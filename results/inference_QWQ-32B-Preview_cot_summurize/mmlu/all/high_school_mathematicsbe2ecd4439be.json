                    "text": "Let's see. I have two numbers that add up to 19 and multiply to 70. I need to figure out which pair is correct among the options given.\n\nFirst, I can check each option to see if the numbers add up to 19 and multiply to 70.\n\nOption A: 5 and 14\n\nAddition: 5 + 14 = 19\n\nMultiplication: 5 * 14 = 70\n\nThat matches both conditions.\n\nOption B: 7 and 10\n\nAddition: 7 + 10 = 17, which is not 19.\n\nSo, this can't be the correct pair.\n\nOption C: 4 and 15\n\nAddition: 4 + 15 = 19\n\nMultiplication: 4 * 15 = 60, which is not 70.\n\nSo, this doesn't match the product condition.\n\nOption D: 3 and 16\n\nAddition: 3 + 16 = 19\n\nMultiplication: 3 * 16 = 48, which is not 70.\n\nSo, this doesn't match the product condition either.\n\nFrom this, it seems like option A is the correct pair because it's the only one that satisfies both conditions.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOption A: 5 + 14 = 19 and 5 * 14 = 70. That's correct.\n\nOption B: 7 + 10 = 17, which is not 19. Incorrect.\n\nOption C: 4 + 15 = 19, but 4 * 15 = 60, not 70. Incorrect.\n\nOption D: 3 + 16 = 19, but 3 * 16 = 48, not 70. Incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 5 and 14.\n\nAlternatively, I could solve this algebraically to confirm.\n\nLet the two numbers be x and y.\n\nGiven:\n\nx + y = 19\n\nx * y = 70\n\nI can express y in terms of x from the first equation:\n\ny = 19 - x\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation:\n\nx*(19 - x) = 70\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n19x - x^2 = 70\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-x^2 + 19x - 70 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:\n\nx^2 - 19x + 70 = 0\n\nNow, I can solve this quadratic equation for x.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(19^2 - 4*1*70)] / 2\n\nCalculate the discriminant:\n\nsqrt(361 - 280) = sqrt(81) = 9\n\nSo, x = [19 \u00b1 9] / 2\n\nWhich gives:\n\nx = (19 + 9)/2 = 28/2 = 14\n\nOr\n\nx = (19 - 9)/2 = 10/2 = 5\n\nSo, the two numbers are 5 and 14, which matches option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 5,14\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A.\\ 5,\\ 14} \\]"
