                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about the photoelectric effect, and it mentions that light of variable frequency shines on a metal surface of a photoelectric tube. We need to pick which statement Einstein\u2019s theory predicts correctly.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect. He proposed that light consists of particles called photons, and each photon has energy proportional to its frequency. The equation for the energy of a photon is E = h\u03bd, where h is Planck's constant and \u03bd is the frequency.\n\nNow, in the photoelectric effect, when light shines on a metal surface, it can eject electrons from the metal. These ejected electrons are called photoelectrons. According to Einstein, the energy of the incoming photon must be enough to overcome the work function of the metal, which is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the metal's surface.\n\nThe work function is a property of the metal itself and doesn't change with the frequency of the incident light. So, options A and B seem incorrect because they suggest that the work function is proportional to frequency or wavelength, which isn't the case.\n\nOption C says that the current in the tube is a linear function of the wavelength. I know that the current in a photoelectric tube is related to the number of photoelectrons emitted per unit time, which depends on the intensity of the light and the frequency. However, I don't think there's a direct linear relationship between current and wavelength. Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency, and the number of emitted electrons depends on the frequency and the intensity. This seems a bit vague, so maybe C isn't the right answer.\n\nOption D states that the potential difference necessary to stop the emitted electrons is a linear function of the frequency above the threshold frequency. This sounds familiar. The stopping potential is the voltage that stops all photoelectrons from reaching the collector plate, essentially measuring the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons.\n\nAccording to Einstein's equation for the photoelectric effect:\n\nKinetic energy of emitted electron = h\u03bd - \u03c6\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the work function.\n\nThe maximum kinetic energy corresponds to the most energetic electrons emitted. So, the stopping potential V_s is related to this maximum kinetic energy by:\n\neV_s = h\u03bd - \u03c6\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\nV_s = (h/e)\u03bd - \u03c6/e\n\nThis equation shows that the stopping potential V_s is linearly dependent on the frequency \u03bd, with a slope of h/e and a y-intercept of -\u03c6/e.\n\nTherefore, above the threshold frequency (which is the frequency at which h\u03bd = \u03c6), the stopping potential is indeed a linear function of the frequency.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct prediction according to Einstein\u2019s theory of the photoelectric effect.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: Work function proportional to frequency. No, the work function is a constant for a given metal.\n\nOption B: Work function proportional to wavelength. Again, no, work function is independent of the incident light's wavelength.\n\nOption C: Current is a linear function of wavelength. Current depends on the number of electrons emitted, which relates to the intensity and the frequency, but not directly linearly with wavelength.\n\nOption D: Stopping potential is a linear function of frequency above the threshold frequency. Yes, as per Einstein's equation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
