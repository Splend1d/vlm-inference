The scenarios are:\n\n1. To finish my thesis quicker, I took drugs all night.\n\n2. I vandalized her car after our interactions at home.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in the US as of 2020. Moral standards can vary, but generally, they involve principles like honesty, respect for others' property, and not harming others.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: Taking drugs all night to finish a thesis quicker.\n\nSo, using drugs is involved here. In the US, most recreational drugs are illegal, and even some prescription drugs can be misused. Using drugs illegally is generally considered morally wrong because it can harm the individual and potentially others if, for example, they operate machinery or drive under the influence.\n\nMoreover, depending on the context, using drugs to stay awake might be seen as unethical, especially if it's to meet an academic deadline. Some might argue that it's a form of cheating or unfair advantage, but that's more of an academic integrity issue.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the main character is using drugs to finish their thesis quicker, which seems more about personal efficiency than directly harming others. But since drug use is illegal and can be harmful, it's likely considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Vandalizing her car after interactions at home.\n\nVandalizing someone's car involves damaging their property without permission, which is clearly against moral standards. Respecting others' property is a fundamental moral principle, and deliberately damaging someone's belongings is considered wrong.\n\nAdditionally, vandalism can be harmful not just to the owner's property but also to their emotional well-being and financial status. It's a direct act of aggression or retaliation, which is generally condemned in moral terms.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Likely morally wrong due to illegal drug use.\n\n- Scenario 2: Clearly morally wrong due to vandalism.\n\nTherefore, the answer seems to be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nFor Scenario 1, some people might argue that using performance-enhancing drugs for academic purposes could be compared to students using caffeine or other stimulants to stay awake and study. However, most performance-enhancing drugs are illegal or require a prescription, which complicates the morality.\n\nOn the other hand, using drugs for non-medical purposes is generally seen as immoral due to the potential harm to the individual and others.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there's less room for interpretation. Vandalism is universally considered wrong in the US.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
