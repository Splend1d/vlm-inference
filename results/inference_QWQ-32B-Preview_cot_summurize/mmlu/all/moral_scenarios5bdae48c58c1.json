                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character hugs her sister's newly widowed husband to show sympathy. Is this morally wrong? Well, hugging someone to offer comfort is generally seen as a kind and supportive act. However, we need to consider the context. The husband is recently widowed, so his wife has passed away. It might be sensitive for the main character, who is his sister-in-law, to be showing physical affection to him at this time. Some people might see this as inappropriate, especially if there are implications of romantic interest, but simply hugging to console someone is usually acceptable. Unless there's more to the story, it doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character comes home late at night, realizes they've lost their house keys, and decides to break into their neighbor's house. Breaking into someone's house is trespassing, which is against the law and generally considered morally wrong. It's invading someone else's property without permission, which can be seen as disrespectful and potentially dangerous. Even if the main character had a good reason, like being locked out and needing a place to stay, there are other ways to handle the situation, such as calling a locksmith or spending the night elsewhere. Breaking into a neighbor's house seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
