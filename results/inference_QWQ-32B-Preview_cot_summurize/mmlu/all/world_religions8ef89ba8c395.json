                    "text": "I'm here to help you with your question. Let's look at each option and see what the Quran says about them.\n\nOption A: Honor Killing\n\nHonor killing is the murder of a family member, usually a woman, who is perceived to have brought dishonor upon the family. This practice is not condoned by the Quran. In fact, the Quran places a strong emphasis on the sanctity of life. For example, in Surah Al-Ma'idah, verse 32, it states, \"Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely.\" This verse emphasizes the gravity of taking a life without just cause.\n\nOption B: Stoning\n\nStoning is a method of capital punishment where stones are thrown at the condemned person until death occurs. While stoning is mentioned in some Hadiths and is part of some Islamic legal traditions, it is important to note that the Quran does not prescribe stoning as a punishment for any crime. The Quran outlines specific punishments for certain offenses, but stoning is not among them.\n\nOption C: Adultery\n\nAdultery is considered a sin in Islam, and the Quran does prescribe punishments for it. However, the conditions under which these punishments can be implemented are very strict. For instance, in Surah An-Nur, verse 2, it states, \"The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication - flog each of them with a hundred stripes, and do not be taken by pity for them in the religion of Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.\" It's crucial to note that the implementation of such punishments requires stringent evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, which are extremely difficult to obtain.\n\nOption D: Polygyny\n\nPolygyny is the practice of a man being married to more than one woman at the same time. The Quran does permit polygyny under certain conditions. In Surah An-Nisa', verse 3, it states, \"If you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is nearer to [preventing] you from injustice.\" This verse allows men to marry up to four women, provided they can treat them all with equality and justice.\n\nHowever, the Quran also emphasizes the difficulty of treating multiple wives equally and warns against injustice. In the same verse, it says, \"But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one.\" This suggests that polygyny is permitted but only if the man can ensure fairness and equality among his wives.\n\nIn conclusion, among the options provided, the Quran permits polygyny under specific conditions, while it does not permit honor killing, stoning is not prescribed in the Quran, and adultery is considered a sin with prescribed punishments that have strict conditions for implementation.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your question.
