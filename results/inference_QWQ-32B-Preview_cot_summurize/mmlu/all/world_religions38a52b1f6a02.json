Guru Nanak, who was born in 1469, is considered the first Guru of Sikhism and the faith's founder. He spread a message of love and understanding, and his teachings emphasize the equality of all humans, the oneness of God, and the importance of leading a righteous life.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh, mentioned in option A, was the tenth Guru of Sikhism and played a crucial role in formalizing many aspects of the religion, including the establishment of the Khalsa in 1699.\n\nGuru Kabir, option C, was a 15th-century saint and poet whose teachings influenced both Sikhism and Hinduism, but he is not considered the founder of Sikhism.\n\nGuru Hargobind, option D, was the sixth Guru of Sikhism and is known for introducing the concept of Miri and Piri, which represent temporal and spiritual authority.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Guru Nanak."
