                    "text": "I need to choose the statement that best describes Gill's response to the argument against the Oregon physician-assisted suicide law. The argument is that the law falsely assumes doctors are qualified to judge whether a life is worth living.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Doctors are as qualified as any other mature adult to decide whether a life is worth living.\n\nThis seems to suggest that there's no special qualification required for making such a judgment; it's on par with what any mature adult can do. But is this Gill's response?\n\nB. Doctors are normally required to make life-and-death decisions, and this is no exception.\n\nThis implies that doctors are already accustomed to making critical decisions about life and death, so assisting in suicide is just another aspect of their professional responsibilities.\n\nC. The argument is self-defeating because it was proposed by medical doctors.\n\nThis suggests that the argument is inconsistent or contradictory, especially since it comes from medical doctors who presumably have a professional stake in such decisions.\n\nD. The law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis, not to judge the worth of life.\n\nThis seems to narrow down the doctor's role to purely medical assessments, avoiding the moral judgment of whether a life is worth living.\n\nI need to think about what Gill's response would be. Gill is likely defending the law against the criticism that doctors are being asked to make judgments beyond their expertise.\n\nOption A seems too vague and doesn't directly address the criticism. Option B might be plausible, but it doesn't directly tackle the issue of judging the worth of life.\n\nOption C is interesting because it questions the validity of the argument itself, especially if it comes from medical doctors. But is Gill likely to make such a meta-level argument?\n\nOption D seems directly addressing the criticism by specifying that the law only requires medical judgments, not moral evaluations.\n\nI think D is the best choice because it clarifies the role of doctors under the law, distinguishing between medical facts and value judgments.\n\nLet me consider again. If the criticism is that the law assumes doctors can judge whether a life is worth living, then Gill might respond by saying that's not what the law is asking them to do. The law is only asking for medical assessments, such as prognosis and life expectancy, which are within the doctors' expertise.\n\nTherefore, Gill's response is likely to be that the law only requires doctors to make medical decisions about the patient's life expectancy and prognosis, not to judge the worth of life.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
