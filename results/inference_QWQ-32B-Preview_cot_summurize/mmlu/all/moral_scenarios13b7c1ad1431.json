                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I fed her baby fingernails and toenails.\n\n2. I demanded a cigarette from the guy outside the store.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I fed her baby fingernails and toenails.\"\n\nThis sounds really bizarre and disturbing. Feeding a baby fingernails and toenails is not something that any caring parent or caregiver would do. Fingernails and toenails are not food; they're made of keratin, which is not suitable for a baby to consume. It could be harmful or at least pose a choking hazard.\n\nMoreover, intentionally feeding something inappropriate and potentially harmful to a baby would likely be considered abusive. In the US, child abuse is a serious moral and legal issue. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I demanded a cigarette from the guy outside the store.\"\n\nDemanding a cigarette from someone seems like an act of aggression or bullying. It's asking for something, perhaps forcefully, without considering the other person's willingness to give it.\n\nIn general, demanding something from someone else can be seen as disrespectful and morally wrong, especially if it involves pressure or threats. However, compared to harming a baby, this seems less severe.\n\nBut is it clearly morally wrong? Well, it depends on the context. If the guy outside the store is a stranger, and the demand is made in a forceful or intimidating way, then it's likely considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's a social situation where such requests are normal, it might not be seen as wrong. But in ordinary circumstances, demanding something from someone could be seen as impolite or even bullying, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is also likely wrong, but perhaps less severely so.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios seem wrong, but Scenario 1 is clearly worse. However, the question is asking for which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong, because both actions are morally wrong, just to different degrees.\n\nBut the way the question is phrased, \"does the main character do something clearly morally wrong,\" it might be expecting to identify one clearly wrong action and one that isn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point is that Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, but Scenario 2 isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nWait, in Scenario 2, demanding a cigarette could be seen as impolite but not necessarily morally wrong. Maybe in some contexts, it's acceptable, like among friends.\n\nBut considering ordinary moral standards, demanding something from someone, especially in a forceful manner, is generally seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, compared to harming a baby, it's less severe.\n\nPerhaps the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong, meaning Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are wrong, so A is the correct answer.\n\nWait, another perspective: maybe Scenario 2 isn't clearly morally wrong because it depends on the context and the manner in which the demand was made.\n\nFor example, if the guy outside the store is a friend, and it's a casual request, then demanding a cigarette might not be morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if it's a stranger and the demand is forceful, then it is wrong.\n\nBut in the absence of specific context, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, Scenario 1 is clearly wrong regardless of context because harming a baby is universally unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBecause Scenario 1 is clearly wrong, and Scenario 2 may or may not be wrong depending on context, but not clearly wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, feeding a baby fingernails and toenails is clearly wrong, while demanding a cigarette is not necessarily clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
