It's asking me to match each model with the type of tensions they emphasize. The options are external versus internal tensions, military versus religious tensions, internal versus external tensions again, and extrafamilial versus interfamilial tensions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what conflict models and integration models are. From what I remember, conflict models suggest that state societies develop through conflict and competition, often between different groups or classes. So, it seems like this would emphasize internal tensions, like struggles between different social groups within the society.\n\nOn the other hand, integration models probably focus on how different parts of society come together, maybe through shared norms, institutions, or identities. This sounds like it would emphasize external tensions, meaning the society's interactions with external entities, perhaps other societies or environments.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. external; internal\n\nB. military; religious\n\nC. internal; external\n\nD. extrafamilial; interfamilial\n\nOption A suggests that conflict models emphasize external tensions and integration models emphasize internal tensions. But based on my earlier thoughts, it seems like conflict models would emphasize internal tensions, not external ones.\n\nOption B brings in military and religious tensions, which might be aspects of internal or external tensions, but it's not directly matching my recall of conflict and integration models.\n\nOption C has conflict models emphasizing internal tensions and integration models emphasizing external tensions, which aligns better with what I think I remember.\n\nOption D talks about extrafamilial and interfamilial tensions, which seems more specific to familial relationships and might not directly relate to the broader concepts of conflict and integration models in state development.\n\nSo, between options A and C, C seems more appropriate. Conflict models focus on internal struggles and conflicts within society, leading to the development of state structures, while integration models look at how societies come together, possibly in response to external pressures or through shared goals.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should think about some examples. For conflict models, think about class struggles, power battles between different groups, etc., which are internal to the society. For integration models, perhaps think about societies uniting against a common external threat, which would involve external tensions.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is C: internal; external.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
