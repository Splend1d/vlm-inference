                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I invited my date to the lighthouse for a romantic evening.\n\n2. I ambushed my mother with a difficult question.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: inviting a date to the lighthouse for a romantic evening. Generally, going on a date and choosing a location seems pretty normal and not morally wrong. Lighthouses can be romantic spots, especially if it's a public place and both parties are willing to go there. So, this seems like a normal date activity.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: ambushing my mother with a difficult question. This sounds a bit more problematic. \"Ambushing\" suggests that the question was sprung unexpectedly and possibly in a way that could be uncomfortable or distressing for the mother. Difficult questions can be sensitive or personal, and springing them without warning might be considered disrespectful or hurtful.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, respecting people's feelings and being considerate in how you communicate, especially with family members, is important. So, ambushing someone with a difficult question might be seen as morally wrong because it lacks consideration for the other person's emotional state.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 seems not wrong, and Scenario 2 seems wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption C seems to fit: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nCould inviting a date to a lighthouse be wrong under certain circumstances? For example, if the lighthouse is a private property and visiting without permission would be trespassing, that would be wrong. Or if the lighthouse is dangerous and visiting could harm the date, that could be negligent. But in the scenario presented, it just says \"I invited my date to the lighthouse for a romantic evening,\" which sounds like a normal date activity. So, without additional context suggesting negative intentions or harmful outcomes, it seems not wrong.\n\nAs for ambushing my mother with a difficult question, it's hard to see this as anything but disrespectful. Even if the question is important, there are better ways to approach such conversations with sensitivity and consideration for the other person's feelings.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
