                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to understand how anthropology differs from other social sciences like economics and sociology. I have these options:\n\nA. Anthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach.\n\nB. Anthropology is less holistic and more theoretical in its approach.\n\nC. Anthropology tends to focus on specific topics in history.\n\nD. Anthropology is more narrowly focused than the other social sciences.\n\nHmm, I need to think about what makes anthropology unique compared to economics and sociology.\n\nFirst, what is anthropology? I know it's the study of humans, their culture, societies, and biology. It seems really broad.\n\nEconomics, on the other hand, is about how societies allocate resources and deal with scarcity. It's more focused on systems of production, distribution, and consumption.\n\nSociology is the study of society and social behavior, looking at groups, institutions, and social interactions.\n\nSo, compared to these, anthropology seems more all-encompassing. It looks at not just social structures or economic systems, but also culture, biology, and history.\n\nI recall that anthropology is divided into four main fields: cultural anthropology, biological anthropology, archaeological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology. That's pretty broad.\n\nOption A says anthropology is holistic and integrative. Holistic means considering everything as interconnected, and integrative means bringing different parts together. That sounds a lot like what I just thought about anthropology.\n\nOption B says it's less holistic and more theoretical. But if anthropology is so broad, covering culture, biology, archaeology, and language, that seems more holistic, not less.\n\nOption C says it tends to focus on specific topics in history. While anthropology does look at history, especially archaeological anthropology, it's not limited to history. It also looks at contemporary cultures and biological aspects.\n\nOption D says it's more narrowly focused than other social sciences. But from what I know, it seems more broad than economics or sociology.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think again.\n\nEconomics focuses on economic systems and behaviors.\n\nSociology focuses on social structures and interactions.\n\nAnthropology looks at all of that plus culture, biology, and language.\n\nSo, anthropology seems to encompass more areas.\n\nHolistic means considering the whole picture, including all these different aspects.\n\nIntegrative means bringing together different disciplines to understand human beings.\n\nThat makes sense. Anthropology integrates insights from biology, culture, history, and language to understand humans.\n\nIn contrast, economics and sociology, while they can be interdisciplinary, have more specific foci.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B is probably wrong because anthropology is more holistic, not less.\n\nOption C is partially true because archaeological anthropology does focus on history, but anthropology as a whole is broader than just history.\n\nOption D is contrary to what I'm thinking because anthropology seems more comprehensive, not narrower.\n\nLet me check if there's any other perspective.\n\nMaybe in some ways, anthropology is more theoretical, but I don't think that's accurate. Anthropology is both theoretical and empirical, like other social sciences.\n\nPerhaps option B is trying to say that anthropology is more practical or applied, but I don't think that's the case.\n\nNo, I think option A is the best answer.\n\nAnthropology is holistic and integrative in its approach, considering multiple dimensions of human experience and integrating knowledge from various disciplines.\n\nSo, I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
