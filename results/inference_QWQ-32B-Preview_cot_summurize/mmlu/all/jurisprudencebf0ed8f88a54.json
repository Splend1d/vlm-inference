                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Austin's view on jurisprudence. So, Austin is a philosopher, right? I think he's associated with legal positivism. Let me see what that means.\n\nLegal positivism, as I understand it, is a theory that separates law and morality. It says that law is one thing and morality is another, and they shouldn't be mixed up in legal analysis. So, if Austin is a proponent of legal positivism, then his science of jurisprudence would probably be concerned with positive law, which is man-made law, as opposed to natural law or divine law.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Morality\n\nB. Positive law\n\nC. Divine law\n\nD. Natural law\n\nIf legal positivism separates law from morality, then option A probably isn't right. Divine law is about religious teachings, and natural law is based on ethics and morality derived from human nature. So, if Austin is focusing on positive law, which is the law made by humans, that would make sense.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check. Maybe Austin had a different view. Let me recall some of his key ideas. Austin is known for his command theory of law, where he defines law as commands from the sovereign backed by sanctions. This sounds like he's focusing on the authoritative rules made by a governing body, which again points to positive law.\n\nAlso, in his work, \"The Province of Jurisprudence Determined,\" Austin tries to define the scope of jurisprudence. He argues that jurisprudence should study positive law, which is the law that is actually in force, regardless of whether it's morally good or bad.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is B. Positive law.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options quickly.\n\nOption A, morality: Since legal positivism separates law and morality, it's unlikely that Austin would consider morality as the central concern of jurisprudence.\n\nOption C, divine law: This is more related to religious legal systems, which Austin's positivism doesn't align with. He was focusing on human-made laws.\n\nOption D, natural law: Natural law theory posits that law should be based on moral principles, which again contrasts with Austin's positivist approach.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B. Positive law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
