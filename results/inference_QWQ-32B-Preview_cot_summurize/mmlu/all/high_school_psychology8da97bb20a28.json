It's asking what this split in opinion demonstrates. The options are external locus of control, internal validity, self-representation, and attitudinal coherence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nExternal locus of control refers to the belief that events in one's life are determined by external factors beyond one's personal control, like fate or other people. So, if someone has an external locus of control, they might believe that their job performance is determined by their boss's mood or the economy, not by their own efforts.\n\nInternal validity is a concept in research design that refers to the degree to which a study establishes a causal relationship between variables. It's about whether the results can be attributed to the manipulation of the independent variable or if there are other confounding factors.\n\nSelf-representation is about how individuals present themselves to others, perhaps in social situations or in their professional lives. It could involve managing one's image or reputation.\n\nAttitudinal coherence, on the other hand, refers to the consistency or harmony among an individual's attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. When someone's attitudes are coherent, their beliefs and actions align nicely without much contradiction.\n\nNow, considering the scenario with President Clinton, Americans were supporting his policies but not his personal life. This suggests that their attitudes towards his professional actions and his personal behaviors were separate. They could compartmentalize these aspects and hold different opinions about them.\n\nThis seems to indicate a lack of attitudinal coherence because their support for his policies isn't necessarily aligned with their disapproval of his personal life. They are able to hold these conflicting attitudes without cognitive dissonance.\n\nExternal locus of control doesn't seem directly relevant here, as it's about beliefs in control over events, not about attitudes towards a politician's personal and professional life.\n\nInternal validity is a research concept and doesn't fit the context of individual attitudes towards a president.\n\nSelf-representation might be related, as it involves how Clinton presents himself, but the question is more about the public's attitudes towards him rather than his own presentation.\n\nTherefore, the most fitting answer seems to be D. attitudinal coherence. The split in opinion demonstrates a lack of coherence between their attitudes towards Clinton's personal life and his professional policies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
