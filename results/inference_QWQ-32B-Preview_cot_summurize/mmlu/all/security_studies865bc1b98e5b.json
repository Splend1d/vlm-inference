                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about the role of information in economic decision making. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that information isn't important in economic theory; it's the actor's perceptions that inform their decision-making process. Hmm, in economics, especially in theories like rational choice theory, decision-makers are assumed to make choices based on their preferences and the information they have. So, while perceptions are important, they are based on the information available to them. So, information is crucial because it shapes those perceptions.\n\nOption B claims that information isn't significant in economic decision making, and instead, external forces coerce actors more than their rational choices do. This seems contrary to mainstream economic thought, which emphasizes individual rational decision making. Of course, there are external forces like market prices, but the idea is that individuals make choices based on their rational assessments of those forces, which require information.\n\nOption C states that information plays a significant role because, even though actors aim to act in their best interest, their rational actions depend on the information available at the time. This aligns well with the concept of bounded rationality, where decision-makers have limited information and cognitive constraints. So, information is key because it affects the quality of their decisions.\n\nOption D says that information has become an important resource in the 21st century and can be bought and sold like any other commodity. This is true in the sense that data and information are valuable assets in today's economy, and there are industries built around collecting, analyzing, and selling information. However, the question is about the role of information in the economic science of decision making, not about information as a commodity.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to capture the essence of how information influences economic decision making. It acknowledges that while actors strive to make rational choices, the actual decisions they make are dependent on the information they have at hand. This resonates with many economic theories, including those that account for uncertainty and imperfect information.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Information plays a significant role in decision making because rational action depends on the information available to actors at the time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
