The options are:\n\nA. illusions\n\nB. physical objects\n\nC. only things existing apart from our minds\n\nD. only sensations existing in our minds\n\nI remember that George Berkeley was an Irish philosopher who lived in the 18th century. He's famous for his empiricist views and his doctrine of immaterialism, which argues that only minds and their ideas exist. Essentially, he believed that physical objects don't have an existence independent of being perceived.\n\nSo, applying that to heat and cold, I think Berkeley would say that these are not physical objects themselves but rather sensations that we experience. According to his philosophy, things only exist as long as they are being perceived. For example, when you touch a hot stove, you feel heat because your mind is perceiving that sensation at that moment.\n\nOption A says \"illusions.\" I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Berkeley might say that sensations like heat and cold are real experiences, but they don't correspond to anything physical outside of our minds. So, perhaps \"illusions\" isn't the best fit.\n\nOption B is \"physical objects.\" That can't be right because Berkeley doesn't believe in the existence of physical objects independent of perception.\n\nOption C says \"only things existing apart from our minds.\" Again, that contradicts Berkeley's immaterialism, which holds that nothing exists outside of the mind.\n\nOption D is \"only sensations existing in our minds.\" This seems to align with Berkeley's ideas. He would likely argue that heat and cold are not properties of external objects but are sensations that occur within our own minds when we interact with those objects.\n\nLet me think about this a bit more. If Berkeley is an immaterialist, he doesn't accept the existence of matter as something separate from mind. Therefore, things like heat and cold must be understood in terms of mental experiences rather than properties of physical objects.\n\nIn his work \"Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous,\" Berkeley discusses secondary qualities like color, sound, taste, and temperature. He argues that these are not properties of external objects but are sensations produced in the mind upon perceiving those objects.\n\nSo, for Berkeley, heat and cold are not illusions but real sensations that exist in the mind. They are not physical objects, nor do they exist independently of the mind.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D: only sensations existing in our minds.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider what the other options imply.\n\nIf heat and cold are illusions (option A), that would suggest they don't really exist at all, which isn't quite Berkeley's view. He would say they exist as sensations in the mind.\n\nIf they are physical objects (option B), that would contradict his immaterialism.\n\nIf they exist apart from our minds (option C), that also goes against his philosophy.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the most consistent with Berkeley's ideas.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
