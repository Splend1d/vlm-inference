Let me read the options again to make sure I understand them all.\n\nOption A says that historical materialism is opposed to the goals of the global justice movement, which advocates expanding neoliberalism after the global financial crisis. Hmm, that seems off. I thought the global justice movement was critical of neoliberalism, not in favor of expanding it. Maybe I need to double-check what neoliberalism is. Neoliberalism is an economic theory that advocates for free markets, privatization, and reduced government intervention. The global justice movement, as I understand it, often critiques these policies for exacerbating inequality and harming vulnerable populations.\n\nOption B says that historical materialism has a history of supporting global justice and opposing inequality, and during the Cold War, it was the basis of opposition to repressive communist states. This seems more accurate. Historical materialism is associated with Marxism, which critiques capitalism for creating inequalities and exploits workers. So, it makes sense that it would support movements for global justice and oppose inequality. Also, during the Cold War, Marxist states were often opposed to repressive communist regimes that didn't align with their ideals.\n\nOption C claims that historical materialism doesn't provide a unique perspective on capitalism and is more concerned with the history of capitalist trade than with exploitation or alienation. I don't think that's correct. Historical materialism is all about analyzing how economic structures shape society and how class relations lead to exploitation and alienation. So, it does focus on exploitation and alienation within the capitalist system.\n\nOption D says that historical materialism can concern both human rights and economic rights and has been an important part of anti-globalization and alternative-globalization movements, including the Occupy protests. This seems consistent with what I know. Marxist theory often emphasizes economic rights and can be connected to broader human rights issues. The Occupy movement, for example, focused on economic inequality and was part of the broader global justice movement.\n\nGiven these options, it seems like option D is the most accurate. Historical materialism does concern itself with both human rights and economic rights and has been influential in movements like Occupy, which are part of the global justice movement.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A is likely incorrect because the global justice movement generally opposes neoliberal policies, not advocates for their expansion. Historical materialism would likely align with criticizing neoliberalism rather than supporting it.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that historical materialism does support global justice and oppose inequality, but the second part about opposing repressive communist states during the Cold War might not fully capture the relationship between historical materialism and the global justice movement. While it's true that Marxist movements opposed repressive regimes, the connection to the global justice movement might be more direct in terms of contemporary issues like economic inequality and globalization.\n\nOption C is incorrect because historical materialism does provide a unique perspective on capitalism, focusing on class struggle, exploitation, and alienation, which are central to understanding its critique of the system.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the best answer. Historical materialism addresses both human and economic rights and has been integral to movements like Occupy, which are part of the global justice movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
