                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about how the Federal Reserve's actions can affect the money supply. So, the Fed increases bank reserves, and we're supposed to figure out which scenario would diminish the potential amount of money created as a result. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"the public prefers to hold less cash.\" Hmm, if people prefer to hold less cash, that might mean they're keeping more money in their bank accounts, which could potentially allow banks to make more loans since they have more deposits. But actually, if people hold less cash, that might increase the money multiplier because less money is leaking out of the banking system in the form of cash holdings. So, this seems like it would increase the potential money supply, not diminish it. Therefore, A doesn't seem to be the right answer.\n\nOption B: \"the velocity of money falls.\" Velocity of money is how quickly money circulates in the economy. If it falls, that means people are spending money less frequently, which could slow down economic activity. But how does this affect the money supply created by the Fed's action? Well, the money supply and the velocity of money are related through the equation of exchange, but a fall in velocity doesn't directly affect the potential money creation from reserve increases. It might influence how much the economy needs money, but not directly how much money is created. So, B doesn't seem directly relevant here.\n\nOption C: \"depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves.\" This seems promising. When banks hold more excess reserves, they have less money available to lend out. The money multiplier effect depends on how much banks lend out, which in turn creates more money through the fractional reserve banking system. If banks are holding more excess reserves, they're lending out less, which means less money is being created through the multiplication process. So, this could definitely diminish the potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves.\n\nOption D: \"the marginal propensity to consume falls.\" The marginal propensity to consume is the fraction of additional income that people spend on consumption. If it falls, people are saving more of their additional income. This could mean that when banks make loans, and that money gets deposited and loaned out again, each cycle might have less money being spent and more being saved, which could reduce the overall money creation process. So, this could also diminish the potential money supply.\n\nBetween C and D, both seem plausible, but I think C is more directly related to the banking system's ability to create money. If banks are holding more excess reserves, they simply have less money to lend out, which directly reduces the potential for money creation. The marginal propensity to consume affects how much money circulates and is saved, but the direct impact on money creation from reserve increases might be more straightforwardly linked to bank lending behavior.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
