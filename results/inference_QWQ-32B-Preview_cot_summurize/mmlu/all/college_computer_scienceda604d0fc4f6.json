                    "text": "So Bob has picked a number between 1 and 1,000, and Mary can ask yes or no questions to figure out what that number is. Bob always tells the truth, which is helpful. Mary wants to use the best strategy to find the number in the fewest questions possible, especially in the worst-case scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what an optimal strategy would be for Mary. Since she's dealing with a range of numbers and can ask yes or no questions, the best approach seems like a binary search. Binary search is efficient because it halves the possible range with each question, which should minimize the number of questions needed.\n\nLet me recall how binary search works. You start by asking about the middle value of the range. If the target number is higher, you adjust the lower bound to just above the middle; if it's lower, you adjust the upper bound to just below the middle. You repeat this process, always dividing the remaining range in half, until you find the target.\n\nIn this case, the range is from 1 to 1,000. So, the first question Mary could ask is: \"Is the number greater than 500?\" Depending on Bob's answer, she can eliminate half of the possibilities.\n\nIf Bob says \"yes,\" then the number is between 501 and 1,000. If \"no,\" it's between 1 and 500.\n\nThen, Mary repeats the process with the new range. For example, if the number is in 501-1,000, she might ask, \"Is the number greater than 750?\" and so on.\n\nEach question halves the number of possible choices, which should lead to finding the number quickly.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how many questions are required in the worst case to identify the number.\n\nThe worst case would be when the number is such that Mary has to keep dividing the range until she's left with only one possibility.\n\nSo, starting with 1,000 possibilities, each question should halve that number.\n\nLet me calculate how many times I need to divide 1,000 by 2 until I get to 1.\n\nThis is essentially finding the logarithm base 2 of 1,000.\n\nSo, log2(1,000) \u2248 9.965.\n\nSince Mary can't ask a fraction of a question, she needs to round up to the next whole number.\n\nTherefore, she needs 10 questions in the worst case.\n\nWait, but let's verify that.\n\n2^10 = 1,024, which is greater than 1,000.\n\nSo, with 10 questions, Mary can distinguish between up to 1,024 possibilities.\n\nSince 1,000 is less than 1,024, 10 questions should be sufficient.\n\nBut is there a chance it might take more?\n\nLet me think about it differently.\n\nSuppose Mary asks 9 questions.\n\n2^9 = 512.\n\nBut 512 is less than 1,000, so with 9 questions, she can only distinguish between 512 possibilities.\n\nThat means, in some cases, she won't have narrowed it down enough to identify the number uniquely.\n\nTherefore, 9 questions are not enough in the worst case.\n\nWith 10 questions, she can distinguish between up to 1,024 possibilities, which covers the 1,000 numbers.\n\nTherefore, 10 questions should be sufficient in all cases.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient way?\n\nIs binary search the optimal strategy here?\n\nI think it is, because it minimizes the number of questions by maximizing the information gained from each question.\n\nEach yes or no question can only halve the possibilities, so binary search is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Mary could ask questions that divide the range into more than two parts, but with yes or no questions, it's not clear how that would be better.\n\nIn fact, any yes or no question can only provide one bit of information, so binary search is optimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 10 questions.\n\nBut let's cross-verify this.\n\nSuppose Mary asks 10 questions.\n\nEach question halves the possibilities.\n\nStarting with 1,000:\n\n1st question: 1,000 / 2 = 500\n\n2nd: 500 / 2 = 250\n\n3rd: 250 / 2 = 125\n\n4th: 125 / 2 \u2248 62.5\n\n5th: 62.5 / 2 \u2248 31.25\n\n6th: 31.25 / 2 \u2248 15.625\n\n7th: 15.625 / 2 \u2248 7.8125\n\n8th: 7.8125 / 2 \u2248 3.90625\n\n9th: 3.90625 / 2 \u2248 1.953125\n\n10th: 1.953125 / 2 \u2248 0.9765625\n\nSo, after 10 questions, the range should be less than 1, meaning the number is identified.\n\nTherefore, 10 questions are sufficient.\n\nIf she asks only 9 questions:\n\nAfter 9 questions, the range would be approximately 2 numbers.\n\nSo, she might not be able to identify the number uniquely in some cases.\n\nTherefore, 10 is the minimum number of questions required in the worst case.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,000\n\nB. 999\n\nC. 500\n\nD. 10\n\nOption D, 10, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, is there a chance that it could be less than 10?\n\nLet me check 2^10 = 1,024, which is greater than 1,000.\n\nSo, 10 questions can handle up to 1,024 possibilities.\n\nBut maybe sometimes 9 questions are enough.\n\nHowever, in the worst case, she might need that 10th question.\n\nSo, in the worst case, she will need exactly 10 questions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10} \\]"
