They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nWhen the author of the passage above discusses the \"second wall,\" to what is he referring?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this passage from Martin Luther's \"Address to the Nobility of the German Nation\" from 1520. It's pretty dense, but I need to figure out what he's talking about when he mentions the \"second wall.\" The options are about different theological topics, like the Holy Ghost, Scripture interpretation, the divinity of Jesus, and baptism. I need to see which one matches what Luther is discussing in that part.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the \"three walls\" are that Luther is referring to. He says the Romanists (which I think means the Catholic Church) have three protective walls. The first one is about the temporal and spiritual powers, the second is about interpreting Scriptures, and the third is about calling a council.\n\nSo, the second wall is about Scripture interpretation. He says that the Catholics claim that only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures, even though they themselves don't learn much from them throughout their lives. He calls this a \"more tottering and weak\" wall, suggesting that this claim isn't very solid.\n\nHe goes on to criticize this idea, saying that if the Holy Spirit always guides the Pope, whether he's learned or wicked, then there's no need for Scriptures at all. He suggests burning the Scriptures and just relying on the Pope, which is obviously sarcasm, because he doesn't actually want that.\n\nSo, the second wall is about the authority to interpret Scriptures. Luther is arguing against the Catholic Church's claim that only the Pope can correctly interpret the Bible. Instead, he's probably\u4e3b\u5f20 that Scriptures should be accessible to and interpretable by all Christians, which aligns with the Protestant idea of \"sola scriptura,\" or Scripture alone as the authority in matters of faith.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The differing views on the definition of \"Holy Ghost.\" Well, Luther does mention the Holy Ghost, but in the context of the Pope's infallibility, not specifically about defining who or what the Holy Ghost is. So, maybe not the primary focus here.\n\nB. The differing views on the use and interpretation of biblical texts. This seems directly related to what he's discussing in the second wall.\n\nC. Theological beliefs about the divinity of Jesus. There's no mention of Jesus's divinity in this excerpt.\n\nD. The method of baptism. Again, no mention of baptism here.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the most fitting. Luther is talking about how the Catholic Church claims exclusive rights to interpret Scriptures, whereas he believes in a more widespread understanding and interpretation of the Bible by Christians.\n\nTo confirm, I should look at the context. He mentions that if the Holy Spirit always guides the Pope, there would be no need for Scriptures, which implies that the authority of Scriptures is being diminished by this claim of papal infallibility in interpretation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: The differing views of Catholics and Reformers on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
