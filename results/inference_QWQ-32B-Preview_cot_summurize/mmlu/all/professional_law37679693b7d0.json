                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we have a waitress who sued her former employer, a restaurant, under Title VII in federal court. She alleged sexual harassment and wrongful termination. The jury awarded her $100,000, and the court entered judgment accordingly. Then, two weeks later, the employer filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing that it didn't have at least 15 employees, which is required for an \"employer\" under Title VII. The lower court agreed and dismissed the case, voiding the judgment. Now, the case is on appeal, and we need to figure out which option the appellate court is likely to choose.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key issues here. Title VII applies to employers with 15 or more employees. If the employer doesn't meet this threshold, then it's not covered by Title VII, and thus, there's no federal subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. The employer is challenging the court's jurisdiction based on this requirement.\n\nOption A says yes, the appellate court will likely uphold the lower court's decision because challenges to jurisdiction can be made at any time, even after judgment, and here the jurisdictional requirement was missing.\n\nOption B also says yes, but for a different reason: that appellate courts have no authority to reverse a lower court's finding that there was no subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nOption C says no, because a judgment entered on a jury verdict can never be changed or attacked after judgment is entered.\n\nOption D says no, because this is a challenge to the existence of a cause of action, i.e., the failure to state a claim, which doesn't go to jurisdiction and cannot be raised post-judgment.\n\nLet's analyze these one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: It's true that challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, even after the judgment has been entered. Jurisdiction is a threshold issue, and courts must ensure they have the power to hear a case before proceeding. So, if it turns out that the court didn't have jurisdiction, the judgment is considered void ab initio, meaning it was never valid to begin with.\n\nIn this case, the employer is arguing that the court never had jurisdiction because the restaurant didn't have the required number of employees to be considered an \"employer\" under Title VII. If this is accurate, then the lower court was correct to dismiss the case and void the judgment.\n\nHowever, we need to consider whether a 12(b)(6) motion is the appropriate vehicle for this challenge. Rule 12(b)(6) is for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In other words, it's about whether the plaintiff's complaint is legally sufficient.\n\nBut the employer is challenging jurisdiction, which is a separate issue. Jurisdiction pertains to the court's power to hear the case, whereas a 12(b)(6) motion goes to the merits of the claim. So, is the employer using the right rule here?\n\nActually, challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction are typically raised under Rule 12(b)(1). Rule 12(b)(6) is more about the adequacy of the claim itself. Here, the employer is questioning whether the court had the power to hear the case in the first place because the employer doesn't meet the employee threshold required by Title VII.\n\nSo, perhaps the employer should have filed under Rule 12(b)(1) instead of 12(b)(6). But does that mean the lower court was wrong to consider the jurisdictional argument?\n\nNot necessarily. Courts have the obligation to consider jurisdictional issues on their own motion, even if the parties don't raise them. So, even if the employer used the wrong rule, the court can still address the jurisdictional issue.\n\nNow, Option B says that appellate courts have no authority to reverse a lower court's finding that there was no subject-matter jurisdiction. This seems incorrect. Appellate courts do have the authority to review and reverse lower courts' decisions, including those related to jurisdiction. In fact, appellate courts regularly review jurisdictional rulings.\n\nSo, Option B is likely incorrect.\n\nOption C states that a judgment entered on a jury verdict can never be changed or attacked after judgment is entered. This is not accurate. Judgments can be appealed, and if there are errors in the trial court's proceedings, appellate courts can reverse or remand the case. Additionally, as we've discussed, if there's no jurisdiction, the judgment is void ab initio and can be challenged at any time.\n\nTherefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D says no, because this is a challenge to the existence of a cause of action, i.e., the failure to state a claim, which doesn't go to jurisdiction and cannot be raised post-judgment. But as we've seen, the employer is actually challenging jurisdiction, not just the cause of action. The number of employees determines whether the restaurant is an \"employer\" under Title VII, which goes to the court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\nSo, Option D seems mistaken in characterizing this as a mere failure to state a claim.\n\nGiven this analysis, Option A appears to be the most accurate. The appellate court is likely to uphold the lower court's decision because challenges to jurisdiction can be made at any time, and if the jurisdictional requirement was not met, the judgment is void.\n\nHowever, there is a complicating factor here. The employer filed a 12(b)(6) motion two weeks after the judgment was entered. Typically, motions under Rule 12(b) are filed before the trial, not after judgment. Once a case has been tried and judgment entered, it's usually too late to raise a 12(b) motion.\n\nBut again, because jurisdiction is at issue, the court can consider it at any stage. So, despite the procedural irregularity, the lower court was justified in addressing the jurisdictional question.\n\nIn conclusion, the appellate court is likely to uphold the lower court's decision, making Option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
