                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two computers backing up data at different intervals, and I need to find out how many times they back up at the same time in a 24-hour period. The first computer backs up every five minutes, and the second one every two minutes. The problem also says that they don't back up at the start of the 24-hour period, but I think that just means we don't count time zero.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for them to back up at the same time. Since both computers back up at the turn of the minute, I guess they coincide whenever their backup intervals overlap.\n\nSo, computer A backs up at minutes like 0, 5, 10, 15, and so on, every 5 minutes. Computer B backs up at minutes like 0, 2, 4, 6, and so on, every 2 minutes.\n\nBut since the problem says \"at the turn of the minute,\" I think they start backing up at minute 0, but because they don't back up at the start, maybe we should consider their backup times starting from the first minute they back up after time zero.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"Assume that the computers do not back up at the start of the 24-hour period.\" So, at time t=0, neither computer backs up. So, computer A backs up at t=5,10,15,... and computer B backs up at t=2,4,6,8,...\n\nSo, I need to find the number of times in 24 hours (which is 1440 minutes) that both computers back up at the same minute.\n\nSo, essentially, find the number of minutes t in [1,1440] where t is a multiple of both 2 and 5.\n\nWell, the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 5 is 10. So, they both back up every 10 minutes.\n\nNow, how many multiples of 10 are there in 1440 minutes?\n\nWell, 1440 divided by 10 is 144.\n\nSo, there are 144 times that both computers back up at the same time in 24 hours.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that they don't back up at the start of the 24-hour period. Does that mean we should exclude t=0?\n\nWell, since t=0 is not included, and the first common backup time is at t=10 minutes, then up to t=1440 minutes, the number of common backup times should be 144.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nTotal time in minutes in 24 hours: 24*60 = 1440 minutes.\n\nNumber of common backup times: 1440 / 10 = 144.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, 144 is option A.\n\nBut the other options are 12, 6, and 36.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPerhaps the problem is considering only the times when both backup intervals coincide within the 24-hour period, excluding the start time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the computers don't back up at the start, so t=0 is excluded.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I started from t=10 minutes, which is the first common multiple of 2 and 5 after t=0.\n\nSo, from t=10 to t=1440, the number of multiples of 10 is indeed 144.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the times when both backup intervals coincide, and perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 5, but no, for finding common backup times, it's the LCM.\n\nWait, the LCM of 2 and 5 is 10, which is correct.\n\nSo, every 10 minutes, both back up.\n\nIn 1440 minutes, the number of times this happens is 1440 / 10 = 144.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 144.\n\nBut perhaps there's a trick here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering that the computers don't back up at the start, so t=0 is excluded, but in my calculation, I already excluded t=0 by starting from t=10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the computers don't back up at the same time at all, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an overlap in the backup times that I'm not considering.\n\nWait, no, since they back up at the turn of the minute, meaning exactly at the minute mark, so if both back up at exactly t=10 minutes, then they back up at the same time.\n\nSo, yes, every 10 minutes, they back up together.\n\nIn 1440 minutes, that happens 144 times.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 144.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is considering only distinct times, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the backups are cyclical every 10 minutes, and in 24 hours, there are 144 such cycles.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 144, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{144} \\]"
