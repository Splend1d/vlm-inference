So, the correct answer is A. inside the nucleus.\n\nTo understand this better, let's recall some basic atomic structure. An atom consists of a nucleus and electrons orbiting around it. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which are collectively called nucleons. Protons have a positive electric charge, neutrons have no electric charge (they are neutral), and electrons have a negative electric charge.\n\nThe number of protons in the nucleus determines the atomic number of the element, which identifies the element itself. The number of neutrons can vary, giving rise to different isotopes of the same element.\n\nSo, to summarize, neutrons are found inside the nucleus of an atom.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
