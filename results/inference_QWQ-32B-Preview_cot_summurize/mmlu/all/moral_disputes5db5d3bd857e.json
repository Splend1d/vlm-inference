                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Carruthers' view on our duties to animals. The options are:\n\nA. direct and basic.\n\nB. indirect and derivative.\n\nC. nonexistent.\n\nD. perfect (rather than imperfect).\n\nI need to remember what Carruthers says about this. I think Peter Carruthers is a philosopher who has written about animal ethics. From what I recall, he argues that animals don't have moral status in the same way that humans do.\n\nLet me think about this. If our duties to animals are \"direct and basic,\" that would mean we have immediate moral obligations to treat animals a certain way, regardless of other considerations. But Carruthers might not agree with that.\n\nOption B says \"indirect and derivative.\" That suggests that our duties to animals come from other moral considerations, perhaps related to how treating animals a certain way affects humans or the environment.\n\nOption C says \"nonexistent.\" That would mean Carruthers thinks we have no moral duties to animals at all, which seems extreme, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D mentions \"perfect\" versus \"imperfect\" duties. I think in Kantian ethics, perfect duties are absolute obligations that must be followed, while imperfect duties are more discretionary. So if our duties to animals are perfect, that would mean they are strict obligations.\n\nI need to recall Carruthers' specific position. I believe he argues that animals don't have the same kind of moral status as humans because they lack certain cognitive abilities, like self-awareness or the capacity for moral reasoning.\n\nIf that's the case, then he might hold that our duties to animals are not direct or basic, but perhaps indirect\u2014meaning that we have duties regarding animals because of how they affect human interests or the ecosystem.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should look up Carruthers' views on animal ethics to get a better understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he thinks that our duties to animals are nonexistent, meaning that animals aren't moral considerands at all.\n\nBut that doesn't sound right. Most philosophers, even those who don't assign strong moral status to animals, still think we have some duties towards them, like preventing unnecessary suffering.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he thinks that our duties are imperfect, meaning that we have some moral latitude in how we treat animals.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit unsure here. Maybe I should consider the context in which this question is asked. Is this from a specific text or lecture?\n\nAssuming that Carruthers holds a position where animals have some moral consideration but not to the same extent as humans, perhaps his view is that our duties to animals are indirect and derivative.\n\nThat is, our duties towards animals are based on how our treatment of them affects human well-being or other moral values.\n\nAlternatively, if he thinks that animals have no moral status and therefore no direct moral claims on us, then perhaps option C, nonexistent, would be his position.\n\nBut I recall that Carruthers argues that animals don't have the same kind of consciousness as humans, and therefore don't have interests in the same way.\n\nIf that's the case, then he might hold that we have no direct moral duties to animals, which could align with option B, indirect and derivative duties.\n\nWait, but indirect duties would still involve considering animals in our moral calculus, just not as direct recipients of moral consideration.\n\nAlternatively, if he thinks that animals don't deserve any moral consideration at all, then perhaps option C, nonexistent duties, would be more accurate.\n\nI need to think carefully here.\n\nAnother angle: if our duties to animals are \"perfect,\" that would suggest that there are strict obligations that must be followed without exception.\n\nGiven that Carruthers might not accept that animals have rights or moral status in a way that generates such strict obligations, perhaps option D isn't the best fit.\n\nSo, between options B and C, which one better represents Carruthers' view?\n\nIf he thinks that animals don't have consciousness or don't have interests that can be harmed, then he might hold that we have no direct duties to them, and any duties we have regarding animals are indirect\u2014perhaps related to environmental concerns or the impact on human morality.\n\nAlternatively, if he thinks that animals don't deserve any moral consideration at all, then our duties to them are nonexistent.\n\nI'm still not entirely sure.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the definitions of these terms more carefully.\n\n\"Direct and basic duties\" would mean that animals are direct objects of moral concern, and we have obligations towards them inherently.\n\n\"Indirect and derivative duties\" suggest that our obligations regarding animals arise from other moral considerations, not from the animals themselves.\n\n\"Nonexistent duties\" would mean that animals are not moral considerands at all.\n\n\"Perfect duties\" are strict obligations that must be followed, as opposed to imperfect duties, which allow more flexibility.\n\nGiven that Carruthers is known for his views on animal consciousness and moral status, I believe he argues that animals lack certain cognitive abilities necessary for moral consideration.\n\nTherefore, he might hold that our duties to animals are either indirect or nonexistent.\n\nBetween B and C, I think he would lean towards B, that our duties are indirect and derivative, based on other moral considerations rather than direct obligations to the animals themselves.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. indirect and derivative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
