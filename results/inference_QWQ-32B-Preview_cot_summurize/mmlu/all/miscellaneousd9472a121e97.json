It was between Billie Jean King, one of the top female tennis players at the time, and Bobby Riggs, a former world No. 1 men's tennis player who was then 55 years old.\n\nBobby Riggs had retired from professional tennis in 1946 but remained involved in the sport as a commentator and promoter. In 1973, he challenged Billie Jean King to a match, claiming that even in his older age, he could beat any woman tennis player, including the top-ranked females of the time.\n\nThe match was seen as a symbolic battle between the sexes and generated enormous media attention, with millions of people around the world watching it on television. Billie Jean King won the match in straight sets, defeating Bobby Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.\n\nThis victory was significant not only for King's tennis career but also for the women's liberation movement, as it challenged the prevailing stereotypes about the physical capabilities of women in sports.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Billie Jean King:** An American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She won 39 Grand Slam titles, including 12 singles, 16 women's doubles, and 11 mixed doubles titles.\n\n- **Bobby Riggs:** An American tennis player who was the World No. 1 ranked player in 1939 and 1946. He won two Grand Slam singles titles: the 1939 and 1946 U.S. Nationals.\n\n- **Context of the Match:** The match was organized by promoter Larry Zugun and was promoted heavily by Riggs, who had previously defeated Margaret Court, another top female player, in a similar \"Battle of the Sexes\" match in May 1973.\n\n- **Significance:** Beyond the tennis court, the match was a cultural event that addressed issues of gender equality and women's rights. It helped to advance the cause of women in sports and society at large.\n\n**Other Options Explained:**\n\n- **Jimmy Connors:** An American former World No. 1 professional tennis player who won eight Grand Slam singles titles. He was a contemporary of Billie Jean King but did not participate in the \"Battle of the Sexes\" match.\n\n- **Pete Sampras:** An American former World No. 1 professional tennis player who won a record 14 Grand Slam singles titles. He played much later, in the 1990s and early 2000s, and thus did not compete against Billie Jean King.\n\n- **John McEnroe:** An American former World No. 1 professional tennis player who won seven Grand Slam singles titles. He was also a contemporary of Billie Jean King but did not participate in the \"Battle of the Sexes\" match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is D. Bobby Riggs. Billie Jean King's victory over Riggs in the \"Battle of the Sexes\" match was a landmark event in tennis and in the broader context of gender equality."
