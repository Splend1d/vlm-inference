I think I've seen this quote before in my law studies, but I need to recall who exactly said it.\n\nFirst, I know that Jeremy Bentham was a prominent legal philosopher who was known for his utilitarianism and his criticism of natural rights. He famously referred to natural rights as \"nonsense upon stilts.\" So, maybe he's the one who called a natural right \"a son that never had a father.\" That sounds like something Bentham would say, given his stance against natural rights.\n\nJeremy Valdon doesn't ring a bell. I think it might be a typo or perhaps I'm misremembering the name. Maybe it's supposed to be Jeremy Waldron, but I'm not sure. Waldron is a contemporary legal philosopher, but the quote seems older.\n\nSalmond is another legal theorist. Patrick Glenn Salmond was known for his work on jurisprudence, but I don't recall him making this particular statement.\n\nPaton is likely William Alan Paton, who was also a legal philosopher known for his work on natural law. He might have discussed natural rights, but again, I don't remember him saying this specific phrase.\n\nGiven that Jeremy Bentham was a critic of natural rights and the quote seems to be dismissing natural rights, it makes sense that it would be Bentham who said it. Also, the phrase \"nonsense upon stilts\" is directly associated with Bentham's view on natural rights.\n\nLet me double-check. Bentham was indeed critical of natural rights, considering them to be without any real foundation in law. He believed that rights should be based on utility and the greatest happiness principle rather than on abstract natural rights.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. Jeremy Bentham.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
