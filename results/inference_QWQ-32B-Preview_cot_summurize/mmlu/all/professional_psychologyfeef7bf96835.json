                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement best describes a researcher's obligations when using animals in psychological research. There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that most accurately reflects the ethical guidelines for animal research.\n\nOption A says: \"Animals should never be used in research when alternative procedures are available.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty straightforward. It suggests that if there's any alternative to using animals, researchers should use that instead. But I think in reality, researchers are supposed to consider alternatives, but sometimes using animals is necessary for certain types of research.\n\nOption B says: \"Animals should never be used in research if a research procedure will cause them pain or stress.\" This seems similar to option A, but it adds the condition that if the procedure causes pain or stress, animals shouldn't be used. Again, I think that's ideal, but in some cases, research that involves pain or stress might still be justified if it leads to important discoveries that benefit both humans and animals in the long run.\n\nOption C states: \"Inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable in research only when an alternative (nonpainful) procedure is unavailable and the use of the procedure is justified by the potential value of the study.\" This seems more balanced. It acknowledges that sometimes causing pain or stress to animals might be necessary if there's no other way to achieve the research goals, and only if the potential benefits are significant.\n\nOption D says: \"Inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable in research as long as it is minimized and the animal\u2019s life is terminated as soon as is feasible.\" This option seems to suggest that as long as pain and stress are kept to a minimum and the animal is euthanized quickly, it's acceptable to cause them pain or stress. But I think there's more to it than that. Researchers have to consider not just minimizing pain and stress but also justifying why the research is necessary and ensuring that the animals are treated humanely throughout the process.\n\nLooking back, option C seems to capture the essence of ethical guidelines for animal research. It emphasizes that causing pain or stress should only be done when there's no alternative and when the research has significant potential value. This aligns with principles like the \"3 Rs\" in animal research: Replacement (using alternatives to animals), Reduction (using as few animals as possible), and Refinement (minimizing pain and distress).\n\nSo, I think the best answer is option C. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
