This service is authorized under a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to federal statute. The certificate does not, however, specify particular highways, streets, or locations for the bus service. The company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city that it serves. The company's management regards this as a particularly effective advertising point in competition with the airlines and the railroads, because short-haul traffic supplies a major part of the bus company's revenues. One of the major cities on the east coast, acting to relieve traffic congestion and air pollution, has recently enacted an ordinance that prohibits (a) the operation of all trucks and buses in a five- square- mile central business area, known as center city, between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. on weekdays, and (b) all on-street parking of passenger automobiles in center city between the same weekday hours. The company's bus station in this city is located in the heart of the center city area. According to its transportation schedules, more than 75 buses either enter or leave this station between the hours of 10:00 A. M. and 4:00 P. M. each weekday. If the company brings suit challenging the constitutionality of the city ordinance, the court will most likely declare the ordinance\n\nA. constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district.\nB. constitutional, because it is a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\nC. unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\nD. unconstitutional, because the ordinance is discriminatory per Se.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this law problem. It's about a bus company that operates between major cities on the east coast. They have a certificate from the Interstate Commerce Commission, which is allowed by federal law. Their ads say they pick up and drop off passengers in the center of each city, which is important for their business because a lot of their revenue comes from short-haul traffic.\n\nNow, one of these cities has passed an ordinance to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. The ordinance bans trucks and buses from operating in a five-square-mile central business area, called center city, between 10 AM and 4 PM on weekdays. It also bans on-street parking for passenger cars in that area during the same times.\n\nThe bus company's station is right in the heart of this center city area, and more than 75 buses either enter or leave the station during those restricted hours on weekdays. So, the company is suing, saying that this ordinance is unconstitutional.\n\nWe need to figure out what the court will most likely decide. The options are:\n\nA. Constitutional, because it's within the city's police power to regulate transportation in the center city business district.\n\nB. Constitutional, because it's a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it violates the dormant commerce clause.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because the ordinance is discriminatory per se.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what the commerce clause is. I remember that the commerce clause is in the U.S. Constitution, and it gives Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. But there's also something called the dormant commerce clause, which is sort of an implied principle that state laws can't unduly burden or discriminate against interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, the bus company is involved in interstate commerce because it operates between major cities on the east coast, and it has a certificate from the ICC, which was a federal agency that regulated interstate commerce.\n\nSo, the city is passing a local ordinance that affects this interstate bus service. The bus company is arguing that this is unconstitutional.\n\nOption A says it's constitutional because of the city's police power to regulate transportation in the business district. Police power is the authority of states and municipalities to pass laws to promote public health, safety, and welfare. Traffic congestion and air pollution are certainly issues related to public health and safety, so the city probably has the power to regulate in this area.\n\nBut, at the same time, the bus company is involved in interstate commerce, and there might be limits to how much a local government can regulate interstate commerce.\n\nOption B says it's constitutional because it's a valid exercise of municipal regulation in the area of intrastate commerce. Wait, but the bus company is involved in interstate commerce, not just intrastate. So, maybe this isn't the best argument.\n\nOption C says it's unconstitutional because it violates the dormant commerce clause. That seems plausible because the dormant commerce clause is about preventing state and local laws from burdening interstate commerce.\n\nOption D says it's unconstitutional because the ordinance is discriminatory per se. That means the ordinance discriminates against interstate commerce on its face.\n\nSo, I need to think about whether this ordinance discriminates against interstate commerce or unduly burdens it.\n\nFirst, the ordinance bans trucks and buses from operating in the center city during certain hours. The bus company is affected because its station is in that area, and many of its buses operate during those hours.\n\nBut, the ordinance doesn't specifically mention buses involved in interstate commerce. It applies to all buses, not just interstate ones. So, it's not targeting interstate commerce specifically.\n\nHowever, the bus company might argue that because it's an interstate carrier, the ordinance imposes an undue burden on its operations.\n\nOn the other hand, the city has a legitimate interest in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in the center city area. Those are important public interests.\n\nI need to think about whether the ordinance discriminates against interstate commerce or if it's a legitimate regulation that incidentally affects interstate commerce.\n\nIn dormant commerce clause cases, courts generally look at whether the law discriminates against interstate commerce or if it unduly burdens interstate commerce compared to local commerce.\n\nHere, the ordinance applies to all buses, regardless of whether they're involved in interstate or intrastate commerce. So, on its face, it doesn't discriminate based on the nature of the commerce.\n\nBut, maybe the bus company is arguing that because it's an interstate carrier, it's being disproportionately affected.\n\nWait, but other bus companies that operate only within the state might also be affected if they operate in the center city during those hours.\n\nThe problem says that the bus company's advertising stresses that it picks up and delivers passengers at the center of each city, which is a competitive advantage over airlines and railroads. So, being unable to operate in the center city during certain hours might hurt their business more than others.\n\nBut, again, other local bus companies might also rely on the center city location.\n\nI think the key here is to see if the ordinance discriminates against interstate commerce or if it's a legitimate local regulation that incidentally affects interstate commerce.\n\nIf it's the former, then it's likely unconstitutional under the dormant commerce clause. If it's the latter, then the court might uphold it, especially if the local benefits outweigh the burdens on interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, since the ordinance applies to all buses, not just interstate ones, it seems like it's not discriminatory on its face.\n\nHowever, perhaps the bus company can argue that the practical effect is to discriminate against interstate commerce because their operations are more dependent on being in the center city.\n\nBut, that might be a harder argument to make.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bus company can argue that the ordinance burdens interstate commerce unduly because it interferes with its ability to provide service in a way that doesn't happen with local commerce.\n\nBut, again, local bus companies might also be affected similarly.\n\nI think the strongest argument for the bus company is that the ordinance burdens interstate commerce by restricting their ability to operate during peak hours in the center city, which is crucial for their business.\n\nHowever, the city has a compelling interest in reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, which are important public health and safety issues.\n\nCourts generally give local governments deference in regulating local conditions, as long as they're not explicitly discriminating against interstate commerce.\n\nIn this case, since the ordinance applies to all buses, it's not per se discriminatory.\n\nTherefore, the court might uphold the ordinance under the police power, especially if it determines that the local benefits outweigh the burdens on interstate commerce.\n\nAlternatively, the bus company might argue that the federal certificate it has supersedes the local ordinance, but the problem says that the certificate doesn't specify particular highways, streets, or locations, so maybe it doesn't mandate that they can operate in the center city during those hours.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the court will declare the ordinance constitutional, perhaps under option A, because it's within the city's police power to regulate transportation in the center city business district.\n\nOption C might be tempting, but since the ordinance isn't specifically targeting interstate commerce and is applying to all buses, it might not violate the dormant commerce clause.\n\nOption D seems less likely because the ordinance isn't discriminatory per se; it applies to all buses equally.\n\nSo, my answer would be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA) constitutional, because it is within the city's police power to regulate transportation services in the center city business district."
