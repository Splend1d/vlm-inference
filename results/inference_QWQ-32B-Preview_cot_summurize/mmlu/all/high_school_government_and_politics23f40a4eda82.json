                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of an implied power of Congress. The options are:\n\nA. Regulation of interstate commerce\n\nB. Borrowing money on the credit of the United States\n\nC. Oversight of executive branch agencies\n\nD. Declarations of war\n\nI know that Congress has enumerated powers, which are specifically listed in the Constitution, and implied powers, which are not explicitly stated but are necessary to carry out the enumerated powers. So, I need to identify which one of these is not directly stated but is considered necessary for Congress to perform its functions.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Regulation of interstate commerce: This is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as one of the enumerated powers of Congress. It's part of the Commerce Clause in Article I, Section 8. So, this is not an implied power.\n\nB. Borrowing money on the credit of the United States: This is also an enumerated power. It's listed in Article I, Section 8, among the powers of Congress. So, this isn't an implied power either.\n\nC. Oversight of executive branch agencies: Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I know that Congress has the power to oversee the executive branch, but is this power explicitly stated in the Constitution? I think oversight is more of an implied power because it's necessary for Congress to ensure that the laws it passes are being properly executed by the executive branch. But maybe it's enumerated somewhere.\n\nD. Declarations of war: This is definitely an enumerated power. Article I, Section 8, states that Congress shall have the power to declare war. So, this isn't an implied power.\n\nWait a minute, maybe oversight is not an implied power. Perhaps it's enumerated. Let me think about this again.\n\nCongress has the power of the purse, which means it controls funding for the executive branch. This is explicitly stated in the Constitution. Perhaps the power to oversee executive agencies comes from this enumerated power. In other words, in order to decide how to appropriate funds, Congress needs to oversee how those funds are being used. So, maybe oversight is an implied power because it's necessary to carry out the enumerated power of controlling the budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power to oversee the executive branch. I need to check.\n\nLooking back at Article I, Section 8, it lists the powers of Congress, including regulating commerce, declaring war, borrowing money, etc., but I don't see anything specifically about oversight. However, in Article I, Section 9, it mentions that Congress can approve or disapprove of specific executive actions, but it's not explicitly about oversight.\n\nMaybe I should consider the separation of powers and the system of checks and balances. The Constitution sets up a system where each branch has certain powers to check the others. Congress's power to oversee the executive branch could be seen as necessary to maintain this balance, even if it's not explicitly stated.\n\nIn comparison, regulation of interstate commerce, borrowing money, and declaring war are all explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, so they are enumerated powers. Oversight, on the other hand, seems to be an implied power because it's necessary for Congress to carry out its other responsibilities effectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Oversight of executive branch agencies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
