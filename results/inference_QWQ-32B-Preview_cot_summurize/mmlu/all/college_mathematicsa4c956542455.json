                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about eigenvectors and invertible matrices. It says that if v is an eigenvector of an invertible matrix A, then which of the following are necessarily true?\n\nI. v is also an eigenvector of 2A.\n\nII. v is also an eigenvector of A\u00b2.\n\nIII. v is also an eigenvector of A\u207b\u00b9.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I, II, and III\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what an eigenvector is. An eigenvector of a matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that when you multiply A by v, you get a scalar multiple of v. Mathematically, that's:\n\nA v = \u03bb v\n\nWhere \u03bb is the eigenvalue associated with v.\n\nNow, the matrix A is invertible, which means that its determinant is not zero, and A\u207b\u00b9 exists.\n\nLet's tackle each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: v is also an eigenvector of 2A.**\n\nIf A v = \u03bb v, then what is 2A v?\n\n2A v = 2 (A v) = 2 (\u03bb v) = (2\u03bb) v\n\nSo, v is an eigenvector of 2A with eigenvalue 2\u03bb.\n\nTherefore, statement I is true.\n\n**Statement II: v is also an eigenvector of A\u00b2.**\n\nIf A v = \u03bb v, then let's find A\u00b2 v.\n\nA\u00b2 v = A (A v) = A (\u03bb v) = \u03bb (A v) = \u03bb (\u03bb v) = \u03bb\u00b2 v\n\nSo, v is an eigenvector of A\u00b2 with eigenvalue \u03bb\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, statement II is true.\n\n**Statement III: v is also an eigenvector of A\u207b\u00b9.**\n\nThis one is a bit trickier. Since A is invertible, A\u207b\u00b9 exists. If A v = \u03bb v, can we say something about A\u207b\u00b9 v?\n\nLet's solve for v in terms of A and \u03bb.\n\nA v = \u03bb v\n\nMultiply both sides by A\u207b\u00b9:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 (A v) = A\u207b\u00b9 (\u03bb v)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nv = \u03bb A\u207b\u00b9 v\n\nNow, solve for A\u207b\u00b9 v:\n\nA\u207b\u00b9 v = (1/\u03bb) v\n\nSo, A\u207b\u00b9 v = (1/\u03bb) v\n\nThis shows that v is an eigenvector of A\u207b\u00b9 with eigenvalue 1/\u03bb.\n\nTherefore, statement III is true.\n\nWait a minute, but what if \u03bb is zero? Then 1/\u03bb would be undefined. But since A is invertible, none of its eigenvalues can be zero. Because if \u03bb were zero, then A v = 0 v = 0, which would imply that v is in the null space of A, but since A is invertible, its null space only contains the zero vector, which can't be an eigenvector. So, all eigenvalues of an invertible matrix are non-zero, which means 1/\u03bb is always defined.\n\nTherefore, statement III is indeed true.\n\nSince all three statements I, II, and III are true, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where one of these might not hold?\n\nSuppose A is a diagonal matrix with non-zero entries on the diagonal, say A = diag(\u03bb\u2081, \u03bb\u2082, ..., \u03bb\u2099), where none of the \u03bb\u1d62 are zero. Then, 2A = diag(2\u03bb\u2081, 2\u03bb\u2082, ..., 2\u03bb\u2099), A\u00b2 = diag(\u03bb\u2081\u00b2, \u03bb\u2082\u00b2, ..., \u03bb\u2099\u00b2), and A\u207b\u00b9 = diag(1/\u03bb\u2081, 1/\u03bb\u2082, ..., 1/\u03bb\u2099). In each case, the eigenvectors remain the same as those of A, which are the standard basis vectors.\n\nSo, in this case, all three statements hold.\n\nAlternatively, consider A to be a rotation matrix in 2D with no real eigenvalues. But actually, in that case, there are no real eigenvectors, so the hypothesis \"v is an eigenvector of A\" wouldn't hold in the real numbers. So, assuming we're working over the real numbers, and A has real eigenvalues, which it must if v is a real eigenvector.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the field, so perhaps it's considering complex matrices and eigenvectors. But in any case, the reasoning should hold.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the definition of eigenvectors and how they transform under these operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a theorem or property that directly addresses this.\n\nBut based on the above reasoning, it seems that all three statements are necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
