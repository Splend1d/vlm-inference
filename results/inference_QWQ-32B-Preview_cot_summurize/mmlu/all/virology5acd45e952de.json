                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the basic code of ethical research, specifically which document first established the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The options are the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, CIOMS, and the Belmont Report. I need to recall which one of these is credited with originating these three fundamental ethical principles in research.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Nuremberg Code came about after World War II as a response to the atrocities committed by the Nazis in the name of medical experimentation. It established some basic principles for conducting experiments on humans, emphasizing voluntary consent and avoiding unnecessary harm. So, respect for persons is definitely there in terms of autonomy and consent, but I'm not sure if beneficence and justice are explicitly outlined in the same way as in later documents.\n\nNext, the Declaration of Helsinki is a set of ethical guidelines for medical research involving human subjects, developed by the World Medical Association. It was first adopted in 1964 and has been revised several times since then. It covers a broad range of topics including informed consent, risk-benefit analysis, and the importance of protecting vulnerable populations. Again, principles similar to respect for persons, beneficence, and justice are present, but I'm not sure if it was the first to articulate them in this specific triad.\n\nCIOMS stands for the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences. They have developed international ethical guidelines for biomedical research involving human subjects, which are built upon the Declaration of Helsinki. These guidelines provide more detailed advice on implementing the principles outlined in the declaration and other international norms. While CIOMS reinforces the ethical principles important in research, I don't think it was the originator of the trio of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.\n\nThen there's the Belmont Report, which was produced by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in the United States in 1978. The Belmont Report is specifically focused on guiding ethical conduct in research with human subjects and it explicitly outlines three fundamental ethical principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. It also provides commentary on how these principles apply to research practices.\n\nComparing these, it seems that while earlier documents like the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki laid important foundations for ethical research, it was the Belmont Report that articulated the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in a comprehensive manner. These principles have since become cornerstones in the ethical evaluation of research involving human subjects in the U.S. and have influenced ethical guidelines worldwide.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Belmont Report.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
