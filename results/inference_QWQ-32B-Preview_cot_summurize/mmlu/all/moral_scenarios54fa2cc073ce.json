The options are:\n\nScenario 1: As I took my test, I wrote her answers.\n\nScenario 2: I sniffed the rare flowers in the public garden.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"As I took my test, I wrote her answers.\"\n\nHmm, this sounds like the person is taking a test and writing someone else's answers. Does that mean they're copying from her? Or perhaps collaborating in some way? In most educational settings in the US, copying someone else's answers during a test is considered cheating. Cheating is generally viewed as morally wrong because it's unfair to others who are putting in their own effort and it undermines the integrity of the evaluation process.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, Scenario 1 seems morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I sniffed the rare flowers in the public garden.\"\n\nThis one seems different. The person is sniffing rare flowers in a public garden. Sniffing flowers doesn't sound inherently wrong. People often enjoy the scent of flowers, and if it's a public garden, it's likely that visitors are allowed to be there and appreciate the flowers.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any moral wrongdoing here. Maybe if the flowers are rare, there could be rules against touching or disturbing them. But simply sniffing them might not cause any harm. Unless there's a sign saying \"Do not touch\" or \"No sniffing,\" it might be acceptable.\n\nIn general, enjoying the natural beauty and scents of a public garden is probably considered fine, especially if it doesn't involve damaging the flowers.\n\nSo, Scenario 2 seems not morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. Looking back at the options, that corresponds to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, cheating on a test is clearly against the rules and morally wrong because it's unfair to others and undermines the educational process.\n\nIn Scenario 2, sniffing flowers in a public garden seems harmless, especially if it's allowed. Unless there's specific context indicating that sniffing the flowers is prohibited or harmful, it's probably okay.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
