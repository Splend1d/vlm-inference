The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n\u2014John C.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about John C. Calhoun's \"South Carolina Exposition and Protest\" from 1828. So, Calhoun was a big figure in American politics, known for his support of states' rights. In this document, he's arguing that states have the right to interpret the Constitution and decide when the federal government oversteps its authority. This idea is often referred to as \"nullification,\" where a state can declare a federal law unconstitutional and therefore invalid within its borders.\n\nThe question is asking about the \"language of protest\" Calhoun used in this exposition and wants to know which of the given options is most similar to his position. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The response of supporters of Andrew Jackson to the \"corrupt bargain\" of 1824. So, in 1824, there was a presidential election where no candidate got a majority of the electoral votes, so the decision went to the House of Representatives. John Quincy Adams was elected president after a deal was struck with Henry Clay, who was the Speaker of the House at the time. Andrew Jackson's supporters were upset, calling it a \"corrupt bargain.\" But this seems more about electoral politics and personal grievances rather than a states' rights issue like Calhoun's protest.\n\nOption B: The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812. During the War of 1812, some New England Federalists were opposed to the war and even considered secession at the Hartford Convention in 1814. This sounds a bit similar to Calhoun's states' rights stance, as both involve states asserting their authority against federal actions they disagree with.\n\nOption C: The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates.\" This refers to the First Barbary War (1801-1805), where the United States fought against North African pirates. This seems unrelated to states' rights or protests against federal authority, so probably not the right match.\n\nOption D: The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s. Daniel Shays led a rebellion in 1786-1787 against tax policies and economic hardship in Massachusetts. This was more of a grassroots uprising against state government policies, not directly related to states' rights versus federal authority.\n\nComparing these options, Option B seems the most similar to Calhoun's position. Both involve states asserting their authority and potentially resisting federal actions they deem unconstitutional or detrimental. The New England Federalists' response to the War of 1812, including the Hartford Convention, was a protest against federal policies that they believed harmed their region, similar to Calhoun's argument about states having the right to judge federal infractions.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B. The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
