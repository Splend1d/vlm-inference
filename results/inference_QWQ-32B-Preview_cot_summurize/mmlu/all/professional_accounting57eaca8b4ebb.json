                    "text": "So I've got this question here about dividends and stock prices. Let me see if I can figure this out. The company last paid a dividend of $3, the expected return on its equity is 12%, and the shares are currently quoted at $75 on the London Stock Exchange. I need to find out what the dividend growth rate should be to make sure that the price is consistent with the pricing of a growing perpetuity.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the formula for the price of a growing perpetuity. I think it's something like P = D / (r - g), where:\n\n- P is the price of the stock,\n\n- D is the expected dividend in the next period,\n\n- r is the required rate of return,\n\n- g is the growth rate of dividends.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So, P = D / (r - g).\n\nGiven that, I have:\n\nP = $75\n\nD = $3 (but is this the next dividend or the last dividend? Hmm.)\n\nr = 12% or 0.12\n\ng = ? That's what I need to find.\n\nAh, I think D here is the next expected dividend. So, if the last dividend was $3, and dividends are growing at a rate of g, then the next dividend should be D = 3 * (1 + g).\n\nSo, plugging that into the formula:\n\n75 = [3 * (1 + g)] / (0.12 - g)\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for g.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply both sides by (0.12 - g) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n75 * (0.12 - g) = 3 * (1 + g)\n\nNow, expand both sides:\n\n75 * 0.12 - 75g = 3 + 3g\n\nCalculate 75 * 0.12:\n\n9 - 75g = 3 + 3g\n\nNow, I'll get all the terms with g on one side and the constants on the other.\n\nAdd 75g to both sides:\n\n9 = 3 + 78g\n\nNow, subtract 3 from both sides:\n\n6 = 78g\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 78:\n\ng = 6 / 78 = 0.0769, which is approximately 7.69%\n\nHmm, but that's not one of the options. The options are 0%, 8%, 16%, and -4%. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me check my steps again.\n\nStarting with:\n\n75 = [3 * (1 + g)] / (0.12 - g)\n\nThen:\n\n75 * (0.12 - g) = 3 * (1 + g)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n9 - 75g = 3 + 3g\n\nThen:\n\n9 - 3 = 75g + 3g \u2192 6 = 78g \u2192 g = 6/78 = 0.0769 or 7.69%\n\nWait, maybe I should consider more decimal places. 6 divided by 78 is exactly 0.0769230769..., which is about 7.692%. But that still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try plugging in the given options to see which one fits.\n\nLet's try g = 8% or 0.08.\n\nSo, D = 3 * (1 + 0.08) = 3 * 1.08 = 3.24\n\nThen, P = 3.24 / (0.12 - 0.08) = 3.24 / 0.04 = 81\n\nBut the stock is quoted at $75, not $81. So that's too high.\n\nNext, g = 16% or 0.16.\n\nD = 3 * 1.16 = 3.48\n\nP = 3.48 / (0.12 - 0.16) = 3.48 / (-0.04) = -87\n\nNegative price doesn't make sense. So, g cannot be 16%.\n\nNext, g = 0%.\n\nD = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nP = 3 / (0.12 - 0) = 3 / 0.12 = 25\n\nBut the stock is at $75, which is higher than $25. Doesn't make sense.\n\nLast option, g = -4% or -0.04.\n\nD = 3 * (1 - 0.04) = 3 * 0.96 = 2.88\n\nP = 2.88 / (0.12 - (-0.04)) = 2.88 / (0.12 + 0.04) = 2.88 / 0.16 = 18\n\nAgain, the stock is at $75, which is much higher than $18.\n\nSo, none of the options seem to fit. Maybe I need to reconsider the formula I'm using.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should use the Gordon Growth Model, which is P = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is the expected dividend in the next period.\n\nWait, that's what I did. D1 = D0 * (1 + g), where D0 is the last dividend.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula I should be using.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting continuous growth or something different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's assuming that the dividend grows at a constant rate forever, which is the standard assumption for a growing perpetuity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to rearrange the formula to solve for g.\n\nStarting again:\n\nP = D1 / (r - g)\n\nWhere D1 = D0 * (1 + g)\n\nSo, P = [D0 * (1 + g)] / (r - g)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n75 = [3 * (1 + g)] / (0.12 - g)\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.12 - g):\n\n75 * (0.12 - g) = 3 * (1 + g)\n\nExpand:\n\n9 - 75g = 3 + 3g\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n6 - 75g = 3g\n\nAdd 75g to both sides:\n\n6 = 3g + 75g \u2192 6 = 78g\n\nDivide both sides by 78:\n\ng = 6 / 78 = 0.0769 or 7.69%\n\nStill getting the same answer, which isn't among the options.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the question or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expected return is inclusive of some other factors, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the current dividend instead of the next one.\n\nWait, if D is the last dividend, and if the next dividend is D * (1 + g), then I think I did it correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is P = D / (r - g), where D is the last dividend. But in that case:\n\n75 = 3 / (0.12 - g)\n\nThen, 75 * (0.12 - g) = 3\n\nSo, 9 - 75g = 3\n\nThen, 9 - 3 = 75g \u2192 6 = 75g \u2192 g = 6 / 75 = 0.08 or 8%\n\nWait, that gives g = 8%, which is option B.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered D1 = D0 * (1 + g), I got a different answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the difference.\n\nIn the Gordon Growth Model, P = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is the next expected dividend.\n\nSo, D1 = D0 * (1 + g)\n\nTherefore, P = [D0 * (1 + g)] / (r - g)\n\nBut in the alternative approach, if I consider P = D / (r - g), where D is the last dividend, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, no, the standard formula is P = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is the next dividend.\n\nSo, I think the first approach is correct, and g should be approximately 7.69%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question expects g = 8%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a rounding assumption or something.\n\nGiven that 6 / 75 = 0.08, which is 8%, and 6 / 78 = approximately 0.0769, which is closer to 7.69%, but 6 / 75 is exactly 0.08.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had P = [D0 * (1 + g)] / (r - g), which is P = D1 / (r - g)\n\nSo, 75 = 3 * (1 + g) / (0.12 - g)\n\nThen, 75 * (0.12 - g) = 3 * (1 + g)\n\n9 - 75g = 3 + 3g\n\n9 - 3 = 75g + 3g \u2192 6 = 78g \u2192 g = 6 / 78 = 0.0769 or 7.69%\n\nBut if I consider P = D0 / (r - g), which would be 75 = 3 / (0.12 - g)\n\nThen, 75 * (0.12 - g) = 3\n\n9 - 75g = 3\n\n9 - 3 = 75g \u2192 6 = 75g \u2192 g = 6 / 75 = 0.08 or 8%\n\nSo, depending on whether D is the last dividend or the next dividend, I get two different answers.\n\nBut according to the standard Gordon Growth Model, it should be P = D1 / (r - g), where D1 is the next dividend.\n\nTherefore, the first approach is correct, and g should be approximately 7.69%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is expecting g = 8%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misprint in the options, and 8% is the closest to the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the continuous growth formula, but I don't think that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expected return already includes the growth rate, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the dividend yield plus growth rate equals required return, which is g = r - (D / P)\n\nWait, dividend yield is D / P, and if the required return is r, then g = r - (D / P)\n\nSo, g = 0.12 - (3 / 75) = 0.12 - 0.04 = 0.08 or 8%\n\nInteresting, that gives g = 8%.\n\nBut earlier, using the first method, I got g \u2248 7.69%, and using this shortcut, I get g = 8%.\n\nMaybe the difference is due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the first method, I made an error in calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the first method.\n\nStarting with:\n\n75 = [3 * (1 + g)] / (0.12 - g)\n\nMultiply both sides by (0.12 - g):\n\n75 * (0.12 - g) = 3 * (1 + g)\n\n9 - 75g = 3 + 3g\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n6 - 75g = 3g\n\nAdd 75g to both sides:\n\n6 = 78g\n\nDivide both sides by 78:\n\ng = 6 / 78 = 0.076923 or approximately 7.69%\n\nBut using the shortcut method, g = 0.12 - (3 / 75) = 0.12 - 0.04 = 0.08 or 8%\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy of 0.003077 or approximately 0.31%.\n\nMaybe this is due to rounding errors or approximation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question expects the answer to be 8%, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer isn't among the options, but given that 8% is closest to the calculated value, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the question or the options provided.\n\nIn any case, based on the calculations, the closest answer is 8%, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
