This slogan was used in a series of television commercials in the 1980s to highlight the larger portion sizes of Wendy's hamburgers compared to those of its competitors. The commercials featured elderly women who would take a bite of their Wendy's burger and exclaim, \"Where's the beef?\" when comparing it to smaller burgers from other fast-food chains. This catchy phrase became a cultural phenomenon and is still recognized today.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Wendy's"
