                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about psoriatic arthropathy. It's asking which statement is true about it. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The absence of plaques of psoriasis excludes the diagnosis.\" Hmm, I know that psoriatic arthritis is related to psoriasis, which is a skin condition that causes plaques. But does that mean everyone with psoriatic arthritis must have these plaques? I think some people can have arthritis related to psoriasis even without obvious skin plaques, maybe they have mild or hidden psoriasis. So, maybe this isn't always true.\n\nOption B says: \"The diagnosis can be confirmed by a blood marker.\" I recall that psoriatic arthritis doesn't have a specific blood test to confirm it. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, which has rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP antibodies, psoriatic arthritis doesn't have a definitive blood marker. So, probably this isn't true.\n\nOption C says: \"Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints.\" Tophi are those lumps that can occur in gout, right? I don't think tophi are characteristic of psoriatic arthritis. Maybe they can occur in psoriatic arthritis, but I'm not sure. Perhaps this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption D says: \"Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis.\" I know that nail changes are common in psoriasis, including pitting, where the nails have little pits or dents. So, if someone has nail pitting, it could suggest that they have psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. This seems plausible.\n\nLet me think again. Option A seems questionable because sometimes psoriatic arthritis can occur without obvious skin psoriasis. Option B is probably false because there's no specific blood marker for psoriatic arthritis. Option C might not be correct because tophi are more associated with gout. Option D seems likely because nail changes are a feature of psoriasis.\n\nMaybe I should look up some resources to confirm. According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, psoriatic arthritis is closely linked to psoriasis, which can affect the skin and nails. Nail changes, including pitting, are common in people with psoriatic arthritis. So, option D seems correct.\n\nAlso, it's known that not all people with psoriatic arthritis have visible skin psoriasis, so option A isn't true. There's no specific blood test to confirm psoriatic arthritis, so option B is incorrect. And tophi are associated with gout, not psoriatic arthritis, so option C doesn't seem right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: \"Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
