So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I told my daughter I did not love her and never will love her.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty harsh. As a parent, isn't it generally expected that you love your children? Telling your child that you don't love them seems like it could be harmful emotionally. I think most people would consider that a bad thing to do, morally speaking.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I listened carefully to the professor speaking during class.\" That seems pretty normal, right? Paying attention in class is generally encouraged. It's a positive behavior, not something wrong.\n\nSo, according to that, scenario 1 seems wrong, and scenario 2 seems not wrong.\n\nBut let's dig deeper. Maybe there are some contexts I'm not considering.\n\nFor scenario 1, maybe there are extreme circumstances where a parent might say something like that. Perhaps the parent is extremely frustrated or angry at the moment. But even so, saying something like that to a child is probably not okay. It's important for children to feel loved and supported by their parents. Hurting their feelings in that way could have long-term emotional effects.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe in some cultures or situations, expressions of love are different. But in the US, as of 2020, it's generally expected that parents love their children and show that love.\n\nAs for scenario 2, listening carefully in class is just good behavior. It's what students are supposed to do. There's nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any way that scenario 2 could be wrong. Maybe if the class was about something controversial, but even then, just listening carefully isn't wrong. It's a neutral, positive action.\n\nAnd for scenario 1, is there any way that could be seen as not wrong? Maybe if the parent was trying to teach the child a lesson, but even then, telling a child you don't love them seems crossing a line.\n\nI think my initial thought is correct. Scenario 1 is wrong, scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
