                    "text": "So I've got this question here about money creation through banking systems. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. Okay, so the scenario is that commercial banks don't hold any excess reserves, and the reserve requirement is 20%. Then, one bank receives a deposit of $1,000, and I need to figure out how much money is created in new loans from all banks as a result of this initial deposit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a reserve requirement is. The reserve requirement is the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. In this case, it's 20%, which means for every dollar deposited, the bank has to keep 20 cents and can lend out the remaining 80 cents.\n\nBut here, it says that banks save no excess reserves. That means that whatever they are allowed to lend out, they do lend out. So, if the reserve requirement is 20%, and they have no excess reserves, then they lend out everything above the required reserves.\n\nOkay, so let's start with the initial deposit of $1,000. The bank has to keep 20% of that as reserves, which is $200 (since 20% of $1,000 is $200). So, the bank keeps $200 in reserves and lends out the remaining $800.\n\nNow, here's where it gets interesting. The $800 that's lent out gets spent, and presumably, it ends up in another bank as a deposit. Let's say person A borrows $800 and spends it with person B, who then deposits that $800 in their own bank.\n\nNow, this second bank receives a deposit of $800. They also have to keep 20% in reserves, which is $160 (20% of $800), and they can lend out the remaining $640.\n\nSo, the second bank keeps $160 in reserves and lends out $640. This $640 gets spent and deposited into a third bank, which again keeps 20% in reserves ($128) and lends out $512.\n\nThis process continues, with each bank keeping 20% in reserves and lending out the remaining 80%.\n\nI think what's happening here is a multiplication effect, where the initial deposit leads to a series of loans and deposits that expand the money supply.\n\nTo find the total amount of money created from the initial deposit, I can use the money multiplier formula. The money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve requirement. In this case, the reserve requirement is 20%, or 0.20, so the money multiplier is 1 / 0.20 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the total money created from the initial deposit is the initial deposit multiplied by the money multiplier. So, $1,000 times 5 equals $5,000.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is asking for the amount created in new loans from all banks, not the total money created. Is there a difference?\n\nLet me think. The total money created includes both the reserves and the loans, right? Because each time a bank makes a loan, that loan becomes a deposit in another bank, which then creates more loans and reserves.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for the amount created in new loans. So, maybe I need to exclude the initial deposit or something.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nStarting with the initial deposit of $1,000, the first bank keeps $200 in reserves and lends out $800.\n\nThe $800 is lent out and deposited in other banks, which then keep 20% of $800, which is $160, in reserves and lend out $640.\n\nThis continues indefinitely, with each loan creating more deposits and reserves.\n\nSo, the total amount of new loans would be the sum of all the loans made in this process.\n\nSo, first loan: $800\n\nSecond loan: $640\n\nThird loan: $512\n\nAnd so on, forming a geometric series where each term is 80% of the previous term.\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nHere, a = $800 and r = 0.80.\n\nSo, S = 800 / (1 - 0.80) = 800 / 0.20 = $4,000.\n\nInteresting, so the total new loans created would be $4,000.\n\nBut earlier, using the money multiplier, I got $5,000 for the total money created.\n\nWait, so what's the difference here?\n\nIf the total money created is $5,000, and the total new loans are $4,000, then what's the remaining $1,000?\n\nAh, I think the total money created includes the initial deposit plus all the subsequent deposits from the loans.\n\nSo, initial deposit: $1,000\n\nLoans: $800 + $640 + $512 + ... = $4,000\n\nTotal money created: $1,000 + $4,000 = $5,000\n\nSo, the total money created is indeed $5,000, but the amount created in new loans is $4,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options, D is $5,000 and C is $4,000.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nThe question asks for \"the amount of money is created in new loans from all banks after this bank receives a deposit of $1,000.\"\n\nSo, it's specifically asking for the new loans created.\n\nAccording to my calculation, that would be $4,000.\n\nBut I recall that the money multiplier for loans might be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check another approach.\n\nIf the reserve requirement is 20%, then the loan multiplier is 1 / reserve requirement, which is 5, but that includes the initial deposit.\n\nWait, no, the money multiplier is 1 / reserve requirement, which is 5, and that gives the total money created, including deposits and loans.\n\nBut I need to find only the loans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loan multiplier is different.\n\nI think there's a distinction here.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nOkay, so the money multiplier is 1 / reserve requirement, which is 5, and that gives the total money created, including all deposits.\n\nBut the total loans would be the total money created minus the initial deposit, because the initial deposit is not a loan.\n\nSo, $5,000 total money created minus the initial $1,000 deposit equals $4,000 in loans.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the total new loans created would be $4,000.\n\nBut now I'm a bit confused because option D is $5,000, which seems to include the initial deposit, not just the loans.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"new loans from all banks,\" so it should be $4,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial deposit leads to $5,000 in loans, but that doesn't make sense because the initial deposit is not a loan.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the initial deposit allows the bank to make loans, and those loans lead to more deposits, which lead to more loans, and so on.\n\nBut in that case, the total loans would still be $4,000, with the total money created being $5,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the question is phrased, it's considering the initial loan as part of the $5,000.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the deposit as part of the loan creation process.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nWhen the bank receives a deposit of $1,000, it can lend out $800, which is then deposited in other banks, who can lend out $640, and so on.\n\nSo, the total loans would be $800 + $640 + $512 + ... = $4,000.\n\nBut perhaps the initial $1,000 deposit is considered a loan somehow, but that doesn't make sense because a deposit is not a loan.\n\nWait, maybe the question is considering the total change in the money supply, which is $5,000, but specifically for loans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach using the reserve ratio.\n\nLet me try calculating it differently.\n\nIf the reserve requirement is 20%, then for every dollar of reserves, the bank can have $5 in deposits (since 1 / 0.20 = 5).\n\nNow, the initial deposit is $1,000, which allows the bank to have $5,000 in deposits.\n\nBut again, the question is about new loans, not total deposits.\n\nSo, if the bank can have $5,000 in deposits, and it starts with $1,000, then the additional deposits are $4,000, which come from the loans.\n\nSo, in this case, the new loans would be $4,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total loans would be $5,000, but that includes the initial deposit, which isn't a loan.\n\nI'm getting conflicting answers here.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of T-account.\n\nInitial deposit: $1,000\n\nReserves increase by $200, loans increase by $800.\n\nThen, the $800 is deposited in other banks, who keep $160 in reserves and lend out $640.\n\nThis continues, with each loan creating more deposits and reserves.\n\nSo, the total loans would be $800 + $640 + $512 + ... = $4,000.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the total change in loans.\n\nI recall that the loan creation process can be modeled using the money multiplier, but adjusted for loans specifically.\n\nPerhaps the loan multiplier is (1 - reserve ratio) / reserve ratio.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loan multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio, same as the money multiplier.\n\nBut in that case, it would be 5, which would give $5,000, but that includes deposits, not just loans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the loan multiplier is 1 / (reserve ratio), but only applied to the initial loan, not the deposit.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose the initial deposit is $1,000.\n\nThe bank keeps $200 in reserves and lends out $800.\n\nNow, the $800 is deposited in other banks, who keep $160 in reserves and lend out $640.\n\nThis process continues.\n\nSo, the total loans would be the sum of the infinite series: $800 + $640 + $512 + ...\n\nWhich is a geometric series with first term $800 and ratio 0.80.\n\nSum S = a / (1 - r) = 800 / (1 - 0.80) = 800 / 0.20 = $4,000.\n\nSo, the total new loans created would be $4,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. $4,000.\n\nBut the options include $5,000, which is the total money created, including the initial deposit.\n\nI think the question is specifically asking for the new loans created, which would be $4,000.\n\nSo, I'll go with C. $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
