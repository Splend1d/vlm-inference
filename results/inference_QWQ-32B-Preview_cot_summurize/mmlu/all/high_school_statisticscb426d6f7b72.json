                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which conclusion is correct regarding this study on confidence in the U.S. economy. So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the researcher wants to examine long-term confidence in the U.S. economy among the adult population. To do this, she gets a simple random sample of 30 adults leaving a Wall Street office building one weekday afternoon. Out of these 30, all but two agree to participate, so 28 adults end up taking the survey.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the options to see which one is correct.\n\nOption A says that proper use of chance as evidenced by the simple random sample makes this a well-designed survey.\n\nHmm, a simple random sample is a good method because it should theoretically give each adult in the population an equal chance of being selected, which helps ensure representativeness. However, I need to consider where the sample is being taken from. It's from adults leaving a Wall Street office building. Is this really representative of the entire adult population?\n\nWall Street is known for finance and business, so the adults there might have different opinions about the economy compared to the general population. Maybe they're more knowledgeable or have more vested interests in the economy. So, even though it's a simple random sample, the starting population isn't necessarily representative of all adults. This might introduce selection bias.\n\nOption B mentions that the high response rate makes this a well-designed survey. The response rate is indeed high since only two out of 30 declined to participate, so that's about 93% participation. High response rates are generally good because they reduce nonresponse bias. But again, going back to the sampling location, if the sample isn't representative of the entire population, then a high response rate doesn't necessarily make the survey well-designed.\n\nOption C states that selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey. Selection bias occurs when there's a systematic error in the selection of the sample, leading to a sample that doesn't represent the population. In this case, sampling adults from a Wall Street office building likely doesn't represent the diverse opinions of the entire adult population. People working in Wall Street might have different economic views compared to, say, blue-collar workers or people in other industries. So, this seems like a valid point. The sample is not randomly selected from the entire adult population but from a specific location that may attract a particular type of person.\n\nOption D says that a voluntary response study like this gives too much emphasis to persons with strong opinions. Voluntary response bias occurs when individuals self-select into the survey, and those with strong opinions are more likely to respond. However, in this study, it's a simple random sample, not a voluntary response study. The researcher is approaching adults and selecting them randomly, not asking for volunteers. So, this option might not apply here.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that option C is the most correct. The study has selection bias because the sample is taken from a specific location that may not represent the entire adult population, making it a poorly designed survey in terms of generalizability.\n\nBut wait, option A mentions that the simple random sample makes it well-designed. Isn't that true? Well, simple random sampling is a good method, but it needs to be applied to the right population. Here, the population being sampled is not the entire adult population but adults leaving a Wall Street building. So, while the sampling method is good, the population it's applied to is not representative.\n\nOption B focuses on the high response rate, which is good, but again, doesn't address the issue of the sample not being representative of the general population.\n\nOption D doesn't apply because this isn't a voluntary response study.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct conclusion is C: selection bias makes this a poorly designed survey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
