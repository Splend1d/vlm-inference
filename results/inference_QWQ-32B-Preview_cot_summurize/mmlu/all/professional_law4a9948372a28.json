                    "text": "I have this legal scenario to analyze, and I need to determine whether the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a partnership that sold a vacant parcel of land to a purchaser using a general warranty deed. In this deed, there's a covenant that requires the grantee (the purchaser) and her assigns to share proportionately in the paving of a road that abuts the property. So, essentially, there's an agreement that whoever owns this land has to contribute to the paving of the adjacent road.\n\nThen, the grantee conveyed the property to a married couple using a special warranty deed, and this new deed didn't include any of the conditions about paving the road. The buyers didn't have an attorney and didn't do a title search, which might be important later on.\n\nNow, when the road was completed, the married couple refused to pay their share of the paving costs. So, the original sellers sued them in an equity claim without a jury, and the judge ruled that the couple had to pay their share. The couple is appealing this decision, and I need to figure out whether the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's order.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, this is a covenant running with the land because it was intended to apply to the first purchaser's heirs and \"assigns\".\n\nB. Yes, because a landowner is in any event responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads.\n\nC. No, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser.\n\nD. No, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not.\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nOption A says yes, it's a covenant running with the land because it applies to heirs and assigns. In property law, a covenant can run with the land if certain conditions are met. One of these conditions is that the covenant must touch and concern the land, meaning it has a material effect on the property's use or value. Here, the covenant is about contributing to the paving of an abutting road, which likely affects the property's value and usability, so it probably touches and concerns the land.\n\nAnother condition is that the original parties must have intended the covenant to run with the land. The use of \"assigns\" in the deed suggests that the intention was for the covenant to bind not just the original grantee but also anyone she assigns the property to, which includes subsequent owners.\n\nAdditionally, the covenant must be assigned to subsequent owners, meaning that the benefit or burden of the covenant passes to successive owners. Since the covenant is imposed on the grantee and her assigns, it seems like the burden is intended to run with the land.\n\nSo, based on these points, it seems plausible that this is a covenant running with the land, which would bind the married couple as subsequent owners.\n\nOption B says yes, because a landowner is responsible for her share of improvements to any abutting private roads. This seems more like a general rule, but I'm not sure if it's accurate in this context. In many jurisdictions, owners of property abutting a private road might have some responsibility for maintaining or improving the road, but this is often based on local ordinances or agreements among the owners.\n\nHowever, in this case, there's a specific covenant in the original deed that imposes this obligation. So, while there might be general responsibilities, here there's a specific contractual obligation that's been imposed. Therefore, option B might not be the best reason to affirm the judge's order.\n\nOption C says no, because the general warranty of the original sellers did not apply beyond the first purchaser. This seems to be confusing the warranty aspect with the covenant.\n\nA general warranty deed generally warrants that the seller has good title and hasn't encumbered the property in ways that wouldn't be apparent, and this warranty runs to all subsequent owners. However, in this case, the issue isn't about the warranty of title but about a specific covenant in the deed regarding paving the road.\n\nSo, the fact that it's a general warranty deed might ensure that the covenant is part of the chain of title, but it doesn't directly relate to whether the covenant binds subsequent owners. Therefore, option C might not be the correct reason to reverse the judge's order.\n\nOption D says no, because the paving requirement had to be placed in the deed to the married couple and it was not. This raises the question of whether covenants run with the land automatically or if they need to be expressly included in each subsequent deed.\n\nIn property law, for a covenant to run with the land, it's not necessarily required that it be expressly mentioned in every subsequent deed, provided that the conditions for it to run are met. So, if it's a covenant that touches and concerns the land and was intended to run with the land, it should bind subsequent owners even if not mentioned in their deed.\n\nTherefore, option D might not be correct because it suggests that the covenant doesn't bind the married couple since it wasn't in their deed, but in reality, if it's a covenant that runs with the land, it would bind them regardless.\n\nConsidering all this, option A seems to be the most accurate. The covenant was intended to apply to the grantee's assigns, which includes subsequent owners like the married couple, and it touches and concerns the land.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the married couple didn't have an attorney or do a title search might not relieve them of the obligation if the covenant is indeed binding on the land. In property law, buyers are generally expected to know about covenants and other encumbrances affecting the property, even if they don't conduct a title search.\n\nTherefore, the appellate court is likely to affirm the trial judge's order, and the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
