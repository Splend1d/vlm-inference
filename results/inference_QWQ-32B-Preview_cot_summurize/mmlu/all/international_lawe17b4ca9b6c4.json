                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out who has the authority to conclude a treaty on behalf of states. This seems like something related to international law and diplomacy.\n\nOption A says that treaties are concluded by competent representatives of states, and it lists heads of state, heads of governments, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions as those presumed to have such authority. That sounds reasonable because these are high-ranking officials who typically have the power to represent their countries in international affairs.\n\nOption B is more restrictive; it says that treaties may only be negotiated and concluded by heads of state and ministers of foreign affairs. While these positions are certainly key in treaty-making, I wonder if other officials can also be authorized to do so.\n\nOption C states that treaties are negotiated and signed only by persons bearing the necessary 'full powers,' and no one is presumed to have such authority. This seems to suggest that even high-ranking officials need specific authorization to conclude treaties, which might be too rigid.\n\nOption D says that treaties are concluded only by members of the diplomatic missions of states. But diplomatic missions usually handle day-to-day diplomatic relations, and while they might be involved in negotiations, I'm not sure if they have the final authority to conclude treaties.\n\nI think Option A is the most accurate because it recognizes that various high-ranking officials can conclude treaties, and they are presumed to have the necessary authority due to their positions.\n\nBut let me double-check. In international law, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides some guidance on this. According to the convention, a representative is considered competent to conclude a treaty if he produces appropriate full powers. However, certain officials are presumed to have the necessary authority based on their positions, such as heads of state, heads of government, and ministers of foreign affairs.\n\nSo, Option A aligns well with this understanding. It acknowledges that these officials have the presumed authority to conclude treaties on behalf of their states.\n\nOption B is too narrow because it excludes other officials who might be authorized to conclude treaties, such as ministers of other departments or special envoys.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that no one is presumed to have authority, which isn't the case for the high-ranking officials mentioned in Option A.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because diplomatic missions, while important in negotiations, are not typically the ones concluding treaties unless specifically authorized.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A: Treaties are concluded by the competent representatives of states. Heads of states, heads of governments, ministers of foreign affairs, and heads of diplomatic missions are presumed to have such authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
