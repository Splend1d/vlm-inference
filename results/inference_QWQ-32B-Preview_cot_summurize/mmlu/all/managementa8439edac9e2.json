                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about competition between countries. It's asking for the term that describes how competition in one country is affected by competition in other countries. The options are International trade, Global economics, Global competition, and Globalisation. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, International trade is about countries buying and selling goods and services across borders. It's important for competition because when countries trade, their companies compete with each other's products. So, it does relate to competition between countries.\n\nNext, Global economics is a broad term that looks at the world economy as a whole. It includes international trade, finance, and how different countries' economies interact. It's more about the big picture of how economies around the world are connected, which does include competition, but it seems a bit too broad for this question.\n\nGlobal competition specifically refers to the rivalry among companies from different countries. It's about how businesses compete on a worldwide scale, which directly affects competition within each country. So, this seems closely related to what the question is asking.\n\nLastly, Globalisation is the process by which businesses and other organisations develop international influence or start operating on an international scale. It involves the integration of local and national markets into a global network. Globalisation affects competition because it allows companies to compete globally, but it's more about the process than the competition itself.\n\nNow, considering the question is about the \"extent to which competition in one country is influenced by competition in other countries,\" I think \"Global competition\" is the most precise term. It directly addresses the rivalry between companies across borders and how that affects domestic competition.\n\nInternational trade is related because it's a channel through which competition occurs, but it's more specific to the exchange of goods and services. Global economics is too broad, and globalisation is more about the process of becoming integrated globally.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is C. Global competition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
