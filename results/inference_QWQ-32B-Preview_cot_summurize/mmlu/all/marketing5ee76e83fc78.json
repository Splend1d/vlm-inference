The options are social media marketing, internet advertising, crowdsourcing, and e-marketing. I think the answer might be crowdsourcing, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that social media marketing is about promoting products or services using social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. It's more about marketing and reaching out to potential customers rather than outsourcing tasks.\n\nInternet advertising is broad and includes various methods of promoting products or services over the internet, which again seems different from outsourcing tasks to a group of people.\n\nCrowdsourcing sounds familiar. I recall it involves getting tasks or problems solved by inviting contributions from a large group of people, often online. This seems pretty close to what the question is asking about.\n\nE-marketing is electronic marketing, which encompasses marketing efforts done through digital channels like email, websites, and social media. Again, it's more about marketing than outsourcing tasks.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, crowdsourcing appears to be the most appropriate answer because it directly relates to outsourcing tasks to a large group of people, typically over the internet.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check what crowdsourcing exactly is. According to what I've learned, crowdsourcing leverages the power of the crowd to accomplish specific tasks that a company might not have the expertise or resources to complete in-house. It can involve anything from gathering ideas, solving complex problems, to completing menial tasks, all contributed by a diverse group of people online.\n\nIn contrast, social media marketing and e-marketing are more focused on promotional activities to drive sales or brand awareness, not necessarily on outsourcing tasks.\n\nInternet advertising is a broader term that includes various advertising methods online, which again doesn't specifically relate to outsourcing tasks.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is crowdsourcing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
