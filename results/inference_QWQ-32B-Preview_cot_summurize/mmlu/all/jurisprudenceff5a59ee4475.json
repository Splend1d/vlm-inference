                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which proposition is most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim that there's only one right answer to every legal question. Dworkin is known for his theory that law is a matter of principle and that judges should look for the best moral justification that fits within the legal framework. He argues against legal positivism, which suggests that law is a set of rules and that judges apply these rules in a more mechanical way.\n\nOption A says, \"In hard cases judges generally decide cases on the basis of rights.\" This seems consistent with Dworkin's view because he emphasizes the importance of rights in legal decision-making, especially in difficult cases where clear rules may not apply.\n\nOption B, \"The rights of the parties feature in the determination of most cases before the courts.\" Again, this aligns with Dworkin's perspective because he believes that rights are central to legal reasoning.\n\nOption C, \"Judges exercise strong discretion.\" This is interesting because Dworkin's theory tends to limit judicial discretion by suggesting that there's only one right answer based on moral principles and legal principles. If judges are exercising strong discretion, that suggests they have a lot of leeway in deciding cases, which might contradict Dworkin's idea that there's a single correct answer.\n\nOption D, \"Judges seek the best 'fit' with constitutional and institutional history.\" This seems consistent with Dworkin's notion of law as a chain novel, where judges interpret the law in a way that best fits with the existing legal narrative and history.\n\nSo, considering these options, it seems that option C, \"Judges exercise strong discretion,\" is the most inconsistent with Dworkin's claim that there's only one right answer to every legal question. If judges have strong discretion, that implies multiple possible right answers, depending on how they exercise that discretion, which directly contradicts Dworkin's assertion of a single correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
