RNA replication takes place in the cytoplasm, whereas DNA replication takes place in the nucleus.\n\nHmm, location might play a role, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to mutation rates. Maybe I need to think about what happens in these different locations.\n\nB. RNA viruses replicate much faster than DNA viruses.\n\nSpeed of replication could be a factor. If a virus replicates faster, it might make more mistakes per unit time. But does that necessarily mean higher mutation rates? Maybe not directly, because mutation rate is often measured per replication cycle rather than per time.\n\nC. RNA viruses use uracil instead of thymine.\n\nUracil vs. thymine is a difference between RNA and DNA, but is that the reason for higher mutation rates? I don't think so. It's more about the replication machinery, I believe.\n\nD. RNA replication lacks the proofreading functions characteristic of DNA replication.\n\nAh, proofreading is important in replication. DNA polymerases have proofreading abilities to correct errors during replication, which helps maintain genetic fidelity. Maybe RNA polymerases don't have the same proofreading capabilities.\n\nLet me think about this.
