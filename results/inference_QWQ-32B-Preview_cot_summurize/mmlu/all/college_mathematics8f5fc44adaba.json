                    "text": "So I have this problem here about linear transformations, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nWe have a linear transformation T: R^2 -> R^2 that maps the point (1, 2) to (2, 3) and the point (-1, 2) to (2, -3). I need to find out where T maps the point (2, 1). The options are (1, 6), (-1, 4), (3, 2), and (-4, 3).\n\nFirst, I remember that linear transformations can be represented by matrices. Since this is a transformation from R^2 to R^2, the matrix should be 2x2. Let's denote the matrix as:\n\nT = [a b]\n\n[c d]\n\nSo, T applied to a vector (x, y) would be:\n\nT(x, y) = [a b; c d] * [x; y] = [a*x + b*y; c*x + d*y]\n\nNow, we know that T(1, 2) = (2, 3) and T(-1, 2) = (2, -3). So, I can set up equations based on these mappings.\n\nFirst, T(1, 2) = (2, 3):\n\na*1 + b*2 = 2\n\nc*1 + d*2 = 3\n\nAnd second, T(-1, 2) = (2, -3):\n\na*(-1) + b*2 = 2\n\nc*(-1) + d*2 = -3\n\nSo, I have two systems of equations:\n\n1) a + 2b = 2\n\n2) -a + 2b = 2\n\nAnd\n\n3) c + 2d = 3\n\n4) -c + 2d = -3\n\nLet me solve these systems one at a time.\n\nFirst, solving for a and b:\n\nFrom equation 1: a + 2b = 2\n\nFrom equation 2: -a + 2b = 2\n\nIf I add these two equations together, the a terms cancel:\n\n(a + 2b) + (-a + 2b) = 2 + 2\n\n4b = 4\n\nSo, b = 1\n\nNow, plug b = 1 into equation 1:\n\na + 2*(1) = 2\n\na + 2 = 2\n\na = 0\n\nSo, a = 0 and b = 1\n\nNow, solving for c and d:\n\nFrom equation 3: c + 2d = 3\n\nFrom equation 4: -c + 2d = -3\n\nAgain, add the two equations:\n\n(c + 2d) + (-c + 2d) = 3 + (-3)\n\n4d = 0\n\nSo, d = 0\n\nNow, plug d = 0 into equation 3:\n\nc + 2*(0) = 3\n\nc = 3\n\nSo, c = 3 and d = 0\n\nTherefore, the matrix T is:\n\nT = [0 1]\n\n[3 0]\n\nNow, I need to find T(2, 1):\n\nT(2, 1) = [0 1; 3 0] * [2; 1] = [0*2 + 1*1; 3*2 + 0*1] = [0 + 1; 6 + 0] = [1; 6]\n\nSo, T maps (2, 1) to (1, 6)\n\nLooking back at the options, A is (1, 6), which matches what I got.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's another way to approach this, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the transformation of two vectors, and these two vectors span R^2, I could express (2, 1) as a linear combination of (1, 2) and (-1, 2), and then apply T to that combination.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nLet (2, 1) = m*(1, 2) + n*(-1, 2)\n\nSo:\n\nm - n = 2 (from the first component)\n\n2m + 2n = 1 (from the second component)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me write it properly.\n\nSo:\n\nm*(1) + n*(-1) = 2 \u2192 m - n = 2\n\nm*(2) + n*(2) = 1 \u2192 2m + 2n = 1\n\nNow, solve for m and n.\n\nFrom the first equation: m = n + 2\n\nPlug into the second equation:\n\n2(n + 2) + 2n = 1\n\n2n + 4 + 2n = 1\n\n4n + 4 = 1\n\n4n = -3\n\nn = -3/4\n\nThen m = (-3/4) + 2 = 5/4\n\nSo, (2, 1) = (5/4)*(1, 2) + (-3/4)*(-1, 2)\n\nNow, apply T:\n\nT(2, 1) = (5/4)*T(1, 2) + (-3/4)*T(-1, 2)\n\nWe know T(1, 2) = (2, 3) and T(-1, 2) = (2, -3)\n\nSo:\n\nT(2, 1) = (5/4)*(2, 3) + (-3/4)*(2, -3)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n(5/4)*(2, 3) = (5/2, 15/4)\n\n(-3/4)*(2, -3) = (-6/4, 9/4) = (-3/2, 9/4)\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n(5/2 + (-3/2), 15/4 + 9/4) = (2/2, 24/4) = (1, 6)\n\nAgain, I get (1, 6), which matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. (1, 6)\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me check if there's any other possible interpretation or if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst approach: finding the matrix T and applying it to (2, 1). Second approach: expressing (2, 1) as a linear combination of the given vectors and applying T. Both methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that (1, 6) is the correct image of (2, 1) under T.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. (1, 6)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A.\\ (1,\\ 6)} \\]"
