                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out how fiscal and monetary policymakers can work together to fight a recessionary gap without causing big budget deficits. So, I need to think about spending policy, tax policy, and monetary policy, and see which combination makes sense.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a recessionary gap is. It's when the economy is producing less than its potential, meaning there's unused capacity and maybe higher unemployment. So, the goal is to stimulate the economy to close that gap.\n\nFiscal policy involves government spending and taxation. Monetary policy is managed by the central bank and involves things like interest rates and the money supply.\n\nOption A suggests higher spending and lower taxes, along with selling Treasury securities. Higher spending and lower taxes are expansionary fiscal policies, which should help stimulate the economy. However, selling Treasury securities is a contractionary monetary policy, which might offset the fiscal stimulus. Also, higher spending and lower taxes would likely increase the budget deficit, which we're trying to avoid.\n\nOption B proposes lower spending and higher taxes, combined with buying Treasury securities. Lower spending and higher taxes are contractionary fiscal policies, which would tend to slow down the economy, opposite of what we want during a recession. Buying Treasury securities is expansionary monetary policy, which might help, but the fiscal policies are working against that.\n\nOption C suggests lower spending and lower taxes, along with increasing the reserve ratio. Lower spending is contractionary, but lower taxes are expansionary fiscal policies. Increasing the reserve ratio is a contractionary monetary policy. This mix seems inconsistent; some parts are trying to stimulate the economy while others are trying to slow it down.\n\nOption D proposes higher spending and higher taxes, along with lowering the discount rate. Higher spending is expansionary, while higher taxes are contractionary fiscal policies. Lowering the discount rate is expansionary monetary policy.\n\nNow, the key here is to fight the recessionary gap without large budget deficits. So, we need policies that stimulate the economy but don't increase the deficit too much.\n\nLet's look back at the options:\n\n- Option A: Higher spending and lower taxes would likely increase the deficit, which we want to avoid.\n\n- Option B: Lower spending and higher taxes would decrease the deficit but might not be effective in stimulating the economy.\n\n- Option C: Lower spending could help the deficit, but lower taxes would work against that. Increasing the reserve ratio isn't helpful for stimulating the economy.\n\n- Option D: Higher spending could stimulate the economy, and higher taxes would help offset the increased spending, potentially keeping the deficit in check. Lowering the discount rate would make borrowing cheaper, encouraging investment and spending.\n\nSo, option D seems like the best combination. It includes both fiscal and monetary policies that can help stimulate the economy, while the higher taxes help to manage the budget deficit.\n\nBut wait, let's think deeper. If the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the direct impact on the deficit would be neutral, right? However, if the spending has a larger multiplier effect than the tax increase, overall economic activity could still increase, helping to close the recessionary gap.\n\nAdditionally, lowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank, which should encourage lending and investment, further stimulating the economy.\n\nTherefore, option D appears to be the most appropriate combination for fighting a recessionary gap while avoiding large budget deficits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
