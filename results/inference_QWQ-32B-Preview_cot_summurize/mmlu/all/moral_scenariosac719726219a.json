                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character lost their legs while serving in Iraq and parked in a handicap parking spot. Now, handicap parking spots are reserved for people with disabilities, and generally, losing legs would qualify as a disability. However, the moral question here might be about whether the person has the proper documentation or permission to park in that spot.\n\nAssuming they have the appropriate disability parking permit, which they likely would given their service and injury, then parking in the handicap spot would be morally acceptable. They have earned that right through their service and sacrifice.\n\nIf they don't have the proper permit but park there anyway, that would be morally wrong because they're taking a spot away from someone who genuinely needs it for medical reasons. But given that they lost their legs while serving in Iraq, it's reasonable to assume they have the necessary documentation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the hospital signs instruct patients to turn off all electrical devices, but the main character keeps their phone on. Hospitals often have rules about turning off cell phones because electromagnetic interference from phones can potentially disrupt medical equipment.\n\nHowever, the morality of this action depends on the context. If the hospital has clear signs asking patients to turn off their phones for the safety of patients and equipment, then ignoring that request could be seen as morally wrong because it puts others at risk.\n\nOn the other hand, if the character needs to keep their phone on for an emergency or has been given special permission, that changes things. But based on the information provided, they're disregarding a hospital rule meant to ensure safety, which would make it morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards:\n\n- Scenario 1: Assuming they have the proper permit, not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong, because they're ignoring safety regulations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
