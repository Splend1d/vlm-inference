                    "text": "To determine which food is the cheapest and most nutritious in terms of price per calorie, we need to consider both the cost and the caloric content of each option. Let's analyze each choice step by step.\n\n**Option A: Apple**\n\n- **Calories**: An average medium-sized apple contains about 95 calories.\n\n- **Price**: The price of apples can vary, but let's assume an average price of $1 per apple.\n\n- **Price per calorie**: $1 / 95 calories \u2248 $0.0105 per calorie.\n\n**Option B: Slice of bread**\n\n- **Calories**: A typical slice of bread has around 70 calories.\n\n- **Price**: A loaf of bread might cost $2 and contain about 20 slices.\n\n- **Price per slice**: $2 / 20 slices = $0.10 per slice.\n\n- **Price per calorie**: $0.10 / 70 calories \u2248 $0.0014 per calorie.\n\n**Option C: Cheeseburger**\n\n- **Calories**: A cheeseburger from a fast-food restaurant can have around 300 calories.\n\n- **Price**: Let's assume a cheeseburger costs $5.\n\n- **Price per calorie**: $5 / 300 calories \u2248 $0.0167 per calorie.\n\n**Option D: Broccoli**\n\n- **Calories**: One cup of chopped broccoli contains about 55 calories.\n\n- **Price**: Broccoli might cost $2 per pound, and one pound is approximately 2 cups.\n\n- **Price per cup**: $2 / 2 cups = $1 per cup.\n\n- **Price per calorie**: $1 / 55 calories \u2248 $0.0182 per calorie.\n\nNow, comparing the price per calorie:\n\n- Apple: $0.0105 per calorie\n\n- Slice of bread: $0.0014 per calorie\n\n- Cheeseburger: $0.0167 per calorie\n\n- Broccoli: $0.0182 per calorie\n\nBased on this calculation, the slice of bread is the cheapest in terms of price per calorie.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider nutritional value beyond just calories. Bread is high in carbohydrates but may lack other essential nutrients compared to fruits and vegetables. Apples provide fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. Cheeseburgers offer protein and fats but are also higher in saturated fats and less nutritious compared to plant-based options. Broccoli is rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\nConsidering both cost and nutrition, the slice of bread is the cheapest per calorie, but it may not be the most nutritious option. Apples offer better nutrition compared to bread, and although they are slightly more expensive per calorie, they provide more health benefits.\n\nTherefore, if the goal is to get the cheapest source of calories, option B (slice of bread) is the best choice. But if nutrition density is also a consideration, option A (apple) might be a better balance between cost and nutritional value.\n\nGiven the question asks for the \"cheapest and most nutritious,\" it's a bit subjective, but based on the data, the slice of bread is the cheapest per calorie, while the apple offers better nutrition compared to its cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
