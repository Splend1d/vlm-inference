Let's look at each option and see which one best defines primary data.\n\nOption A says: \"Data collected for the first time specifically for a marketing research study.\" Hmm, that sounds right. Primary data is indeed original data that is collected directly for a specific research purpose. It's not reused from previous studies but is gathered anew to address the particular questions or hypotheses of the current study. So, this seems like a good definition.\n\nOption B states: \"Less time-consuming to acquire and less costly than secondary data.\" Wait a minute, is this accurate? Actually, collecting primary data can be more time-consuming and expensive compared to using secondary data. Secondary data is data that already exists and has been collected for other purposes, so it's often quicker and cheaper to access. Primary data requires designing a research method, collecting the data, and then analyzing it, which can be a lengthy and costly process. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"Newly-published results of government investigations.\" This sounds more like secondary data to me. Secondary data includes existing information from various sources, such as government publications, reports, and studies that have already been conducted by others. While it's newly published, it's still data that has been collected for other purposes, not specifically for the current research study. Therefore, this doesn't align with the definition of primary data.\n\nOption D mentions: \"Part of a strategic planning activity to ensure proper resource allocation.\" This seems a bit vague. While primary data can certainly be used in strategic planning to make informed decisions about resource allocation, this option doesn't directly define what primary data is. It's more about the use of data rather than its origin or collection method.\n\nSo, considering all these points, option A appears to be the most accurate definition of primary data. It emphasizes that the data is collected specifically for the marketing research study, which aligns with the general understanding of primary data in the field of research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
