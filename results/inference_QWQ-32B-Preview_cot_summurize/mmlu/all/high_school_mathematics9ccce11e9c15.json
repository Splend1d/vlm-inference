                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two people, Rowena and Ruby, who can paint a room in different amounts of time. Rowena can paint the room in 14 hours, and Ruby can do it in 6 hours. That means their painting rates are different.\n\nFirst, I need to find out their painting rates. The rate is usually defined as the fraction of the job they can complete in one hour.\n\nSo, Rowena's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{14} \\) of the room per hour, and Ruby's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of the room per hour.\n\nNow, the problem states two scenarios:\n\n1. If Rowena paints for \\( x \\) hours and Ruby paints for \\( y \\) hours, they will finish half of the painting.\n\n2. If Rowena paints for \\( y \\) hours and Ruby paints for \\( x \\) hours, they will paint the whole room.\n\nSo, I need to set up equations based on these scenarios.\n\nFor the first scenario:\n\nRowena paints for \\( x \\) hours at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{14} \\) per hour, so she paints \\( \\frac{x}{14} \\) of the room.\n\nRuby paints for \\( y \\) hours at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) per hour, so she paints \\( \\frac{y}{6} \\) of the room.\n\nTogether, they paint half the room:\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nFor the second scenario:\n\nRowena paints for \\( y \\) hours at \\( \\frac{1}{14} \\) per hour, so \\( \\frac{y}{14} \\).\n\nRuby paints for \\( x \\) hours at \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) per hour, so \\( \\frac{x}{6} \\).\n\nTogether, they paint the whole room:\n\n\\[ \\frac{y}{14} + \\frac{x}{6} = 1 \\]\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\n2. \\( \\frac{y}{14} + \\frac{x}{6} = 1 \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFirst, to make it easier, I can eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator. The denominators are 14 and 6, so the least common multiple is 42.\n\nMultiply both equations by 42 to eliminate denominators.\n\nFor the first equation:\n\n\\[ 42 \\times \\left( \\frac{x}{14} + \\frac{y}{6} \\right) = 42 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ 42 \\times \\frac{x}{14} + 42 \\times \\frac{y}{6} = 21 \\]\n\n\\[ 3x + 7y = 21 \\]\n\nFor the second equation:\n\n\\[ 42 \\times \\left( \\frac{y}{14} + \\frac{x}{6} \\right) = 42 \\times 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 42 \\times \\frac{y}{14} + 42 \\times \\frac{x}{6} = 42 \\]\n\n\\[ 3y + 7x = 42 \\]\n\nNow I have a system of linear equations:\n\n1. \\( 3x + 7y = 21 \\)\n\n2. \\( 7x + 3y = 42 \\)\n\nI can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination.\n\nLet's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 7 to make the coefficients of \\( y \\) the same:\n\nFirst equation \u00d7 3:\n\n\\[ 9x + 21y = 63 \\]\n\nSecond equation \u00d7 7:\n\n\\[ 49x + 21y = 294 \\]\n\nNow, subtract the first multiplied equation from the second multiplied equation:\n\n\\[ (49x + 21y) - (9x + 21y) = 294 - 63 \\]\n\n\\[ 40x = 231 \\]\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{231}{40} \\]\n\nNow, plug \\( x = \\frac{231}{40} \\) back into one of the original equations to find \\( y \\). Let's use the first equation:\n\n\\[ 3x + 7y = 21 \\]\n\n\\[ 3 \\times \\frac{231}{40} + 7y = 21 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{693}{40} + 7y = 21 \\]\n\nSubtract \\( \\frac{693}{40} \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 7y = 21 - \\frac{693}{40} \\]\n\nConvert 21 to fortyths:\n\n\\[ 21 = \\frac{840}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ 7y = \\frac{840}{40} - \\frac{693}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ 7y = \\frac{147}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{147}{40 \\times 7} \\]\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{147}{280} \\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{147}{280} \\):\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 7:\n\n\\[ \\frac{147 \\div 7}{280 \\div 7} = \\frac{21}{40} \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = \\frac{21}{40} \\)\n\nTherefore, the ordered pair \\( (x, y) \\) is \\( \\left( \\frac{231}{40}, \\frac{21}{40} \\right) \\)\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{231}{40}, \\ \\dfrac{21}{40} \\right)} \\]"
