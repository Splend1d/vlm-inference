                    "text": "Let's see. So, the storekeeper did a survey to find out if customers want the store to be open on Sundays. He asked 100 female customers and 120 male customers if they're interested in shopping there on Sundays. Then, he looked at the proportions of \"yes\" answers from males and females and found a 95% confidence interval for the difference between these proportions, specifically by subtracting the female proportion from the male proportion. The interval he got was (-0.23, -0.18).\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what this confidence interval means. A 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions gives a range of plausible values for the true difference between the proportion of males and females who are interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThe way he calculated it was by subtracting the proportion of females from the proportion of males. So, if we let p_m be the proportion of males interested and p_f be the proportion of females interested, then the difference he's looking at is p_m - p_f.\n\nThe confidence interval is (-0.23, -0.18), which means that we're 95% confident that the true difference p_m - p_f lies between -0.23 and -0.18.\n\nNow, since both ends of the interval are negative, that means p_m - p_f is negative, which implies that p_m is less than p_f. In other words, the proportion of females interested in shopping on Sundays is higher than that of males.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis seems to match what I just thought. Since p_f > p_m, the proportion of women interested is higher than that of men.\n\nB. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nThis would be the opposite of what the interval suggests, since the difference p_m - p_f is negative.\n\nC. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is equal to the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\n\nBut the interval doesn't include zero; it's entirely negative, so we can be confident that the proportions are not equal.\n\nD. Because the interval contains negative values, it is invalid and should not be interpreted.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Negative values in the confidence interval are okay; they just indicate the direction of the difference.\n\nSo, the correct interpretation should be A, right? We're 95% confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays is higher than that of men.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The confidence interval is for p_m - p_f, which is negative, meaning p_m < p_f, so indeed, p_f > p_m.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
