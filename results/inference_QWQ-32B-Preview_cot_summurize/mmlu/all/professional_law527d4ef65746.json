                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. It's a bit complex with multiple events happening over the years, so I need to make sure I understand the sequence and the legal implications of each event.\n\nFirst, in 1993, the borrower mortgaged a ranch to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest per annum. So, the borrower owes the mortgage company money, and the ranch is collateral for that debt.\n\nNext, in 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. Recording is important because it provides public notice of the mortgage, protecting the mortgage company's interest against other claims on the property.\n\nThen, in 2007, the borrower promised in writing to convey the ranch to his daughter via a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. This seems like the borrower is planning to give the ranch to his daughter but also take care of the mortgage debt.\n\nIn 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. A quitclaim deed transfers any interest the borrower has in the property to the daughter without warranties. Since it doesn't mention the mortgage, the daughter is likely taking the property subject to the existing mortgage.\n\nNow, if the borrower defaults on the mortgage and the mortgage company brings an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, we need to determine whether the mortgagee (the mortgage company) will probably succeed.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.\n\nB. Succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.\n\nC. Not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nD. Not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of property transfer.\n\nFirst, considering option A: Is the mortgage company a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter?\n\nIn 2007, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to his daughter and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. This seems like an agreement between the borrower and the daughter. For the mortgage company to be a third-party beneficiary, the agreement must have been made with the intent to benefit the mortgage company.\n\nIn this case, the borrower is promising to pay the mortgage debt when it comes due, which benefits the mortgage company, but it's not clear that the agreement was made for the purpose of benefiting the mortgage company directly. The primary purpose seems to be the transfer of the property to the daughter, with the borrower taking care of the mortgage.\n\nMoreover, in a third-party beneficiary situation, the third party must be identified or part of a class that's identified in the contract. Here, the mortgage company isn't specifically named as a beneficiary; it's just that paying the mortgage would benefit the mortgage company.\n\nSo, option A seems less likely.\n\nOption B: Succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.\n\nDelegation of duties typically occurs when one party to a contract assigns their duties to a third party. In this case, the borrower is transferring the property to the daughter and promising to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nHowever, delegation of duties requires that the original obligor (the borrower) transfers their duty to perform to another party (the daughter), and this typically requires the consent of the obligee (the mortgage company).\n\nThere's no indication that the mortgage company consented to any delegation of the borrower's duties to the daughter. Therefore, it's unlikely that there was an implied delegation of duties.\n\nOption C: Not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nThis seems plausible. The daughter never made any promise to pay the mortgage debt. The borrower promised to pay the debt, and transferred the property to the daughter via a quitclaim deed that didn't mention the mortgage.\n\nSo, the daughter received the property subject to the mortgage, but she didn't assume any personal liability for the mortgage debt.\n\nTherefore, the mortgage company should look to the borrower for payment, not the daughter.\n\nOption D: Not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of property transfer.\n\nThis is similar to option B, focusing on the delegation of duties. As discussed earlier, delegation typically requires the consent of the obligee, which is lacking here.\n\nHowever, option C seems more directly applicable because it highlights that the daughter didn't promise to pay the debt.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that the mortgage company cannot successfully bring an in personam action against the daughter to recover the mortgage debt because the daughter didn't assume any obligation to pay it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably C. Not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the transfer of the property to the daughter affects the mortgage company's rights. In some jurisdictions, transferring mortgaged property without assuming the mortgage debt doesn't relieve the transferee from the debt, but it doesn't create personal liability either.\n\nIn this case, since the quitclaim deed doesn't mention the mortgage, the daughter takes the property subject to the mortgage, meaning the mortgage remains attached to the property, but she isn't personally liable for the debt unless she specifically assumed it.\n\nGiven that there's no indication that the daughter assumed the mortgage debt, it's unlikely that the mortgage company can hold her personally liable for the debt.\n\nHence, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
