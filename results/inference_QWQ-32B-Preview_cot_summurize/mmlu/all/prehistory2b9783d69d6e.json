                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about the walls of the central complex of Great Zimbabwe is not true. So, I have options A through D, and one of them is incorrect.\n\nFirst, I know that Great Zimbabwe is an ancient city in southern Africa, and it's famous for its stone structures. The central complex is probably the most impressive part, with these massive walls.\n\nOption A says: \"they were built of over 1 million granite bricks.\" Hmm, that sounds plausible. Zimbabwean architecture is known for its use of granite, which is abundant in the region. Building with millions of bricks would make sense for such a large structure.\n\nOption B: \"they exhibit sophisticated masonry.\" Again, this seems accurate. The ruins of Great Zimbabwe are renowned for their intricate stonework, especially the walls without mortar, which are a signature of their construction technique.\n\nOption C: \"they stood 40 feet tall in places.\" Forty feet is about 12 meters. That's pretty tall for walls. I need to check if that's accurate. I recall that some parts of the walls are quite high, but I'm not sure about exactly 40 feet.\n\nOption D: \"the mortar that holds them together was made from ground up ocean shells.\" Now, this one catches my attention. I thought that Zimbabwean architecture, especially in Great Zimbabwe, was characterized by dry stone walling, meaning they didn't use mortar. So, this statement seems contradictory.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe in some parts, they did use mortar. But I'm fairly certain that the main walls, especially in the central complex, are dry stone walls.\n\nAlso, using ground-up ocean shells for mortar sounds unusual. Ocean shells are from the coast, and Great Zimbabwe is inland. Transporting materials like that over long distances would be challenging.\n\nMoreover, traditional Zimbabwean construction techniques emphasize the skill in fitting stones together without mortar. So, using mortar might not align with the general building practices of that time and place.\n\nTherefore, I suspect that option D is the statement that is not true.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A: 1 million granite bricks. That seems feasible. The site is massive, and using local granite would make sense.\n\nOption B: Sophisticated masonry. Definitely true; it's one of the highlights of the site.\n\nOption C: 40 feet tall in places. While I'm not sure about the exact height, it's possible. Some walls might have been that high.\n\nOption D: Mortar made from ground-up ocean shells. This seems inconsistent with what I know about Great Zimbabwe's construction methods.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
