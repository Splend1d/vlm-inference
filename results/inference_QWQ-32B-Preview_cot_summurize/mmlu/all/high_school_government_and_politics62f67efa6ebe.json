The options are:\n\nA. issues a writ of habeas corpus\n\nB. issues a writ of certiorari\n\nC. issues amicus curiae briefs\n\nD. engages in judicial review\n\nI think I need to understand what each of these terms means to get this right.\n\nFirst, a writ of habeas corpus is something that's used to challenge someone's detention or imprisonment, right? It's like asking the court to check if someone is being held legally. So, that seems related to specific cases where someone's liberty is at stake, but I'm not sure if it's what the Supreme Court does when it takes an appeal.\n\nNext, a writ of certiorari. I've heard this term before in relation to the Supreme Court. I think it's when the Court is deciding whether to review a lower court's decision. So, maybe when the Supreme Court wants to take a case on appeal, it issues a writ of certiorari to bring the case up to them.\n\nThen there are amicus curiae briefs. I know that \"amicus curiae\" means \"friend of the court\" in Latin. These are submissions from people or groups who aren't directly involved in the case but have relevant information or perspective to offer. So, I don't think that's what happens when the Supreme Court decides to take a case; that's more something that third parties do in existing cases.\n\nFinally, judicial review. That's the power of the courts to decide if laws and actions are constitutional. It's a big part of what the Supreme Court does, but I don't think it specifically answers the question of what happens when they take a case on appeal.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B. issues a writ of certiorari. That seems to be the formal way the Supreme Court says it wants to review a case.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should look it up or think about it some more.\n\nWait, I remember that the Supreme Court has discretion over which cases it hears, especially in civil cases. Parties can ask the Court to review their case by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari. If the Court grants certiorari, it agrees to hear the case. So, that makes sense.\n\nOption A, habeas corpus, seems more related to specific types of cases, like those involving detention, not generally to the process of appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nOption C, amicus curiae briefs, are submitted by outside parties wanting to influence the case, not by the Court itself when it takes a case.\n\nOption D, judicial review, is a power the Court exercises once it's hearing a case, not specifically the act of taking the case on appeal.\n\nTherefore, it must be B. issues a writ of certiorari.\n\nI feel pretty confident about that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
