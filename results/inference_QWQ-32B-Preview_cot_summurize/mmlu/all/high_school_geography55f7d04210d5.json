Adequate schools\n\nC. Daycare facilities\n\nD. Health care\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a large and rapidly aging population means. It means that there are more older people compared to younger people, and this shift is happening quickly. So, the population is getting older on average.\n\nNow, let's think about each option:\n\nA. Immunization: This is important for all ages, but older people might have different vaccination needs, like shots for flu or pneumonia, which are common in older age groups. But is this the biggest concern?\n\nB. Adequate schools: Schools are crucial for children and young people. But in a population that's aging rapidly, there might be fewer young people needing schools. So, this might not be the top concern.\n\nC. Daycare facilities: These are for very young children. Again, if the population is aging, there might be fewer young children needing daycare. So, this might not be the primary issue.\n\nD. Health care: Older people generally have more health issues than younger people. They might need more medical care, long-term care, and services tailored to age-related conditions.\n\nConsidering this, health care seems like it would be a major concern in countries with a large and rapidly aging population. There might be needs for more healthcare providers, facilities equipped for elderly care, and services like nursing homes or in-home care.\n\nImmunization is important, but it's more of a general health concern and not specifically tied to an aging population. Schools and daycare facilities are more relevant to younger populations, which are decreasing in proportion as the population ages.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Health care.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
