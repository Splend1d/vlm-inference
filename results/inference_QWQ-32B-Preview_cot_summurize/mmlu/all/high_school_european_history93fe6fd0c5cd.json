                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Mikhail Gorbachev about perestroika, which means restructuring in Russian. He's talking about how it's an urgent necessity because of some deep changes happening in Soviet society. He says that society is ready for change and has been wanting it for a long time. He also mentions that if they don't start restructuring soon, there could be big problems like economic, social, and political crises in the near future.\n\nThe question is asking what we can infer from this passage about Gorbachev's arguments for perestroika. There are four options:\n\nA. That restructuring was inevitable.\n\nB. That restructuring would make the current situation worse.\n\nC. That restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis.\n\nD. That restructuring was necessary to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nOkay, let's look at each one.\n\nOption A says restructuring was inevitable. Well, Gorbachev says it's an urgent necessity and that the society is ripe for change and has been yearning for it. So, it seems like he thinks it's necessary, but does that mean it's inevitable? Not necessarily. Inevitable means it's going to happen no matter what, but Gorbachev is arguing that they need to do it proactively to avoid crises. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B says that restructuring would exacerbate the current situation. But Gorbachev is saying that any delay in beginning perestroika could lead to an exacerbated situation. So, he's arguing that not doing it would make things worse, not that doing it would make things worse. So, this seems opposite to what he's saying.\n\nOption C says that restructuring was necessary to avoid a crisis. That aligns pretty well with what Gorbachev is saying. He mentions that delaying perestroika could lead to serious crises, implying that doing it is necessary to prevent those crises.\n\nOption D says that restructuring was necessary to avoid the collapse of the Soviet Union. Well, he does mention serious social, economic, and political crises, which could potentially lead to collapse, but he doesn't explicitly say that perestroika is necessary to avoid collapse. He talks about avoiding crises, but collapse is a step further.\n\nSo, comparing these options, option C seems to directly reflect Gorbachev's argument in the passage. He's saying that perestroika is urgent and necessary to prevent crises that could arise from delaying it.\n\nBut wait, maybe option D is also plausible because if there are serious crises, it could lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, Gorbachev doesn't explicitly mention collapse here. He stops at crises.\n\nMoreover, option A about inevitability isn't strongly supported by the text. He says it's necessary and urgent, but not inevitable.\n\nOption B is clearly against what he's saying.\n\nSo, between C and D, C seems more directly supported by the text.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. A restructuring of the socialist society of the Soviet Union was necessary in order to avoid a crisis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
