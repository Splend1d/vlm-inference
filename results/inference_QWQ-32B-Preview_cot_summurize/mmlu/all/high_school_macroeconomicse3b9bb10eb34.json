                    "text": "Let's see which of these events doesn't affect GDP. So, GDP is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a certain period. It's like the score that tells us how well the economy is doing.\n\nOption A: You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend. This is about buying a used car. Now, in GDP, we mostly consider the production of new goods. Used goods transactions aren't included in GDP because they don't represent new production. The car was already produced in 1957, so its sale now doesn't add to current production. So, this might be a candidate for having no effect on GDP.\n\nOption B: The Department of Transportation repaves a road. That sounds like a government service, and it involves producing something\u2014repairing infrastructure. Government spending on goods and services is part of GDP. So, this should affect GDP.\n\nOption C: Your friends make a music CD that doesn't sell any copies. So, they've produced something, but it hasn't been sold. GDP measures the value of final goods and services produced and sold in the economy. If nothing is sold, it might not be counted in GDP, especially if it's not intended for the market. However, I'm a bit unsure here because if it's a homemade CD not intended for sale, it might not be included in GDP. But if it's produced with the intention of selling but just didn't sell, it might be considered as inventory investment. Hmm, this one is tricky.\n\nOption D: A college buys computers. That seems like a purchase of new goods by a business. Investment in equipment by businesses is part of GDP. So, this should affect GDP.\n\nComparing all these, option A seems to have no effect on GDP because it's a transaction of a used good, and GDP doesn't include used goods sales. Options B and D clearly involve new production and government spending, which are components of GDP. Option C is ambiguous, but since the CD wasn't sold, it might not affect GDP, but perhaps it does in some way.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. GDP is composed of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Let's see:\n\n- Option A: Used car sale\u2014doesn't fit into any of these categories directly, as it's not new production.\n\n- Option B: Government repaving a road\u2014that's government spending on services, which is part of GDP.\n\n- Option C: Friends making a CD but not selling it\u2014this is probably not included in GDP because there's no market transaction. It might be considered part of household production, but typically, GDP only includes market activities.\n\n- Option D: College buying computers\u2014this is investment by businesses, which is part of GDP.\n\nSo, between options A and C, both might not affect GDP, but let's see which one is more accurate.\n\nIn option A, even though it's a used car, the transaction itself doesn't add to current production. However, in some cases, used goods sales might have indirect effects, like commissions for dealers, which could be part of GDP. But generally, used goods sales aren't considered part of GDP.\n\nIn option C, if the CD was made but not sold, and it's not intended for the market, it might not be included in GDP. It's similar to household production, which isn't counted in GDP.\n\nBut the question is which event has no effect on GDP. Both A and C seem to have little to no effect, but perhaps the question wants the one that most clearly has no effect.\n\nMaybe option A is better because it's a direct transaction of a used good, which is explicitly not included in GDP, while option C might have some indirect effects if, for example, the friends used materials that were purchased, which would have been part of consumption and thus GDP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the production of the CD, even if not sold, is considered in some way, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to recall that GDP measures market value of final goods and services produced in a given period. So, if the CD was produced but not sold, it might be considered as unsold inventory, which would be counted as investment in GDP.\n\nOh, that's interesting. So, even if the CD wasn't sold, the production of the CD might still be counted in GDP as part of investment, specifically as changes in inventories.\n\nTherefore, option C might actually have an effect on GDP because the production of the CD is part of GDP, even if it doesn't sell any copies.\n\nOn the other hand, option A is a transaction of a used good, which isn't part of current production, so it shouldn't affect GDP.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: You buy a 1957 Chevy from a friend.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other effects.\n\nFor example, in option A, maybe there are fees involved in the transaction, like registration fees or broker fees if there was a broker. Those fees would be part of GDP. But assuming it's a direct sale between friends without any intermediaries, then those fees might not be present.\n\nSimilarly, in option C, if the friends used materials that they had to buy, those purchases would have been already counted in consumption, and the production of the CD might be counted as investment in the form of unsold inventory.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that option A has the least effect on GDP, perhaps no effect if we assume no intermediary services are involved.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
