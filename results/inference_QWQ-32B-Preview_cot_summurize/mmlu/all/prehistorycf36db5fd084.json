                    "text": "I'm trying to understand why the discovery of Homo naledi is causing so much debate among scientists. I know that fossils of this species were found in a place called the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa, and that these fossils show a mix of different physical traits, which is referred to as a \"mosaic of hominid traits.\" But what exactly is making this discovery controversial?\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. There are already two well-known species of Homo, and it's unlikely there were more than two species at one time.\n\nI think this might be referring to the idea that during any given time period in human evolution, there were probably only one or two species of Homo around. The discovery of Homo naledi might be challenging this notion if it suggests that multiple species coexisted at the same time. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nB. Paleoanthropologists didn't make the discovery, and it was found in an inaccessible cave in South Africa.\n\nThis seems a bit off. First, paleoanthropologists are the scientists who study human evolution, so it's likely that they were involved in the discovery and analysis of the fossils. Also, the location being inaccessible might make the discovery more intriguing, but it doesn't necessarily make it controversial.\n\nC. There is, as yet, no firm date that can be applied to the specimens.\n\nThis is an interesting point. Dating fossils is crucial in understanding their place in human evolution. If we don't know how old the Homo naledi fossils are, it's hard to place them accurately in the evolutionary timeline. This uncertainty could indeed be a source of controversy.\n\nD. The Homo naledi fossils have been shown to pre-date the earliest known hominid fossils by millions of years.\n\nWait a minute, if Homo naledi fossils are found to be older than the earliest known hominids, that would be groundbreaking but also potentially controversial because it would require a significant revision of our understanding of human evolution. However, I don't recall reading anything about Homo naledi being that old.\n\nLet me think about this again. Option A suggests that there were probably only two species of Homo at any given time, and the discovery of Homo naledi might be controversial because it suggests there were more species around at the same time. That does make sense, as the more species we find, the more complex the evolutionary tree becomes.\n\nOption B seems less plausible because the involvement of paleoanthropologists and the location of the find shouldn't inherently make the discovery controversial.\n\nOption C is definitely a valid point. Without a firm date, it's hard to integrate Homo naledi into the evolutionary narrative. This uncertainty could lead to debates among scientists.\n\nOption D is intriguing but seems unlikely, as our current understanding is that the earliest known hominids date back around 6 million years, and I don't think Homo naledi is thought to be that old.\n\nPerhaps the controversy stems from a combination of these factors, but if I had to choose one, I would go with option C: there is, as yet, no firm date that can be applied to the specimens. Dating is crucial in paleoanthropology, and without it, interpretations can vary widely.\n\nBut let me double-check. I recall that when Homo naledi was first discovered, dating was indeed a challenge because the fossils were found in a cave context that complicated the usual dating methods. So, yes, the lack of a definitive date is a significant issue that has contributed to the controversy surrounding this species.\n\nAdditionally, the mosaic of traits exhibited by Homo naledi is also problematic because it combines features seen in both early and late Homo species, making it difficult to place phylogenetically without a clear date.\n\nSo, while option A might be a factor, I think the primary controversy stems from the uncertainty in dating the fossils, as indicated in option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
