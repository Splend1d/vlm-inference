                    "text": "In Jainism, the cycle that one must liberate oneself from is Samsara. Samsara refers to the continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. The ultimate goal in Jainism is to achieve Moksha, which is liberation from this cycle and the attainment of eternal bliss and freedom from suffering. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Samsara.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Punya** (Option A) refers to merit or good karma, which is accumulated through virtuous actions. While punya is important in Jainism as it can lead to better rebirths, it does not represent the cycle one needs to liberate from.\n\n- **Samayika** (Option C) is a Jain practice of achieving a state of equanimity and focusing on the self for a period of time, often 48 minutes. It is a form of meditation and is an important part of spiritual discipline but is not the cycle to be liberated from.\n\n- **Jiva** (Option D) refers to a soul or living being. In Jainism, jivas are considered to be infinite in number and are distinct from the physical body. Jivas can be liberated from samsara by achieving moksha.\n\nSo, among the options provided, Samsara is the cycle that Jains seek to transcend through their spiritual practices and ethical living."
