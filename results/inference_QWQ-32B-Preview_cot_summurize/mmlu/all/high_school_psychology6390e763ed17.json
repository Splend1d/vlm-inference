A. food, B. water, C. money, D. sex.\" I need to pick one, but I'm a bit unsure about what a secondary reinforcer is. I remember that in psychology, especially in behaviorism, reinforcers are stimuli that increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring again. There are primary reinforcers and secondary reinforcers.\n\nPrimary reinforcers are things that are naturally rewarding, like food and water, because they satisfy basic biological needs. Sex might also be considered a primary reinforcer since it's related to reproduction and survival. So that leaves money. I think money is a secondary reinforcer because it doesn't have intrinsic value in terms of satisfying a biological need, but it can be exchanged for things that do, like food and shelter.\n\nWait, but maybe sex is different. While it does have biological underpinnings, in some contexts, it might be conditioned to have other meanings or values. But I think fundamentally, it's a primary reinforcer.\n\nSo, food, water, and sex seem like primary reinforcers, and money seems like a secondary reinforcer because its value is learned through its association with other rewards.\n\nLet me double-check. Secondary reinforcers are stimuli that acquire their reinforcing properties through association with primary reinforcers. For example, money isn't inherently satisfying, but we learn that we can use it to buy food, water, shelter, and other things that satisfy our needs. So, money is a secondary reinforcer.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. money.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Food: Primary reinforcer, as it satisfies hunger.\n\nB. Water: Primary reinforcer, as it quenches thirst.\n\nC. Money: Secondary reinforcer, as its value is learned.\n\nD. Sex: Primary reinforcer, as it relates to reproduction and pleasure.\n\nSo, yes, money is the secondary reinforcer in this list.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
