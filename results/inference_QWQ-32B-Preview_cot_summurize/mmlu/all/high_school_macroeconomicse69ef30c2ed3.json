I need to figure out what happens to aggregate demand, output, and the price level in the short run when the government implements contractionary monetary policy.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what contractionary monetary policy is. It's when the central bank reduces the money supply in the economy to curb inflation or slow down economic growth. They do this by selling government securities, raising reserve requirements, or increasing the discount rate.\n\nOkay, so if the central bank reduces the money supply, that should affect aggregate demand. Aggregate demand is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time and price level. It's made up of consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\nWhen the money supply decreases, it becomes more expensive to borrow money because interest rates rise. Higher interest rates discourage borrowing and spending, which should lead to a decrease in consumption and investment. As a result, aggregate demand should decrease.\n\nSo, aggregate demand decreases. That matches with option C and D, but not A and B, which say aggregate demand increases. So, I can eliminate A and B.\n\nNow, what happens to output? Output is the total production of goods and services in an economy, often represented by real GDP.\n\nIn the short run, if aggregate demand decreases, and assuming aggregate supply remains the same, the equilibrium output should also decrease. This is because firms sell less due to lower demand, so they produce less.\n\nSo, output decreases. That aligns with option C and D, but not A and B, which again say output increases. So, sticking with C and D.\n\nFinally, what happens to the price level? The price level is a measure of the average prices of goods and services in an economy.\n\nIf aggregate demand decreases while aggregate supply remains the same, the equilibrium price level should also decrease. This is because there's less demand pushing up prices.\n\nSo, price level decreases. That matches with option D, which says decreases for all three: aggregate demand, output, and price level.\n\nOption C says aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, but price level increases. That doesn't make sense in this scenario because if both aggregate demand and supply are decreasing, the effect on price level depends on which one decreases more. But in standard short-run analysis, with aggregate supply curve assumed to be upward sloping but not vertical, a decrease in aggregate demand leads to a lower price level.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the aggregate supply curve. In the short run, we usually have an upward sloping aggregate supply curve, reflecting that firms can increase production up to a point, but beyond that, they need to hire more resources at higher prices, leading to higher prices.\n\nSo, if aggregate demand decreases, the new equilibrium would be at a lower price level and lower output.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any scenario where price level increases when aggregate demand decreases. Maybe if aggregate supply decreases significantly at the same time, but the question is specifically about contractionary monetary policy affecting aggregate demand, not supply.\n\nUnless there are other factors affecting aggregate supply, I think the standard analysis applies here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, and price level decreases.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check this. Let me think about the transmission mechanism again.\n\nContractionary monetary policy reduces the money supply, which leads to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates discourage investment and consumption, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand.\n\nWith aggregate demand decreasing, and if we assume short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping, the new equilibrium will have lower price level and lower output.\n\nSo, yes, option D seems correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some cases, like when economy is near full capacity, a decrease in aggregate demand might not lead to a decrease in price level immediately, but in general, in the short run, it should.\n\nAlso, maybe I should consider the liquidity effect. When money supply decreases, it becomes scarcer, driving up interest rates, which further reduces spending.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that lower money supply leads to less spending, which reduces demand for goods and services, firms may lower prices to sell their output, leading to a decrease in price level.\n\nSo, overall, it seems consistent that all three decrease.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about what other options might suggest.\n\nOption A: aggregate demand increases, output increases, price level increases. This would be expansionary monetary policy, not contractionary.\n\nOption B: aggregate demand increases, output increases, price level decreases. This doesn't make sense because if aggregate demand increases, price level should increase, not decrease, unless there's a significant increase in aggregate supply.\n\nOption C: aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, price level increases. This would require that aggregate supply decreases more than aggregate demand, which isn't the case here, as we're only talking about contractionary monetary policy affecting demand.\n\nTherefore, the only logically consistent option is D: aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, price level decreases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
