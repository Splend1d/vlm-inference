                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three statements about a nonempty subset \\( K \\) of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), where \\( n > 1 \\). We need to determine which of these statements must be true.\n\n**Statement I:** If \\( K \\) is compact, then every continuous real-valued function defined on \\( K \\) is bounded.\n\nI recall that in real analysis, one of the key properties of compact sets is that continuous functions on them are bounded and attain their supremum and infimum. So, if \\( K \\) is compact, and \\( f: K \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) is continuous, then \\( f \\) should indeed be bounded. This seems true.\n\n**Statement II:** If every continuous real-valued function defined on \\( K \\) is bounded, then \\( K \\) is compact.\n\nThis is the converse of Statement I. I need to think about whether this is always true. In metric spaces, like \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded (Heine-Borel theorem). So, if every continuous function on \\( K \\) is bounded, does that imply \\( K \\) is compact?\n\nLet me consider the contrapositive: if \\( K \\) is not compact, then there exists a continuous real-valued function on \\( K \\) that is unbounded. Since \\( K \\) is a subset of \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), which is a metric space, \\( K \\) is not compact if it is either not closed or not bounded.\n\nSuppose \\( K \\) is not bounded. Then, the identity function \\( f(x) = x \\) would be unbounded, but since \\( f \\) maps to \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\), and we're considering real-valued functions, maybe I need to think of a different function. For example, \\( f(x) = \\|x\\| \\), the norm of \\( x \\), would be unbounded if \\( K \\) is unbounded.\n\nSo, if \\( K \\) is not bounded, there exists a continuous real-valued function (like \\( f(x) = \\|x\\| \\)) that is unbounded. Therefore, if every continuous real-valued function on \\( K \\) is bounded, then \\( K \\) must be bounded.\n\nNow, what if \\( K \\) is bounded but not closed? Can we find a continuous real-valued function on \\( K \\) that is unbounded in this case?\n\nConsider \\( K = (0,1) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\). This is bounded but not closed. The function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is continuous on \\( K \\) but unbounded. Similarly, in higher dimensions, if \\( K \\) is bounded but not closed, there might be points on the boundary that are not in \\( K \\), and functions can blow up as we approach those points.\n\nTherefore, if every continuous real-valued function on \\( K \\) is bounded, \\( K \\) must be closed and bounded, hence compact. So, Statement II seems to be true.\n\n**Statement III:** If \\( K \\) is compact, then \\( K \\) is connected.\n\nI know that compactness does not imply connectedness. For example, in \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), the set \\( [0,1] \\cup [2,3] \\) is compact (closed and bounded) but not connected. Similarly, in higher dimensions, you can have compact sets that are not connected.\n\nSo, Statement III is false.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct choice should be D. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
