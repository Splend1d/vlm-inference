                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about point mutations and their potential lack of impact on proteins. So, we're looking at how a change in a single nucleotide in DNA might not necessarily mess things up when it comes to the protein that's made from that DNA sequence.\n\nFirst off, it's important to remember that DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into protein. Proteins are made up of amino acids, and each amino acid is specified by a triplet of nucleotides called a codon.\n\nOption A says that the first codon of a gene is always AUG, which is a leader sequence, and that a mutation in that sequence will have no effect on the protein produced. Now, AUG is indeed the start codon, coding for methionine, and it's crucial for initiating protein synthesis. If you mutate the start codon, it could potentially prevent the protein from being made at all, which would be a big negative impact. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B states that several codons code for the same amino acid. This is referring to the redundancy of the genetic code. For example, both GUU and GUC code for valine. So, if you have a point mutation that changes one of these codons to another that codes for the same amino acid, the protein sequence won't change at all. This is known as a synonymous mutation. So, this could definitely explain how a point mutation has no negative impact on the protein.\n\nOption C mentions that DNA polymerase and DNA ligase carry out excision repair before transcription. While it's true that these enzymes are involved in DNA replication and repair, the process of excision repair happens to fix damages in DNA, not specifically to correct point mutations before transcription. Moreover, transcription can occur at any time, not just after replication. So, this seems a bit off.\n\nOption D says that RNA processing will repair point mutations before mRNA leaves the nucleus. RNA processing includes splicing, capping, and tailing, but it doesn't include mechanisms to repair mutations in the mRNA sequence itself. There are proofreading mechanisms during transcription, but they're not specifically for repairing point mutations. So, this doesn't sound accurate.\n\nComparing all these options, option B seems to be the most plausible explanation for how a point mutation can have no negative impact on the protein formed from a DNA sequence. It directly relates to the concept of codon redundancy in the genetic code.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
