Images produced by concave mirrors are always real.\n\nC. Images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual.\n\nD. Images produced by convex mirrors can be both real and virtual.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about optics and how different types of lenses and mirrors form images.\n\nStarting with concave lenses (option A). Concave lenses are diverging lenses, which means they spread out the light rays that pass through them. I think that images formed by concave lenses are virtual because the light rays appear to come from a point behind the lens, but no actual convergence of rays happens on the other side. So, I don't think images produced by concave lenses are always real. Maybe option A is false.\n\nNext, concave mirrors (option B). Concave mirrors can produce both real and virtual images depending on the position of the object. If the object is beyond the focal point, the image is real and inverted. If the object is between the focal point and the mirror, the image is virtual and upright. So, images produced by concave mirrors are not always real. Option B seems false.\n\nNow, convex lenses (option C). Convex lenses are converging lenses, which means they bring light rays together. Depending on the object's position, convex lenses can produce both real and virtual images. For example, if the object is beyond the focal point, the image is real and inverted. If the object is between the focal point and the lens, the image is virtual and upright, like in a magnifying glass. So, option C seems true.\n\nLastly, convex mirrors (option D). Convex mirrors are diverging mirrors, similar to concave lenses. They also produce virtual images because the light rays appear to come from a point behind the mirror. I don't think convex mirrors can produce real images. So, option D seems false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I believe that option C is the correct statement: Images produced by convex lenses can be both real and virtual.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
