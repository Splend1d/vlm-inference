                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about the epidemiology of Anorexia Nervosa is correct. So, I have four options here:\n\nA. Females are three times more affected than males.\n\nB. It never happens in children or postmenopausal women.\n\nC. Males from any socioeconomic background can be affected.\n\nD. Prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents.\n\nFirst, I know that Anorexia Nervosa is more common in females, but I'm not sure about the exact ratio compared to males. I think it's higher than three times. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nOption B says it never happens in children or postmenopausal women. That seems too absolute. I've heard of cases in teenagers, so maybe it does affect children, or at least adolescents. And what about postmenopausal women? Is that possible?\n\nOption C mentions that males from any socioeconomic background can be affected. That sounds plausible, but I need to confirm if socioeconomic status plays a role in Anorexia Nervosa.\n\nOption D states that prevalence rates are 2% for female adolescents. I think I've read something about prevalence rates, but I don't remember the exact percentage. Maybe it's around there.\n\nLet me start by considering option A. I recall that Anorexia Nervosa is more prevalent in females, but I'm not sure about the exact ratio. I think it might be higher than three times more common. Maybe I should check some statistics.\n\nUpon checking, I find that Anorexia Nervosa is indeed more common in females, but the ratio can vary. Some studies suggest that it is about 10 times more common in females than in males, but other sources mention a lower ratio. So, saying three times more affected might not be accurate. Therefore, option A might not be the correct answer.\n\nNow, option B claims that it never happens in children or postmenopausal women. That seems unlikely because Anorexia Nervosa can affect people of different ages, including children and older women. I've read about cases in adolescents, who are still considered children, and there might be cases in postmenopausal women as well, although it might be less common. So, this statement seems too absolute and probably incorrect.\n\nOption C says that males from any socioeconomic background can be affected. That sounds reasonable because eating disorders like Anorexia Nervosa can affect individuals regardless of their socioeconomic status. It's not limited to a particular group. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D mentions a prevalence rate of 2% for female adolescents. I need to verify this. Prevalence rates can vary depending on the population and the study, but I recall that Anorexia Nervosa is relatively rare, with prevalence rates typically below 1% in the general population. In female adolescents, it might be higher, but 2% seems a bit high. Maybe it's closer to 0.5-1%. So, this option might not be accurate.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the most correct statement among the given options. It acknowledges that males can be affected and that socioeconomic background does not limit who can develop Anorexia Nervosa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
