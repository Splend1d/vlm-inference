I need to figure out the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants the number of positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40. In other words, it's asking for the common factors of 120 and 40.\n\nOne way to approach this is to list all the factors of 120 and all the factors of 40, and then find the intersection of these two sets, i.e., the numbers that appear in both lists.\n\nLet's start by finding all the factors of 120.\n\n120 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let's list its factors:\n\n1. 1 and 120 (since 1*120=120)\n\n2. 2 and 60 (since 2*60=120)\n\n3. 3 and 40 (since 3*40=120)\n\n4. 4 and 30 (since 4*30=120)\n\n5. 5 and 24 (since 5*24=120)\n\n6. 6 and 20 (since 6*20=120)\n\n7. 8 and 15 (since 8*15=120)\n\n8. 10 and 12 (since 10*12=120)\n\nSo, the factors of 120 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nNow, let's find all the factors of 40.\n\n40 is also even, so divisible by 2. Let's list its factors:\n\n1. 1 and 40 (since 1*40=40)\n\n2. 2 and 20 (since 2*20=40)\n\n3. 4 and 10 (since 4*10=40)\n\n4. 5 and 8 (since 5*8=40)\n\nSo, the factors of 40 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nNow, I need to find the common factors, which are the numbers that appear in both lists.\n\nLooking at the factors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.\n\nAnd the factors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nThe common factors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nCounting these, there are 8 common factors.\n\nSo, the answer should be 8, which is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother way to find the common factors of two numbers is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers and then find the number of factors of that GCD.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the GCD of 120 and 40.\n\n120 divided by 40 is 3 with a remainder of 0, so GCD(120, 40) is 40.\n\nNow, find all the factors of 40, which we already did: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nSo, again, there are 8 factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 8, option B.\n\nBut the options include A.4, which might make one wonder if there's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the number of positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40, which is the same as the number of common factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's interpreted as the number of positive integers that divide both 120 and 40, which again is the number of common factors.\n\nIn any case, both approaches lead to the same conclusion that there are 8 common factors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
