                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"What is the shortest distance between the y-axis and the point (2, 7)?\"\n\nLet me see. The options are A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 7.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The y-axis is the vertical line where x=0 on the coordinate plane. The point given is (2,7), which is 2 units to the right of the y-axis and 7 units above the x-axis.\n\nSo, the shortest distance between a point and a line is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line. In this case, since the y-axis is a vertical line, the perpendicular distance from the point (2,7) to the y-axis would be horizontal, directly left to the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the distance should be the absolute value of the x-coordinate of the point, because that's how far it is from the y-axis.\n\nSo, for the point (2,7), the x-coordinate is 2. Therefore, the distance is |2| = 2.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Is there a formula for the distance from a point to a line? Yeah, the general formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to a line ax + by + c = 0 is:\n\nDistance = |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2)\n\nBut in this case, the y-axis is the line x=0, which can be written as 1x + 0y + 0 = 0.\n\nSo, a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nDistance = |1*2 + 0*7 + 0| / sqrt(1^2 + 0^2) = |2| / sqrt(1) = 2 / 1 = 2.\n\nOkay, that matches my initial thought.\n\nAlternatively, since the y-axis is a vertical line, the shortest distance is simply the horizontal distance, which is the absolute value of the x-coordinate.\n\nSo, distance = |2| = 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nBut let's make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nWait, maybe using the distance formula between the point (2,7) and a point on the y-axis. Let's say I take a general point on the y-axis as (0, y), and find the distance between (2,7) and (0,y), then minimize that distance.\n\nThe distance formula is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\nSo, distance = sqrt((0 - 2)^2 + (y - 7)^2) = sqrt(4 + (y - 7)^2).\n\nTo minimize this distance, I need to minimize the expression under the square root, which is 4 + (y - 7)^2.\n\nThe minimum value of (y - 7)^2 is 0, when y = 7.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance is sqrt(4 + 0) = sqrt(4) = 2.\n\nAgain, I get the same answer, 2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it graphically. If I plot the point (2,7) and draw a perpendicular from it to the y-axis, since the y-axis is vertical, the perpendicular will be horizontal, directly left to the y-axis, landing at the point (0,7).\n\nThe distance between (2,7) and (0,7) is simply 2 units.\n\nSo, no matter which way I look at it, the answer is 2.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 7\n\nThe correct choice is B. 2.\n\nI don't see how the other options make sense in this context. Option D, 7, is the y-coordinate, which is the distance from the x-axis, not the y-axis.\n\nOption C, 3, is just wrong.\n\nOption A, 1, is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer is B. 2.\n\nI think that's pretty much it. I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
