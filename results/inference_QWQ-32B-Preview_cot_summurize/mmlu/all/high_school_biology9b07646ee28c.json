I need to figure out which one doesn't secrete digestive enzymes.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what digestive enzymes are. Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions, and digestive enzymes specifically help break down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. So, they're crucial for digestion.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with the mouth. I know that when we chew food, saliva is secreted by salivary glands. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase, which starts breaking down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. So, the mouth does secrete digestive enzymes.\n\nNext is the stomach. The stomach secretes gastric juice, which contains several enzymes like pepsin, which helps break down proteins. So, definitely, the stomach secretes digestive enzymes.\n\nNow, the gall bladder. I remember that the gall bladder stores bile produced by the liver. Bile helps emulsify fats, making them easier to digest, but I'm not sure if bile contains digestive enzymes. I think bile is more of a detergent that helps break down fats into smaller droplets, but the actual breakdown of fats into fatty acids and glycerol is done by lipase, which is secreted by the pancreas and small intestine. So, maybe the gall bladder doesn't secrete digestive enzymes itself.\n\nFinally, the small intestine. The small intestine is a major site for digestion, and it secretes various enzymes that break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Also, pancreatic juice, which contains digestive enzymes, is delivered to the small intestine via the pancreatic duct.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like the gall bladder might be the organ that doesn't secrete digestive enzymes. It stores bile, which aids in digestion but doesn't contain enzymes.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check about bile and see if it contains any enzymes.\n\nI know that bile primarily consists of bile salts, which help emulsify fats, and also bilirubin and other components, but I don't think it contains digestive enzymes. The actual breakdown of fats is handled by lipase from the pancreas and small intestine.\n\nSimilarly, in the mouth, saliva has amylase; in the stomach, gastric juice has pepsin and other enzymes; and in the small intestine, there are numerous enzymes for breaking down different nutrients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be the gall bladder, as it doesn't secrete digestive enzymes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
