I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I added a sprinkle of spit to all of the coffees I made.\" Okay, so this is about contaminating drinks with saliva. Generally, in the US, it's considered disrespectful and unhygienic to spit in someone's food or drink. It's a violation of personal space and can be seen as malicious or vindictive. So, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"I told the authorities about the missing girl mainly because I knew her folks were distraught.\" This one is about reporting a missing person to the authorities, motivated by the distress of the family. Reporting a missing person is usually a good thing; it can help in finding the person and ensuring their safety. The motivation here is that the family is distraught, which seems empathetic. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the first scenario, adding spit to coffee is clearly inappropriate and could be considered harmful or at least disgusting. It doesn't respect the other person's space or health.\n\nIn the second scenario, reporting a missing person is a responsible action. The motivation is to help the family, which is a positive thing. There doesn't seem to be any moral wrongdoing here.\n\nYeah, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
