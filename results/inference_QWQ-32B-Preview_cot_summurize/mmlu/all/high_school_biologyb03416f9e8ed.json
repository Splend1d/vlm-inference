                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Turner's syndrome and hemophilia. It says that females with Turner's syndrome have a high incidence of hemophilia, which is a recessive, X-linked trait. I need to infer something about their chromosome composition based on that.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Turner's syndrome is. I think it's a condition where a female has only one X chromosome instead of two. So, typically, females have XX, but in Turner's, it's XO, meaning they have only one X and no second X.\n\nNow, hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder. That means it's located on the X chromosome, and since it's recessive, a female would need to have two copies of the recessive gene to express the disease. But in Turner's syndrome, females have only one X chromosome. So, how can they have hemophilia if they only have one X?\n\nWait, but the question says they have a high incidence of hemophilia. So, if they only have one X, and hemophilia is recessive, does that mean that their single X has the hemophilia gene? But in regular females, they have two X's, so they'd need both to have the hemophilia gene to express it, or just one if it's dominant, but it's recessive.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. have an extra X chromosome\n\nB. have an extra Y chromosome\n\nC. lack an X chromosome\n\nD. have red blood cells that clump\n\nOkay, so option A says they have an extra X chromosome. But I thought Turner's is XO, meaning they lack an X, not have an extra one.\n\nOption B, have an extra Y chromosome. That sounds like Klinefelter's syndrome or something else, not Turner's.\n\nOption C, lack an X chromosome, which aligns with what I think Turner's is.\n\nOption D, have red blood cells that clump, I don't think that's related to chromosome issues directly.\n\nBut the question is about inferring based on the high incidence of hemophilia. So, if they have a high incidence of hemophilia, and hemophilia is X-linked recessive, and they have only one X, then does that mean that their one X has the hemophilia gene?\n\nWait, but in regular females, they have two X's, so to express hemophilia, which is recessive, they need two copies of the recessive gene. But in Turner's, with only one X, if that X has the hemophilia gene, would they express it?\n\nI think so, because there's no second X to potentially have a dominant normal gene. So, with only one X, if it has the hemophilia gene, they would express the disease.\n\nBut the question says they have a high incidence of hemophilia, based on this information, it can be inferred that females with this condition...\n\nWell, if they have only one X, and that X has the hemophilia gene, then they would have hemophilia. So, the high incidence suggests that in Turner's syndrome, there's a higher chance that their single X has the hemophilia gene.\n\nBut why would that be? Is there something about Turner's syndrome that makes it more likely for the X they have to carry the hemophilia gene?\n\nMaybe not directly. Perhaps it's just that, since they only have one X, if that X has the hemophilia gene, they will express it, whereas in regular females with two X's, they'd need both to have the gene to express it.\n\nSo, perhaps the incidence seems higher because any female with Turner's and the hemophilia gene on their X will express it, whereas in the general female population, only those with two copies of the recessive gene will express it.\n\nBut the question seems to be suggesting that there's something about the chromosome composition that leads to a higher incidence of hemophilia in Turner's syndrome females.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. have an extra X chromosome - that would be like Klinefelter's, which is not Turner's.\n\nB. have an extra Y chromosome - again, not Turner's.\n\nC. lack an X chromosome - that aligns with Turner's syndrome.\n\nD. have red blood cells that clump - that doesn't seem relevant.\n\nSo, based on the information, it seems like the inference is that females with Turner's syndrome lack an X chromosome.\n\nBut wait, if they lack an X chromosome, how does that relate to the high incidence of hemophilia? If they lack an X, does that mean they have only one X, so if that X has the hemophilia gene, they express it?\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the inference is that they lack an X chromosome, meaning they have only one X, and if that X has the hemophilia gene, they will have hemophilia.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. lack an X chromosome.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nOption A says have an extra X chromosome. That would be like XXX, which is a different condition, and not related to Turner's.\n\nOption B, have an extra Y chromosome, which would be like XY, which is male, or XXY, which is Klinefelter's, again not Turner's.\n\nOption D, have red blood cells that clump, that sounds more like sickle cell anemia or something, not related to chromosome issues.\n\nSo, yes, the correct inference is that females with Turner's syndrome lack an X chromosome, which leads to them having only one X, and thus, if that X has the hemophilia gene, they will express the disease, leading to a higher incidence of hemophilia in this population.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
