                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. Umi has created a number pattern by adding the same amount each time to get the next number. The sequence given is 20, 40, 60, 80, and it continues in this manner. We need to find the eighth number in this pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern. It starts at 20 and each subsequent number is obtained by adding 20 to the previous one. So, the common difference is 20.\n\nLet's list out the terms to see the pattern clearly:\n\n1st term: 20\n\n2nd term: 40\n\n3rd term: 60\n\n4th term: 80\n\n5th term: 100\n\n6th term: 120\n\n7th term: 140\n\n8th term: 160\n\nWait, but the options include 160, 240, 320, and 640. According to my calculation, the eighth term is 160, which is option A.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is to use the formula:\n\nnth term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference\n\nIn this case, the first term (a) is 20, the common difference (d) is 20, and we need to find the eighth term, so n = 8.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n8th term = 20 + (8 - 1) * 20\n\n= 20 + 7 * 20\n\n= 20 + 140\n\n= 160\n\nSo, again, I get 160 as the eighth term.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if the pattern starts at zero or if there's a different indexing. Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is clearly starting with the first term as 20, and each subsequent term increases by 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is multiplying by 2 each time, but that doesn't match the given sequence. Let's check:\n\n20 * 2 = 40\n\n40 * 2 = 80\n\n80 * 2 = 160\n\n160 * 2 = 320\n\nSo, if it were a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2, the sequence would be 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, etc.\n\nBut the given sequence is 20, 40, 60, 80, which is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 20.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to use the arithmetic sequence formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about exponents, but that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. 160\n\nB. 240\n\nC. 320\n\nD. 640\n\nIf it were a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2, then:\n\n1st term: 20\n\n2nd term: 40\n\n3rd term: 80\n\n4th term: 160\n\n5th term: 320\n\n6th term: 640\n\n7th term: 1280\n\n8th term: 2560\n\nBut that doesn't match the given sequence of 20, 40, 60, 80.\n\nWait, in the geometric sequence approach, the third term would be 80, which doesn't match the given third term of 60 in the original sequence.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is indeed arithmetic, not geometric.\n\nSo, sticking with the arithmetic sequence formula, the eighth term is 160.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options. Maybe I need to consider a different starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the common difference is not 20 but something else.\n\nLooking back at the sequence: 20, 40, 60, 80,...\n\nThe difference between each term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, the eighth term should be 20 + 7*20 = 160.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence is defined differently, but based on the given terms, it's clearly arithmetic with a common difference of 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by multiplying by 2 every time, but as we saw, that doesn't fit the given terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the term \"eighth number.\"\n\nWait, let's count the terms:\n\n1st: 20\n\n2nd: 40\n\n3rd: 60\n\n4th: 80\n\n5th: 100\n\n6th: 120\n\n7th: 140\n\n8th: 160\n\nSo, the eighth term is 160.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence starts with 0, but that doesn't make sense because the first term is given as 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the common difference is increasing by a certain amount each time, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the sequence is actually geometric, but based on the given terms, it's arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about something else entirely, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven all this, I think the correct answer is 160, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
