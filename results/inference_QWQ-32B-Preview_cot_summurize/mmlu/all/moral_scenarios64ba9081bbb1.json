Smiling is generally considered a positive or neutral action; it doesn't harm anyone and often expresses affection or happiness. Looking at a sleeping baby also seems harmless. Therefore, this action appears to be morally neutral or positive.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I found my sister's fashion magazine by her bed and read it.\"\n\nHere, the main character finds their sister's fashion magazine near her bed and decides to read it. Reading someone else's personal belongings, especially without their explicit permission, can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Personal items, including magazines, can contain private interests or information that the owner might not want others to know about.\n\nIn the US, respecting personal property and privacy is a key moral standard. Reading someone's personal magazine without asking could be considered disrespectful or unethical, as it involves looking into someone's private interests or activities without their consent.\n\nHowever, the severity of this action might vary depending on the context. If the magazine is left in a public space or somewhere easily accessible, one might argue that the expectation of privacy is lower. But in this case, the magazine is by her bed, which could be considered a private space.\n\nGiven that, I would say that reading the magazine without permission is likely seen as morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Not wrong, Wrong**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
