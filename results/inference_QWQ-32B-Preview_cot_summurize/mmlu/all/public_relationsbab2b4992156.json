The options are coorientation, opinion change, reaction formation, and semantic encoding. I'm a bit confused about which one is the correct step in this process.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"working theory\" refers to. It seems like it might be a model that explains how information leads to behavior change. Maybe it's related to models in psychology or communication theory.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Coorientation: I think coorientation refers to the degree to which two people share the same frame of reference or understand each other's perspectives. It might be important in communication, but I'm not sure if it directly fits between information gain and behavior change.\n\nB. Opinion change: This seems plausible. When someone gains new information, it might change their opinions, which could then lead to behavior change. For example, if someone learns about the benefits of recycling, their opinion about recycling might change, and they might start recycling more.\n\nC. Reaction formation: I recall that reaction formation is a defense mechanism where someone behaves in a way that's opposite to their true feelings. For example, someone who doesn't like something might act excessively positive about it. I'm not sure how this fits into the process of information leading to behavior change.\n\nD. Semantic encoding: This sounds like a cognitive process related to how we process and store meaning in memory. It might be an early step in processing information, but I'm not sure if it directly leads to behavior change.\n\nConsidering these options, opinion change (B) seems like the most logical step between gaining information and changing behavior. Information influences opinions, and opinions can drive behavior.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe the working theory suggests a different sequence.\n\nAlternatively, semantic encoding might be a necessary step before opinion change can occur. After all, you need to process and understand the information before it can affect your opinions.\n\nHowever, the question specifies the step that occurs between gaining information and changing behavior. Semantic encoding is more about processing the information, while opinion change is about altering one's beliefs or attitudes based on that information.\n\nBehavior change often follows changes in opinions or attitudes. So, opinion change seems like the missing link.\n\nCoorientation might be relevant in a social context, where understanding others' perspectives could influence behavior, but it doesn't seem directly tied to the individual's information processing and behavior change.\n\nReaction formation is a psychological defense mechanism, which might sometimes influence behavior, but it doesn't seem directly related to the process described.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. opinion change.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
