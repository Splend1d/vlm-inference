I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I told the 2-year-old toddler, 'Get out of here and never come back!'\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I spent the grocery money on weed.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Telling a 2-year-old toddler to \"get out of here and never come back!\" That seems pretty harsh. Toddlers are very young and vulnerable; they don't understand much, and they look up to adults for care and protection. Shouting at a toddler like that could be frightening and potentially harmful to their emotional development. In general, treating children with kindness and patience is considered morally right, so being abusive or threatening towards them would be wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Spending grocery money on weed. Assuming \"weed\" refers to marijuana, which was illegal federally in 2020, although some states had legalized it for medical or recreational use. But morally, spending money intended for necessities like groceries on something else, especially if it's for personal use and not for the family's needs, could be seen as wrong. It might prioritize personal desires over the well-being of others who rely on that money for food.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. In Scenario 1, it's about mistreating a child, and in Scenario 2, it's about misusing funds meant for essential needs.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the context a bit more. For Scenario 1, maybe the toddler was in a dangerous situation, and the adult was trying to protect them by shouting that command. However, even in dangerous situations, there are better ways to handle toddlers safely without threatening them. So, unless there's a specific context that justifies the action, it still seems wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, if the person spent the grocery money on weed for medical purposes and perhaps the family agreed to it, then it might be different. But based on the scenario presented, it seems like the person is spending the money on weed without any such justification, which would be wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, which corresponds to option A: Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
