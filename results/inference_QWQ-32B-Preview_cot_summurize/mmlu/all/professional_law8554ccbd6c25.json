                    "text": "So here's this situation: a salesman who's worked for the same company for 20 years gets fired out of the blue, and he thinks it's because of his age. So, he decides to sue the company for age discrimination. Now, at the trial, he wants to bring in an employee from the company to testify against the company. Specifically, he wants this employee to say that she was at a board meeting where the company's president supposedly said something like, \"The salesman is too old and doesn't fit the image we want our employees to project.\" \n\nMoreover, the company has a practice of taping all such board meetings, and it's standard procedure for the company's secretary to transcribe these tapes after the meetings. So, the company's attorney objects to this employee testifying about what was said at the meeting. The question is, should the employee's testimony be allowed or not? The options are:\n\nA. Admissible, because the employee was present during the board meeting.\n\nB. Admissible, because the president's statement was an admission by a company representative.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, the employee was present at the board meeting, so she has firsthand knowledge of what was said. That might make her testimony admissible under the hearsay exception for present sense impressions or something similar. But, there's a catch here because the company has a recording of the meeting, and transcriptions made from that recording.\n\nNow, the best evidence rule generally requires that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original item must be produced. The idea is that copies or oral testimony about the content may not be as reliable as the original.\n\nIn this case, the tape of the meeting would be the original recording of what was said, and the secretary's transcribed notes would be a written copy of that recording. So, if the salesman wants to prove what was said at the meeting, the best evidence would be the tape itself or the transcription.\n\nTherefore, allowing the employee to testify about what was said might violate the best evidence rule, especially since there are recorded and transcribed versions available.\n\nOption A says the testimony is admissible because the employee was present. While that's true, the best evidence rule might override that, making the testimony inadmissible.\n\nOption B says it's admissible because the president's statement is an admission by a company representative. That's correct; statements by company representatives can be admissions and thus admissible as an exception to hearsay. However, again, the best evidence rule might still apply.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible because the tape is the best evidence. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because the secretary's transcribed notes are the best evidence. This is similar to option C but refers to the transcription instead of the tape.\n\nGiven that the tape is the original recording and the transcription is a derivative, perhaps the tape is considered the best evidence. But transcriptions can also be considered reliable, especially if they're made accurately from the tape.\n\nI think the key here is that the tape recording is the most accurate reflection of what was said at the meeting. Allowing someone to testify from memory about what was said could introduce inaccuracies or biases.\n\nTherefore, the company's attorney would likely object on the grounds of the best evidence rule, arguing that the tape should be submitted instead of relying on the employee's memory.\n\nSo, between options C and D, I think C is a better answer because the tape is the original recording, whereas the transcription is a copy. The tape would capture not only the words but also the tone and any other auditory cues that might be relevant.\n\nHowever, in practice, both the tape and the transcription could be used, but perhaps the tape is considered more authoritative.\n\nWait, but the best evidence rule is about producing the original writing, recording, or photograph. In this case, the tape is the original recording, and the transcription is a derivative work.\n\nSo, if the salesman wants to prove what was said, the tape would be the best evidence. The employee's testimony would be secondary, relying on her memory, which could be less reliable.\n\nTherefore, the objection would likely be sustained, and the testimony would be held inadmissible because the tape is the best evidence.\n\nOption C seems to be the correct choice here.\n\nOption B might also have some merit because the president's statement is an admission, but the best evidence rule still applies to the content of the statement.\n\nSo, perhaps both B and C are relevant, but the best evidence rule takes precedence, making the testimony inadmissible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C: inadmissible, because the tape of the meeting is the best evidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
