                    "text": "So Mr. Lucci has 5 bags, and in each bag, there are 19 black pens and 12 red pens. We need to find out the total number of pens he put into all the bags combined.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We have 5 bags, each containing 19 black pens and 12 red pens. So, in each bag, the total number of pens is 19 + 12. That makes sense.\n\nNow, since there are 5 bags, each with 19 + 12 pens, the total number of pens should be 5 times (19 + 12). So, mathematically, that would be 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12).\n\nLet me just double-check that. If I calculate 19 + 12, that's 31 pens per bag. Then, 5 bags would have 5 \u00d7 31 = 155 pens in total.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Well, I could think about the black pens and the red pens separately. So, there are 5 bags with 19 black pens each, which is 5 \u00d7 19 = 95 black pens. And there are 5 bags with 12 red pens each, which is 5 \u00d7 12 = 60 red pens. Then, the total number of pens would be 95 + 60 = 155 pens.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same total I got earlier. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is good.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. (5 \u00d7 19) + 12\n\nB. 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12)\n\nC. 5 + (19 \u00d7 12)\n\nD. (5 + 19) \u00d7 12\n\nFrom my first approach, 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12) seems to be the correct expression, which is option B.\n\nBut let me see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: (5 \u00d7 19) + 12\n\nThis would be 5 times 19, which is 95, plus 12, which equals 107. But we know the total should be 155, so this is not correct.\n\nOption C: 5 + (19 \u00d7 12)\n\nFirst, 19 \u00d7 12 is 228, plus 5 is 233, which is not equal to 155.\n\nOption D: (5 + 19) \u00d7 12\n\nThat's 24 \u00d7 12, which is 288, again not 155.\n\nSo, only option B gives the correct total of 155 pens.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the distributive property, 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12) is equal to (5 \u00d7 19) + (5 \u00d7 12), which is what we calculated separately for black and red pens.\n\nTherefore, the expression that shows the total number of pens Mr. Lucci put into bags is 5 \u00d7 (19 + 12), which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
