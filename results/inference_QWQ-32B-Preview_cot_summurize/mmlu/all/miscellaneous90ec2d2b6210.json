So, including the base, there are five sides in total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. five.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the base:** The base of the pyramid is a square, which is a four-sided polygon.\n2. **Identify the lateral faces:** A square-based pyramid has four triangular faces that connect the base to the apex.\n3. **Count the total number of faces:** The base is one face, and there are four lateral faces, making a total of five faces.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid:**\n\n- **Counting only the lateral faces:** Some might think there are only four sides by considering only the triangular faces and forgetting the base.\n- **Counting additional features:** It's important to remember that \"sides\" refer to the faces of the pyramid, not the edges or vertices.\n\n**Additional information:**\n\n- **Edges:** A square-based pyramid has eight edges in total. Four edges form the base, and four edges connect the base to the apex.\n- **Vertices:** It has five vertices. Four vertices are at the corners of the base, and one vertex is the apex.\n\n**Visualizing the pyramid:**\n\nImagine a square base, and from each corner of the square, lines extend upwards to meet at a single point above the base. This forms four triangular faces.\n\n**Real-world example:**\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza is an example of a square-based pyramid. It has a square base and four triangular sides that meet at the top.\n\n**Mathematical properties:**\n\n- **Surface area:** The total surface area includes the area of the base plus the areas of the four triangular faces.\n- **Volume:** The volume of a pyramid is given by (1/3) times the area of the base times the height from the base to the apex.\n\n**Comparison with other pyramids:**\n\n- **Triangular base:** A triangular pyramid has four triangular faces, totaling four sides.\n- **Pentagonal base:** A pentagonal pyramid has a pentagonal base and five triangular faces, totaling six sides.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor a square-based pyramid, including the base, there are five sides. Therefore, the correct answer is C. five.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
