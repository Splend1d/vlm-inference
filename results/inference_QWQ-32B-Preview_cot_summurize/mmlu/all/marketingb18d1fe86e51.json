                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"_______________ are used in the positioning process to illustrate differing attributes of a selection of brands.\" And then there are four options: A. Product features. B. SIC code. C. Perceptual maps. D. Organizational characteristics.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The question is about positioning in marketing, which is all about how a brand differentiates itself in the market based on certain attributes that are important to customers. So, we need to find out which of these options is a tool or concept used to visualize or illustrate those differences between brands.\n\nOption A is \"Product features.\" Now, product features are indeed important attributes that can differentiate brands. For example, one smartphone might have a longer battery life, while another has a better camera. These features are crucial for positioning, but are they used to illustrate differing attributes in a visual way? Well, features are more like list items rather than a visual representation. So, maybe not the best fit here.\n\nOption B is \"SIC code.\" SIC stands for Standard Industrial Classification, which is a system used by governments to classify industries. It's more about categorizing businesses into different sectors based on what they do, not about comparing brand attributes. So, this seems unrelated to the positioning process as described in the question.\n\nOption C is \"Perceptual maps.\" Hmm, perceptual maps sound interesting. I think these are graphical representations that show how consumers perceive different brands in relation to each other based on certain attributes. For example, a map might have axes for \"price\" and \"quality,\" and plot different brands accordingly. This would clearly illustrate how each brand is positioned in the minds of consumers regarding those attributes. That sounds like exactly what the question is asking for.\n\nOption D is \"Organizational characteristics.\" This seems to refer to the internal features of a company, like its structure, culture, or processes. While these can influence how a brand is positioned, they aren't directly used to illustrate the differing attributes of brands from the consumer's perspective. So, probably not the right answer here.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like \"perceptual maps\" is the most appropriate choice. They are specifically designed to visualize how brands differ in terms of certain attributes as perceived by customers, which is central to the positioning process.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Perceptual maps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
