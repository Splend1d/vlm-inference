                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about horizontal versus vertical microarchitecture, and I need to determine which statements are true. There are three statements labeled I, II, and III, and I have to choose among several options that combine these statements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what horizontal and vertical microarchitectures are. From what I recall, horizontal microarchitecture is characterized by microinstructions that are wide and have multiple bits to control various functions directly. On the other hand, vertical microarchitecture uses encoded microinstructions that are more compact, and the decoding is done to activate the necessary functions.\n\nAlright, let's look at statement I: \"Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\"\n\nHmm, I think this might not be accurate. Actually, horizontal microarchitectures can execute more operations in a single time step because the microinstructions can directly control many functions in parallel. In contrast, vertical microarchitectures might need more time steps because the encoded microinstructions need to be decoded before the functions can be activated, which could take additional cycles.\n\nSo, perhaps statement I is false.\n\nMoving on to statement II: \"Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\"\n\nThis seems plausible because in horizontal microarchitecture, microinstructions are designed to directly control the hardware components without needing to be decoded first. Each bit or group of bits in the microinstruction corresponds directly to a specific function or control signal.\n\nSo, statement II appears to be true.\n\nNow, statement III: \"Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\"\n\nWait a minute, in horizontal microarchitecture, microinstructions are wide and have many bits to control various functions directly. They don't necessarily have an opcode in the traditional sense like in vertical microarchitecture, where the microinstruction contains an opcode that is decoded to generate control signals.\n\nSo, in horizontal microarchitecture, it's more about having a bundle of control signals rather than an opcode and operand specifiers. Therefore, statement III seems to be false.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Statement I: False\n\n- Statement II: True\n\n- Statement III: False\n\nGiven these assessments, the correct choice would be option B: \"II only.\"\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nFirst, confirming horizontal versus vertical microarchitecture:\n\n- Horizontal: Microinstructions are wide, directly control multiple functions, and can perform multiple operations in a single cycle.\n\n- Vertical: Microinstructions are encoded, more compact, and need to be decoded before activating functions, which might take additional time.\n\nRegarding statement I, it seems that horizontal architectures can actually require fewer time steps because they can do more in parallel.\n\nStatement II aligns with the direct control nature of horizontal microinstructions.\n\nStatement III doesn't seem accurate because horizontal microinstructions don't typically have an opcode field; instead, they have multiple control fields.\n\nTherefore, my answer remains option B: \"II only.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
