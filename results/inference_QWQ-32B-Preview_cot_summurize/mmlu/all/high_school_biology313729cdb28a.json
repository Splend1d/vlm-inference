                    "text": "So I've got this question about invertebrate immune systems, and I need to figure out which of these options they possess: A. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, B. Phagocytes, C. B-cells, or D. Helper T-cells. I'm not super familiar with invertebrate biology, but I know a bit about immune systems in general. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that immune systems can be divided into two main types: innate and adaptive. Innate immunity is the first line of defense and is present from birth, while adaptive immunity is more specific and develops over time as the body encounters different pathogens.\n\nNow, in vertebrates, like humans, we have both innate and adaptive immunity. Adaptive immunity is characterized by the presence of lymphocytes, which include B-cells and T-cells. B-cells produce antibodies, and T-cells can be cytotoxic, helping to kill infected cells, or helper T-cells, which assist in coordinating the immune response.\n\nBut invertebrates, which are animals without backbones, like insects, mollusks, and worms, have immune systems too, but they are primarily innate. I think they don't have the same kind of adaptive immunity that vertebrates have.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes: These are part of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. Since invertebrates don't have adaptive immunity, I don't think they have these.\n\nB. Phagocytes: These are cells that can engulf and digest pathogens. They are part of the innate immune system and are found in many organisms, including invertebrates. So, this seems likely.\n\nC. B-cells: Again, these are part of the adaptive immune system in vertebrates. Probably not present in invertebrates.\n\nD. Helper T-cells: Same as above, part of adaptive immunity in vertebrates.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the answer should be B. Phagocytes.\n\nBut to make sure, I should think about some examples. For instance, in insects, which are invertebrates, they have something called hemocytes in their hemolymph (which is like their blood). Some of these hemocytes can act as phagocytes, engulfing pathogens. Similarly, in mollusks, there are cells that perform phagocytic functions.\n\nI don't think invertebrates have lymphocytes like vertebrates do. Their immune responses are more generalized and don't involve the same level of specificity that adaptive immunity provides.\n\nAlso, I've heard of something called the Toll pathway in invertebrates, which is involved in innate immunity. In fact, the discovery of the Toll pathway in fruit flies led to understanding similar pathways in vertebrates.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like invertebrates possess phagocytes as part of their innate immune system, but they don't have the same lymphocytes that vertebrates have.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Phagocytes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
