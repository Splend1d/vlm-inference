                    "text": "To find the value of the tax shield, we can use the trade-off theory of capital structure, which balances the benefits of debt (tax shield) against the costs (bankruptcy and agency costs).\n\nThe formula that relates these variables is:\n\n\\[ V_L = V_U + PV(\\text{tax shield}) - PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V_L \\) is the value of the levered firm.\n- \\( V_U \\) is the value of the unlevered firm.\n- \\( PV(\\text{tax shield}) \\) is the present value of the tax shield.\n- \\( PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\) is the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs.\n\nWe are given:\n- \\( V_L = \\$5,000,000 \\)\n- \\( V_U = \\$4,780,000 \\)\n- \\( PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) = \\$360,000 \\)\n\nWe need to find \\( PV(\\text{tax shield}) \\).\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for \\( PV(\\text{tax shield}) \\):\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = V_L - V_U + PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$5,000,000 - \\$4,780,000 + \\$360,000 \\]\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$220,000 + \\$360,000 \\]\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$580,000 \\]\n\nHowever, this result doesn't match any of the provided options directly. Let's double-check the formula and the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, some versions of the trade-off theory formula might present the relationship differently. Let's consider another approach.\n\nThe tax shield provided by debt is typically the tax rate multiplied by the amount of debt. But in this problem, we are not given the tax rate or the amount of debt directly. Therefore, the previous approach seems more appropriate.\n\nGiven that, let's verify the calculation again:\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = V_L - V_U + PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$5,000,000 - \\$4,780,000 + \\$360,000 \\]\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$220,000 + \\$360,000 \\]\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$580,000 \\]\n\nThis matches option D. However, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the formula.\n\nLet me consider another perspective. Maybe the formula should be:\n\n\\[ V_L = V_U + PV(\\text{tax shield}) - PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\nSolving for \\( PV(\\text{tax shield}) \\):\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = V_L - V_U + PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\nThis is the same as before. So, \\$580,000 seems to be the correct answer based on this formula.\n\nBut since \\$580,000 is option D, and the other options are lower, perhaps there's a different formula or approach that should be used here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that the tax shield is the difference between the levered and unlevered firm values, adjusted for the costs.\n\nLet me try calculating the difference between the levered and unlevered firm values:\n\n\\[ V_L - V_U = \\$5,000,000 - \\$4,780,000 = \\$220,000 \\]\n\nThis matches option B. But according to the trade-off theory, this difference should equal the present value of the tax shield minus the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ V_L - V_U = PV(\\text{tax shield}) - PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\$220,000 = PV(\\text{tax shield}) - \\$360,000 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( PV(\\text{tax shield}) \\):\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = \\$220,000 + \\$360,000 = \\$580,000 \\]\n\nAgain, this points to option D.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question is asking for the net benefit of leverage, which would be the tax shield minus the costs.\n\nIn that case, the net benefit would be:\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) - PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) = \\$580,000 - \\$360,000 = \\$220,000 \\]\n\nBut this is option B, which seems to be the difference between the firm values.\n\nThis confusion suggests that the question might be phrased in a way that's leading to this ambiguity.\n\nGiven the information provided, and using the standard trade-off theory formula, the present value of the tax shield should be \\$580,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. \\$580,000.\n\nHowever, to ensure there are no mistakes, let's consider if the firm value includes the tax shield and costs in a different manner.\n\nSuppose the value of the levered firm is:\n\n\\[ V_L = V_U + PV(\\text{tax shield}) - PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\nThen, rearranging:\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = V_L - V_U + PV(\\text{bankruptcy and agency costs}) \\]\n\nThis is consistent with our earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if the question implies that the tax shield is simply the difference between the levered and unlevered firm values, without considering the costs, then:\n\n\\[ PV(\\text{tax shield}) = V_L - V_U = \\$220,000 \\]\n\nBut according to the trade-off theory, this ignores the costs associated with debt.\n\nGiven that the present value of bankruptcy and agency costs is provided, it should be incorporated into the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the comprehensive approach suggests that the present value of the tax shield is \\$580,000.\n\nThus, the answer should be D. \\$580,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
