He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him.

                    "text": "Let's see. This excerpt is from a book by al-Bakri, an eleventh-century Muslim historian and geographer. He's describing the city of Ghana, which consists of two towns: one inhabited by Muslims. From the text, it seems like there's a significant Muslim presence, with imams, muezzins, and scholars. The king's interpreters, treasury official, and most of his ministers are Muslims, which suggests that Islam has some influence at the highest levels of society.\n\nHowever, it also mentions that only the royalty can wear sewn clothes, and others wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade according to their means. The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces and bracelets, and has a domed pavilion with horses standing around it. There are different ways of greeting the king depending on one's religion: those who share the king's religion kneel and sprinkle dust on their heads, while Muslims clap their hands.\n\nReligiously, the people are described as pagans who worship idols, but there's a significant Muslim population, especially among the elite. The king levies taxes on goods like salt, copper, and other commodities, and there's mention of gold mines where the nuggets are reserved for the king.\n\nBeyond this country, there's another called Malal, whose king was attached to Islam, but his people remained polytheists. It seems like even in Malal, where the ruler is a Muslim, the general population hasn't fully converted to Islam.\n\nSo, based on this, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Imams and muezzins ensured that all Africans adhered to Islamic law.\n\nWell, the text mentions imams and muezzins in the Muslim-inhabited town, but it also says that the people are mostly pagans who worship idols. So, it doesn't seem like everyone is adhering to Islamic law. This option seems incorrect.\n\nB. Some elites converted to Islam, but lower classes kept their traditional beliefs.\n\nThis aligns with what's described: the king's interpreters, treasury official, and most ministers are Muslims, indicating that some elites have converted to Islam, while the general population remains pagan.\n\nC. Muslim merchants refused to do business with anyone who was not Muslim.\n\nThere's no mention of Muslim merchants refusing to do business with non-Muslims. In fact, the text mentions taxes on goods like salt and copper, suggesting trade is happening, but it doesn't specify about the religious affiliations of the merchants.\n\nD. African kings required Muslims to conform to pagan customs at court.\n\nThe text says that Muslims greet the king by clapping their hands, while those who share the king's religion kneel and sprinkle dust. It doesn't say that Muslims are required to conform to pagan customs; rather, they have their own way of greeting the king.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the most accurate description of Islam's influence in Africa during this time period: some elites converted to Islam, but the lower classes kept their traditional beliefs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
