The six names from each plant will be put together to make up the sample. Will this method result in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees?\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\nC.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out if this sampling method results in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 1000 employees spread evenly across five assembly plants. That means each plant has 200 employees. Each plant manager is going to pick six names randomly from their plant's employees, and then all those selected from each plant will be combined to make the sample of 30 employees.\n\nSo, is this a simple random sample? A simple random sample is one where every possible group of 30 employees has an equal chance of being selected from the entire population of 1000 employees.\n\nIn this method, the managers are selecting six employees from each plant randomly. This sounds a lot like stratified sampling, where the population is divided into strata (in this case, the five plants), and then a random sample is taken from each stratum.\n\nStratified sampling is different from simple random sampling because in stratified sampling, we ensure representation from each stratum. In simple random sampling, there's no such stratification; every individual has an equal chance of being selected, regardless of any subgroup they might belong to.\n\nSo, in this case, by selecting six employees from each plant, we're ensuring that each plant is represented equally in the sample. This is stratified sampling, not simple random sampling.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because every employee has the same chance of being selected.\n\nWell, in this method, every employee does have an equal chance of being selected within their plant. Since each plant has 200 employees and six are selected, each employee in a plant has a 6/200 = 3% chance of being selected. Because all plants are the same size, every employee across the company has the same individual probability of being selected.\n\nBut in simple random sampling, it's not just about individual probabilities; it's about the probability of any particular group of 30 being selected. In stratified sampling, some groups of 30 are impossible because they might not have six employees from each plant. So, not every group of 30 has the same chance of being selected.\n\nB. Yes, because every plant is equally represented.\n\nThis is more in line with stratified sampling, where we ensure equal representation from each stratum. But the question is about simple random sampling, which doesn't ensure equal representation from subgroups.\n\nC. Yes, because this is an example of stratified sampling, which is a special case of simple random sampling.\n\nActually, stratified sampling is a different method from simple random sampling. It's a type of probability sampling, but it's not the same as simple random sampling. So, this statement is incorrect.\n\nD. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nThis seems to be the correct answer. In simple random sampling, every possible group of 30 employees has an equal chance of being selected. But in this stratified sampling method, only those groups of 30 that have exactly six employees from each plant can be selected. Other groups that don't have six from each plant have zero chance of being selected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. No, because not every group of 30 employees has the same chance of being selected.\n\nTo summarize, while each employee has an equal individual chance of being selected, the method ensures that the sample is stratified by plant, which means that only specific types of groups of 30 are possible. This is different from simple random sampling, where any group of 30 has the same chance of being selected.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
