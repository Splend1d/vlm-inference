                    "text": "I've come across this term \"multibrand policy,\" and it seems like it's being referred to as another type of branding strategy. The question is asking about a strategy where each product in an organization is branded separately from the others. Let's see what options are given:\n\nA. Individual branding.\n\nB. Corporate brands.\n\nC. Family branding.\n\nD. Co-branding.\n\nI need to understand what each of these terms means to determine which one matches the description provided.\n\nStarting with A, individual branding: This is when each product has its own unique brand identity, separate from other products of the same company. So, each product stands on its own without any association with the company's other products.\n\nB, corporate brands: This refers to the overall brand of the company itself. It's the reputation and identity of the entire organization, not just a specific product.\n\nC, family branding: This is when a company uses the same brand name for multiple products. So, instead of each product having its own brand, they all share the same brand identity.\n\nD, co-branding: This is when two or more brands join together to create a new product or service. It's a collaboration between different brands.\n\nGiven these definitions, the strategy where each product is branded independently of all others sounds most like individual branding. In individual branding, each product has its own distinct brand identity, which aligns with the description provided.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nCorporate brands focus on the overall company image, not on individual products. Family branding applies the same brand to multiple products, which is the opposite of what's described. Co-branding involves multiple brands collaborating, which isn't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Individual branding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
