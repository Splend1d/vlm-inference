                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question. It's asking who defined jurisprudence as the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of right and wrong. The options are Austin, Ulpian, Holland, and Allen.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who these people are and what they contributed to jurisprudence.\n\nStarting with Austin. John Austin was an influential English jurist in the 19th century. He's known for his book \"The Province of Jurisprudence Determined,\" where he defined law as commands from a sovereign backed by sanctions. But I don't recall him defining jurisprudence in terms of divine and human things or the science of right and wrong.\n\nNext, Ulpian. He was a Roman jurist from the classical period. I think he played a significant role in Roman law, but I'm not sure about his definition of jurisprudence.\n\nThen, there's Holland. I believe this is Thomas Erskine Holland, another English jurist who wrote about jurisprudence. However, I don't remember him defining it in the way the question describes.\n\nLastly, Allen. Maybe Frederick Pollock and Frederic William Maitland, but I don't think that's who this refers to.\n\nLet me think differently. The definition \"the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of right and wrong\" sounds quite broad and seems to encompass not just law but also ethics and perhaps philosophy.\n\nI recall that in ancient times, law was closely tied with morality and philosophy. Maybe it's Ulpian who defined it this way.\n\nWait, I think I remember something about Ulpian defining jurisprudence as \"the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of the just and the unjust.\" That sounds very similar to the question.\n\nLet me check what I know about Ulpian. He was a Roman lawyer and jurist who lived in the 3rd century AD. He was one of the great Roman jurists whose works were later compiled in the Digest of Justinian.\n\nIn one of his writings, he is credited with defining jurisprudence as \"the knowledge of things divine and human, the science of the just and the unjust.\" This seems to match the option given in the question.\n\nComparing it to the options:\n\nA. Austin: Known for his command theory of law, not for this particular definition.\n\nB. Ulpian: Seems to fit based on my memory.\n\nC. Holland: I don't recall him defining jurisprudence in these terms.\n\nD. Allen: Not sure who this refers to specifically.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. Ulpian.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options might also define jurisprudence in a similar way.\n\nAustin's definition is more about the analysis of positive law, not about divine things or right and wrong.\n\nHolland, if it's Thomas Erskine Holland, he wrote \"The Elements of Jurisprudence,\" but again, his definition might not match this description.\n\nAllen: If this refers to W.H. Allen, he co-authored \"Legal Duties\" with H.L.A. Hart, but again, their focus might not align with this definition.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, Ulpian seems to be the most likely candidate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
