                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option would help correct a negative externality. So, first, I need to remember what a negative externality is. It's when the production or consumption of a good causes harm to a third party that's not reflected in the market price. For example, pollution from a factory that affects the health of nearby residents.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these options would internalize or correct that externality. Internalizing means making the producer or consumer bear the cost of that externality, so they have an incentive to reduce it.\n\nOption A is a government subsidy. Subsidies are payments from the government to producers or consumers to encourage certain behaviors, like producing more of a good that's beneficial for society. But in the case of a negative externality, we don't want to encourage more production; we want to discourage it or at least make sure the producer pays for the harm caused. So, a subsidy seems counterproductive here.\n\nOption B is a government tax. Taxes are levies imposed by the government on certain activities, often to discourage them or to generate revenue. In the context of a negative externality, a tax could be imposed on the producer equal to the external cost they're imposing on society. This way, the market price would reflect the true social cost, and the quantity produced would decrease to the socially optimal level. This sounds promising.\n\nOption C is a lower price. If there's a negative externality, lowering the price would likely increase consumption or production, which could exacerbate the externality. That doesn't seem like a way to correct it.\n\nOption D is a higher level of output. Again, with a negative externality, increasing output would likely increase the externality, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nSo, between these options, it seems like a government tax would be the most appropriate tool to internalize a negative externality. It aligns with the principle of making the producer pay for the external costs they impose, thereby encouraging them to reduce those costs.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there are other ways to internalize externalities. I recall that in some cases, Coase theorem suggests that if property rights are well-defined and transaction costs are low, parties can negotiate to reach an efficient outcome without government intervention. However, that's not one of the options here, and in many real-world situations, transaction costs are too high for this to be practical.\n\nAnother approach is regulation, where the government sets standards or limits on the externality, like emissions standards. But that's not listed here either.\n\nGiven the options provided, it seems clear that a government tax is the way to internalize a negative externality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
