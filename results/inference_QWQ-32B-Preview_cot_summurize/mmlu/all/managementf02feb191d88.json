                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which 18th-century writer wrote the book called 'The Wealth of Nations.' Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Frederick Taylor\n\nB. Henry Mintzberg\n\nC. Adam Smith\n\nD. Dr. Samuel Johnson\n\nFirst, I should think about who these people are and what they're known for.\n\nFrederick Taylor, option A, is famous for his work in management and scientific management. He's known for ideas like time and motion studies to improve efficiency in the workplace. But I think he was more of a 19th or 20th-century figure, not the 18th century.\n\nHenry Mintzberg, option B, is a contemporary management theorist. He's known for his work on organizational structures and strategic management. Definitely not from the 18th century.\n\nAdam Smith, option C, is often considered the father of modern economics. He lived in the 18th century and is famous for his book 'The Wealth of Nations,' which is a foundational text in classical economics. This sounds promising.\n\nDr. Samuel Johnson, option D, was an 18th-century writer, yes, but he's more known for his works like 'A Dictionary of the English Language' and his essays and poetry. While he was a prominent figure in the 18th century, I don't think he wrote 'The Wealth of Nations.'\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Adam Smith is the correct answer. But let me double-check.\n\n'The Wealth of Nations' was published in 1776, which is indeed in the 18th century. Adam Smith was a Scottish economist and philosopher who is best known for this work. In 'The Wealth of Nations,' he introduced the concept of the invisible hand, which suggests that individual self-interest in a free market can lead to economic prosperity.\n\nFrederick Taylor, on the other hand, lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is known for his contributions to scientific management, which is a different field.\n\nHenry Mintzberg is a contemporary scholar, so he's not from the 18th century.\n\nDr. Samuel Johnson was a prominent figure in the 18th century, but his works are more in literature and language, not economics.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Adam Smith.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
