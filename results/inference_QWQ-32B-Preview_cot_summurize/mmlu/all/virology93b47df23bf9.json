So, I think it's more about the bigger picture rather than individual cases. Let me look at these options.\n\nOption A says \"Patient-centered.\" That sounds like it's focused on individual patients, like in clinical medicine. But public health is more about communities and populations, so maybe that's not the best fit.\n\nOption B is \"Population-centered.\" That seems directly related to public health, which aims to improve the health of entire populations. So, this might be a good choice.\n\nOption C says \"Subject-centered.\" I'm not sure what \"subject-centered\" means in this context. It's a bit vague. Maybe it refers to focusing on specific subjects or topics, but that doesn't seem directly related to ethics in public health.\n\nOption D is \"Must respect the rights of individuals.\" That's important in any ethical framework, including public health ethics. Public health interventions should consider and respect individual rights while promoting the common good.\n\nSo, if I have to choose, maybe both B and D are correct in different ways. Public health ethics is population-centered, but it also must respect individual rights. But since it's a multiple-choice question and probably expects a single answer, I might go with B, \"Population-centered,\" because that seems to be the primary focus of public health ethics.\n\nWait, maybe it allows selecting more than one option. The question has options A, B, C, D, and it's not specified if only one can be chosen. If I can select more than one, then B and D would make sense.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll go with B, \"Population-centered,\" as the main characteristic of public health ethics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
