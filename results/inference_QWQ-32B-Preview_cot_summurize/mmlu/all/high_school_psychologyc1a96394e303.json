That sounds like she's in a situation where both choices are attractive, but she can't have both. I think this relates to some kind of psychological conflict in decision-making.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. frustration-aggression\n\nI've heard about frustration leading to aggression, like when someone can't get what they want, they get frustrated and act aggressively. But in Delia's case, she's accepted to both schools, so she's not being frustrated in that way. She has two positive options, so this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nB. intrinsic-extrinsic\n\nThis seems to be about motivations. Intrinsic motivations are things that drive us internally, like passion or interest, while extrinsic motivations are external, like money or status. Maybe Delia is torn between choosing a school based on intrinsic factors like her interest in the curriculum versus extrinsic factors like the school's reputation. That could be a possibility.\n\nC. approach-avoidance\n\nThis is a type of conflict where one option has both appealing and unappealing aspects. For example, you might want to take a new job because it pays more (approach), but you're afraid of the longer hours and commute (avoidance). In Delia's case, she's considering two different schools, both of which probably have their own set of appealing and unappealing features. So, it's possible that she's experiencing approach-avoidance conflicts with each school individually.\n\nD. approach-approach\n\nThis is when you have to choose between two desirable options. Since Delia is accepted to both Harvard and Yale, which are both prestigious schools, she's facing a decision between two good choices. This sounds a lot like an approach-approach conflict because she's pulled in two directions, each towards something she wants.\n\nComparing these, option D seems to fit best because she's having difficulty choosing between two attractive options. Options A and B don't seem directly related to her situation, and while C could apply if she has mixed feelings about each school, the initial description just says she's having difficulty choosing between the two, without mentioning specific pros and cons of each.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. approach-approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
