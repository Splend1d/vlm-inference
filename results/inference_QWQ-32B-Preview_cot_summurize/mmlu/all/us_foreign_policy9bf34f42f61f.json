It has member states from all over the world and deals with a lot of global issues like peace, security, and development.\n\nBut let me think about the other options too. B is NATO, which is an alliance of countries, mostly from North America and Europe, focused on collective defense. It's important, especially in terms of military cooperation, but I feel like it's not as widely known as the UN.\n\nOption C is OPEC, which is made up of petroleum-exporting countries. It's significant in the energy sector, but its focus is more narrow compared to the UN, which handles a broad range of international issues.\n\nThen there's D, the World Trade Organization, which deals with global trade rules and regulations. It's crucial for international commerce, but again, its scope is more limited compared to the UN's comprehensive approach to global affairs.\n\nSo, while all these organizations are important in their own ways, I believe the United Nations is the most well-known and comprehensive international organization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
