                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Sinnott-Armstrong's interests in moral obligations. The options are individuals, societies, governments, and families. I need to figure out which one he is most interested in examining.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Sinnott-Armstrong is. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, moral psychology, and practical reasoning. He has written on various topics within moral philosophy, including moral obligations.\n\nTo determine which aspect he is most interested in examining, I should consider his major works and areas of research. Sinnott-Armstrong has written extensively on moral obligations in different contexts. For instance, he has discussed moral obligations in relation to individual actions, societal norms, governmental policies, and family duties.\n\nLet me think about his contributions to each area:\n\n1. Individuals: Sinnott-Armstrong has written about individual moral responsibilities, such as the\u4e49\u52a1 to help others in need, the morality of killing, and the ethics of war. His work often delves into the moral obligations that individuals face in their daily lives and in more extreme situations.\n\n2. Societies: He has also explored how moral obligations shape societal structures and norms. This includes discussions on justice, fairness, and the moral foundations of social institutions.\n\n3. Governments: Sinnott-Armstrong has analyzed the moral obligations of governments, particularly in terms of policy-making, law enforcement, and international relations. He has written about the ethical dimensions of governmental actions and the responsibilities that come with governing.\n\n4. Families: While family duties are certainly a part of moral philosophy, I don't recall Sinnott-Armstrong focusing extensively on this area compared to the others. His work seems more concentrated on broader ethical issues affecting individuals and societies at large.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that Sinnott-Armstrong has a broad interest in moral obligations across different levels, but his most prominent work might be in the area of individual moral obligations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps his interest lies more in the obligations of societies or governments, given his work on justice and policy.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look for specific works or statements where he expresses his primary interest.\n\nUpon reflection, one of his well-known books is \"Moral Obligation: New Essays on Old Questions.\" In this book, he and other philosophers discuss various aspects of moral obligation, including their sources, nature, and applications. While the book covers a range of topics, it seems to focus more on individual moral obligations and their philosophical underpinnings.\n\nAdditionally, Sinnott-Armstrong has been involved in projects related to moral psychology, which often examines how individuals make moral judgments and decisions. This suggests a strong interest in the moral obligations of individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, he has also contributed to debates on global justice and the obligations of nations towards one another, which would pertain to societies and governments.\n\nGiven this, it's a bit nuanced. However, if I had to choose one option that best represents his primary interest, I would say that Sinnott-Armstrong is most interested in examining issues about the moral obligations of individuals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. individuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
