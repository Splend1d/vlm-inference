                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 40-year-old woman who's been experiencing increased facial hair growth over the past six months, and her last menstrual period was four months ago. She's 165 cm tall, weighs 70 kg, which gives her a BMI of 26 kg/m2. Her pulse is 80 per minute, and her blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. During the physical exam, they noticed temporal balding and coarse dark hair on her upper lip and chin, and also clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone level is increased, but other hormone levels like androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are all within normal ranges. And then, ultrasonography of her pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass.\n\nSo, the question is asking which type of tumor best describes this mass, and the options are:\n\nA. Granulosa tumor\n\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\n\nD. Teratoma\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, the patient is experiencing symptoms that suggest hyperandrogenism\u2014things like increased facial hair, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement. And indeed, her serum testosterone is increased, which supports that.\n\nNow, looking at the ovarian mass, it's quite large at 12 cm, and in a 40-year-old woman, we need to consider the possible types of ovarian tumors that could cause hyperandrogenism.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Granulosa tumor: These are sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary that can produce estrogen, which can lead to symptoms like vaginal bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia, but they don't typically secrete androgens. So, this seems less likely given the patient's symptoms of hyperandrogenism.\n\nB. Ovarian carcinoid: Carcinoids are neuroendocrine tumors that can produce a variety of hormones, including serotonin, but they're not known for producing androgens. So, this also seems less likely in this context.\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor: This is another type of sex cord-stromal tumor of the ovary, and it's known for producing androgens, which can lead to virilization symptoms like the ones this patient is experiencing. Given that her testosterone is elevated and other androgens are within normal range, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nD. Teratoma: These are germ cell tumors that can contain tissue from all three germ layers, like hair, teeth, etc. They can sometimes produce hormones, but they're not typically associated with hyperandrogenism unless they contain elements that secrete androgens, which is less common.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms of hyperandrogenism and the presence of an ovarian mass, the most likely diagnosis is a Sertoli-Leydig tumor, which is known to produce androgens.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider why the other options are less likely:\n\n- Granulosa tumors usually secrete estrogen, leading to different symptoms.\n\n- Ovarian carcinoids are rare and typically present with symptoms related to serotonin secretion, not androgens.\n\n- Teratomas can be cystic or solid and may contain a variety of tissues, but they're not commonly associated with hyperandrogenism.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Sertoli-Leydig tumor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
