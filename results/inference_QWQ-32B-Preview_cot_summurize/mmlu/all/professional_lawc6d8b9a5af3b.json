The youth thereafter entered into a written contract with the dealership, which provided that the youth would make monthly payments of $1,000 for three years. During the first year of the contract, the youth made 12 monthly payments totaling $12,000. However, the youth failed to make any payments during the second year of the contract. The dealership repeatedly threatened to sue the youth for the remaining balance that it claimed was due under the contract. Finally, in order to avoid litigation, the youth sent the dealership the following letter:\"The car I purchased from you is a real lemon. I have spent a considerable sum of money during the last two years in repair work. I don't believe that the car is worth $36,000, but I am willing to pay you $10,000 if I find ajob in the next month. \"The youth had just turned 18 when he sent this letter to the dealership. The day after mailing this letter, the youth was involved in an automobile accident, and the sports car was totally demolished. Following the accident, the youth remained unemployed, and he refused to make any payments to the dealership. At the time of the accident, the sports car was worth $18,000. In this jurisdiction, the age of majority is18 years of age. If the dealership brings suit against the youth for breach of contract, what, if any, is the plaintiff's proper recovery?\n\nA. Nothing.\nB. $10,000. 00\nC. $18,000. 00\nD. $24,000. 00\n"

                    "text": "This is a complex scenario involving contract law, particularly dealing with minors and the concept of breach of contract. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the initial contract. The youth purchased a car for $36,000 with a plan to pay $1,000 per month for three years. He made payments for the first year, totaling $12,000, but failed to make any payments in the second year. The dealership threatened to sue for the remaining balance.\n\nNow, the youth, who has just turned 18, sends a letter offering to pay $10,000 if he finds a job in the next month. He had been 16 when he signed the original contract, and in this jurisdiction, the age of majority is 18.\n\nA key point here is that at the time of signing the original contract, the youth was a minor (16 years old), and generally, contracts entered into by minors are voidable at the option of the minor. However, once the minor reaches the age of majority, they can ratify the contract, making it binding.\n\nIn this case, the youth, now 18, sends a letter proposing a new deal: to pay $10,000 if he finds a job in the next month. This can be seen as an attempt to modify the original contract or to settle the debt for a lesser amount.\n\nBut before any resolution is reached, the car is totally demolished in an accident, and the youth remains unemployed, refusing to make further payments.\n\nGiven that the car was worth $18,000 at the time of the accident, and the original contract price was $36,000, with $12,000 already paid, the remaining balance would be $24,000.\n\nHowever, since the car is now destroyed, the dealership no longer has the car to repossess or sell to recoup some of the loss. So, the dealership is left with pursuing the youth for the remaining balance.\n\nNow, considering that the youth was a minor at the time of signing the original contract, and he didn't ratify it upon reaching majority age (by continuing payments or otherwise indicating acceptance of the contract), the original contract may be voidable.\n\nBut, the letter he sent at age 18 could be seen as an attempt to negotiate a new agreement, which might imply some acceptance of the original debt.\n\nHowever, since the car is destroyed and the youth is unemployed, his ability to pay is in question.\n\nIn contract law, if a party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party can seek damages. In this case, the dealership can sue for the remaining balance owed under the contract, which is $24,000.\n\nBut, considering the car's value at the time of destruction was $18,000, the dealership might only be entitled to the difference between the remaining balance and the car's value, which is $6,000.\n\nHowever, this might not be straightforward because the youth's payments were spread out over time, and the car's value depreciates over time as well.\n\nMoreover, the letter sent by the youth proposes to pay $10,000 if he finds a job, which is a conditional offer. Since he remains unemployed, this condition hasn't been met, so no payment is due under this proposal.\n\nGiven all these factors, the dealership's proper recovery is uncertain.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Nothing.\n\nB. $10,000.00\n\nC. $18,000.00\n\nD. $24,000.00\n\nOption A, nothing, might be the case if the original contract is voidable due to the youth being a minor and he disaffirms it upon reaching majority age.\n\nOption B, $10,000, is the amount offered in the letter, but since it's conditional on finding a job and he remains unemployed, this condition hasn't been met.\n\nOption C, $18,000, is the value of the car at the time of destruction.\n\nOption D, $24,000, is the remaining balance owed under the original contract.\n\nConsidering that the car is destroyed and the youth hasn't paid anything beyond the initial $12,000, the dealership might argue that they are entitled to the remaining balance of $24,000.\n\nHowever, the youth could argue that the contract is voidable due to his minority status at the time of signing, and he has disaffirmed it by not making further payments and refusing to pay.\n\nAdditionally, the letter sent at age 18 could be seen as an attempt to negotiate a new agreement, but since the condition wasn't met, it doesn't create an obligation to pay $10,000.\n\nGiven that the car is destroyed and the youth is unemployed, the dealership's recovery might be limited.\n\nBut in contract law, if a party breaches the contract, the non-breaching party can seek damages equivalent to the loss suffered.\n\nIn this case, the dealership sold a car worth $36,000, received $12,000, and the car is now destroyed. So, their loss is $24,000.\n\nHowever, the youth was a minor at the time of signing, and the contract may be voidable.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, contracts with minors are voidable, meaning the minor can disaffirm the contract and return the property (if possible), and the other party can seek restitution for any value received.\n\nBut since the car is destroyed, restitution in kind isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the dealership might not have a claim for the remaining $24,000 if the contract is voidable and the youth disaffirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if the youth's actions after reaching majority age indicate ratification of the contract, then the dealership could seek the remaining balance.\n\nGiven the letter sent, it's unclear whether it's an attempt to disaffirm or to modify the contract.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most plausible answer is that the dealership's proper recovery is $18,000, which is the value of the car at the time of destruction.\n\nThis would account for the fact that the car, being the subject matter of the contract, is now worth $18,000, and the dealership can't recover the full $24,000 remaining on the contract because the car is destroyed.\n\nTherefore, option C, $18,000, seems to be the most reasonable answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
