So, the question is asking which option best describes elaborative rehearsal. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A says \"making new information meaningful.\" That sounds familiar. Elaborative rehearsal is supposed to be about connecting new information to what you already know to make it more meaningful and easier to remember. So, this seems like a good candidate.\n\nOption B is \"consciously repeating new information.\" Hmm, that sounds more like rote rehearsal, where you just repeat something over and over without necessarily understanding it or connecting it to other knowledge. Elaborative rehearsal is different because it involves deeper processing.\n\nOption C says \"practicing a new skill past the point of mastery.\" This sounds more like overlearning, which is a concept related to mastering skills through practice, but it doesn't seem directly related to elaborative rehearsal, which is more about memory and information processing.\n\nOption D is \"\u2018thinking aloud\u2019 while studying.\" Thinking aloud can be a study technique, but it's not specifically about elaborative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal is more about the depth of processing and making connections, not necessarily about verbalizing thoughts.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option A seems to be the best description of elaborative rehearsal. It's about making new information meaningful by connecting it to existing knowledge, which is the essence of elaborative rehearsal.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me recall the definition of elaborative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal is a memory strategy that involves linking new information to existing knowledge in a meaningful way. This can involve relating new concepts to personal experiences, using mnemonics, or creating mental images that connect the new information to what you already know.\n\nOption B, conscious repetition, is more aligned with maintenance rehearsal, which is a different strategy that focuses on keeping information active in short-term memory through repetition, but without necessarily understanding or connecting it to other knowledge.\n\nOption C, practicing a new skill past mastery, is more about motor learning and skill acquisition, which are related but distinct from memory strategies like elaborative rehearsal.\n\nOption D, thinking aloud, might be a technique used during studying, but it's not specifically defined as elaborative rehearsal.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is Option A: making new information meaningful. This captures the essence of elaborative rehearsal by emphasizing the importance of giving meaning to new information through connections to existing knowledge.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
