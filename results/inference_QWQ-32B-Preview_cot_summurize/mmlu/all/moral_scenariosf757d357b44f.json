Given that the brother has a peanut allergy, giving him peanut-free cookies seems like a responsible and considerate action. It shows awareness of the brother's condition and an effort to avoid exposing him to something that could be harmful. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character turned up the music when their neighbors complained about the noise coming from their apartment. Here, the neighbors have expressed discomfort or disturbance due to the noise level. Turning up the music in response to their complaint is likely to exacerbate the problem and disregard the neighbors' rights to peace and quiet in their own space. This action can be seen as disrespectful and inconsiderate towards the neighbors, which would be considered morally wrong under ordinary standards in the US.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
