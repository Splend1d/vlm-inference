                    "text": "Let's go through each option to determine which statement is not true.\n\nOption A: \"Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate.\"\n\nMuscle glycogen is indeed broken down within muscle cells, but the initial product is glucose-1-phosphate. This process is catalyzed by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase. So, this statement seems accurate.\n\nOption B: \"Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibers in their leg muscles.\"\n\nType I muscle fibers are slow-twitch fibers, which are more efficient at using oxygen to generate more fuel for extended periods. Endurance athletes typically have a higher proportion of these fibers, which makes this statement true.\n\nOption C: \"Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration.\"\n\nThe liver plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels. It can break down glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream to prevent hypoglycemia. So, this statement is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body.\"\n\nInsulin is a hormone that regulates glucose metabolism. It promotes glucose uptake primarily in muscle and adipose tissue, and it also stimulates glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscles. However, not all tissues in the body take up glucose in response to insulin. For example, the brain can take up glucose without insulin stimulation. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n\nGiven this analysis, option D is the statement that is not entirely true, as insulin does not promote glucose uptake by all tissues in the body.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
