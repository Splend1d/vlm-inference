                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to remember what Chodorow said about gender socialization. I think it has something to do with how kids relate to their parents and how that shapes their gender identities.\n\nOption A says that both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers at first, but then boys break away. That sounds familiar. Maybe Chodorow believed that boys have to separate from their mothers to develop a masculine identity, while girls stay more attached.\n\nOption B says that girls are attached to their mothers but then break away. That seems contradictory to what I just thought. If girls are supposed to stay more attached to their mothers, why would they break away?\n\nOption C says that boys are attached to their fathers and girls to their mothers. Hmm, that seems simplistic. I thought Chodorow emphasized the mother's role in child-rearing, especially in traditional families.\n\nOption D says that both boys and girls are closely attached to their fathers, but girls break away. That doesn't sound right to me. I feel like fathers are important, but Chodorow might have focused more on the mother-child bond.\n\nLet me think about this again. Chodorow, in his 1978 work, was discussing how gender roles are socially constructed through family dynamics. He was building on Freud's ideas but critiquing them from a feminist perspective.\n\nFreud thought that boys go through the Oedipus complex, where they're attached to their mothers and see their fathers as competitors, leading to identification with the father as they grow up. Girls go through the Electra complex, attaching to their fathers and seeing their mothers as rivals.\n\nChodorow, I believe, challenged this by suggesting that the mother is the primary caregiver in most families, and both boys and girls form strong attachments to her. However, boys have to overcome this attachment to develop a separate identity, while girls can maintain a closer bond.\n\nSo, based on that, option A seems the most accurate: both boys and girls are closely attached to their mothers, but then boys break away.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't right now, I'll go with my best guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Chodorow argued that girls identify with their mothers and boys identify with their fathers, which would be option C. But I think that's too straightforward and doesn't capture the complexity of his argument.\n\nOr maybe he said that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but girls break away. That doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nLet me consider the context. Chodorow was writing in the 1970s, a time when feminist theory was gaining traction, and there was a lot of re-examination of traditional psychoanalytic theories.\n\nHe might have been critiquing Freud's assumption that the Oedipus complex is universal and that girls' identification is different from boys'. Perhaps Chodorow proposed that both genders have a primary attachment to the mother, and the differences come from the way they resolve that attachment.\n\nIf that's the case, then option A makes sense: both are attached to the mother, but boys eventually break away to establish their own identities, while girls may maintain a closer relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he said that girls are attached to their mothers but then break away, which is option B. But that seems inconsistent with what I recall about his theory.\n\nWait, perhaps Chodorow emphasized that girls identify with their mothers because they share the same gender, and boys identify with their fathers for the same reason. That would be option C.\n\nBut I think he went beyond that by considering the mother's role as the primary caregiver and the impact that has on children's development.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is A: both boys and girls are attached to their mothers, but boys break away as part of their gender socialization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he argued that both boys and girls are attached to their fathers, but girls break away. That seems less likely.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Based on my understanding, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
