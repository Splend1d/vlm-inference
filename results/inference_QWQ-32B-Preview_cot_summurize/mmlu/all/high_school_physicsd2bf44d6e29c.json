                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a stone is thrown horizontally from a bridge with an initial speed of 30 m/s, and I need to find its total speed when it enters the water 4 seconds later, ignoring air resistance. The options are 30, 40, 50, or 60 m/s.\n\nAlright, first things first. Since the stone is thrown horizontally, its initial velocity has only a horizontal component, which is 30 m/s. There's no initial vertical velocity because it's thrown horizontally. But as it falls, it's going to pick up speed in the vertical direction due to gravity.\n\nSo, I need to find the total speed after 4 seconds. Speed is a scalar quantity, and in this case, since the motion is two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical), I need to find the magnitude of the velocity vector after 4 seconds.\n\nLet me recall that in projectile motion, the horizontal component of velocity remains constant if air resistance is negligible. So, the horizontal component after 4 seconds is still 30 m/s.\n\nNow, for the vertical component, it starts from zero and increases due to gravity. The vertical velocity after time t is given by v_y = g*t, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 10 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, v_y = 10 m/s\u00b2 * 4 s = 40 m/s.\n\nNow, the total velocity is the vector sum of the horizontal and vertical components. Since they are perpendicular to each other, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the total velocity.\n\nSo, v_total = sqrt(v_x\u00b2 + v_y\u00b2) = sqrt(30\u00b2 + 40\u00b2) = sqrt(900 + 1600) = sqrt(2500) = 50 m/s.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the energy. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)*m*(30)^2, and the potential energy at the start is m*g*h, where h is the height of the bridge. When the stone hits the water, all the potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy.\n\nSo, final kinetic energy = initial kinetic energy + potential energy.\n\nTherefore, (1/2)*m*v_final\u00b2 = (1/2)*m*(30)^2 + m*g*h.\n\nBut I don't know the height h, and I don't know the mass m. Hmm.\n\nWait, but I do know the time of fall, which is 4 seconds. So, I can find the height h using the equation h = (1/2)*g*t\u00b2.\n\nSo, h = (1/2)*10 m/s\u00b2*(4 s)^2 = (1/2)*10*16 = 80 m.\n\nNow, plugging back into the energy equation:\n\n(1/2)*m*v_final\u00b2 = (1/2)*m*(30)^2 + m*g*80.\n\nI can cancel m from both sides:\n\n(1/2)*v_final\u00b2 = (1/2)*(900) + (10)*(80).\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1/2)*v_final\u00b2 = 450 + 800 = 1250.\n\nSo, v_final\u00b2 = 2500, therefore v_final = sqrt(2500) = 50 m/s.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the total speed when it enters the water is 50 m/s.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the equations of motion for projectiles.\n\nI know that the horizontal displacement is x = v_x * t = 30 m/s * 4 s = 120 m.\n\nBut I don't think that's directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the angle of the velocity vector when it hits the water.\n\nThe tangent of the angle \u03b8 is v_y / v_x = 40 / 30 = 4/3.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arctan(4/3).\n\nBut again, I'm interested in the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity vector, which I've already calculated as 50 m/s.\n\nI think that's solid. Both the vector component method and the energy conservation method give me the same answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if air resistance being negligible is important here. Since it's negligible, it doesn't affect the motion significantly, so my calculations hold.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the acceleration due to gravity is 10 m/s\u00b2, which is a common approximation. In real scenarios, it's about 9.8 m/s\u00b2, but using 10 simplifies calculations without significantly affecting the result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 50 m/s, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50 \\text{ m/s}} \\]"
