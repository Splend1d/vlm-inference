The rhyme is about what day of the week a child is born on and what character traits they have based on that day. So, it goes something like:\n\n\"Monday's child is fair of face,\n\nTuesday's child is full of grace,\n\nWednesday's child is full of woe,\n\nThursday's child has far to go,\n\nFriday's child is loving and giving,\n\nSaturday's child works hard for a living,\n\nAnd a child that's born on the Sabbath day\n\nIs bonny and blithe and good and gay.\"\n\nOkay, so from what I remember, Wednesday's child is full of woe. So, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't misremembered the rhyme. I recall that Monday's child is fair of face, which matches option A, and Saturday's child works hard for a living, which is option D. Thursday's child has far to go, which is option C. So, yes, Wednesday's child is indeed full of woe.\n\nI think I've got it right. It's been a while since I heard that rhyme, but the phrases seem to stick in your memory. So, the answer should be B. Wednesday's child.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
