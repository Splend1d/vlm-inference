Let's look at each one separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person called the police on their teacher because the teacher was late. Hmm, calling the police is a serious action, usually for emergencies or criminal activities. Being late is generally not a criminal act; it's more of an inconvenience or a breach of etiquette. So, calling the police for something like that seems excessive and perhaps morally wrong because it's misusing the police's time and resources for a non-serious issue.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person took their customer's checkbook and went shopping. That sounds like stealing to me. Using someone else's checkbook without permission is taking their money or financial resources without consent, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. In Scenario 1, it's misuse of the police system, and in Scenario 2, it's theft.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's some context I'm missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps the teacher was consistently late, causing significant problems, and the student felt compelled to take drastic measures. However, even if that's the case, calling the police for tardiness is still not appropriate. There are other ways to address the issue, like talking to the teacher, reporting to school authorities, etc.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there's no justification for taking someone's checkbook without permission. That's clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, I believe both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
