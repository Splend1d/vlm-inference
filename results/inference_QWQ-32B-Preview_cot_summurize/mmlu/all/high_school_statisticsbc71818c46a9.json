                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about dice and winning money. Let me see if I can figure this out. Two dice are rolled at the same time. If both of them land on 6, the player wins $20. But if anything else happens, the player loses. And it costs $2 to play this game. I need to find out what the expected gain or loss per game is.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"expected\" means in this context. I think it's about calculating the average outcome if someone plays this game many times. So, I need to find the average gain or loss per game.\n\nTo do that, I should probably calculate the probability of winning and the probability of losing, and then see how much money is gained or lost on average.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the probability of both dice showing 6. Since each die has 6 faces, and they are rolled independently, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is 6 times 6, which is 36.\n\nNow, there's only one outcome where both dice show 6, right? That's when the first die is 6 and the second die is also 6. So, the probability of both dice showing 6 is 1 out of 36, which is approximately 0.0278, or about 2.78%.\n\nThe probability of not getting two 6s is therefore 1 minus the probability of getting two 6s, which is 1 - 1/36 = 35/36, which is about 0.9722, or 97.22%.\n\nNow, if the player wins $20 when both dice show 6, but it costs $2 to play, I need to calculate the net gain when winning. So, the net gain would be $20 minus the $2 cost, which is $18.\n\nIf the player doesn't win, which is in the other cases, the player loses the $2 cost, so the gain is -$2.\n\nTo find the expected gain, I need to multiply the gain in each scenario by the probability of that scenario happening, and then add them up.\n\nSo, expected gain = (probability of winning) * (net gain when winning) + (probability of losing) * (net gain when losing)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected gain = (1/36) * 18 + (35/36) * (-2)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, (1/36) * 18 = 18/36 = 0.5\n\nThen, (35/36) * (-2) = -70/36 \u2248 -1.9444\n\nNow, add them up: 0.5 + (-1.9444) = -1.4444\n\nSo, the expected gain is approximately -$1.44.\n\nThat means, on average, the player will lose about $1.44 per game.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The player will gain about $0.55.\n\nB. The player will gain about $1.44.\n\nC. The player will lose about $0.55.\n\nD. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nProbability of winning: 1/36\n\nNet gain when winning: $20 - $2 = $18\n\nProbability of losing: 35/36\n\nNet gain when losing: -$2\n\nExpected gain = (1/36)*18 + (35/36)*(-2)\n\nCalculate (1/36)*18:\n\n18 divided by 36 is 0.5\n\nCalculate (35/36)*(-2):\n\n35 divided by 36 is approximately 0.9722, multiplied by -2 is -1.9444\n\nAdd them up: 0.5 + (-1.9444) = -1.4444\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the expected loss is about $1.44 per game.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The player will lose about $1.44.\n\nI think that makes sense. The cost to play is $2, and the chance to win is pretty low, so on average, the player is expected to lose money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
