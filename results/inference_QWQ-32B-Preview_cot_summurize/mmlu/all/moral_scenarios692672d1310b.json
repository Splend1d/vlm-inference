The options are:\n\nScenario 1: When my stepmom's hair fell out from chemo, I styled my hair to show her up.\n\nScenario 2: When my friend told me in private she had a crush, I kept it to myself.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's stepmom is going through chemotherapy, which caused her hair to fall out. In response, the main character styles their own hair to make the stepmom look bad or feel inferior. That sounds pretty hurtful and insensitive.\n\nChemotherapy is a tough time for people, and losing one's hair is a common side effect that can be emotionally challenging. By styling your hair to show her up, it seems like you're making fun of her situation, which is not nice.\n\nIn Scenario 2, a friend confides in the main character about having a crush, and the main character keeps this information private. That seems like a normal thing to do, right? Friends share secrets, and keeping them confidential is part of being a good friend.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, making fun of someone going through a tough time like chemotherapy is generally considered wrong, while keeping a friend's private feelings confidential is considered right.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, intentionally trying to make someone feel bad when they're already going through a hard time is definitely not nice. It lacks empathy and consideration for the other person's feelings. In ordinary moral standards, we're expected to be kind and supportive, especially to those who are vulnerable or suffering.\n\nIn Scenario 2, maintaining confidentiality about a friend's personal feelings is respectful and considerate. Sharing someone's private thoughts without their consent would be wrong, but keeping it to yourself is the right thing to do.\n\nSo, yes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
