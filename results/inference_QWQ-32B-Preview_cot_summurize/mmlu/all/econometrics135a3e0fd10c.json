                    "text": "Let's see which statements about maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in the context of GARCH models are true. I'll go through each one step by step.\n\n**Statement (i):** \"Maximum likelihood estimation selects the parameter values that maximize the probability that we would have actually observed the values of the series y that we actually did.\"\n\nThis sounds like a basic definition of maximum likelihood estimation. In ML estimation, we choose the parameters that make the observed data most probable. So, this seems correct.\n\n**Statement (ii):** \"GARCH models can only be estimated by ML and not by OLS.\"\n\nI know that GARCH models are typically estimated using ML because the error terms are not independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which is an assumption of OLS. OLS might not be appropriate here because it doesn't account for the volatility clustering that GARCH models are designed to capture. So, I think this statement is true.\n\n**Statement (iii):** \"For estimation of a standard linear model (with no GARCH), the OLS and ML estimates for the slope and intercept parameters will be identical but the estimator for the variance of the disturbances is slightly different.\"\n\nIn a standard linear regression model with i.i.d. errors, OLS and ML estimators for the slope and intercept parameters are indeed identical. The ML estimator for the variance of the disturbances is the maximum likelihood estimate, which is slightly different from the OLS estimator in that it divides by n instead of n-k. So, this statement seems correct.\n\n**Statement (iv):** \"Most computer packages use numerical procedures to estimate GARCH models rather than a set of analytical formulae.\"\n\nGARCH models don't have closed-form solutions for their parameters, so numerical optimization methods are typically used to find the parameter estimates that maximize the likelihood function. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nSince all four statements seem to be true, the correct answer should be D. However, I should double-check if there's any catch or misunderstanding in any of these statements.\n\nLet me verify statement (i) again. ML estimation indeed aims to maximize the likelihood of observing the data given the parameters. So, no issue there.\n\nStatement (ii): GARCH models are not typically estimated using OLS because OLS assumes constant variance of errors, which contradicts the volatility clustering that GARCH models are designed to handle. So, ML is preferred.\n\nStatement (iii): In a standard linear model with i.i.d. errors, OLS and ML estimators for coefficients are identical, but the estimators for the error variance differ slightly in their denominators.\n\nStatement (iv): Due to the complexity of GARCH models, numerical methods are necessary for estimation, and that's what software packages use.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the answer should be D. All statements are true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
