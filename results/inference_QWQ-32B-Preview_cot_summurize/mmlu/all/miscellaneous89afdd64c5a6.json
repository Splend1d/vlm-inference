I remember that Richard Nixon was the 37th President of the United States, but I don't recall his middle name off the top of my head.\n\nI know that sometimes middle names can be a bit tricky to remember, especially for historical figures. Maybe I can think about other things I know about him that might give a clue. He was involved in politics for a long time, and he had a pretty eventful presidency with the Watergate scandal.\n\nBut that doesn't really help me with his middle name. Maybe I can try to eliminate some options. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is Michael. I don't think that's his middle name, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a possibility, but it doesn't ring a bell.\n\nOption B is Milhous. That seems familiar. I think I've seen or heard that before in relation to Richard Nixon. Maybe that's his middle name.\n\nOption C is Mortimer. I don't think that's his middle name, but again, I'm not sure. It might be from another president or historical figure.\n\nOption D is Matthew. Similarly, I don't recall that being his middle name.\n\nLet me try to recall any biographies or history lessons I've had about Richard Nixon. I seem to remember that his full name was Richard Milhous Nixon. Yes, that sounds right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how he was often referred to as \"Tricky Dick,\" but that doesn't help with his middle name.\n\nWait, maybe I can look this up online, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I should try to answer based on the options provided.\n\nGiven that, and recalling my history knowledge, I believe the correct answer is B. Milhous.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can cross-verify this with another approach. If I think about his parents' names or his family background, maybe that could give me a clue. Richard Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California, and his parents were Hannah Milhous Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. So his mother's maiden name was Milhous, which was given to him as his middle name.\n\nThat makes sense. It was a common practice to give children middle names related to the family, perhaps after grandparents or other relatives.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Milhous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
