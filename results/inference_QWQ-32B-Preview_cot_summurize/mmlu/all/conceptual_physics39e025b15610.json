Neither of these\n\nSo, I'm trying to figure out what happens when I brush my hair and some electrons get scraped off. I know that electrons are negatively charged particles, so if I'm scraping them off my hair, that means my hair is losing electrons. \n\nLet me think about this. If my hair is losing electrons, that means it's having fewer negative charges than before. So, does that make it positively charged? Wait, maybe I should recall what happens when an object loses electrons.\n\nIn physics, I remember that when an object loses electrons, it has more protons than electrons, right? Protons are positively charged, so if there are more protons than electrons, the overall charge should be positive.\n\nOn the other hand, if an object gains electrons, it has more electrons than protons, making it negatively charged.\n\nSo, in this case, since I'm scraping electrons from my hair, my hair is losing electrons, which should make it positively charged.\n\nBut, I've also heard that when you rub things together, like rubbing a balloon on your hair, electrons can be transferred, and that can cause static electricity. Is this similar?\n\nYes, brushing hair can also cause static electricity, especially in dry conditions. That's why sometimes your hair stands up or sticks to things after brushing.\n\nSo, if my hair is losing electrons, it's becoming positively charged. Therefore, the answer should be A. positive.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nIs it possible for the hair to become both positively and negatively charged at the same time? That would be option C. Both of these. But I don't think that's possible. An object can have either a positive or negative charge, but not both at the same time, unless it has different parts with different charges, but in this context, I don't think that's what they're asking.\n\nOption D is Neither of these. But if my hair is becoming positively charged, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the question is tricky. Maybe scraping electrons from hair doesn't necessarily mean losing electrons. Maybe it's gaining electrons.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"When you brush your hair and scrape electrons from your hair, the charge of your hair becomes...\"\n\nOkay, it says \"scrape electrons from your hair,\" which means removing electrons from your hair. So, your hair is losing electrons.\n\nTherefore, it should become positively charged.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the brush is scraping electrons from something else onto your hair. But the wording says \"from your hair,\" so it's from your hair to somewhere else.\n\nSo, hair is losing electrons, becoming positively charged.\n\nI think A. positive is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
