                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question step by step. I need to determine which one of these statements is true. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an equivalence relation and a partial-ordering relation are.\n\nAn equivalence relation on a set is a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. That means, for any elements a, b, and c in the set:\n\n- Reflexive: a is related to a.\n\n- Symmetric: If a is related to b, then b is related to a.\n\n- Transitive: If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c.\n\nOn the other hand, a partial-ordering relation is a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. So, for a partial order:\n\n- Reflexive: a is related to a.\n\n- Antisymmetric: If a is related to b and b is related to a, then a must be equal to b.\n\n- Transitive: If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c.\n\nComparing these, both are reflexive and transitive, but an equivalence relation is symmetric, while a partial order is antisymmetric.\n\nSymmetry and antisymmetry are different properties. In fact, the only relation that is both symmetric and antisymmetric is the equality relation.\n\nSo, not every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation because equivalence relations are symmetric, whereas partial orders are antisymmetric.\n\nTherefore, option A is false.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Number of relations from A = {x, y, z} to B = {1, 2} is 64.\"\n\nThis seems like a question about the number of possible relations between two sets.\n\nA relation from set A to set B is any subset of the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B.\n\nGiven A = {x, y, z} and B = {1, 2}, the Cartesian product A \u00d7 B would be:\n\n{(x,1), (x,2), (y,1), (y,2), (z,1), (z,2)}\n\nThere are 6 elements in A \u00d7 B.\n\nThe number of possible relations from A to B is equal to the number of subsets of A \u00d7 B, which is 2 raised to the power of the number of elements in A \u00d7 B.\n\nSo, 2^6 = 64.\n\nTherefore, the number of relations from A to B is indeed 64.\n\nSo, option B is true.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption C: \"Empty relation is reflexive.\"\n\nThe empty relation is the relation that contains no elements.\n\nFor a relation to be reflexive on a set A, every element of A must be related to itself.\n\nSo, for every a in A, (a, a) must be in the relation.\n\nBut the empty relation has no elements, so if A is non-empty, there will be elements a in A for which (a, a) is not in the relation.\n\nTherefore, the empty relation is not reflexive on any non-empty set.\n\nHowever, if A is empty, then the empty relation is reflexive on A because there are no elements in A to violate the condition.\n\nBut typically, when we talk about the empty relation, we consider it on a non-empty set, in which case it is not reflexive.\n\nSo, option C is false.\n\nOption D: \"Properties of a relation being symmetric and being unsymmetric are negative of each other.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"unsymmetric\" means in this context.\n\nSymmetry in relations means that if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) must also be in the relation.\n\nAn asymmetric relation is one where if (a, b) is in the relation, then (b, a) is not in the relation.\n\nHowever, there's also the concept of antisymmetry, which allows (a, b) and (b, a) only if a = b.\n\nBut the term \"unsymmetric\" isn't standard in relation properties. It might be a misstatement, and perhaps it's meant to be \"asymmetric.\"\n\nAssuming that \"unsymmetric\" means \"asymmetric,\" then we need to see if the properties of symmetry and asymmetry are negatives of each other.\n\nActually, symmetry and asymmetry are not exact negatives.\n\nA relation can be neither symmetric nor asymmetric. For example, consider the relation R = {(a, b), (b, a), (a, c)} on set {a, b, c}.\n\nThis relation is not symmetric because (a, c) is in R but (c, a) is not.\n\nIt's also not asymmetric because (a, b) and (b, a) are both in R.\n\nSo, there are relations that are neither symmetric nor asymmetric.\n\nTherefore, the negation of symmetry is not asymmetry, and vice versa.\n\nHence, option D is false.\n\nGiven that, the only true statement among the options is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
