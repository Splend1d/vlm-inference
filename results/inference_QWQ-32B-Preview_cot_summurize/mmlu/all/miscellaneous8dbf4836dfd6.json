The options are Bill Viola, Betye Saar, Damien Hirst, and Rachel Whiteread. I need to think about each one and see who fits the description best.\n\nFirst, Bill Viola. I know he's an American artist who's famous for his video art. He's been working with video for a long time, and his works often explore themes of life, death, and human experience. He's definitely known for using video projections in his installations. So, he seems like a strong candidate.\n\nNext, Betye Saar. She's an African-American artist who's been active since the 1960s. She's known for her assemblage work, which often incorporates found objects and explores issues of race and feminism. While her work is incredibly important, it's not primarily focused on image projection or videos. So, she might not be the best fit for this question.\n\nThen there's Damien Hirst. He's a British artist who's a major figure in the Young British Artists movement. He's known for his controversial works, like preserved animals in formaldehyde and spot paintings. While he's a contemporary artist, I don't recall him being particularly associated with image projection or videos. His work is more diverse, but video isn't his primary medium.\n\nLastly, Rachel Whiteread. She's another British artist known for her sculptures that often cast everyday objects and spaces, creating negative spaces that are thought-provoking. Her work is more sculptural and installation-based, but again, not primarily focused on image projection or videos.\n\nComparing all four, Bill Viola stands out as the artist who specifically uses image projection and videos in his contemporary installation art. His work is renowned for its multimedia approach, often incorporating large-scale video projections that engage the viewer in profound ways.\n\nI think the answer is A. Bill Viola.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
