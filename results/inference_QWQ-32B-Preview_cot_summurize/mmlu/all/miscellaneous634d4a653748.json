Acceleration.\n\nThis is based on Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by its acceleration. The formula is F = m * a, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration.\n\nTo understand why the other options are incorrect:\n\n- Velocity: While force can affect velocity (by changing an object's speed or direction), force is not directly equal to mass times velocity. Momentum is equal to mass times velocity (p = m * v), but that's a different concept.\n\n- Distance: Force and distance are related in terms of work (work = force * distance), but force isn't equal to mass times distance.\n\n- Weight: Weight is actually a type of force, specifically the force due to gravity. It's calculated as weight = mass * gravitational acceleration (w = m * g). So, while weight is a force, it's not what force equals mass times in the general sense.\n\nSo, remember, force equals mass times acceleration."
