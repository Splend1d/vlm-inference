                    "text": "The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in (a, b) where the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over [a, b].\n\nGiven the function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x on the interval [0, \u03c0], we need to find how many points satisfy the MVT.\n\nFirst, check if f(x) is continuous on [0, \u03c0] and differentiable on (0, \u03c0). Since sine functions are continuous and differentiable everywhere, f(x) meets these conditions.\n\nNext, compute the average rate of change of f(x) over [0, \u03c0]:\n\nAverage rate of change = [f(\u03c0) - f(0)] / (\u03c0 - 0)\n\nCalculate f(0):\n\nf(0) = 2 sin(0) + sin(0) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nCalculate f(\u03c0):\n\nf(\u03c0) = 2 sin(\u03c0) + sin(4\u03c0) = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nSo, average rate of change = (0 - 0) / \u03c0 = 0\n\nNow, find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x\n\nAccording to MVT, there exists at least one c in (0, \u03c0) such that f'(c) = 0\n\nSo, set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x in [0, \u03c0]:\n\n2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\ncos x + 2 cos 4x = 0\n\nUse the identity for cos 4x:\n\ncos 4x = 2 cos\u00b2 2x - 1\n\nBut it might be better to use cos 4x in terms of cos x.\n\nAlternatively, express cos 4x using multiple-angle formulas.\n\nAlternatively, solve the equation numerically or graphically.\n\nLet's try to express everything in terms of cos x.\n\nFirst, recall that cos 4x = 2 cos\u00b2 2x - 1\n\nAnd cos 2x = 2 cos\u00b2 x - 1\n\nSo, cos 4x = 2 (2 cos\u00b2 x - 1)\u00b2 - 1\n\nLet's compute that:\n\ncos 4x = 2 (4 cos\u2074 x - 4 cos\u00b2 x + 1) - 1\n\n= 8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 2 - 1\n\n= 8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 1\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation:\n\ncos x + 2 (8 cos\u2074 x - 8 cos\u00b2 x + 1) = 0\n\ncos x + 16 cos\u2074 x - 16 cos\u00b2 x + 2 = 0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider solving cos x + 2 cos 4x = 0 directly.\n\nLet\u2019s plot both cos x and -2 cos 4x and see where they intersect.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equation:\n\ncos x = -2 cos 4x\n\nWe can plot y = cos x and y = -2 cos 4x and find their intersection points in [0, \u03c0].\n\nAlternatively, use numerical methods or graphing calculator.\n\nAlternatively, consider the equation:\n\ncos x + 2 cos 4x = 0\n\nLet\u2019s use a substitution to simplify.\n\nLet\u2019s set u = cos x\n\nThen, cos 4x = 2 cos\u00b2 2x - 1\n\nAnd cos 2x = 2 cos\u00b2 x - 1 = 2u\u00b2 - 1\n\nSo, cos 4x = 2 (2u\u00b2 - 1)\u00b2 - 1\n\nCompute that:\n\ncos 4x = 2 (4u\u2074 - 4u\u00b2 + 1) - 1\n\n= 8u\u2074 - 8u\u00b2 + 2 - 1\n\n= 8u\u2074 - 8u\u00b2 + 1\n\nNow, substitute back into the equation:\n\nu + 2 (8u\u2074 - 8u\u00b2 + 1) = 0\n\nu + 16u\u2074 - 16u\u00b2 + 2 = 0\n\nRearrange:\n\n16u\u2074 - 16u\u00b2 + u + 2 = 0\n\nThis is a quartic equation, which might be difficult to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, consider factoring or numerical methods.\n\nAlternatively, consider using trigonometric identities to simplify the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, consider expressing everything in terms of sin x or other trigonometric identities.\n\nAlternatively, consider using a graphing approach to estimate the number of solutions.\n\nGiven that we are working within [0, \u03c0], let's consider the behavior of the functions involved.\n\nFirst, plot cos x and -2 cos 4x on [0, \u03c0].\n\nCos x starts at 1, decreases to 0 at \u03c0/2, and decreases to -1 at \u03c0.\n\n-2 cos 4x oscillates more rapidly, with period \u03c0/2, amplitude 2, reflected over the x-axis.\n\nAlternatively, consider the derivative f'(x) = 2 cos x + 4 cos 4x\n\nSet f'(x) = 0:\n\n2 cos x + 4 cos 4x = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ncos x + 2 cos 4x = 0\n\nNow, let's consider solving this equation graphically.\n\nPlot y = cos x and y = -2 cos 4x on the same axes for x in [0, \u03c0], and count the number of intersection points.\n\nAlternatively, consider the function g(x) = cos x + 2 cos 4x, and find the number of roots in [0, \u03c0].\n\nAlternatively, consider using calculus to find the number of times g(x) crosses the x-axis.\n\nFirst, find the critical points of g(x) by taking its derivative:\n\ng'(x) = -sin x - 8 sin 4x\n\nSet g'(x) = 0:\n\n-sin x - 8 sin 4x = 0\n\nsin x + 8 sin 4x = 0\n\nThis might not be easier to solve.\n\nAlternatively, consider the behavior of g(x) at key points in [0, \u03c0].\n\nEvaluate g(x) at x = 0, \u03c0/4, \u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/4, \u03c0.\n\nCompute g(0):\n\ncos(0) + 2 cos(0) = 1 + 2(1) = 3\n\nCompute g(\u03c0/4):\n\ncos(\u03c0/4) + 2 cos(\u03c0) = (\u221a2)/2 + 2(-1) = (\u221a2)/2 - 2 \u2248 0.707 - 2 = -1.293\n\nCompute g(\u03c0/2):\n\ncos(\u03c0/2) + 2 cos(2\u03c0) = 0 + 2(1) = 2\n\nCompute g(3\u03c0/4):\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) + 2 cos(3\u03c0) = (-\u221a2)/2 + 2(-1) = (-\u221a2)/2 - 2 \u2248 -0.707 - 2 = -2.707\n\nCompute g(\u03c0):\n\ncos(\u03c0) + 2 cos(4\u03c0) = (-1) + 2(1) = 1\n\nNow, plot these points:\n\nx | g(x)\n\n0 | 3\n\n\u03c0/4 | -1.293\n\n\u03c0/2 | 2\n\n3\u03c0/4 | -2.707\n\n\u03c0 | 1\n\nFrom this, we can see that g(x) changes sign between:\n\n- 0 and \u03c0/4: 3 to -1.293 \u2192 one root\n\n- \u03c0/4 and \u03c0/2: -1.293 to 2 \u2192 one root\n\n- \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/4: 2 to -2.707 \u2192 one root\n\n- 3\u03c0/4 and \u03c0: -2.707 to 1 \u2192 one root\n\nSo, there are at least 4 sign changes, suggesting at least 4 roots.\n\nHowever, since g(x) is continuous, and we have 4 sign changes, there are at least 4 roots.\n\nBut to confirm the exact number, consider the behavior and possible multiple roots.\n\nAlternatively, consider that g(x) is a sum of cosines with different frequencies, and in [0, \u03c0], cos x has one period from 0 to \u03c0, while cos 4x has 4 periods in [0, 2\u03c0], so in [0, \u03c0], it has 2 periods.\n\nThus, cos x and cos 4x can intersect multiple times.\n\nGiven the earlier analysis suggesting 4 sign changes, and hence at least 4 roots, and considering the functions' behaviors, it's likely there are exactly 4 points where f'(x) = 0 in [0, \u03c0].\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 4\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
