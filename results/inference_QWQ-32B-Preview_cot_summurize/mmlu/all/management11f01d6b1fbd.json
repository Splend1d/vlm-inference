Heuristics are like mental shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly, but sometimes they can lead to biases or errors in our judgments. The term \"rule of thumb\" suggests a general guideline or a simple approach based on experience rather than a strict rule, which aligns with the concept of heuristics.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure:\n\nA. Framing bias: This is when people make decisions based on how information is presented or \"framed\" rather than on the actual content. For example, people might prefer a treatment described as having a 90% success rate over one described as having a 10% failure rate, even though they're the same.\n\nB. Hindsight bias: This is the \"I knew it all along\" effect, where people believe after an event that they predicted or expected the outcome, even if they didn't.\n\nC. Over-confidence bias: This is when people have too much confidence in their own judgments or abilities, leading them to make overgeneralizations or ignore contradictory evidence.\n\nD. Heuristics: As I said, these are mental shortcuts that can sometimes lead to biases.\n\nSo, while all these are types of biases in decision making, the one that most closely matches the idea of a \"rule of thumb\" is heuristics. Rules of thumb are often based on experience and general principles, which is what heuristics are all about.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
