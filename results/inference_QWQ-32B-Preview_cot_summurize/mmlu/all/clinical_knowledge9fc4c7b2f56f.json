The enzymes involved in glycolysis are all located in the cytoplasm, where they catalyze the series of reactions that make up this process.\n\nTo provide a bit more context, glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy in the form of ATP. It consists of ten steps, each catalyzed by a specific enzyme. The process does not require oxygen and is therefore anaerobic. The end products of glycolysis are two pyruvate molecules, two NADH molecules, and two ATP molecules (though there is a net gain of two ATP molecules after accounting for the initial investment of energy).\n\nAfter glycolysis, the pyruvate molecules can enter the mitochondria for further processing in the presence of oxygen, through the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. However, the enzymes of glycolysis themselves are strictly cytoplasmic.\n\nOption A, the mitochondrion, is where the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation take place, but not glycolysis.\n\nOption B, the nucleus, contains the cell's genetic material and is involved in processes like DNA replication and gene expression, but not glycolysis.\n\nOption D, lysosomes, are responsible for breaking down waste materials and cellular debris, and are not involved in glycolysis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. cytoplasm."
