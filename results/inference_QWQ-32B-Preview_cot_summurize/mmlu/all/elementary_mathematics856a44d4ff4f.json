                    "text": "Let's see here. There are 72 students on the dance team, and 4 over 9 take tap lessons. I need to find out how many students that is. So, 4 over 9 means 4/9 of the students take tap lessons. To find out how many that is, I should multiply 4/9 by the total number of students, which is 72.\n\nSo, it's 4/9 * 72. Let me calculate that. First, I can simplify the fraction multiplication. 72 divided by 9 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 4 is 32. So, 4/9 of 72 is 32.\n\nLet me check that again to make sure. 4/9 * 72. Yeah, 72 divided by 9 is 8, and 8 times 4 is 32. That seems right.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 32\n\nB. 49\n\nC. 63\n\nD. 68\n\nSo, A is 32, which matches what I calculated. But wait, let me see if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs there a possibility that \"4 over 9\" means something else? Like, maybe it's a ratio or something. But in this context, it seems clear that it means 4/9 of the students take tap lessons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 4 out of 9 students, but again, that's the same as 4/9.\n\nSo, unless there's some other interpretation, it seems like 32 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me consider if there might be a mistake in the calculation. 4/9 of 72:\n\n4/9 * 72 = (4 * 72) / 9.\n\n4 * 72 is 288.\n\n288 divided by 9 is 32.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions. If 9 parts represent 72 students, then 1 part represents 72 / 9 = 8 students. Therefore, 4 parts would be 4 * 8 = 32 students.\n\nThat's another way to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of decimals, 4/9 is approximately 0.444..., and 0.444... times 72 is approximately 32.\n\nBut since we're dealing with whole students, and 4/9 * 72 comes out exactly to 32, there's no need for approximation.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. The answer should be 32, which is option A.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption B is 49. That's close to half of 72, which is 36, but 4/9 is less than half, so 49 is too high.\n\nOption C is 63. That's 7/9 of 72, because 7*8=56 and 56+7=63. But we're dealing with 4/9, not 7/9.\n\nOption D is 68. That's even higher than 63, which is clearly too high for 4/9 of 72.\n\nSo, again, 32 is the only logical choice.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. The answer is A. 32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
