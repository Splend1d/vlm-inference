They never last very long\n\nD. They are very rare\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what age stereotypes are. Age stereotypes are generalized beliefs or expectations about characteristics or behaviors associated with particular age groups. These can be about young people, middle-aged adults, or older adults.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nOption A says positive ones are stronger. That would mean that people generally have more positive beliefs about different age groups. But is that really the case? I think in many societies, there are a lot of negative perceptions about certain age groups, like teenagers being irresponsible or older people being forgetful.\n\nOption B says negative ones are stronger. This seems plausible because often stereotypes tend to highlight negative traits. For example, young people might be stereotyped as lazy or rebellious, while older people might be seen as tech-illiterate or set in their ways.\n\nOption C says they never last very long. Stereotypes, by their nature, are enduring beliefs that persist over time. So, this seems unlikely. Stereotypes can be quite persistent and resist change even in the face of contradictory evidence.\n\nOption D says they are very rare. But stereotypes are quite common in societies. They are mental shortcuts that help us make sense of the world, but they can also lead to prejudice and discrimination.\n\nGiven this, I think Option B, negative ones are stronger, is the most accurate. Research in social psychology suggests that negative stereotypes tend to be more prominent and have a greater impact on behavior and attitudes than positive stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, studies have shown that negative age stereotypes can affect older adults' health and well-being. If older people internalize negative stereotypes about their capabilities, it can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where they perform worse on tasks than they otherwise would.\n\nAdditionally, negative stereotypes can influence how different age groups are treated by others. For example, older job applicants might face ageism in the workplace, or teenagers might be subjected to harsher disciplinary measures based on stereotypes about their behavior.\n\nIt's also worth noting that positive stereotypes exist, but they might not have the same detrimental effects as negative ones. However, positive stereotypes can still be limiting and overlook individual differences within age groups.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the understanding of how stereotypes work and the impact they have, it seems that negative age stereotypes are stronger and more pervasive than positive ones.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
