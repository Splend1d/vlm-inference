                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Chlorine gas reacts most readily with...\" and then it lists options A. toluene, B. ethylene, C. ethanoic acid, and D. ethane. I need to figure out which one reacts most readily with chlorine gas.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what \"reacts most readily\" means. I think it means which of these substances is most likely to undergo a chemical reaction with chlorine gas under normal conditions. So, I need to consider the reactivity of each of these compounds with chlorine.\n\nLet me start by recalling some general chemistry. Chlorine is a highly reactive element; it's a member of the halogen group, and it's known for its ability to form compounds with many other elements. In organic chemistry, chlorine can react with alkanes, alkenes, aromatic compounds, and even carboxylic acids under certain conditions.\n\nOption A is toluene. Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically a methylbenzene. Aromatics can undergo substitution reactions with chlorine, particularly in the presence of a catalyst like ferric chloride (FeCl3). However, this reaction isn't instantaneous; it requires some energy and a catalyst to proceed.\n\nOption B is ethylene, which is an alkene, C2H4. Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with a carbon-carbon double bond. Chlorine can add across the double bond in an electrophilic addition reaction. This reaction is pretty fast and doesn't require a lot of activation energy. In fact, alkenes are commonly halogenated in this way.\n\nOption C is ethanoic acid, also known as acetic acid, CH3COOH. Carboxylic acids can react with chlorine, but this is usually under more extreme conditions or in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst. The reaction might involve chlorination of the methyl group or other substitutions, but it's not as straightforward as with alkenes or alkanes.\n\nOption D is ethane, which is an alkane, C2H6. Alkanes can undergo free radical halogenation with chlorine, but this reaction is typically slower and requires UV light or heat to initiate the free radical chain reaction.\n\nComparing these options, ethylene (option B) seems to react most readily with chlorine gas because the electrophilic addition to the double bond is a fast and exothermic process that doesn't require a catalyst or extreme conditions.\n\nToluene (option A) requires a catalyst and might not react as quickly as ethylene. Ethanoic acid (option C) would likely require more extreme conditions or a catalyst to react with chlorine, making it less reactive under normal conditions. Ethane (option D) requires initiation energy to start the free radical reaction, which makes it less reactive compared to ethylene.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. ethylene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
