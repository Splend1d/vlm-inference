Each level contains two stages, making a total of six stages.\n\n1. **Preconventional Level:**\n   - **Stage 1:** Obedience and Punishment Orientation. At this stage, individuals follow rules to avoid punishment.\n   - **Stage 2:** Individualism and Exchange. Here, morality is based on what serves one's own needs and occasional considerations of others' needs.\n\n2. **Conventional Level:**\n   - **Stage 3:** Good Interpersonal Relationships. Morality is defined by maintaining good social relationships and being liked by others.\n   - **Stage 4:** Maintaining Social Order. At this stage, individuals adhere to social rules and laws to maintain societal order and stability.\n\n3. **Postconventional Level:**\n   - **Stage 5:** Social Contract and Individual Rights. Here, individuals begin to consider the reasons behind laws and rules, and they value individual rights and the social contract.\n   - **Stage 6:** Universal Principles. At the highest stage, individuals make moral decisions based on self-chosen ethical principles that may or may not align with the prevailing moral views of their society.\n\nOption D accurately describes the postconventional level, particularly Stage 6, where individuals develop their own moral principles, which may or may not coincide with the dominant morals of their time. This level involves abstract thinking and a focus on universal ethical principles rather than societal norms or personal interests.\n\nOptions A and B describe the preconventional level, where morality is based on avoiding punishment or obtaining rewards. Option C pertains to the conventional level, where morality is defined by conforming to the expectations of others, especially authority figures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D."
