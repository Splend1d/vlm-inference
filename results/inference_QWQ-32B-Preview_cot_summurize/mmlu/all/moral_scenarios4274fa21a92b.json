That's part of their job and ethical responsibilities. They shouldn't share personal information with family members without permission. So, that's not wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, pushing your sister on a swing at the park seems like a normal sibling activity. Maybe they're playing or having fun. Unless it was done in a harmful way, which isn't mentioned, it's probably not wrong.\n\nSo, neither scenario shows the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
