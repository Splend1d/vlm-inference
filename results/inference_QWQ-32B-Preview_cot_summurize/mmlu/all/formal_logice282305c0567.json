Iwjk, B. Ijkw, C. Ikjw, D. Iwkj. I need to pick the best one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the predicate Ixyz means. It says \"x introduces y to z.\" So, in this context, x is the person doing the introducing, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person being introduced to.\n\nNow, looking at the sentence: \"Kevin is introduced to Jos\u00e9 by Wilma.\" So, Kevin is being introduced to Jos\u00e9, and Wilma is the one doing the introducing.\n\nSo, in this case, x should be Wilma, because she's doing the introducing. Y should be Kevin, because he's the one being introduced, and z should be Jos\u00e9, who he's being introduced to.\n\nSo, plugging in the symbols: x is w (Wilma), y is k (Kevin), and z is j (Jos\u00e9). Therefore, the predicate should be Iwkj.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Iwjk\n\nB. Ijkw\n\nC. Ikjw\n\nD. Iwkj\n\nSo, Iwkj matches option D.\n\nBut wait, option D is Iwkj, which is I-w-k-j, which would be Wilma introduces Kevin to Jos\u00e9, which matches the sentence.\n\nOption A is Iwjk, which would be Wilma introduces Jos\u00e9 to Kevin, which is different.\n\nOption B is Ijkw, which would be Jos\u00e9 introduces Kevin to Wilma.\n\nOption C is Ikjw, which would be Kevin introduces Jos\u00e9 to Wilma.\n\nNone of these match the original sentence except for D.\n\nWait, but in option D, Iwkj, that would be Wilma introduces Kevin to Jos\u00e9, which is what the sentence says: Kevin is introduced to Jos\u00e9 by Wilma.\n\nSo, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut let me double-check. The order in the predicate is Ixyz: x introduces y to z.\n\nSo, x is the introducer, y is the one being introduced, and z is the one to whom they're being introduced.\n\nIn the sentence, Wilma is introducing Kevin to Jos\u00e9.\n\nSo, x is w, y is k, z is j.\n\nTherefore, Iwkj, which is option D.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the predicate was defined differently, say Ixyz means x introduces z to y, then it would be different, but according to the given definition, Ixyz means x introduces y to z.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
