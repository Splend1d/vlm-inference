                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the kinked demand curve. So, the kinked demand curve model is a theory in oligopoly markets where firms face a demand curve that has a kink at the going market price. This kink reflects the idea that if one firm raises its price above the market price, its competitors won't follow, and it will lose a lot of customers. Conversely, if it lowers its price, competitors will match the price cut to avoid losing customers.\n\nNow, let's look at each option to see which one isn't correct.\n\nOption A says, \"There is no price leader.\" In the kinked demand curve model, there isn't a single firm that sets the price for the entire market. Instead, firms tend to follow each other's prices, and there's a sort of implicit understanding or coordination on the current price level. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B says, \"There are relatively equal shares of the market.\" The kinked demand curve model doesn't necessarily require that all firms have equal market shares. It can apply to situations where firms have similar sizes or different sizes, as long as they are interdependent in their pricing decisions. So, this might not be entirely accurate, but it's not necessarily incorrect either.\n\nOption C says, \"Price is greater than marginal costs.\" In most oligopoly models, including the kinked demand curve, firms set prices above marginal costs because they have some market power. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption D says, \"The demand curve is of one continuous function.\" Hmm, this is interesting. In the kinked demand curve model, the demand curve isn't a single smooth curve; it has a kink at the going market price. This means that the marginal revenue curve is discontinuous at that point, which can lead to a stable equilibrium where price equals marginal cost only at the kink point. So, saying that the demand curve is of one continuous function isn't correct in this model.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Is the demand curve in the kinked demand curve model continuous or not? Well, the demand curve itself has a kink, which means it's not differentiable at that point, but it is still continuous; it doesn't have a break. The kink represents a change in the slope, not a discontinuity.\n\nBut in the context of the question, \"the demand curve is of one continuous function\" might be interpreted as whether the demand curve is described by a single equation or function without breaks. In the kinked demand curve model, the demand curve is typically described by two different functions: one above the kink and one below it. So, in that sense, it's not a single continuous function but rather a piecewise function.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the one that's not correct because the demand curve in the kinked demand curve model is composed of two different functions, not one continuous function.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider again:\n\n- Option A: No price leader \u2013 correct in the kinked demand curve model.\n\n- Option B: Relatively equal shares \u2013 not necessarily required, but possible.\n\n- Option C: Price > marginal cost \u2013 generally correct in oligopoly.\n\n- Option D: Demand curve is one continuous function \u2013 not accurate in the kinked demand curve model.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but in mathematics, a continuous function can be piecewise defined as long as there are no jumps or breaks. So, the demand curve in the kinked model is continuous but not differentiable at the kink point.\n\nHowever, in the context of economics and this multiple-choice question, I think the intention is to identify that the demand curve isn't described by a single function but rather by two different functions above and below the kink.\n\nSo, based on that, I'll go with D as the incorrect statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
