                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out which statement about informal carers is true based on data from 2020. Informal carers are people who provide unpaid care to family members or friends, often because they have a long-term illness, disability, or other care needs.\n\nOption A says that 50% of over 65s are providing informal care. That seems pretty high. I doubt that half of all people over 65 are caring for someone informally. Maybe a significant number, but 50% sounds too much.\n\nOption B says one in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care. That sounds more plausible. One in six would be around 16.6%, which seems more reasonable for the proportion of older adults providing care.\n\nOption C claims that informal carers should not be included in discharge planning. Discharge planning is part of healthcare when someone is being released from a hospital or care facility. It's important to include informal carers in this process because they often play a crucial role in supporting the person at home. So, this statement seems false; they should be included, not excluded.\n\nOption D says that the majority of informal carers are fit and active. I'm not sure about this. Informal carers can be of any age and health status. In fact, many carers might experience stress and health issues due to the demands of caring, so saying the majority are fit and active might not be accurate.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most accurate. One in six over 65s providing some form of informal care aligns with what I've read about caregiving statistics. Also, excluding carers from discharge planning is counterproductive, so option C is definitely false. Options A and D seem less accurate based on my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
