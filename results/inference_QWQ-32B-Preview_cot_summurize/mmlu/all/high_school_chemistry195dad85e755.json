                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the pH of the resulting solution when a 50.0 mL sample of 0.0025 M HBr is mixed with 50.0 mL of 0.0023 M KOH. HBr is a strong acid, and KOH is a strong base, so they will completely react with each other in a neutralization reaction.\n\nFirst, let's write the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:\n\n\\[ \\text{HBr} + \\text{KOH} \\rightarrow \\text{KBr} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nFrom the equation, we can see that one mole of HBr reacts with one mole of KOH.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of moles of HBr and KOH present in the solutions.\n\nFor HBr:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of HBr} = \\text{volume (L)} \\times \\text{concentration (M)} = 0.0500 \\, \\text{L} \\times 0.0025 \\, \\text{M} = 0.000125 \\, \\text{moles} \\]\n\nFor KOH:\n\n\\[ \\text{moles of KOH} = \\text{volume (L)} \\times \\text{concentration (M)} = 0.0500 \\, \\text{L} \\times 0.0023 \\, \\text{M} = 0.000115 \\, \\text{moles} \\]\n\nNow, we compare the moles of HBr and KOH to determine which one is in excess.\n\nSince 0.000125 moles of HBr > 0.000115 moles of KOH, HBr is in excess.\n\nThe amount of HBr that reacts with KOH is equal to the moles of KOH present, which is 0.000115 moles. Therefore, the moles of HBr remaining after the reaction are:\n\n\\[ \\text{excess moles of HBr} = 0.000125 \\, \\text{moles} - 0.000115 \\, \\text{moles} = 0.000010 \\, \\text{moles} \\]\n\nThe total volume of the resulting solution is the sum of the volumes of the two solutions:\n\n\\[ \\text{total volume} = 50.0 \\, \\text{mL} + 50.0 \\, \\text{mL} = 100.0 \\, \\text{mL} = 0.1000 \\, \\text{L} \\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentration of the remaining HBr in the solution:\n\n\\[ \\text{concentration of H}^+ = \\frac{\\text{excess moles of HBr}}{\\text{total volume}} = \\frac{0.000010 \\, \\text{moles}}{0.1000 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.00010 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nFinally, we can find the pH of the solution using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{pH} = -\\log[\\text{H}^+] = -\\log(0.00010) = 4 \\]\n\nTherefore, the pH of the resulting mixture is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
