                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with multiple transactions and parties involved, so I need to make sure I understand the sequence of events and the legal principles at play.\n\nFirst, there's a landlord who owns a three-story house in fee simple. He leases it to a tenant for 10 years, with a monthly rental of $300 and a covenant for the tenant to pay taxes during the lease term. The lease also has a clause prohibiting assignments or subleases.\n\nThe tenant lives there for two years, then assigns his leasehold interest to a student, who was unaware of the no-assignment clause. The assignment says the student will pay $300 monthly rent but is silent on taxes. The landlord doesn't object to this assignment.\n\nSix months after the assignment, the landlord sells the property to a new owner. The student fails to pay taxes, and the new owner pays them, then sues the student for the amount.\n\nWe need to decide who should win: the new owner or the student. The options suggest various legal reasons why the student might not be liable.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Original Lease Terms:**\n\n- Tenant agrees to pay $300 monthly rent.\n\n- Tenant agrees to pay taxes during the lease term.\n\n- No assignment or subleasing allowed.\n\n2. **Tenant's Assignment to Student:**\n\n- Tenant assigns leasehold interest to student.\n\n- Assignment states student will pay $300 monthly rent.\n\n- Silent on taxes.\n\n- Landlord doesn't object to the assignment.\n\n3. **Landlord Sells to New Owner:**\n\n- After the assignment, landlord sells the property to a new owner.\n\n- Student fails to pay taxes.\n\n- New owner pays taxes and sues student for the amount.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the student is liable for paying the taxes to the new owner.\n\nFirst, let's consider the assignment. The original lease prohibited assignments, but the landlord didn't object to this one. In lease law, if a landlord accepts rent from an assignee without objection, it may be considered consent to the assignment. So, perhaps the assignment is valid despite the prohibition.\n\nNext, the assignment states that the student will pay $300 monthly rent but is silent on taxes. Does this mean the student isn't responsible for taxes?\n\nIn contract law, an assignment generally transfers only the rights and duties expressly assigned, unless there's an intention to transfer more. Since the assignment only mentions rent, one might argue that the tax payment obligation isn't transferred.\n\nHowever, in property law, covenants in a lease can \"run with the land\" and bind assignees if certain conditions are met.\n\nConditions for a covenant to run with the land:\n\n- The covenant must touch and concern the land.\n\n- The original parties must have intended the covenant to run with the land.\n\n- There must be privity of estate between the original party and the successor.\n\nIn this case, the covenant to pay taxes touches and concerns the land because taxes are levied on the property. Intent is probably present since it's a standard lease term. Privity of estate exists between the original landlord and the tenant, and the tenant's assignee (student) has a leasehold interest.\n\nTherefore, the student, as the assignee, might be bound by the covenant to pay taxes, even though it's not expressly mentioned in the assignment.\n\nBut, there's a twist: the landlord sold the property to a new owner after the assignment. Does this affect the student's obligations?\n\nWhen the landlord sold the property, the new owner stepped into the landlord's shoes and acquired the reversionary interest. The student's leasehold interest remains, and the covenants in the lease should continue to bind the student.\n\nSo, the new owner, as the current landlord, should be entitled to enforce the student's obligation to pay taxes.\n\nHowever, option B says the student didn't contract with the tenant to pay taxes, which is true\u2014the assignment only mentions rent. But, as discussed, the covenant to pay taxes might still bind the student through the running of the covenant with the land.\n\nOption C mentions that the covenant to pay taxes won't run with the land unless clearly expressed. But in standard lease practice, tax payment covenants are typically considered to run with the land.\n\nOption D says the covenant is merely collateral and doesn't run with the land. Collateral covenants are those that don't touch and concern the land, and they generally don't run with the land. However, a covenant to pay taxes directly affects the land and its ownership, so it's likely not a collateral covenant.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems the student is bound by the covenant to pay taxes, and the new owner, as the current landlord, should be able to enforce this against the student.\n\nTherefore, judgment should be for the new owner (option A).\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any defenses for the student.\n\nOne possible defense is that the assignment didn't include the tax payment obligation, and the student was unaware of the original lease terms. However, in property law, assignees of leasehold interests are generally bound by the original lease covenants that run with the land, regardless of whether they were expressly mentioned in the assignment.\n\nAnother defense could be that the landlord's acceptance of the assignment despite the no-assignment clause somehow voids the original lease terms. But, as mentioned earlier, the landlord's acceptance of rent from the assignee may be deemed consent to the assignment, making it valid.\n\nMoreover, the student had actual notice of the no-assignment clause since the assignment occurred despite it, and the student was unaware of it. However, ignorance of the lease terms doesn't typically excuse the assignee from complying with the original covenants that run with the land.\n\nTherefore, despite the student's lack of knowledge, the covenant to pay taxes likely still binds the student.\n\nIn conclusion, the judgment should be for the new owner (option A).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
