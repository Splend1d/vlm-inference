                    "text": "So I've got this question here about DDoS and DOS attacks, and I need to figure out how they differ primarily. The options are about the goal, the number of computers being attacked, the number of computers launching the attack, and the time period of the attack. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I know that both DDoS and DOS are types of cyberattacks that aim to make a service unavailable to its intended users. So, the goal seems similar\u2014disrupting access to a service or website. Maybe the goal isn't the differing factor here.\n\nOption B says \"the number of computers being attacked.\" Hmm, actually, in both cases, it's usually one specific target that's being attacked, whether it's a server, a network, or a service. So, I don't think the number of computers being attacked differs between DDoS and DOS.\n\nOption C is \"the number of computers launching the attack.\" Now, this sounds familiar. I recall that in a DOS attack, it's typically one attacker using a single computer or a small number of computers to flood the target with traffic or overwhelm it in some way. On the other hand, a DDoS attack involves multiple computers, often hundreds or even thousands, coordinated together to launch the attack. So, the \"distributed\" part refers to the fact that the attack comes from many different sources.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the primary difference is the number of computers launching the attack, with DDoS involving multiple, distributed machines.\n\nOption D is \"the time period in which the attack occurs.\" I don't think that's the main difference. Both DOS and DDoS can be sustained over a period of time, but the duration isn't what fundamentally distinguishes them.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is C: the number of computers launching the attack.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
