The question is: \"The somatic nervous system is part of the...\" and then it gives four options: A. central nervous system, B. peripheral nervous system, C. autonomic nervous system, and D. parasympathetic nervous system.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the somatic nervous system is. I remember that it's involved with voluntary movements of our body, like when we decide to move our muscles. It's different from the autonomic nervous system, which handles involuntary actions, like digestion and heart rate.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is the autonomic nervous system, which I know is separate from the somatic nervous system. So, maybe that's not the right answer.\n\nOption D is the parasympathetic nervous system. I think that's a part of the autonomic nervous system, right? It's involved in resting and digesting functions. So, again, that seems different from the somatic nervous system.\n\nOption A is the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord. I think the somatic nervous system is more about the nerves that connect the central nervous system to the muscles and senses. So, maybe it's not part of the central nervous system.\n\nOption B is the peripheral nervous system. I recall that the peripheral nervous system includes all the nerves that are outside the brain and spinal cord. It connects the central nervous system to the rest of the body. I think the somatic nervous system is a part of the peripheral nervous system because it deals with sensory and motor functions that are outside the central nervous system.\n\nLet me double-check. The peripheral nervous system is divided into two main parts: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. So, if that's the case, then the somatic nervous system is indeed part of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nAlso, I remember that the autonomic nervous system is further divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which manage the fight or flight and rest and digest responses, respectively.\n\nSo, going back to the options, B. peripheral nervous system seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nA. Central nervous system: This includes the brain and spinal cord only. The somatic nervous system involves nerves that extend from the spinal cord to the muscles and senses, so it's not entirely part of the central nervous system.\n\nB. Peripheral nervous system: This includes all the nerves outside the central nervous system, which matches the somatic nervous system's function.\n\nC. Autonomic nervous system: This is responsible for involuntary functions and is separate from the somatic nervous system.\n\nD. Parasympathetic nervous system: This is a part of the autonomic nervous system, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. peripheral nervous system.\n\nI think that makes sense. I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
