                    "text": "So I've got this question about grapes and supply and demand. It says that both the demand for grapes and the supply of grapes are increasing at the same time, and I need to figure out what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. The options are:\n\nA. Equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.\n\nB. Equilibrium quantity falls, but the price change is ambiguous.\n\nC. Equilibrium quantity rises, and the price rises.\n\nD. Equilibrium quantity falls, and the price falls.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember how supply and demand work. I know that when demand increases, the demand curve shifts to the right, which usually leads to a higher price and a higher quantity in equilibrium. Similarly, when supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right, which typically results in a lower price and a higher quantity.\n\nBut here, both demand and supply are increasing at the same time. So, the demand curve shifts right, and the supply curve also shifts right. Now, I need to figure out what happens to price and quantity when both of these shifts occur simultaneously.\n\nI think the equilibrium quantity will definitely increase because both shifts are to the right. So, more quantity is being demanded and supplied. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut the price is trickier. Normally, an increase in demand would push the price up, and an increase in supply would push the price down. So, in this case, these two effects are working in opposite directions. That means the overall effect on price is uncertain or ambiguous.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine a graph with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. The original demand curve is D1, and the original supply curve is S1. Their intersection is the initial equilibrium point, with price P1 and quantity Q1.\n\nNow, both demand and supply increase. So, the demand curve shifts to D2 (to the right of D1), and the supply curve shifts to S2 (also to the right of S1). The new equilibrium will be at the intersection of D2 and S2, let's say at price P2 and quantity Q2.\n\nSince both curves are shifting to the right, the quantity will increase from Q1 to Q2. But for the price, it depends on which shift is larger\u2014demand or supply.\n\nIf the increase in demand is greater than the increase in supply, the price might rise from P1 to P2.\n\nIf the increase in supply is greater than the increase in demand, the price might fall from P1 to P2.\n\nAnd if they are equal, maybe the price stays the same.\n\nSo, because we don't know the relative magnitudes of the shifts, the price change is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.\n\nThat matches option A.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any scenario where equilibrium quantity falls when both demand and supply increase? That seems unlikely. Both shifts are to the right, so quantity should increase.\n\nOption B says equilibrium quantity falls, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C says equilibrium quantity rises and price rises. Well, quantity rises, but price could rise, fall, or stay the same, depending on the relative shifts.\n\nOption D says equilibrium quantity falls and price falls, which again doesn't make sense given both curves are shifting to the right.\n\nSo, A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider specific examples.\n\nSuppose grapes become really popular, so demand increases. At the same time, farmers plant more grapevines, so supply increases.\n\nIf the popularity surge is huge and supply takes time to catch up, initially, price might rise even if supply is increasing, but if supply increases sufficiently, price might stabilize or even fall.\n\nSo, without knowing the extent of each shift, price is uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: equilibrium quantity rises, but the price change is ambiguous.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
