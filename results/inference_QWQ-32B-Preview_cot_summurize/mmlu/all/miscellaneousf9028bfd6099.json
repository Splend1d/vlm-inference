These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.

                    "text": "Let's take a closer look at that passage from Zora Neale Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God.\" It's a beautiful and vivid description, isn't it? So, the question is about the second sentence: \"The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky.\" We need to identify which literary device is used here. The options are foreshadowing, irony, flashback, or personification.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these terms means. Foreshadowing is when an author gives hints about what's to come later in the story. Irony is when there's a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens. A flashback is a scene that takes the narrative back in time to provide background information. Personification is giving human qualities to non-human things.\n\nNow, looking at the sentence: \"The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky.\" Here, the sun is referred to as \"he,\" which is giving it a masculine pronoun, and it's said to have left footprints in the sky. Suns don't literally have feet or leave footprints, so this is clearly giving human characteristics to a non-human object. That sounds a lot like personification.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Is there any hint of foreshadowing here? Well, foreshadowing would suggest something about what's to come in the story. But this sentence seems to be describing the current scene at sundown, not hinting at future events. So, probably not foreshadowing.\n\nIrony would involve some sort of contrast between expectation and reality. Here, perhaps someone might expect the sun to be absent and its presence forgotten, but instead, its absence is noted by the \"footprints\" it left behind. That could be seen as a form of irony, but it's a bit of a stretch. Moreover, personification seems like a more direct fit.\n\nFlashback would involve a shift back in time, but again, this sentence is focusing on the present moment at sundown. There's no indication of a shift in time here.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is personification. The sun is being given human qualities by being referred to as \"he\" and by leaving footprints.\n\nBut, to ensure I'm not missing anything, let's look at the surrounding text for context. The passage describes the end of the day, the sun setting, and how the people come to life after a day of labor. It talks about them being \"tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long,\" suggesting they were treated like objects or animals during the day, but now, in the evening, they regain their humanity.\n\nThe personification of the sun fits into this theme of attributing human qualities to non-human elements, perhaps symbolizing the way the characters in the story are objectified during the day and then regain their humanity in the evenings.\n\nAdditionally, the use of personification here might also be to give a sense of the characters' perspective and their relationship with nature. By personifying the sun, it suggests that they see the natural world in a way that is intimately connected with human experiences.\n\nSo, not only is personification the correct literary device here, but it also serves a deeper purpose in the narrative, reflecting the themes and perspectives within the story.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Personification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
