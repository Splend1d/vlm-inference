                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have the expression (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2, and we're given the values a = 5, b = 3, and c = 2. Our goal is to plug these values into the expression and simplify it to find the correct answer among the options provided: A. 194, B. 18, C. 50, D. 0.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the expression again to keep it clear:\n\n(c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2\n\nNow, let's substitute the given values:\n\nc = 2, so c\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 = 4\n\nb = 3, so b\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9\n\na = 5, so a\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 = 25\n\nNow, plug these into the expression:\n\n(4 - 9)\u00b2 + 25\n\nNext, I'll calculate inside the parentheses:\n\n4 - 9 = -5\n\nSo, (-5)\u00b2 + 25\n\nNow, square of -5 is 25, because (-5) * (-5) = 25\n\nSo, 25 + 25 = 50\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 50, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate step by step:\n\nFirst, c\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 = 4\n\nb\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9\n\nSo, c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 4 - 9 = -5\n\nThen, (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 = (-5)\u00b2 = 25\n\nAnd a\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 = 25\n\nSo, 25 + 25 = 50\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, like using algebraic identities.\n\nLet me see: (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2\n\nI know that c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 can be factored as (c - b)(c + b), but in this case, since we have squares, maybe it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expanding (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2:\n\n(c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 = c\u2074 - 2c\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u2074\n\nSo, the entire expression would be:\n\nc\u2074 - 2c\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u2074 + a\u00b2\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\nc = 2 \u2192 c\u2074 = 16, c\u00b2b\u00b2 = 4*9 = 36\n\nb = 3 \u2192 b\u2074 = 81\n\na = 5 \u2192 a\u00b2 = 25\n\nSo, 16 - 2*36 + 81 + 25\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n2*36 = 72\n\nSo, 16 - 72 = -56\n\nThen, -56 + 81 = 25\n\nFinally, 25 + 25 = 50\n\nAgain, I get 50.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the original expression differently.\n\nLet me see: (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2\n\nI can think of it as (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 = c\u2074 - 2c\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u2074, and then add a\u00b2, which is what I did earlier.\n\nOr, perhaps there's a way to relate this to some known identity, but I don't think that's necessary here since direct substitution works fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the expression as ((c - b)(c + b))\u00b2 + a\u00b2, but that seems more complicated for the given values.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n(c - b)(c + b) = (2 - 3)(2 + 3) = (-1)(5) = -5\n\nThen, (-5)\u00b2 = 25\n\nPlus a\u00b2 = 25\n\nTotal = 50\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, no matter which way I approach this, I keep getting 50 as the answer.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is indeed 50.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 50.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all approaches lead to the same result.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility that the expression could be interpreted differently.\n\nFor example, maybe someone might misread the expression as c\u00b2 - (b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2, but that would be c\u00b2 - b\u2074 + a\u00b2, which is different from the given expression.\n\nSimilarly, misreading the parentheses could lead to errors, but in this case, the expression is clear: (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 + a\u00b2.\n\nAnother potential source of error could be miscalculating the squares, but as I've checked multiple times, 2\u00b2 is 4, 3\u00b2 is 9, and 5\u00b2 is 25.\n\nAlso, ensuring that I'm squaring the difference correctly: (-5)\u00b2 is indeed 25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might forget to square the difference and just calculate c\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + a\u00b2, which would be 4 - 9 + 25 = 20, which is not among the options.\n\nOr, maybe they square each term separately: c\u2074 + b\u2074 + a\u00b2, which would be 16 + 81 + 25 = 122, which is also not an option.\n\nAlternatively, misapplying the formula for (c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)\u00b2 as c\u2074 - b\u2074, which is incorrect, as it should be c\u2074 - 2c\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u2074.\n\nBut as I've calculated correctly, I don't think that's an issue here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is indeed 50, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
