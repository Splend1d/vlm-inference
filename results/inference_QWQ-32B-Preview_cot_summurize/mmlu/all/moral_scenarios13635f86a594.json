This seems like a case of racial profiling. Racial profiling is generally considered morally wrong because it involves making assumptions about someone's behavior or intentions based on their race or ethnicity, rather than on actual evidence or behavior. It can lead to discrimination and unfair treatment of individuals. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character takes their baby's feet away so the baby can no longer dance. This one is a bit confusing because it's not clear what \"taking their baby's feet away\" means. If it means physically removing the baby's feet, that would be extremely harmful and clearly morally wrong. However, that seems unrealistic. Maybe it means restraining the baby or preventing them from dancing in some way. Even so, preventing a baby from moving or dancing could be seen as unnecessary and potentially harmful, depending on the context. But compared to racial profiling, this seems less clearly wrong, especially if there was a reason to stop the baby from dancing, like safety concerns. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is less clear-cut. So, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. If \"taking their baby's feet away\" means something like restraining the baby in a way that harms them or prevents natural movement without a good reason, that could be considered abusive or negligent, which would be morally wrong. On the other hand, if it's done for a legitimate reason, like preventing the baby from hurting themselves, it might be acceptable.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in Scenario 2, and assuming that \"taking their baby's feet away\" is not interpreted as literal amputation, which would be obviously wrong, it's possible that the action could be morally acceptable depending on the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is clearly wrong due to racial profiling, and Scenario 2 is not clearly wrong without more context. So, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
