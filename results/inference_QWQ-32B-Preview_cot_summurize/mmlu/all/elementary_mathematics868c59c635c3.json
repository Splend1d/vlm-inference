So, we need to substitute y with 8 and then simplify the expression.\n\nFirst, substitute y with 8:\n\n\u22127(8 \u2212 6)\n\nNext, do the subtraction inside the parentheses:\n\n8 minus 6 is 2, so now we have:\n\n\u22127(2)\n\nNow, multiply \u22127 by 2:\n\n\u22127 times 2 equals \u221214.\n\nSo, the answer should be \u221214.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet's go through it again.\n\nStart with the expression: \u22127(y \u2212 6)\n\nPlug in y = 8: \u22127(8 \u2212 6)\n\nSubtract inside the parentheses: 8 \u2212 6 = 2\n\nMultiply: \u22127 \u00d7 2 = \u221214\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nMaybe I can distribute the \u22127 to both y and \u22126.\n\nSo, \u22127(y) + (\u22127)(\u22126)\n\nThat would be \u22127y + 42\n\nNow, substitute y = 8:\n\n\u22127(8) + 42 = \u221256 + 42 = \u221214\n\nAgain, I get \u221214.\n\nOkay, that matches my first answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. \u221214\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. \u221214"
