                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about possible rectal findings. I need to determine which statement among the options is true. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"The finding of a palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding.\" Hmm, I recall that the prostate has a median groove that can be felt during a digital rectal exam. In a normal prostate, this groove is palpable, but in cases where the prostate is enlarged, like in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), the groove may become less distinct or even obliterated. So, finding a palpable median groove might actually be a sign of a normal prostate. Therefore, I think this statement is false.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour.\" This sounds plausible. Impacted faeces can cause a mass that might be confused with a tumor during a rectal exam. Patients with constipation or those who have difficulty evacuating their bowels can have hardened faecal matter that persists in the rectum. A doctor performing a digital rectal exam might feel this mass and initially consider it as a potential tumor. So, this seems like a true statement.\n\nOption C states: \"A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless.\" I know that haemorrhoids are swellings involving the blood vessels around the anal canal, and they can be internal or external. Thrombosed haemorrhoids occur when a blood clot forms within the hemorrhoidal vessel. External thrombosed haemorrhoids are typically very painful because they involve the anal sphincter muscle and are innervated by sensory nerves. Internal ones might not be as painful, but thrombosed internal haemorrhoids can still cause discomfort. So, saying that a thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless doesn't sound right. This seems false.\n\nOption D says: \"Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy.\" Peri-anal warts, which are usually caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), can be visible externally around the anal area and may not always require proctoscopy to be detected. A physical examination can often identify these warts without the need for internal inspection. Proctoscopy is used to visualize the inside of the rectum and anus, but for peri-anal warts, a visual inspection might suffice. Therefore, this statement appears to be false.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct choice. Impacted faeces can indeed be mistaken for a rectal tumour during a digital rectal exam.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
