                    "text": "Let's see which statement about nuclear binding energies isn't true. I need to think carefully about each option.\n\nOption A says that binding energy per nucleon reaches a maximum for 56Fe. I remember from my studies that iron-56 is often cited as having the highest binding energy per nucleon. This means that, on average, each nucleon in 56Fe is bound more tightly than in other nuclei. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B claims that nuclear binding energies have about the same magnitude as chemical bond energies. Now, I know that nuclear binding energies are much stronger than chemical bond energies. Chemical bonds involve electrons, which are much lighter than protons and neutrons, and the forces involved are electromagnetic, whereas nuclear binding energies are due to the strong nuclear force, which is much stronger. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says that nuclei have slightly less mass than the sum of their component nucleons. This is a fundamental concept in nuclear physics known as mass defect. The mass of a nucleus is always less than the sum of the masses of its free constituent protons and neutrons, and this \"missing\" mass is accounted for by the binding energy, as described by Einstein's equation, E=mc\u00b2. So, this is correct.\n\nOption D states that the nuclei of heavy elements have more neutrons than protons in order to provide sufficient binding energy to hold the nuclei together. This is also correct. In heavier nuclei, the repulsive electromagnetic force between protons becomes significant, so additional neutrons help to increase the strong nuclear force, which is attractive and helps to bind the nucleus together despite the proton repulsion.\n\nSo, considering all these, it seems that option B is the one that's not true. Nuclear binding energies are actually much larger in magnitude compared to chemical bond energies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
