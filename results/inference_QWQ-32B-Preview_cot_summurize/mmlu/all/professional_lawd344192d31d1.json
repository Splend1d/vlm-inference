The center weighed 170 pounds and was stocky in build. The quarterback was lanky and weighed about 145 pounds. The center and the quarterback often engaged in friendly tests of strength, such as arm wrestling and weight lifting contests, to see who was stronger. One afternoon, both youngsters were in the school gymnasium getting ready for football practice. As they were putting on their football uniforms, the center turned to the quarterback and said, \"Hey, weakling, why don't you punch me in the chest with your best shot?\" The quarterback replied, \"No, I'm afraid I might hurt you. \" The center then said, \"Are you kidding? You can't hurt me. C'mon, give me your best shot. \" The center stood up, stuck out his muscular chest, and prepared to have the quarterback hit him. The quarterback proceeded to cock his fist and then punched the center in the chest as hard as he could. Immediately thereafter, the center slumped to the floor, gasping for air.

It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's this center who is a stocky 14-year-old eighth grader, weighing 170 pounds, and the quarterback is lanky, weighing about 145 pounds. They're both on the junior varsity football team. They often have these friendly strength tests, like arm wrestling and weight lifting contests.\n\nOne day, in the gymnasium before football practice, the center challenges the quarterback to punch him in the chest with his best shot, jokingly calling him a \"weakling.\" The quarterback is hesitant, saying he's afraid he might hurt the center, but the center insists that he can't be hurt and even encourages him to go ahead.\n\nSo, the quarterback punches the center in the chest as hard as he can, and immediately, the center collapses, gasping for air. The quarterback tries to help but can't, and sadly, the center stops breathing and dies. It turns out that the center had a defective heart, and the blow to the chest caused a heart attack.\n\nNow, there's a wrongful death action being brought against the quarterback, and I need to determine which option is most likely correct:\n\nA. be held responsible, because he committed a battery by hitting the center in the chest.\n\nB. be held responsible, because the center's consent was ineffective.\n\nC. not be held responsible, because the center's consent was effective.\n\nD. not be held responsible, because the quarterback delivered the punch with greater strength than the center anticipated.\n\nAlright, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A says the quarterback will be held responsible because he committed a battery by hitting the center in the chest. Well, battery is a legal term for an unauthorized touching that is offensive or harmful. In this case, the center explicitly asked the quarterback to punch him, so there's consent involved. Consent can negate the claim of battery, provided that the consent is valid. So, maybe option A isn't the best answer because of the consent.\n\nOption B says the quarterback will be held responsible because the center's consent was ineffective. This seems interesting. Consent can be ineffective if the person doesn't fully understand the risks involved or if the activity is illegal, etc. Here, the center had a defective heart, which was unknown to both of them. So, perhaps the center didn't fully appreciate the risks, making the consent ineffective.\n\nOption C says the quarterback won't be held responsible because the center's consent was effective. This could be plausible if the consent is considered valid despite the unknown risk.\n\nOption D says the quarterback won't be held responsible because he punched harder than the center anticipated. This seems a bit off because the center invited the punch, and in such consensual activities, participants usually understand that there's a range of possible actions within the game.\n\nLet me think about consent in this context. In sports and similar activities, consent is often given for actions that are part of the game or activity. For example, in football, players consent to certain levels of contact. However, in this case, it's a specific act outside of the regular game activities.\n\nMoreover, the center and the quarterback are both 14-year-old eighth graders, so they are minors. The law treats minors differently in terms of capacity and consent.\n\nAlso, the center had a pre-existing condition\u2014 a defective heart\u2014 which neither of them knew about. This adds a layer of unpredictability to the situation.\n\nIn general, for consent to be effective, the person giving consent must know and understand the risks involved. In this case, since the center didn't know about his heart condition, he couldn't have fully appreciated the risks of being punched in the chest.\n\nAdditionally, even if he had known, as minors, their ability to consent to certain activities might be limited.\n\nLooking at option A again, while there was a battery\u2014 an unauthorized touching\u2014 the consent might invalidate the battery claim if it's considered valid.\n\nOption B suggests that the consent was ineffective, which could be due to the center not knowing the full risks because of his unknown heart condition.\n\nOption C says the consent was effective, which might not hold here because of the unknown risks.\n\nOption D seems weak because the anticipation of the force doesn't address the issue of the unknown risk.\n\nPerhaps the key here is whether the consent is effective given the unknown risk of the heart condition.\n\nIn some legal contexts, consent is not a defense if the harm is beyond what was consented to. For example, in contact sports, players consent to ordinary rules of the game, but not to intentional, gratuitous violence.\n\nSimilarly, here, the center consented to being punched, expecting a certain level of risk, but the actual harm was beyond what could have been anticipated given the unknown heart condition.\n\nMoreover, since they are minors, their capacity to consent might be more limited.\n\nI think option B is the most likely correct answer: the quarterback will be held responsible because the center's consent was ineffective. This is because the center didn't know about his heart condition, so he couldn't fully appreciate the risks involved in being punched in the chest.\n\nOption C might be incorrect because the consent wasn't informed due to the unknown medical condition.\n\nOption A might not hold because of the presence of consent, even if it's ineffective.\n\nOption D seems irrelevant because the strength of the punch wasn't the issue; it was the unforeseeable reaction due to the heart condition.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is B: be held responsible, because the center's consent was ineffective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
