Then, on September 3, the landlord mailed a letter to the tenant offering them an option to sign a two-year lease at $225 per month, provided they pay two months' rent in advance. The letter says it's in consideration of one dollar, and acknowledges receipt of that dollar.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an offer is in contract law. An offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it. So, in this case, the landlord is proposing terms: a two-year lease at $225 per month, with two months' rent in advance, in consideration of one dollar.\n\nNow, the tenant received the letter on September 4 but didn't read it until September 5. On September 23, the tenant calls the landlord and says they want to pay the $450 and sign the lease as soon as possible. The landlord changes his mind and says no, and wants the tenant to vacate immediately.\n\nThe question is whether the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease.\n\nOption A says yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent. That sounds right. The landlord is proposing specific terms, and the tenant can accept by agreeing to those terms.\n\nOption B says yes, because consideration for the option can be inferred from the previous month-to-month lease. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. The letter specifies that it's in consideration of one dollar, and acknowledges receipt of that dollar. So, maybe the consideration is the one dollar, not the previous lease.\n\nOption C says no, unless the tenant paid or tendered the one-dollar consideration. But in this case, the tenant didn't pay the one dollar after receiving the letter. So, if consideration is required, and it wasn't paid, maybe the offer isn't effective.\n\nOption D says no, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease. What's a condition precedent? It's a condition that must be fulfilled before a party's performance under a contract becomes due. In this case, the condition is paying two months' rent in advance.\n\nWait, but in the letter, it says \"in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged.\" That sounds like the landlord is acknowledging receipt of one dollar, which seems like consideration for the option.\n\nBut the tenant didn't pay or tender the one dollar after receiving the letter. Does that matter? Maybe the consideration is already acknowledged, so perhaps the offer is effective.\n\nAlso, in option contracts, the optionee (the tenant here) has the right, but not the obligation, to enter into the main contract (the two-year lease) within a certain time frame.\n\nSo, in this case, the landlord is offering an option for 20 days from September 2, in consideration of one dollar, acknowledged.\n\nThe tenant received the letter on September 4, didn't read it until September 5, and then on September 23, expressed willingness to accept the offer.\n\nBut September 2 is the date of the letter, so 20 days from September 2 would be until September 22. So, the option period expires on September 22.\n\nThe tenant tries to accept on September 23, which is after the option period has expired. So, maybe the offer is no longer valid.\n\nWait, but the question is whether the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease.\n\nGiven that the option period was 20 days from September 2, and the tenant tried to accept after that period, perhaps the offer was effective but has now lapsed.\n\nBut the question seems to be about whether the letter constituted an effective offer in the first place.\n\nLet me look back at the options.\n\nOption A: Yes, because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.\n\nThat seems correct. The landlord is proposing specific terms, and the tenant can accept by agreeing to those terms.\n\nOption B: Yes, because consideration for the option can be inferred from the previous month-to-month lease.\n\nI'm not sure about this. The letter specifies \"in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged.\" So, it seems like the consideration is specifically one dollar, not related to the previous lease.\n\nOption C: No, unless the tenant paid or tendered to the landlord the one-dollar consideration.\n\nBut the letter says \"in consideration of one dollar, receipt of which is acknowledged.\" It seems like the consideration has already been acknowledged, so perhaps the tenant doesn't need to pay or tender the dollar after receiving the letter.\n\nOption D: No, because it contained a condition precedent to execution of the proposed lease.\n\nThe condition is paying two months' rent in advance, which is a term of the main contract, not a condition for the option itself.\n\nSo, perhaps this isn't applicable.\n\nGiven all that, I think option A is the correct answer: yes, the landlord's letter constituted an effective offer for a two-year lease because it manifested a willingness to enter into a specific bargain that could be concluded by the tenant's assent.\n\nThe fact that the option period had expired by the time the tenant tried to accept doesn't affect whether the offer was effective in the first place, but rather affects whether the offer is still available to accept.\n\nSo, my answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
