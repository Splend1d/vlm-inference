                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an integer that ends with the digit 0 and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. We need to figure out how many of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 necessarily divide it.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a number to end with 0. If a number ends with 0, it means it's divisible by 10. So, it's divisible by both 2 and 5. That's because 10 is 2 times 5.\n\nNext, the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. This is a rule for divisibility by 3: if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3.\n\nSo, right away, we know that the number is divisible by 2, 3, and 5.\n\nNow, let's look at the other numbers in the list: 4, 6, 8, 9.\n\nLet's see if the number is necessarily divisible by 4.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by 4, the last two digits must form a number that's divisible by 4. Since the number ends with 0, the last two digits are something like \"x0\", where x is the second last digit. Now, \"x0\" is divisible by 4 if x is even. For example, 20 is divisible by 4, 40 is divisible by 4, 60 is divisible by 4, and so on. But if x is odd, like in 10 or 30, those are not divisible by 4. Wait a minute, but our number is divisible by 2 and 5, and ends with 0, but we don't have information about the second last digit being even or odd. So, we can't be sure that it's divisible by 4. Therefore, 4 is not necessarily a divisor.\n\nNext, 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. We already know that our number is divisible by both 2 and 3, so it must be divisible by 6. So, 6 is necessarily a divisor.\n\nNow, 8. For a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number that's divisible by 8. Our number ends with 0, so the last three digits are \"yx0\", where y is the third last digit and x is the second last digit. Without knowing more about y and x, we can't determine if \"yx0\" is divisible by 8. For example, 100 is not divisible by 8, but 200 is. So, we can't be sure about 8. Therefore, 8 is not necessarily a divisor.\n\nNext, 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. We only know that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, not necessarily by 9. For example, sum could be 6, which is divisible by 3 but not by 9. In that case, the number wouldn't be divisible by 9. So, 9 is not necessarily a divisor.\n\nSo, to sum up, the number is necessarily divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 6. That's four numbers.\n\nWait a second, let's double-check. We have:\n\n- Divisible by 2 and 5 because it ends with 0.\n\n- Divisible by 3 because the sum of digits is divisible by 3.\n\n- Divisible by 6 because it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n\nAnd we saw that divisibility by 4, 8, and 9 is not necessarily guaranteed based on the given information.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut let's see the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 3\n\nD. 4\n\nSo, the answer is D. 4.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"how many of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 necessarily divide it?\" and according to our reasoning, it's 4 numbers: 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't any mistake here.\n\nIs there any possibility that the number is not divisible by one of these?\n\nFor example, could a number ending with 0 and having a digit sum divisible by 3 not be divisible by 2? No, because ending with 0 means it's even, so divisible by 2.\n\nNot divisible by 3? No, because the sum of digits is divisible by 3.\n\nNot divisible by 5? No, because it ends with 0.\n\nNot divisible by 6? Wait, if it's divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6.\n\nSo, these four are guaranteed.\n\nFor the others:\n\n- 4: not necessarily, as we saw.\n\n- 8: not necessarily.\n\n- 9: not necessarily.\n\nSo, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other number in the list that we might have missed.\n\nOh, wait, the list is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. We've covered all of them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
