It's often denoted by the symbol that looks like a big \"C\" on the staff, which stands for \"common time.\" Numerically, it's represented as 4/4 time.\n\nSo, what does 4/4 time mean? The bottom number tells you what kind of note gets one beat. In this case, the \"4\" at the bottom means a quarter note gets one beat. The top number tells you how many of those beats are in each measure. Here, the \"4\" on top means there are four beats per measure.\n\nTherefore, in common time or 4/4 time, there are four quarter notes per measure.\n\nLet's look at the options you provided:\n\nA. one\n\nB. four\n\nC. five\n\nD. ten\n\nBased on what we've discussed, the correct answer should be B. four.\n\nTo make sure, let's think about it another way. If you've ever clapped along to a song and counted \"1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4,\" and so on, that's likely in common time, with four beats per measure.\n\nAlternatively, if you've seen sheet music, you might notice that every four beats, a bar line separates the measures in 4/4 time.\n\nSo, to summarize, in common time, there are four quarter notes per measure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
