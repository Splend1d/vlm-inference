                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Dershowitz and his views on terrorism from a consequentialist perspective. So, first things first, I need to recall what consequentialism is all about. Consequentialism is an ethical theory that suggests the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes or consequences. The main idea is that if the results are good, then the action is morally acceptable, regardless of the intentions behind it.\n\nNow, the question is asking about Dershowitz's thoughts on justifying terrorism in extreme cases using consequentialist theory. I need to think about which type of consequentialist theory he might be aligning with here. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Act-based deontology\n\nWait, deontology is not a consequentialist theory. Deontology focuses on the inherent morality of actions themselves, regardless of the outcomes. So, that doesn't fit here.\n\nB. Rule-based hedonism\n\nHedonism is about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, but rule-based hedonism sounds like a type of deontology again, focusing on rules rather than consequences. Not sure about this one.\n\nC. Rule utilitarianism\n\nUtilitarianism is a consequentialist theory that aims for the greatest good for the greatest number. Rule utilitarianism applies this by creating rules that, if followed, lead to the best overall consequences. So, in this case, it might justify certain actions based on general rules that promote overall happiness or welfare.\n\nD. Act utilitarianism\n\nThis is another form of utilitarianism but focuses on individual acts. Each action is judged based on whether it maximizes utility in that specific situation, without necessarily following general rules.\n\nGiven that the question is about justifying terrorism in certain extreme particular cases, it seems like it's referring to specific actions rather than general rules. Terrorism is a highly controversial and often immoral act, but if someone were to justify it from a consequentialist perspective, they would likely look at the specific outcomes of that act.\n\nSo, act utilitarianism seems plausible because it evaluates each act on its own merits based on the consequences. If a terrorist act leads to a greater good in a particular extreme case, then according to act utilitarianism, it could be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, rule utilitarianism looks at the overall goodness that comes from following certain rules. Justifying terrorism might conflict with general rules against violence and harm, so it's less likely that rule utilitarianism would justify specific acts of terrorism.\n\nAct-based deontology doesn't make sense because deontology isn't consequentialist. Similarly, rule-based hedonism seems like a mix of deontology and hedonism, which isn't directly consequentialist.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. act utilitarianism.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider why Dershowitz might think this way. Alan Dershowitz is a well-known legal scholar and civil libertarian. He has been controversial for suggesting that in extreme cases, such as preventing a genocide, terrorism or even torture might be justified if they lead to saving lives or preventing greater evils.\n\nHis argument would likely be that in those specific, extreme situations, the consequences of acting violently or using terrorism could outweigh the moral costs. This aligns with act utilitarianism, where each case is evaluated individually based on its outcomes.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Dershowitz's views are highly debated and criticized. Many argue that terrorism and torture set dangerous precedents and can lead to abuses of power, which may have long-term negative consequences that outweigh any short-term benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the options provided and the nature of consequentialist theories, act utilitarianism seems to be the most plausible answer for how Dershowitz might justify terrorism in certain extreme cases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
