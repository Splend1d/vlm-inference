                    "text": "So I have this question about Mentor Co., which is a U.S. corporation that owns 100% of a Swiss corporation. The Swiss franc is the functional currency for the Swiss subsidiary. At the end of the year, there's a remeasurement gain of $25,000 and a translation gain of $40,000. I need to figure out how much Mentor should recognize as foreign currency gain in its income statement. The options are A.$0, B.$25,000, C.$40,000, or D.$65,000.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between remeasurement and translation in the context of foreign currency transactions.\n\nRemeasurement typically involves converting the financial statements of a foreign entity from its local currency to the reporting currency of the parent company, which in this case is the U.S. dollar. However, I've also heard that remeasurement might refer to adjusting transactions and balances to reflect changes in exchange rates.\n\nTranslation, on the other hand, is the process of converting the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary from its functional currency to the reporting currency of the parent company for consolidation purposes.\n\nGiven that the Swiss franc is the functional currency, I think translation is what's being referred to here, as the subsidiary's financial statements are in Swiss francs, and they need to be translated into U.S. dollars for Mentor Co.'s financial statements.\n\nNow, the question mentions both remeasurement and translation gains. I'm a bit confused because I thought translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and not in the income statement, at least under U.S. GAAP.\n\nLet me recall: when a subsidiary's functional currency is its local currency, translation adjustments are supposed to be recorded in OCI, not in the income statement. So, any gain or loss from translating the subsidiary's financial statements should go into OCI.\n\nBut here, there's also a remeasurement gain of $25,000. Maybe remeasurement refers to transactions or balances that are remeasured each period to reflect current exchange rates, and any gains or losses from that process are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSo, perhaps the $25,000 gain is from remeasuring certain transactions or balances, like monetary items, and that would go into the income statement, while the $40,000 gain from translation goes into OCI.\n\nIf that's the case, then the amount Mentor should recognize as foreign currency gain in its income statement would be the remeasurement gain of $25,000.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"recognize as foreign currency gain in its income statement.\" If translation gains go to OCI and remeasurement gains go to the income statement, then only the $25,000 remeasurement gain should be in the income statement.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about the distinction between remeasurement and translation. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nLet me look up the difference between remeasurement and translation in the context of foreign currency.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that remeasurement is indeed the process of converting the financial statements of a foreign entity from its local currency to the reporting currency, but it's typically used when the functional currency is the reporting currency. If the functional currency is the local currency, then the process is translation.\n\nIn this case, since the Swiss franc is the functional currency, it should be translation, not remeasurement.\n\nBut the question mentions both remeasurement and translation gains. Maybe there are both remeasurement and translation processes happening here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps remeasurement refers to adjusting individual transactions and balances to current exchange rates, while translation is the process of converting the entire financial statement at a specific rate.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, when the functional currency is the local currency, transactions are initially recorded in the local currency, and then translated to the reporting currency using appropriate exchange rates.\n\nAny gains or losses from this translation process are supposed to be reported in other comprehensive income, as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), and not in the income statement.\n\nHowever, there might be situations where remeasurement is required, such as for certain types of items or under different circumstances.\n\nPerhaps the $25,000 gain is from remeasuring monetary items that are considered to be U.S. dollar\u2013denominated, and thus the gains or losses are recognized in the income statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the $40,000 gain is from translating the financial statements from Swiss francs to U.S. dollars, which would go into OCI.\n\nIf that's the case, then the foreign currency gain recognized in the income statement would be the $25,000 remeasurement gain.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because the question seems to present both remeasurement and translation gains, and I need to determine which one, or both, to include in the income statement.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"The remeasurement of Mentor's financial statements resulted in a $25,000 gain at year-end. The translation of the financial statements resulted in a $40,000 gain at year-end. What amount should Mentor recognize as foreign currency gain in its income statement?\"\n\nGiven that, it seems like there are two separate gains: one from remeasurement and one from translation.\n\nIf remeasurement gains are recognized in the income statement and translation gains are recognized in OCI, then only the $25,000 remeasurement gain should be in the income statement.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.$25,000.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any scenario where both gains would be recognized in the income statement.\n\nI think if the functional currency were the U.S. dollar, then the entire process would be remeasurement, and both gains would be recognized in the income statement.\n\nBut in this case, the functional currency is the Swiss franc, so translation adjustments should go to OCI.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if there are both remeasurement and translation processes, both gains would be recognized in the income statement.\n\nBut that doesn't align with my understanding of how translation adjustments are handled.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the $25,000 gain is from remeasuring intercompany transactions or some other items that are remeasured, and the $40,000 gain is from translating the subsidiary's financial statements.\n\nIn that case, only the $25,000 would go to the income statement, and the $40,000 would go to OCI.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident.\n\nLet me consider the alternatives.\n\nOption A is $0, which would suggest that neither gain is recognized in the income statement. But that can't be right because the remeasurement gain should be in the income statement.\n\nOption B is $25,000, which matches the remeasurement gain.\n\nOption C is $40,000, which is the translation gain, and as per my understanding, that should go to OCI.\n\nOption D is $65,000, which is the sum of both gains.\n\nBut I don't think you can sum both gains because only the remeasurement gain goes to the income statement.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's confusion about what is being asked.\n\nThe question is asking for the amount Mentor should recognize as foreign currency gain in its income statement.\n\nIf only the remeasurement gain goes to the income statement, then it's $25,000.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nMaybe the translation gain also affects the income statement in some way.\n\nBut under U.S. GAAP, translation adjustments are supposed to be reported in OCI, not in the income statement.\n\nTherefore, only the remeasurement gain of $25,000 should be in the income statement.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.$25,000.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any exceptions or special circumstances where translation gains would also be recognized in the income statement.\n\nI recall that if a company disposes of a foreign operation, the accumulated translation adjustments in OCI are reclassified to the income statement.\n\nBut in this case, there's no mention of disposing of the subsidiary, so that doesn't apply.\n\nAnother scenario is if the functional currency of the subsidiary is re-designated, but again, there's no indication of that here.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B.$25,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
