If it's invalid, I have to pick a counterexample from the options provided. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the argument is:\n\nI \u2261 ~J\n\nI \u2228 J / I\n\nSo, I need to understand what this means. The symbol \"\u2261\" stands for logical equivalence, which means that I and ~J have the same truth value. The symbol \"\u2228\" stands for logical OR. The \"/ I\" might indicate that the conclusion is I, based on the premises I \u2261 ~J and I \u2228 J.\n\nTo construct a truth table, I need to evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion for all possible combinations of truth values for I and J. Since there are two variables, I and J, there are four possible combinations: both true, both false, I true and J false, I false and J true.\n\nLet me list out the columns I'll need:\n\n1. I\n\n2. J\n\n3. ~J\n\n4. I \u2261 ~J\n\n5. I \u2228 J\n\n6. I (conclusion)\n\nNow, I'll create a table with these columns and fill in the truth values for each row.\n\nRow 1: I = T, J = T\n\n- ~J = F\n\n- I \u2261 ~J: T \u2261 F \u2192 F\n\n- I \u2228 J: T \u2228 T \u2192 T\n\n- I: T\n\nRow 2: I = T, J = F\n\n- ~J = T\n\n- I \u2261 ~J: T \u2261 T \u2192 T\n\n- I \u2228 J: T \u2228 F \u2192 T\n\n- I: T\n\nRow 3: I = F, J = T\n\n- ~J = F\n\n- I \u2261 ~J: F \u2261 F \u2192 T\n\n- I \u2228 J: F \u2228 T \u2192 T\n\n- I: F\n\nRow 4: I = F, J = F\n\n- ~J = T\n\n- I \u2261 ~J: F \u2261 T \u2192 F\n\n- I \u2228 J: F \u2228 F \u2192 F\n\n- I: F\n\nNow, let's organize this into a table:\n\n| I | J | ~J | I \u2261 ~J | I \u2228 J | I |\n\n|---|---|----|--------|-------|---|\n\n| T | T | F  | F      | T     | T |\n\n| T | F | T  | T      | T     | T |\n\n| F | T | F  | T      | T     | F |\n\n| F | F | T  | F      | F     | F |\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is valid, I need to check if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.\n\nThe premises are:\n\n1. I \u2261 ~J\n\n2. I \u2228 J\n\nThe conclusion is I.\n\nSo, I need to look for rows where both premises are true, and see if in those rows, the conclusion is also true.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- Row 1: I \u2261 ~J is F, I \u2228 J is T \u2192 premises not both true\n\n- Row 2: I \u2261 ~J is T, I \u2228 J is T \u2192 both premises true, conclusion I is T\n\n- Row 3: I \u2261 ~J is T, I \u2228 J is T \u2192 both premises true, conclusion I is F\n\n- Row 4: I \u2261 ~J is F, I \u2228 J is F \u2192 premises not both true\n\nSo, in row 2, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.\n\nIn row 3, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\nThis means the argument is invalid because there is at least one case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nNow, I need to choose a counterexample from the options provided.\n\nOption B: Invalid. Counterexample when I and J are true.\n\nBut in row 1, I and J are both true, but the premises are not both true (since I \u2261 ~J is false). So this isn't a valid counterexample.\n\nOption C: Invalid. Counterexample when I is true and J is false.\n\nThis is row 2, where both premises are true, and the conclusion is true. But for a counterexample, we need a case where both premises are true but the conclusion is false. So this isn't a counterexample.\n\nOption D: Invalid. Counterexample when J is true and I is false.\n\nThis is row 3, where both premises are true, and the conclusion is false. This matches the condition for a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\nJust to double-check, let's ensure that there are no other counterexamples. In row 4, I \u2261 ~J is false, so it's not a case where both premises are true.\n\nSo, only row 3 qualifies as a counterexample.\n\nHence, the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when J is true and I is false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
