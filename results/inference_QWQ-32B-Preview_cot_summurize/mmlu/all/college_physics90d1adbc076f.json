                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the speed of light in a dielectric material. The dielectric constant is given as 4.0, and I need to find the speed of light inside this material. The options are:\n\nA. 1.2 * 10^9 m/s\n\nB. 3.0 * 10^8 m/s\n\nC. 1.5 * 10^8 m/s\n\nD. 1.0 * 10^8 m/s\n\nFirst, I need to recall how the speed of light in a material relates to its dielectric constant. I know that in a vacuum, the speed of light is approximately 3.0 * 10^8 m/s. When light travels through a material, its speed changes due to the material's properties.\n\nThe dielectric constant, also known as the relative permittivity (\u03b5r), is a measure of how much the material can store electrical energy in an electric field. It affects the speed of light in the material.\n\nI think the relationship between the speed of light in vacuum (c) and the speed of light in the material (v) is given by:\n\nv = c / \u221a\u03b5r\n\nWhere:\n\n- c is the speed of light in vacuum (3.0 * 10^8 m/s)\n\n- \u03b5r is the dielectric constant (4.0 in this case)\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nv = (3.0 * 10^8 m/s) / \u221a4.0\n\nSince \u221a4.0 is 2.0, then:\n\nv = (3.0 * 10^8 m/s) / 2.0\n\nv = 1.5 * 10^8 m/s\n\nWait, but option C is 1.5 * 10^8 m/s, which matches this calculation. But let me double-check if this is the correct formula.\n\nI recall that the refractive index (n) of a material is related to the dielectric constant by n = \u221a\u03b5r for nonmagnetic materials. And the speed of light in the material is given by v = c / n.\n\nSo, n = \u221a4.0 = 2.0\n\nThen, v = c / n = (3.0 * 10^8 m/s) / 2.0 = 1.5 * 10^8 m/s\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this. The question specifies that the material is nonmagnetic, so its magnetic permeability is approximately that of vacuum, which is \u03bc0.\n\nIn that case, the refractive index n is indeed given by n = \u221a(\u03b5r * \u03bcr), but since \u03bcr is 1 for a nonmagnetic material, n = \u221a\u03b5r.\n\nTherefore, the speed of light in the material should be v = c / n = c / \u221a\u03b5r, which is what I used.\n\nSo, according to this, the speed of light in the material is 1.5 * 10^8 m/s, which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut let me look back at the options to make sure:\n\nA. 1.2 * 10^9 m/s - that's faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which doesn't make sense because light should always be slower in a material than in vacuum.\n\nB. 3.0 * 10^8 m/s - that's the speed in vacuum, so in a material with dielectric constant greater than 1, it should be slower.\n\nC. 1.5 * 10^8 m/s - matches my calculation.\n\nD. 1.0 * 10^8 m/s - that's even slower, but according to my calculation, it should be 1.5 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check a reference.\n\nAfter checking, I confirm that for nonmagnetic materials, the speed of light in the material is v = c / \u221a\u03b5r.\n\nGiven that \u03b5r = 4.0, \u221a\u03b5r = 2.0, and v = 3.0 * 10^8 m/s / 2.0 = 1.5 * 10^8 m/s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 1.5 * 10^8 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
