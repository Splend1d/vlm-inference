                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an electric motor with some given specifications, and we need to find out at what constant speed it can lift a 6 kg mass. The label says: Input is 120 volts AC, 1.0 ampere, 60 Hz, and the efficiency is 75%. Okay, so first things first, I need to understand what all this means and how it relates to the speed at which the motor can lift the mass.\n\nStarting with the input specifications: 120V AC, 1.0 Amp, 60 Hz. AC stands for alternating current, which is the type of electricity that comes out of wall outlets in many countries. The voltage is 120V, and the current is 1.0 ampere. The frequency is 60 Hz, which tells us how many times the current changes direction per second, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant to this problem.\n\nThe efficiency is 75%, which means that 75% of the electrical power input is converted into mechanical power output by the motor. The remaining 25% is lost, probably as heat.\n\nSo, my goal is to find the constant speed at which the motor can lift a 6 kg mass. To do that, I need to find out how much power the motor can deliver mechanically and then relate that to the power required to lift the mass at a certain speed.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the input power to the motor. Power is calculated as voltage multiplied by current, so:\n\nInput power (P_input) = voltage \u00d7 current = 120 V \u00d7 1.0 A = 120 Watts.\n\nNow, since the motor is 75% efficient, the output power (P_output) is 75% of the input power.\n\nP_output = efficiency \u00d7 P_input = 0.75 \u00d7 120 W = 90 Watts.\n\nSo, the motor can deliver 90 watts of mechanical power.\n\nNext, I need to relate this power output to the speed at which it can lift the mass. The power required to lift a mass is equal to the product of the force needed to lift the mass and the speed at which it's lifted. The force needed to lift the mass is equal to its weight, which is mass times acceleration due to gravity.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- m = mass = 6 kg\n\n- g = acceleration due to gravity \u2248 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\n- v = lifting speed (which we need to find)\n\nThe force required to lift the mass is:\n\nF = m \u00d7 g = 6 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 58.8 Newtons.\n\nThe power required to lift the mass at speed v is:\n\nP = F \u00d7 v = 58.8 N \u00d7 v.\n\nBut we know that the motor can deliver 90 watts of power, so:\n\n90 W = 58.8 N \u00d7 v.\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 90 W / 58.8 N \u2248 1.53 m/s.\n\nRounding this to one decimal place, it's approximately 1.5 m/s.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.5 m/s\n\nB. 1.0 m/s\n\nC. 1.5 m/s\n\nD. 2.0 m/s\n\nOption C. 1.5 m/s seems to be the closest match.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, input power: 120 V \u00d7 1.0 A = 120 W. That seems correct.\n\nThen, output power: 75% of 120 W is indeed 90 W.\n\nForce required: 6 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 = 58.8 N. That's standard.\n\nPower equation: P = F \u00d7 v \u2192 v = P / F = 90 W / 58.8 N \u2248 1.53 m/s.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider other factors, like the motor's internal resistance or something, but the problem doesn't provide any other information, so probably not.\n\nAlso, the frequency of 60 Hz might not be directly relevant here, unless it affects the motor's performance in some way, but since it's not mentioned in the context of the motor's operation beyond the input specifications, I think it's safe to ignore it for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. 1.5 m/s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
