The options are about due process, property rights, limits on fines and punishments, and petitioning the government. I know the First Amendment is pretty broad, but I need to recall exactly what it covers.\n\nLet me start by remembering the text of the First Amendment. It says: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nOkay, so it mentions freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and petitioning the government. So, among the options given, A is about due process, which I think is more related to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. B is about property rights, which might be more associated with the Fifth Amendment regarding eminent domain. C talks about excessive fines and unusual punishment, and I think that's covered under the Eighth Amendment. So, that leaves D, which is about petitioning the government for a redress of grievances.\n\nLooking back at the First Amendment text, it specifically mentions \"the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" So, that seems to match option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly review what the other amendments cover. The Fifth Amendment includes due process and protection against self-incrimination, and it also covers eminent domain with just compensation. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, fines, and cruel and unusual punishments. So, none of those match options A, B, or C directly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: petition the government for a redress of grievances, as it is explicitly mentioned in the First Amendment along with freedom of speech and religion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
