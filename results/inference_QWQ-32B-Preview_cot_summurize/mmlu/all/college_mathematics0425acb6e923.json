                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about linear transformations. Let's see what it's asking. We have a finite-dimensional real vector space V, and P is a linear transformation of V such that P squared equals P. So, P^2 = P. I need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true.\n\nFirst, let's understand what P^2 = P means. If P is a linear transformation and P^2 = P, that means applying P twice is the same as applying it once. So, P is idempotent. That's a key property here.\n\nNow, let's look at statement I: P is invertible. Is that necessarily true?\n\nWell, for P to be invertible, its determinant must be non-zero, and it must be bijective, meaning both injective and surjective. But given that P is idempotent, let's see if that implies invertibility.\n\nConsider the zero transformation, where P(v) = 0 for all v in V. Then P^2(v) = P(P(v)) = P(0) = 0 = P(v), so P^2 = P holds. But the zero transformation is not invertible because it's not injective; everything gets mapped to zero. So, in this case, P is not invertible, even though P^2 = P. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nOkay, so I can eliminate any options that include I only or III only, since III includes I.\n\nNext, statement II: P is diagonalizable. Is that necessarily true for any idempotent linear transformation?\n\nTo check if P is diagonalizable, I need to see if there exists a basis for V consisting of eigenvectors of P.\n\nLet's recall that for a linear transformation P, if P^2 = P, then the minimal polynomial of P divides x^2 - x = x(x - 1). The minimal polynomial factors into distinct linear factors over the real numbers, which are x and (x - 1). According to the diagonalization theorem, if the minimal polynomial of a linear transformation factors into distinct linear factors, then the transformation is diagonalizable.\n\nTherefore, since P's minimal polynomial divides x(x - 1), which has distinct linear factors, P must be diagonalizable.\n\nSo, statement II must be true.\n\nNow, statement III: P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.\n\nIs that necessarily true?\n\nWell, we already saw that the zero transformation satisfies P^2 = P, and the identity transformation also satisfies P^2 = P, since P(v) = v and P(P(v)) = P(v) = v.\n\nBut are there other possibilities?\n\nConsider a projection onto a subspace. For example, in R^2, projection onto the x-axis. So, P(x, y) = (x, 0). Then P^2(x, y) = P(P(x, y)) = P(x, 0) = (x, 0) = P(x, y), so P^2 = P holds.\n\nBut P is neither the identity nor the zero transformation. So, there are other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, among the options, since only statement II must be true, the answer should be C. II only.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Is there any case where P is idempotent but not diagonalizable? We already reasoned that the minimal polynomial divides x(x - 1), which has distinct roots, so P should always be diagonalizable if P^2 = P.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any non-diagonalizable matrix that satisfies P^2 = P.\n\nSuppose P is not diagonalizable. Then its minimal polynomial must have a repeated root. But since P^2 - P = 0, the minimal polynomial divides x(x - 1), which has no repeated roots. Therefore, P must be diagonalizable.\n\nSo, indeed, statement II must be true.\n\nAnd since statements I and III are not necessarily true, the correct answer is C. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
