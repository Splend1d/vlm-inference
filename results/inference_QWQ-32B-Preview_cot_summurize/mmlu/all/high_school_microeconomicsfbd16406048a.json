                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics question. I need to figure out which option will shift the supply curve for textbooks to the left. First, I need to remember what a supply curve represents. The supply curve shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity suppliers are willing to supply at that price. A shift to the left means that at any given price, suppliers are willing to supply less quantity. So, I'm looking for a factor that would decrease the supply of textbooks.\n\nOption A says: \"A decrease in the demand for a substitute in production.\" Hmm, this is a bit tricky. If there's a substitute in production, that means that resources can be allocated to produce either textbooks or something else. If the demand for that substitute decreases, it might make producing textbooks more attractive, which could increase the supply of textbooks. Wait, but the question is asking for something that shifts the supply curve to the left, which is a decrease in supply. So, this seems contrary to what I'm looking for.\n\nOption B: \"A decrease in the number of buyers.\" Now, the number of buyers affects demand, not supply. If there are fewer buyers, the demand for textbooks might decrease, but that would shift the demand curve, not the supply curve. So, this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C: \"An increase in printing costs.\" Printing costs are a production cost for textbooks. If production costs increase, it becomes more expensive to produce each textbook. As a result, at any given price, suppliers would be willing to supply fewer textbooks because their profit margins are reduced. This sounds like it would decrease supply, which would shift the supply curve to the left. This seems promising.\n\nOption D: \"Expectations of future surpluses.\" If suppliers expect future surpluses, they might increase current supply to sell more now before prices potentially drop. Wait, but the question is about shifting the supply curve to the left, which is a decrease in supply. So, if suppliers expect future surpluses, they might supply more now, which would actually shift the supply curve to the right, not to the left.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C, an increase in printing costs, seems to be the correct answer because it would decrease the supply of textbooks at any given price, shifting the supply curve to the left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
