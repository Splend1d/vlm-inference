So, there's a millionaire who owned two buildings, one for medical offices and one for dental offices, and they're connected by a walkway on the second floor. He sold the dental building to an investor, and now there's an issue with repairing the walkway. The millionaire wants to stop the investor from repairing it, and he's suing to get an injunction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are two buildings, adjacent, both 10 stories, one for medical offices, one for dental offices, and the first floors have retail. There's a walkway connecting the second floors of both buildings, allowing people to move between them.\n\nThe millionaire sold the dental building to an investor via a warranty deed, and there was no mention of the walkway in the deed. So, the deed transferred the dental building but didn't specify anything about the walkway.\n\nAfter the sale, the walkway became unsafe due to wear and tear, and the investor hired a contractor to repair it. When the millionaire saw the repair work starting, he demanded that the investor stop, and when the investor refused, he sued to enjoin the repair work.\n\nNow, I need to decide who is likely to win this case. The options are:\n\nA. The millionaire, because the investor doesn't have rights in the walkway.\n\nB. The millionaire, because the investor's rights in the dental building don't extend to the walkway.\n\nC. The investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\n\nD. The investor, because he has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the walkway connects the two buildings, and it's been in use by occupants of both buildings. The millionaire sold the dental building but kept the medical building. The deed for the dental building didn't mention the walkway, so presumably, the walkway is part of the medical building or is jointly owned or something.\n\nBut in reality, walkways connecting buildings are often considered appurtenances to the buildings they connect, and rights to use them can be appurtenant easements.\n\nSo, when the dental building was sold, did the investor get any rights to the walkway?\n\nWell, the walkway was being used by both buildings' occupants, so it's likely that there's an easement appurtenant to the dental building to use the walkway.\n\nAn easement appurtenant runs with the land, so even if it's not mentioned in the deed, the investor, as the new owner of the dental building, would still have the right to use the walkway, assuming it's necessary for the use and enjoyment of the dental building.\n\nNow, if there's an easement appurtenant to the dental building, then the investor has the right to use the walkway, but does he have the right to repair it?\n\nGenerally, the owner of the servient estate (the one burdened by the easement) is responsible for maintenance and repair of the easement area, but only to the extent that such maintenance doesn't interfere with the easement holder's use.\n\nHowever, in some cases, the dominant estate (the one benefiting from the easement) may have the obligation to maintain the easement area.\n\nIn this case, since the walkway is used by both buildings, it's possible that both parties have some responsibility for its maintenance.\n\nBut since the walkway is physically part of both buildings, depending on how it's constructed, the ownership might be divided between the two buildings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the walkway is solely part of the dental building, or solely part of the medical building.\n\nWait, the walkway connects the second floor of each building, so it's possible that the walkway is built as an extension of each building, with each owner owning their part of the walkway.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the walkway is a separate structure owned by both.\n\nBut in the problem, it says that the walkway is enclosed, connecting the second floor of each building, so it's likely that each building has a portion of the walkway that is part of its structure.\n\nGiven that, when the dental building was sold, the portion of the walkway attached to it would also have been transferred to the investor.\n\nTherefore, the investor owns his building and his portion of the walkway, while the millionaire owns the medical building and his portion of the walkway.\n\nIf that's the case, then the investor should have the right to repair his portion of the walkway.\n\nBut in the scenario, the investor is repairing the entire walkway, which might include both portions.\n\nSo, perhaps the millionaire is objecting to the investor repairing the portion that belongs to the medical building.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair work is affecting both portions, and the millionaire wants to control the repair work or have input into it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the millionaire is claiming that the walkway is exclusively his property, since he kept the medical building, and the investor has no right to repair it.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given that the walkway was being used by both buildings' occupants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an implied easement when the dental building was sold, allowing the occupants of the dental building to continue using the walkway.\n\nIn that case, the investor would have the right to use the walkway, and possibly the right to maintain it to ensure its usability.\n\nBut does that include the right to repair the entire walkway, including the portion owned by the millionaire?\n\nProbably not entirely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a joint ownership or a joint easement between the two buildings for the use and maintenance of the walkway.\n\nBut since the deed didn't mention any rights concerning the walkway, it's unclear.\n\nIn property law, when two properties are adjacent and connected by a common passageway, there may be implied easements for the use of that passageway.\n\nIn this case, since both buildings were previously owned by the same owner and were connected by the walkway, which was being used by both buildings' occupants, it's likely that there are implied easements allowing each building's occupants to use the walkway.\n\nTherefore, the investor, as the new owner of the dental building, would have an easement to use the walkway.\n\nNow, does this easement include the right to repair the walkway?\n\nGenerally, the burden of maintaining the easement area lies with the owner of the servient estate, but in some cases, the dominant estate may have the right or the responsibility to maintain the easement area.\n\nIn this scenario, since the walkway is being used by both buildings, and presumably both buildings benefit from its existence, it's possible that both parties have responsibilities regarding its maintenance.\n\nAlternatively, if the walkway is physically part of each building, then each owner is responsible for maintaining their own portion.\n\nGiven that, the investor should be responsible for maintaining his portion of the walkway, and the millionaire should be responsible for maintaining his portion.\n\nIf the walkway is unsafe due to wear and tear, then both owners may have a duty to ensure that their portions are safe.\n\nHowever, in the scenario, the investor is undertaking repair work on the walkway, and the millionaire is objecting to it.\n\nPerhaps the millionaire is concerned that the investor is repairing the entire walkway, including the portion that belongs to the medical building.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair work is being done in a way that affects the medical building or violates some agreement.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the millionaire is claiming that the walkway is exclusively his property, since he kept the medical building, and the investor has no right to repair it.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given that the walkway was being used by both buildings' occupants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an implied easement when the dental building was sold, allowing the occupants of the dental building to continue using the walkway, and possibly implying a right to maintain it.\n\nIn that case, the investor would have the right to maintain the walkway to ensure its usability for the dental building's occupants.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible: the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\n\nAlternatively, option D suggests that the investor has a right to take whatever action is necessary to protect himself from possible tort liability from persons using the walkway.\n\nThis could be relevant because if the walkway is unsafe, and people are using it, the investor could be liable for any injuries that occur due to the unsafe condition, especially if he has control over the walkway.\n\nTherefore, he may have a legal obligation to repair the walkway to prevent such liabilities.\n\nIn that case, the court might rule in favor of the investor, allowing him to proceed with the repairs.\n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the \"most likely\" result, and we need to consider what the law typically holds in such situations.\n\nGiven that there is an implied easement for the use of the walkway by both buildings' occupants, and that the investor, as the owner of one of the buildings, has an interest in ensuring the walkway's safety for his tenants, it's probable that the court would allow the investor to proceed with the repairs.\n\nTherefore, the decision would be for the investor, likely under option C or D.\n\nBetween C and D, option C seems more directly related to property law principles, specifically easements and the rights that come with them.\n\nOption D is more related to tort law and liability concerns.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result will be a decision for the investor, because the investor has an easement in the walkway and an implied right to keep the walkway in repair.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
