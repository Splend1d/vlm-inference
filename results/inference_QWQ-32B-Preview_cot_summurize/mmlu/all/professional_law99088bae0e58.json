                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an earthquake in a foreign country that causes a lot of damage and casualties. The leader of that country asks the U.S. for help, specifically emergency aid. The President wants to send troops from a West Coast military base, but they're out on training maneuvers, so that plan is put on hold.\n\nInstead, the President issues an executive order directing members of a federal agency under the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to go to the foreign country for emergency rescue operations. Normally, this agency patrols the borders to prevent illegal immigration.\n\nOne member of this agency refuses to comply with the executive order, arguing that participating in international relief operations isn't part of his job responsibilities. He sues in federal court to challenge the validity of the President's executive order.\n\nWe need to determine which option the court should choose, assuming the agency member has adequate standing.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Valid, because as commander-in-chief, the President has unfettered authority to require federal employees to participate in an international relief effort.\n\nB. Valid, because employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions.\n\nC. Invalid, because the executive order is beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n\nD. Invalid, because the director of the INS, not the President, has the power to issue directives to federal agencies under its supervision.\n\nFirst, let's consider the President's authority.\n\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the military, but in this case, the troops from the military base are unavailable. So, he's turning to a civilian agency under the INS to carry out this rescue mission.\n\nIs the President's authority as commander-in-chief broad enough to require federal employees, especially those not in the military, to participate in international relief operations?\n\nCommander-in-chief powers are generally associated with military command, and while the President has broad authorities in national security and foreign affairs, extending that to require civilian agency employees to undertake tasks outside their usual duties might be stretching it.\n\nOption A suggests that the President has unfettered authority in this regard, but that seems too broad. There must be some limits to the President's powers, especially when it comes to directing civilian agencies to perform functions outside their statutory mandates.\n\nOption B says that employees of an executive agency can be required to perform such emergency functions. This might have some merit, as executive agencies have certain flexibilities during emergencies. However, again, if the agency's main function is border patrol, forcing them into international relief operations might be seen as beyond their scope without specific authorization.\n\nOption C argues that the executive order is invalid because it's beyond the President's power without congressional authorization. This seems plausible. In many areas, especially those involving the use of federal resources and personnel for purposes outside their intended functions, congressional authorization is required.\n\nOption D suggests that the INS director, not the President, has the power to issue directives to agencies under its supervision. This could be relevant if the agency in question is subordinate to the INS, but given that the agency is under the INS, it's possible that the President, as the head of the executive branch, does have authority to issue such orders.\n\nHowever, perhaps the INS director has more direct authority in day-to-day operations.\n\nBut in this case, the President is issuing the order, which might override the INS director's authority.\n\nWait, the INS is part of the Department of Homeland Security, I think. Actually, the INS used to be part of the Department of Justice but was reorganized under the DHS after 9/11.\n\nBut for the sake of this question, let's assume that the agency is under the INS, which is itself under the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nGenerally, the President has authority to direct actions across the executive branch, including through department secretaries and agency directors.\n\nBut perhaps there are specific limitations based on the agency's statutory mandate.\n\nGiven that the agency's main function is border patrol, it's not clear whether it has the authority or capabilities to conduct international relief operations.\n\nMaybe the President can direct them to do so in an emergency, but it might require specific authorization.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA seems too broad, as it suggests unfettered authority, which isn't usually the case.\n\nB might be acceptable if there's a general authority for executive agencies to perform emergency functions, but again, outside their primary mandate, it might not hold.\n\nC suggests that presidential power is limited absent congressional authorization, which aligns with the principle of separation of powers.\n\nD points to the INS director's authority, but it might not be directly relevant if the President has overarching authority.\n\nPerhaps the key here is whether the President has the authority to redirect a civilian agency to perform functions outside its statutory purpose without congressional approval.\n\nIn general, executive agencies are bound by their statutory mandates, and the President can't unilaterally expand their missions beyond what Congress has authorized.\n\nTherefore, option C seems most appropriate: the executive order is invalid because it's beyond the scope of presidential power absent congressional authorization.\n\nOptions A and B overstate the President's authority in this scenario, and option D doesn't directly address the scope of the President's power.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
