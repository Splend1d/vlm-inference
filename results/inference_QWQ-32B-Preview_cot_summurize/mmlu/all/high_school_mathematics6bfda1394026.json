                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the smallest whole number that satisfies three conditions:\n\n1. It has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.\n\n2. It has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\n\n3. It has a remainder of 2 when divided by 5.\n\nFirst, I should understand what these conditions are saying. Essentially, I'm looking for a number, let's call it x, that when divided by 4 gives a remainder of 1, when divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1, and when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 2.\n\nOne way to approach this is to look for a number that satisfies the first two conditions and then check if it also satisfies the third.\n\nSo, let's start with the first two conditions:\n\nx \u2261 1 mod 4\n\nx \u2261 1 mod 3\n\nSince both conditions give a remainder of 1 for different divisors, I can think of x as being 1 more than a multiple of both 4 and 3. In other words, x = k*LCM(4,3) + 1, where LCM is the least common multiple of 4 and 3.\n\nThe LCM of 4 and 3 is 12, so x = 12k + 1, where k is a whole number.\n\nNow, I need to find such a x that also satisfies the third condition:\n\nx \u2261 2 mod 5\n\nSo, substituting x from above:\n\n12k + 1 \u2261 2 mod 5\n\nLet's solve for k:\n\n12k + 1 - 2 \u2261 0 mod 5\n\n12k - 1 \u2261 0 mod 5\n\n12k \u2261 1 mod 5\n\nNow, 12 mod 5 is 2, so:\n\n2k \u2261 1 mod 5\n\nTo solve for k, I need to find a k such that 2k divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1.\n\nLet's try k = 0: 2*0 = 0 \u2261 0 mod 5 \u2192 not 1\n\nk = 1: 2*1 = 2 \u2261 2 mod 5 \u2192 not 1\n\nk = 2: 2*2 = 4 \u2261 4 mod 5 \u2192 not 1\n\nk = 3: 2*3 = 6 \u2261 1 mod 5 \u2192 yes!\n\nSo, k = 3 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, x = 12*3 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37\n\nNow, let's check if 37 satisfies all three conditions:\n\n1. 37 divided by 4: 4*9 = 36, remainder 1 \u2192 good\n\n2. 37 divided by 3: 3*12 = 36, remainder 1 \u2192 good\n\n3. 37 divided by 5: 5*7 = 35, remainder 2 \u2192 good\n\nPerfect! So, 37 seems to be a candidate.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the smallest whole number that satisfies these conditions. Since k = 3 gave us x = 37, and k is a whole number, we should check if there are smaller k values that also satisfy the conditions.\n\nWe found that k = 3 is a solution, but is there a smaller k that also works?\n\nLet's see: the general solution for k would be k = 3 + 5n, where n is a whole number, because the modulus was 5 in the equation 2k \u2261 1 mod 5.\n\nSo, k = 3, 8, 13, etc.\n\nTherefore, the corresponding x values would be:\n\nFor k=3: x=37\n\nFor k=8: x=12*8 +1=96+1=97\n\nFor k=13: x=12*13 +1=156+1=157\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the smallest whole number that satisfies all the conditions is 37.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 67\n\nB. 43\n\nC. 57\n\nD. 37\n\nIndeed, 37 is option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's quickly check the other options to ensure that 37 is indeed the smallest.\n\nOption A: 67\n\nCheck conditions:\n\n67/4 = 16*4=64, remainder 3 \u2192 doesn't satisfy condition 1.\n\nOption B: 43\n\n43/4 = 10*4=40, remainder 3 \u2192 doesn't satisfy condition 1.\n\nOption C: 57\n\n57/4 = 14*4=56, remainder 1 \u2192 good\n\n57/3 = 19*3=57, remainder 0 \u2192 doesn't satisfy condition 2.\n\nOption D: 37\n\nAs previously checked, it satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 37.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
