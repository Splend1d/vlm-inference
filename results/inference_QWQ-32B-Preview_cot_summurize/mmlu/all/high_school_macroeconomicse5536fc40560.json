                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have a situation where the demand for a product is falling, and at the same time, the supply of that product is increasing. We need to figure out what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nFirst, let's recall what demand and supply mean in this context. Demand refers to how much of a product consumers are willing and able to buy at different prices. Supply is how much of a product producers are willing and able to sell at different prices.\n\nEquilibrium price and quantity are the price and quantity where the amount demanded equals the amount supplied.\n\nNow, if demand falls, that means at any given price, consumers want to buy less of the product. This would typically shift the demand curve to the left. If supply increases, that means at any given price, producers are willing to sell more of the product. This shifts the supply curve to the right.\n\nSo, we have two shifts happening at the same time: demand is shifting left and supply is shifting right.\n\nLet's think about what this does to price and quantity.\n\nFirst, the effect on quantity.\n\nWhen demand falls, it tends to decrease the equilibrium quantity. When supply increases, it also tends to decrease the equilibrium quantity. So, both shifts are pushing quantity down. Therefore, the equilibrium quantity should decrease.\n\nNow, the effect on price.\n\nThis is a bit trickier because the two shifts are pushing price in opposite directions.\n\nWhen demand falls, it tends to decrease the equilibrium price.\n\nWhen supply increases, it also tends to decrease the equilibrium price.\n\nWait, actually, when supply increases, it puts downward pressure on price, but when demand falls, it also puts downward pressure on price.\n\nWait, no, actually, let's clarify this.\n\nThe general rules are:\n\n- If demand increases, price rises.\n\n- If demand decreases, price falls.\n\n- If supply increases, price falls.\n\n- If supply decreases, price rises.\n\nSo, in this case, both demand decreasing and supply increasing are pushing price down.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price should fall.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the equilibrium price is indeterminate in one of the options.\n\nHold on, maybe I need to consider that the effects on price could be ambiguous in some cases.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a decrease in demand and an increase in supply simultaneously.\n\nBoth of these tend to decrease price.\n\nSo, price should fall.\n\nAnd quantity should decrease.\n\nBut the question says that the equilibrium price is indeterminate in some options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the magnitude of the shifts could affect the price.\n\nFor example, if demand decreases a lot and supply increases a little, or vice versa.\n\nBut in general, both shifts are pushing price down, so price should fall.\n\nAnd quantity should decrease.\n\nBut let's look at the options:\n\nA. The equilibrium price will rise while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nB. The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nC. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will rise.\n\nD. The equilibrium price is indeterminate while the equilibrium quantity will fall.\n\nHmm.\n\nAccording to my earlier reasoning, price should fall and quantity should decrease.\n\nBut option B says price will fall and quantity is indeterminate.\n\nOption D says price is indeterminate and quantity will fall.\n\nWait, why is quantity indeterminate in option B? I thought quantity should fall.\n\nWait, maybe in some cases, the quantity could be indeterminate.\n\nLet me consider the shifts graphically.\n\nIf demand decreases and supply increases, both shifts are to the left for demand and to the right for supply.\n\nLet's draw this out.\n\nSuppose initial demand is D and initial supply is S, equilibrium at price P and quantity Q.\n\nNow, demand falls to D', supply increases to S'.\n\nD' is to the left of D, S' is to the right of S.\n\nThe new equilibrium will be at the intersection of D' and S'.\n\nNow, compared to the original equilibrium, both price and quantity could change.\n\nBut in general, since both shifts are putting downward pressure on price and quantity, price should fall and quantity should decrease.\n\nBut perhaps the magnitude of the shifts could make the quantity change uncertain.\n\nWait, actually, in this specific case, because both shifts are in the same direction for price (downward), but for quantity, demand shift decreases quantity, supply shift increases quantity.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWhen supply increases, it shifts the supply curve to the right, which, ceteris paribus, would decrease price and increase quantity.\n\nWhen demand decreases, it shifts the demand curve to the left, which, ceteris paribus, would decrease price and decrease quantity.\n\nSo, the effects on price are the same (both decrease price), but the effects on quantity are opposite: supply increase wants to increase quantity, demand decrease wants to decrease quantity.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price should fall, but the effect on quantity is ambiguous because the two shifts are pulling quantity in opposite directions.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be that the equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nThat corresponds to option B.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf supply increases and demand decreases, price will definitely fall because both shifts decrease price.\n\nBut for quantity, it depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts.\n\nIf the increase in supply is larger than the decrease in demand, quantity could increase.\n\nIf the decrease in demand is larger than the increase in supply, quantity could decrease.\n\nIf they are equal, quantity might stay the same.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.\n\nHence, option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
