John has to place the symbols +, \u00d7, and - exactly once into the blanks in the expression 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8 to get the highest possible number. He can't use parentheses or rearrange the numbers, which means he has to stick with the given order of numbers and just insert the operations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider all possible ways to arrange these three operations in the three blanks. Since there are three distinct operations and three blanks, the number of possible arrangements is 3! (3 factorial), which is 6. So, there are 6 possible expressions to evaluate:\n\n1. 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8\n\n2. 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\n3. 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8\n\n4. 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8\n\n5. 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\n6. 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these expressions carefully, remembering to follow the order of operations, which is multiplication first, then addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's evaluate each one:\n\n1. 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen, 2 + 24 - 8 = 26 - 8 = 18\n\n2. 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, 2 + 4 - 48 = 6 - 48 = -42\n\n3. 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThen, 8 + 6 - 8 = 14 - 8 = 6\n\n4. 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 2 \u00d7 4 = 8\n\nThen, 8 - 6 + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10\n\n5. 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, 2 - 4 + 48 = -2 + 48 = 46\n\n6. 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8\n\nFirst, do the multiplication: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24\n\nThen, 2 - 24 + 8 = -22 + 8 = -14\n\nNow, let's look at the results:\n\n1. 18\n\n2. -42\n\n3. 6\n\n4. 10\n\n5. 46\n\n6. -14\n\nAmong these, the highest value is 46.\n\nWait a minute, but the options provided are:\n\nA. 22\n\nB. 46\n\nC. 100\n\nD. 99\n\nSo, 46 is one of the options. But is there a way to get a higher number than 46 with the given operations and order?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I missed something. Perhaps there's a way to arrange the operations to get a higher number.\n\nLet me consider each expression again:\n\n- In expression 1: 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8 = 18\n\n- Expression 2: 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8 = -42\n\n- Expression 3: 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8 = 6\n\n- Expression 4: 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8 = 10\n\n- Expression 5: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8 = 46\n\n- Expression 6: 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8 = -14\n\nAll of these have been evaluated, and 46 is the highest.\n\nBut option C is 100 and D is 99, which are higher than 46. Is there a mistake in my approach?\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that multiplication can be applied in a way that maximizes the product.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a way to get a higher number.\n\nWhat if I consider the expression 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8 = 46 again.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the operations differently to get a higher number?\n\nLet me try to see if I can get 100 or 99.\n\nFor example, if I could arrange it as 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 \u00d7 8, but I can only use each operation once. Oh, wait, I have only one multiplication symbol to use.\n\nSimilarly, if I could do 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 + 8, but again, I have only one addition and one subtraction.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the order differently.\n\nWait, but no, I can't rearrange the numbers. They must stay in the order 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nAnd I have to use each operation exactly once.\n\nSo, maybe 46 is indeed the highest possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the operations in a different order.\n\nWait, let's try arranging the operations differently.\n\nWhat about 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 - 8, but I only have one multiplication symbol. Oh, no, I have only one \u00d7.\n\nWait, no, I have to use each operation exactly once: one +, one \u00d7, and one -.\n\nSo, I can't have two multiplications.\n\nOkay, so my initial evaluation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the operations in a different sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps I can arrange it as 2 + 4 - 6 + 8, but then I'm using + and - more than once, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no, I have to use each operation exactly once.\n\nWait, but in the expressions above, I've already considered all possible arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the operations are placed between the numbers in sequence.\n\nSo, 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8, with each blank being one of the three operations, each used once.\n\nYes, that's what I did earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the associative property, but since there are no parentheses, the order of operations dictates that multiplication is done first.\n\nWait, in expression 5: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8, multiplication is done first: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48, then 2 - 4 = -2, then -2 + 48 = 46.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the operations to get a higher number?\n\nWait, what if I arrange it as 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8, which is 2 + 24 - 8 = 18, which is lower.\n\nOr 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8 = 8 + 6 - 8 = 6.\n\nOr 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8 = 8 - 6 + 8 = 10.\n\nOr 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8 = -2 + 48 = 46.\n\nOr 2 - 4 \u00d7 6 + 8 = -22 + 8 = -14.\n\nSo, again, 46 is the highest.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that subtraction can be applied differently.\n\nWhat if I consider 2 + 4 - 6 \u00d7 8, but that gives -42.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 2 \u00d7 4 - 6 + 8 = 10.\n\nStill less than 46.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if there's a way to get 100 or 99.\n\nIs there any arrangement that can give me 100?\n\nLet me try to see.\n\nIf I could arrange it as 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 6 - 8, but I can only use one multiplication.\n\nWait, no, I have only one \u00d7.\n\nAlternatively, 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 + 8, but again, I can't have two pluses.\n\nWait, no, I have to use each operation exactly once.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the operations are used in a different sequence.\n\nWait, maybe I can arrange it as 2 + 4 \u00d7 (6 - 8), but I can't use parentheses.\n\nNo, parentheses are not allowed.\n\nSo, the order of operations is strictly multiplication first, then addition and subtraction left to right.\n\nSo, in expression 5: 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8, it's multiplication first: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48, then 2 - 4 = -2, then -2 + 48 = 46.\n\nIs there a way to arrange the operations to get a higher number?\n\nWait, perhaps if I arrange it as 2 \u00d7 (4 + 6) - 8, but again, parentheses are not allowed.\n\nSo, that's not valid.\n\nAlternatively, 2 \u00d7 4 + 6 - 8, which is 8 + 6 - 8 = 6.\n\nStill less than 46.\n\nWait, maybe 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8 is indeed the highest possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that addition and subtraction can be rearranged in a way that maximizes the result.\n\nWait, but I've already considered all possible arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that subtraction can be applied to the largest possible number.\n\nWait, for example, 2 + 4 \u00d7 (6 - 8), but again, no parentheses.\n\nWait, without parentheses, it would be 2 + 4 \u00d7 6 - 8, which is 2 + 24 - 8 = 18.\n\nStill less than 46.\n\nAlternatively, 2 - 4 + 6 \u00d7 8 = 46.\n\nIs there a way to get higher?\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider the operations in a different sequence.\n\nWait, but with the given constraints, I don't see a way to arrange the operations to get higher than 46.\n\nTherefore, the highest possible number John could obtain is 46.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{46} \\]"
