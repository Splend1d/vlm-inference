                    "text": "This question is about group dynamics and how discussions within groups can affect individuals' positions on a topic, in this case, the death penalty. Let's break it down.\n\nWe have two groups:\n\n- Group A: All members initially opposed to the death penalty.\n\n- Group B: Two members opposed and two in favor of the death penalty.\n\nThe question is asking what we would expect to happen after an intense discussion within each group about capital punishment, based on research.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Both groups would moderate their positions.\n\nB. Group A members would moderate their positions, but Group B members would retain their original positions.\n\nC. Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions.\n\nD. Group A members would retain their original positions, but Group B members would moderate their positions.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider how group discussions affect individuals' opinions, especially in homogeneous versus heterogeneous groups.\n\nFirst, let's think about Group A, where all members start with the same position against the death penalty. Research on group dynamics suggests that when people interact with others who share their views, they tend to become more extreme in their positions. This phenomenon is known as \"group polarization.\" So, in Group A, we might expect that after discussing the topic, members become even more firmly opposed to the death penalty.\n\nNow, let's consider Group B, which has a mix of opinions: two opposed and two in favor of the death penalty. In this heterogeneous group, discussions are likely to involve more debate and exchange of different viewpoints. Research suggests that in such diverse groups, individuals may consider multiple perspectives, which could lead to moderation of their positions as they encounter and consider opposing arguments.\n\nSo, based on this understanding:\n\n- Group A, being a homogeneous group, is likely to experience group polarization, leading to more extreme positions against the death penalty.\n\n- Group B, being a heterogeneous group, is likely to experience attitude moderation as members consider different perspectives.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Both groups would moderate their positions. This seems unlikely because Group A is homogeneous and might polarize.\n\nB. Group A members would moderate their positions, but Group B members would retain their original positions. This contradicts the expectation of group polarization in Group A.\n\nC. Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions. This aligns with the expectations based on group dynamics research.\n\nD. Group A members would retain their original positions, but Group B members would moderate their positions. This suggests that Group A doesn't change, which contradicts the polarization effect.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be option C: Group A would become more firmly entrenched, while Group B members would moderate their positions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a generalization based on research trends, and actual outcomes can vary depending on various factors such as the intensity of discussion, the personalities involved, and the specific topic.\n\nAlso, it's worth considering that in some cases, heterogeneous groups might lead to polarization if the debate becomes polarized and entrenches positions further. But based on the standard understanding of group dynamics, option C seems the most accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
