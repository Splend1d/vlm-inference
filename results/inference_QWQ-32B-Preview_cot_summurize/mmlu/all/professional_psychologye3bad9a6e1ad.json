So, as a psychologist, how should you approach developing professional and ethical standards for psychological services?\n\nOption A says you should only work with fellow psychologists. Hmm, that seems a bit isolated. In a multidisciplinary setting, wouldn't it be better to collaborate with other professionals too? Probably not the best choice.\n\nOption B is about cooperating with other professionals when developing these standards. That sounds more collaborative and inclusive, which might be good in a multidisciplinary environment.\n\nOption C suggests consulting with your local ethics committee for permission to work with other professionals. Wait, do you need permission to collaborate? It seems like seeking approval might be an extra step. Maybe not necessary?\n\nOption D says to develop standards that don't recognize professional differences. So, creating universal standards that don't take into account the specific roles and expertise of different professionals? That might not be practical.\n\nLet me think about this. In a multidisciplinary team, there are professionals from different backgrounds, each with their own ethical standards and perspectives. As a psychologist, it's important to respect those differences while also ensuring that the ethical standards for psychological services are maintained.\n\nOption B seems the most appropriate because it encourages cooperation with other professionals. This way, you can share insights, understand each other's perspectives, and develop comprehensive standards that consider everyone's roles and ethical considerations.\n\nOption A is too narrow, as it excludes other professionals who might have valuable input. Option C seems unnecessarily bureaucratic; while ethics committees are important, seeking permission for collaboration might not be required. Option D ignores the professional differences, which could lead to standards that don't adequately address the specific ethical issues each profession faces.\n\nTherefore, the best approach is to cooperate with other professionals when developing professional and ethical standards for psychological services. So, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
