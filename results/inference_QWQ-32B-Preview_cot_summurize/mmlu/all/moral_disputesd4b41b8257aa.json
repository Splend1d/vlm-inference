                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement Macedo would disagree with. First, I need to recall who Macedo is and what his views on immigration are. I remember that Macedo is a political philosopher who has written about immigration and citizenship. He's generally considered to be in the liberal camp, but I think he has some nuanced views on the subject.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"States should give special weight to their own citizens.\" I think Macedo might agree with this to some extent. In his work, he acknowledges that states have responsibilities to their citizens and that citizenship carries certain rights and duties. So, perhaps he wouldn't completely disagree with this statement. But I need to be careful because he might have qualifications to this idea.\n\nOption B: \"Immigration policies can have powerful economic effects.\" This seems like a straightforward statement that most people would agree with, regardless of their political views. Immigration can impact labor markets, wages, and overall economic growth. I doubt Macedo would disagree with this. In fact, he probably discusses these economic aspects in his writings.\n\nOption C: \"Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.\" Hmm, this is interesting. Macedo is known for emphasizing the importance of democracy and self-governance in political theory. He likely believes that self-governance is a crucial aspect of political life and that it has moral significance. Therefore, I suspect he would disagree with this statement, as it suggests that self-governance doesn't matter in the context of immigration.\n\nOption D: \"There are reasons to think U.S. immigration policy has had detrimental effects on income distribution among citizens.\" This seems like a plausible statement, and again, I think most scholars would agree that immigration policies can have various effects on income distribution. Some studies suggest that immigration can lead to wage depressions for certain groups, while others argue that the overall effect is positive. Macedo, being a scholar, would likely acknowledge the complexity of this issue and consider that there might be detrimental effects for some citizens.\n\nSo, considering all these options, I think Macedo would most disagree with option C: \"Self-governance is morally irrelevant to the immigration debate.\" This is because his work emphasizes the importance of democratic self-governance and how it relates to issues of citizenship and immigration.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should recall some of his specific arguments. Macedo argues that while states have the right to control their borders, they also have moral obligations to consider the rights and interests of non-citizens. He stresses that immigration policies should be just and that they should be designed in a way that respects the rights of all persons involved.\n\nGiven this, his view is probably that self-governance is important, but it's not the only consideration in immigration policy. There are other moral considerations, such as the rights of immigrants and the global distribution of opportunities.\n\nTherefore, saying that self-governance is morally irrelevant would likely be contrary to his position. He probably believes that self-governance is relevant, but it needs to be balanced with other moral considerations.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
