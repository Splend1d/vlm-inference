                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a grantor who conveyed his property to his son \"for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs.\" So, the son got a life estate, meaning he owns the property for his lifetime, and after he dies, the property goes to his heirs. This is a remainder to his heirs.\n\nNow, two years later, the son decides to sell the property to his friend. They enter into a real estate agreement where the son promises to convey the premises to his friend in fee simple absolute. A fee simple absolute is the most complete ownership interest in property.\n\nBefore the settlement date, the friend backs out, saying that the son can't convey a fee simple because he only owns a life estate.\n\nThe question is, if the Rule in Shelley's Case applies in this jurisdiction, what would be the outcome of a suit by the son for specific performance of the real estate contract?\n\nLet's recall what the Rule in Shelley's Case is. It's an old common law rule that applies when a conveyance gives property to a person for life, and then to that person's heirs after their death. If both elements are present in the same instrument, the rule merges the life estate and the remainder, turning it into a fee simple absolute.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the grantor conveyed the property to his son for life, and then to his heirs after the son's death. This seems to fit the Rule in Shelley's Case.\n\nIf the rule applies, then the son wouldn't just have a life estate with a remainder to his heirs; instead, he would have a fee simple absolute from the beginning.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let's double-check the rule. The Rule in Shelley's Case applies when the conveyance says something like \"to A for life, and after A's death, to A's heirs.\" In that case, it merges into a fee simple absolute.\n\nIn this scenario, it says \"to his son for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs.\" It's similar, but specified as a remainder to his heirs.\n\nI think the rule still applies here, merging the life estate and the remainder into a fee simple absolute.\n\nIf that's the case, then the son actually has a fee simple absolute, not just a life estate. Therefore, he could convey a fee simple absolute to his friend.\n\nSo, if the son sues for specific performance, he should succeed because he can convey marketable title.\n\nBut let's look at the options:\n\nA. the son's not succeeding, because he could not convey marketable title.\n\nB. the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.\n\nC. the son's not succeeding, because his heirs have to join in the transaction in order to convey marketable title.\n\nD. the son's succeeding, because the son's conveyance of his life estate to the friend divested the contingent remainder of his heirs.\n\nGiven our analysis, option B seems correct: the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if the Rule in Shelley's Case actually applies here. Maybe there's a twist.\n\nUpon further thought, the Rule in Shelley's Case requires that the remainder be to the life tenant's heirs, and that it's in the same instrument.\n\nIn this case, the conveyance is \"to his son for life, remainder after (the son's) death to his heirs.\" This seems to match the rule's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the rule would apply, merging the life estate and the remainder into a fee simple absolute in the son.\n\nSo, the son has a fee simple absolute, and can convey that to his friend.\n\nTherefore, in a suit for specific performance, the son should succeed because he can convey marketable title.\n\nThus, the answer should be B: the son's succeeding, because he had a fee simple to convey.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to be thorough.\n\nOption A says the son doesn't succeed because he couldn't convey marketable title. But if the rule applies, he can convey marketable title, so this is incorrect.\n\nOption C says the son doesn't succeed because his heirs have to join in the transaction. But under the rule, he has a fee simple, so his heirs aren't involved; hence, this is incorrect.\n\nOption D says the son succeeds because his conveyance of his life estate divested the contingent remainder of his heirs. Actually, the rule already merged the interests into a fee simple, so this isn't accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
