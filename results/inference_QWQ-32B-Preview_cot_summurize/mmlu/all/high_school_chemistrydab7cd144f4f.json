                    "text": "To determine which reaction has the greatest decrease in entropy, we need to consider the entropy changes associated with each reaction. Entropy (S) is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In chemical reactions, entropy changes can be influenced by factors such as the physical states of reactants and products, the number of moles of gas, and the complexity of molecules.\n\nLet's analyze each reaction step by step:\n\n**Option A: HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \u2192 NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)**\n\n- Reactants: HCl(aq) and NaOH(aq) are both aqueous solutions, which are highly disordered.\n- Products: NaCl(aq) is an aqueous solution, and H2O(l) is a liquid, both of which are also disordered but slightly less than the reactants because some ions are now combined.\n- Entropy change: There is a slight decrease in entropy because the reactants are more disordered than the products, but the change is not significant.\n\n**Option B: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)**\n\n- Reactants: CH4(g) and O2(g) are gases, which have high entropy due to their disordered state.\n- Products: CO2(g) is a gas, and H2O(l) is a liquid. Liquids have lower entropy than gases.\n- Entropy change: There is a decrease in entropy because the number of gas molecules decreases from 3 moles of gas (1 CH4 + 2 O2) to 1 mole of gas (CO2), and liquids are less disordered than gases.\n\n**Option C: C(s) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g)**\n\n- Reactants: C(s) is a solid, which has low entropy, and O2(g) is a gas, which has high entropy.\n- Products: CO2(g) is a gas, which has high entropy.\n- Entropy change: The entropy increases because the solid reactant is converted to a gas product. However, the question asks for the reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy, so this option is not likely to be the answer.\n\n**Option D: 2 SO2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2 SO3(g)**\n\n- Reactants: 2 moles of SO2(g) and 1 mole of O2(g), totaling 3 moles of gas.\n- Products: 2 moles of SO3(g), totaling 2 moles of gas.\n- Entropy change: There is a decrease in the number of gas molecules from 3 to 2, which leads to a decrease in entropy.\n\nNow, let's compare the entropy decreases in options B and D, as both show a decrease in entropy.\n\n- In option B, the number of gas molecules decreases from 3 to 1, and liquids are formed, which have lower entropy than gases.\n- In option D, the number of gas molecules decreases from 3 to 2, but all products are still gases.\n\nTherefore, the decrease in entropy in option B is greater than in option D because not only is there a reduction in the number of gas molecules, but also the formation of liquids, which have lower entropy than gases.\n\nOption A has a slight decrease in entropy, while option C has an increase in entropy.\n\nThus, the reaction with the greatest decrease in entropy is option B: CH4(g) + 2 O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
