His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had killed their despot&\u2026\n\"Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery.\"\nThen, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion had not taken place.\nHis voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on \u00e9tienne, directly addressing him:\n\"Now, do you understand that? These hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place.\"\n\u00e9mile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885\nThe radical movement known as anarchism, alluded to in the first paragraph, had been related to all of the following EXCEPT\n\nA. the International Workingman's Association\nB.

There's a quote from \u00c9mile Zola's novel \"Germinal\" from 1885, and it mentions something about anarchism and relates it to various historical entities. The question is asking which of the options A through D anarchism was NOT related to. So, I need to recall what I know about anarchism and see which one doesn't fit.\n\nFirst off, anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for the absence of hierarchical government and promotes decentralized, often communal, organizations. It's often associated with radical social and political movements, especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOption A is the International Workingmen's Association, also known as the First International. I think anarchism was related to this. The First International was a federation of various left-wing groups, including socialists, Marxists, and anarchists. Anarchists like Mikhail Bakunin were members, and there was a lot of internal conflict between the anarchists and the Marxists led by Karl Marx himself. So, anarchism was definitely related to the International Workingmen's Association.\n\nOption B is Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. He's often considered one of the fathers of anarchism. Proudhon was a French politician and philosopher who coined the term \"anarchism\" and is known for his works on mutualism and federalism. So, anarchism is clearly related to Proudhon.\n\nOption C is the Congress of Vienna. Now, the Congress of Vienna was a conference of European powers in 1814-1815, aimed at achieving a balance of power and restoring stability after the Napoleonic Wars. I don't recall anarchism being directly related to this congress. Anarchism emerged more in the mid-19th century as a response to industrialization and the rise of capitalism, so it might not have a direct connection to the Congress of Vienna. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nOption D is the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune was a radical socialist and revolutionary government that ruled Paris for a brief period in 1871. Anarchists were involved in the Commune, and it's considered an important episode in the history of anarchism and socialism. So, anarchism was definitely related to the Paris Commune.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and D are clearly related to anarchism, while the Congress of Vienna seems unrelated. Therefore, the answer should be C. the Congress of Vienna.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
