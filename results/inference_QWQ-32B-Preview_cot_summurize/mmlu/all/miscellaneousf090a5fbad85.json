Ten miles long and nearly 500 feet deep (152.4 m meters), Lake McDonald, the largest lake in the park, is a direct result of glacial carving. High peaks surrounding the lake all show evidence of the power of glaciers to carve even the hardest of rock. The powerful glaciers that carved the broad U-shaped valley that Lake McDonald sits in also carved smaller hanging valleys with wonderful waterfalls that are accessible by numerous hiking trails. Which of the following best identifies the intended audience of the passage?\n\nA. Scientists researching glacier development\nB. Teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips\nC. Academics studying the historical context of national parks\nD. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald\n"

                    "text": "I'm looking at this passage from the National Park Service's website about Lake McDonald. It talks about the lake being created by glaciers, its size, and how there are hiking trails with waterfalls. The question is asking who the intended audience of this passage is. There are four options: scientists researching glaciers, teachers wanting to create virtual field trips, academics studying the history of national parks, and families interested in visiting Lake McDonald.\n\nFirst, I need to think about who would be most likely to read this kind of information on a national park's website. National park websites are usually aimed at visitors who are planning to go there, so option D, families interested in visiting Lake McDonald, seems pretty likely.\n\nBut let's look at the other options. Option A is scientists researching glacier development. While the passage does talk about glaciers carving the lake and the surrounding peaks, it doesn't go into deep scientific detail that researchers would need. It's more of a general description, so maybe this isn't the primary audience.\n\nOption B is teachers interested in creating virtual park field trips. While teachers might use this information to plan virtual trips, the passage doesn't seem tailored specifically to educators. It's just general information about the lake and its features.\n\nOption C is academics studying the historical context of national parks. Again, while the passage mentions that Lake McDonald is the largest lake in the park, it doesn't provide much historical context about the park itself or its establishment. So, this also seems less likely.\n\nComparing all the options, it seems like option D, families interested in visiting Lake McDonald, is the most appropriate. The passage describes the lake's features, its size, the hiking trails, and waterfalls, which are all things that potential visitors would be interested in knowing before they go. It's informative and gives a sense of what they can expect to see and do there.\n\nAlso, national park websites are designed to attract and inform visitors, so it makes sense that the audience would be people planning to visit. Scientists and academics might use the information, but it's not targeted specifically at them based on the content provided.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. Families interested in visiting Lake McDonald.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
