It's about helping someone in need. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this isn't something morally wrong; it's actually something positive.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I snuck a peek at my opponent's cards before wagering.\n\nThis seems like cheating in a game, possibly a card game where players aren't supposed to see each other's cards. Cheating is generally considered morally wrong because it's dishonest and unfair to the other players.\n\nSo, based on this, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving money to a homeless person is kindness, not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, peeking at someone's cards is cheating, which is wrong.\n\nSo, yes, C seems correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that sometimes giving money to strangers, including homeless people, might be seen as not the best approach. Some people might argue that it enables homelessness or that there are better ways to help, like donating to shelters. But morally wrong? That seems stretch.\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards, it's still generally seen as a good deed, not wrong.\n\nSo, sticking with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
