                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which movement was founded by Mordechai Kaplan. The options are Liberal Judaism, Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism, and Reconstructionist Judaism. I think I need to recall some information about these Jewish movements and their founders.\n\nFirst, I know that Reform Judaism is one of the largest denominations in Judaism, and it's known for its more liberal approach to Jewish law and tradition. I believe it originated in Germany in the 19th century, and some key figures include Abraham Geiger and Isaac Mayer Wise. So, probably not Kaplan.\n\nConservative Judaism is another major denomination, and it tries to balance traditional Jewish law with modern scholarship. I think its founding figures include people like Solomon Schechter and Mordecai Kaplan, but I'm not sure. Wait, Mordecai Kaplan\u2014 that sounds familiar, but I need to remember who he is associated with.\n\nLiberal Judaism\u2014 I'm not entirely sure about this one. I think it might be similar to Reform Judaism, but perhaps with some differences in practice or theology. I don't recall if Kaplan was involved with this movement.\n\nThen there's Reconstructionist Judaism, which I believe is a smaller movement that emphasizes Judaism as an evolving religious civilization. I think Mordechai Kaplan is closely associated with this movement. In fact, I recall that he is often considered the founder of Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nLet me double-check what I know about Mordechai Kaplan. He was an American rabbi and professor who lived from 1881 to 1983. He was influential in developing a naturalistic approach to Judaism, viewing it as a cultural and civilizational phenomenon rather than solely a religious one. This aligns with the principles of Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nSo, if Kaplan founded Reconstructionist Judaism, then the answer should be D. Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider each option again:\n\nA. Liberal Judaism\u2014 not sure about its origins or founders.\n\nB. Reform Judaism\u2014 founded by figures like Geiger and Wise, not Kaplan.\n\nC. Conservative Judaism\u2014 founded by people like Schechter, but Kaplan was also involved in this movement at some point.\n\nD. Reconstructionist Judaism\u2014 founded by Mordechai Kaplan.\n\nWait a minute, I remember that Kaplan was associated with Conservative Judaism early in his career but later broke away to found Reconstructionist Judaism. That might explain why Conservative Judaism is listed as an option.\n\nSo, to clarify, Kaplan started within the Conservative movement but eventually developed his own approach, which led to the establishment of Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nI think that makes sense. I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
