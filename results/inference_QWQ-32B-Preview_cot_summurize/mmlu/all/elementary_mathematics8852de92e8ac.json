If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nLet's apply this to the given set of data: 13, 35, 26, 8, 24, 10, 22, 10, 32.\n\nFirst, I'll arrange these numbers in ascending order.\n\nStarting with the smallest number:\n\n- The smallest number is 8.\n\n- Next is 10. There are two 10s.\n\n- Then 13.\n\n- Followed by 22.\n\n- Then 24.\n\n- Next is 26.\n\n- Then 32.\n\n- Finally, 35.\n\nSo, the ordered set is: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35.\n\nNow, I need to find the median. Since there are 9 numbers in the set, which is an odd number, the median is the middle number.\n\nTo find the middle number, I can use the formula for the position of the median in an ordered list: (n + 1)/2, where n is the number of observations.\n\nHere, n = 9.\n\nSo, the position of the median is (9 + 1)/2 = 10/2 = 5.\n\nTherefore, the 5th number in the ordered list is the median.\n\nLooking at the ordered set: 8, 10, 10, 13, 22, 24, 26, 32, 35.\n\nThe 5th number is 22.\n\nTherefore, the median is 22.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 23\n\nB. 20\n\nC. 22\n\nD. 27\n\nThe correct answer is C. 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
