Louis XIV, but let me check the facts to make sure.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who these monarchs were and how long each one ruled.\n\nLouis XIII was king of France from 1610 until his death in 1643. So, he ruled for about 33 years.\n\nLouis XIV, also known as the Sun King, succeeded his father Louis XIII. He ruled from 1643 until his death in 1715, which is a reign of 72 years.\n\nLouis XV was the great-grandson of Louis XIV. He ruled from 1715 to 1774, which is about 59 years.\n\nLouis XVI was the last king of France before the French Revolution. He ruled from 1774 until his deposition in 1792 and subsequent execution in 1793. That's roughly 18 years.\n\nSo, comparing their reigns:\n\n- Louis XIII: 33 years\n\n- Louis XIV: 72 years\n\n- Louis XV: 59 years\n\n- Louis XVI: 18 years\n\nClearly, Louis XIV has the longest reign among these four.\n\nBut wait, is there any other French monarch who might have reigned longer than Louis XIV?\n\nLet me think about earlier French kings. For example, Louis IX, who was also known as Saint Louis, ruled from 1226 to 1270, which is about 44 years. That's less than Louis XIV.\n\nThen there's Philippe II, who ruled from 1180 to 1223, about 43 years. Still shorter than Louis XIV.\n\nHenry IV ruled from 1589 to 1610, which is about 21 years.\n\nSo, among all these, Louis XIV still has the longest reign.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Louis XIV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
