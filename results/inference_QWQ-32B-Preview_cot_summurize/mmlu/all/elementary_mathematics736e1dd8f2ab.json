The daytime temperature is 27\u00b0C and the nighttime temperature is -125\u00b0C.\n\nFirst, add the two temperatures:\n\n27 + (-125) = 27 - 125 = -98\u00b0C\n\nThen, divide by 2 to find the average:\n\n-98 / 2 = -49\u00b0C\n\nSo, the average temperature is -49\u00b0C, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
