                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. We have Dr. Harold Hanson, who's the head of the personnel committee at a mental health facility. He's facing a dilemma regarding a psychologist who has an unresolved charge of sexual harassment against him. Dr. Hanson recommends not considering this psychologist for a promotion. Now, we need to evaluate whether Dr. Hanson's action is ethical based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let's understand the context. There's an unresolved charge of sexual harassment against the psychologist in question. This means that the matter is still pending, and no final decision has been made yet. Dr. Hanson is recommending not to consider this psychologist for a promotion based on this unresolved charge.\n\nOption A says that Dr. Hanson has acted ethically since sexual harassment is explicitly prohibited by the ethical guidelines. This seems plausible because sexual harassment is indeed a serious ethical violation in the psychology profession. However, we need to consider that the charge is unresolved. So, while sexual harassment is prohibited, the status of the charge is not yet determined.\n\nOption B suggests that Dr. Hanson has acted ethically as long as he is willing to consider the psychologist for promotion if he is acquitted of the harassment charge. This introduces a condition. It implies that Dr. Hanson's decision is contingent on the outcome of the harassment case. This might seem fair, but we need to consider whether withholding consideration for promotion based on an unresolved charge is ethical in itself.\n\nOption C states that Dr. Hanson has acted ethically as long as his decision is consistent with the stated promotion policy of the mental health facility. This shifts the focus to the institution's policy. If the policy allows or requires not considering individuals with unresolved ethical charges for promotions, then Dr. Hanson's action aligns with that policy. However, we need to consider whether following institutional policy always aligns with ethical guidelines, especially in matters of due process and fairness.\n\nOption D claims that Dr. Hanson has acted unethically by violating the requirements of the ethical guidelines regarding employment procedures. This suggests that there are specific ethical guidelines pertaining to employment procedures that Dr. Hanson has not adhered to. We need to consider what these guidelines might entail, particularly in situations involving unresolved ethical charges.\n\nTo make an informed decision, let's consider the principles of ethics in psychology, particularly those related to fairness, justice, and due process.\n\nFirstly, sexual harassment is a severe ethical violation that can have profound impacts on victims and the professional environment. Therefore, it's crucial to take such charges seriously. However, it's also important to ensure that the accused receives a fair hearing and that decisions are based on verified facts rather than mere allegations.\n\nIn this case, the charge is unresolved, meaning that there hasn't been a final determination of guilt or innocence. Therefore, Dr. Hanson's recommendation to not consider the psychologist for promotion based on an unresolved charge could be seen as premature. It might be akin to punishing someone before a fair hearing, which goes against principles of due process.\n\nOn the other hand, promotions often involve trusting an individual with greater responsibilities and potentially more significant influence within the organization. Given the serious nature of sexual harassment charges, it might be prudent to err on the side of caution and not promote someone who is facing such charges until they are resolved.\n\nHowever, this approach must be balanced with the principle of presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Withholding consideration for promotion based on an unresolved charge could be seen as a form of prejudgment, which may not be ethical.\n\nMoreover, employment decisions should be based on professional competence, performance, and other relevant criteria. Introducing considerations based on unresolved ethical charges might set a problematic precedent, potentially leading to discrimination or unfair treatment of employees who are going through disciplinary processes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. While sexual harassment is prohibited, acting on an unresolved charge might not be entirely ethical, as it could violate principles of due process.\n\nB. This option introduces a condition that seems fair, but it still doesn't address the issue of making a decision based on an unresolved charge. The promotion decision should ideally be based on established performance and competence, not on the outcome of a pending ethical investigation.\n\nC. Following institutional policy is important, but it's also crucial that the policy aligns with ethical standards. If the policy allows for not considering promotions based on unresolved charges, it might be ethically problematic.\n\nD. This option suggests that Dr. Hanson has acted unethically by not adhering to employment procedure guidelines. Given the potential conflict between following institutional policy and upholding ethical principles of due process, this might be the most accurate choice.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Hanson's recommendation to not consider the psychologist for promotion based on an unresolved sexual harassment charge may indeed be unethical, as it could violate principles of due process and fairness. Therefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
