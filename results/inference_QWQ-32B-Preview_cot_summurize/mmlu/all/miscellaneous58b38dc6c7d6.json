                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what type of sentence \"Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful\" is. The options are simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex. I think I need to look at how many clauses are in the sentence and whether they are independent or dependent.\n\nFirst, I know that an independent clause can stand alone as a sentence because it has a subject and a verb. A dependent clause, on the other hand, cannot stand alone; it needs an independent clause to make sense.\n\nLooking at the sentence, \"Every day was a happy day, and every night was peaceful.\" I see two parts separated by a comma and \"and.\" Each part seems to have its own subject and verb. \"Every day was a happy day\" and \"every night was peaceful\" both make sense on their own.\n\nSo, since there are two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction \"and,\" I think this is a compound sentence. Compound sentences are made up of two or more independent clauses.\n\nI don't see any dependent clauses here, so it's not a complex sentence, which has an independent clause and at least one dependent clause. And it's not compound-complex, which would have multiple independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.\n\nAlso, it's not a simple sentence, which has only one independent clause.\n\nSo, my answer is B. compound.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. \"Every day was a happy day\" is an independent clause. \"Every night was peaceful\" is another independent clause. They're joined by \"and,\" which is a coordinating conjunction.\n\nYes, that sounds right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
