                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the work done on a 100-kg crate that is hoisted 2 meters in a time of 4 seconds. The options provided are 200 J, 500 J, 800 J, and 2000 J.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for work done against gravity. Work (W) is equal to the force (F) multiplied by the distance (d) in the direction of the force. When lifting an object, the force required is equal to the weight of the object, which is the mass (m) multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity (g).\n\nSo, the formula for work done is:\n\n\\[ W = m \\times g \\times h \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the object,\n\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height the object is lifted.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Mass, \\( m = 100 \\) kg,\n\n- Height, \\( h = 2 \\) m,\n\n- Time, \\( t = 4 \\) s (though time isn't directly needed for calculating work).\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity, \\( g \\), is approximately \\( 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 9.8 \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ W = 1960 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nHowever, none of the options match exactly with 1960 J. It's possible that the problem uses an approximation for gravity, such as \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2, which is commonly used in physics problems for simplicity.\n\nLet's try calculating with \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2:\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 10 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 10 \\times 2 \\]\n\n\\[ W = 2000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 2000 J is option D.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's any other factor we might have missed. The problem mentions that the crate is hoisted in a time of 4 seconds, but in calculating work done against gravity, the time taken doesn't affect the work done, only the distance lifted matters. So, time is likely just additional information not needed for this calculation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there's any friction or other forces involved, but the problem doesn't mention any, so we can assume that the only work being done is against gravity.\n\nTherefore, using \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2, the work done is 2000 J, which corresponds to option D.\n\nHowever, if we use the more accurate value of \\( g = 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2, the work done is 1960 J, which isn't listed among the options. It's possible that the problem expects us to use \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2 for simplicity.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to interpret the problem. Maybe it's asking for power instead of work. Power is the rate at which work is done, calculated as:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{W}{t} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is power,\n\n- \\( W \\) is work,\n\n- \\( t \\) is time.\n\nIf we calculate power using \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2:\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 10 \\times 2 = 2000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{2000 \\, \\text{J}}{4 \\, \\text{s}} = 500 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nWait a minute, 500 W is not among the options either. The options are in Joules, not Watts, so it's probably not asking for power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of what \"work done\" means in this context. Maybe it's referring to the energy expended by the hoisting mechanism, considering efficiency or other factors. But without additional information, that seems unlikely.\n\nLet's try another approach. Maybe the problem is considering only the change in potential energy of the crate, which is indeed \\( mgh \\), as we calculated earlier.\n\nUsing \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2:\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 10 \\times 2 = 2000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let's recompute:\n\n\\[ W = m \\times g \\times h \\]\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 10 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ W = 100 \\times 10 = 1000 \\]\n\n\\[ 1000 \\times 2 = 2000 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 2000 J is option D. However, perhaps there's a trick here. Maybe the problem is considering the average power, but again, the question asks for work done, not power.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the crate is being accelerated or decelerated, but the problem doesn't provide any information about acceleration, so we have to assume it's lifted at a constant velocity.\n\nIn that case, the net force is zero, but the force applied by the hoist must still counteract the force of gravity to lift the crate at a constant speed.\n\nTherefore, the work done by the hoist is indeed \\( mgh \\).\n\nGiven that, the correct answer should be 2000 J, which is option D.\n\nHowever, since 1960 J is not an option, and 2000 J is provided, it's reasonable to use \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2 for this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options provided.\n\nBut based on standard calculations, using \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2, the work done is 2000 J.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 2000 J.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
