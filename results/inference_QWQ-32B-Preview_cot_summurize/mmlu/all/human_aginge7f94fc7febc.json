So, the question is: \"Surveys of older adults who are living together show that they tend to view cohabitation as...\" and then there are four options: A) a first step toward eventual marriage, B) an alternative to marriage, C) a way to save on expenses, or D) their swan song.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what cohabitation means, especially for older adults. Cohabitation is when two people live together in a committed relationship without being married. Now, older adults might have different reasons for choosing to cohabit rather than getting married, especially considering their life experiences and possibly previous marriages.\n\nOption A suggests that cohabitation is a first step toward eventual marriage. Maybe for some younger couples, but for older adults who have perhaps been married before, they might not be looking to get married again. So, this might not be the primary view for them.\n\nOption B says it's an alternative to marriage. This seems plausible. Older adults might prefer cohabitation as a way to commit to a partner without the legal and sometimes financial complexities of marriage. They might value the independence and flexibility that cohabitation offers.\n\nOption C mentions saving on expenses. While financial benefits are certainly a consideration for many cohabiting couples, including older adults, I'm not sure if this is the primary view they have about cohabitation. It might be a bonus, but perhaps not the main reason.\n\nOption D, \"their swan song,\" is a bit unclear to me. \"Swan song\" generally refers to someone's last great performance or achievement before retirement or death. I'm not sure how that applies to cohabitation for older adults. It might be a poetic way of saying that cohabitation is their final relationship before the end of life, but that seems a bit morbid and not necessarily reflective of their views.\n\nConsidering these options, I think B) an alternative to marriage is the most likely answer. Older adults often choose cohabitation as a way to maintain a relationship without the formalities and potential entanglements of marriage. They might have been married before and are content with a different kind of commitment.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any data or studies that support this. I recall that in some studies, older adults who cohabit cite reasons like maintaining separate finances, avoiding the complications of remarriage, especially regarding estate planning and benefits from previous marriages, and perhaps even experiencing more freedom in their relationship.\n\nAlso, some older adults might have partners but choose not to marry due to concerns about how marriage could affect their Social Security benefits or pensions. So, financial considerations might play a role, but again, I think the primary view is that cohabitation is an alternative to marriage.\n\nOption C, saving on expenses, might be a secondary benefit, but it's less likely to be the main reason for choosing to cohabit, especially for older adults who might have more financial stability.\n\nOption D seems out of place and doesn't align well with the other options or with what I know about cohabitation among older adults.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B) an alternative to marriage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
