                    "text": "Let's see. So, the question is about equilibrium real GDP being far below full employment, and the government decides to lower household taxes. We need to figure out what the likely result of this action would be among the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for equilibrium real GDP to be far below full employment. Full employment is when all available labor resources are being used efficiently, and unemployment is at its natural rate, which includes some frictional and structural unemployment but not cyclical unemployment. So, if equilibrium real GDP is below full employment, it means the economy is producing less than its potential, and there is cyclical unemployment.\n\nNow, the government decides to lower household taxes. Tax cuts put more money in the hands of households, which could increase their disposable income. With higher disposable income, households might spend more, leading to increased consumption. This increase in consumption can shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\nIn the short run, an increase in aggregate demand when the economy is operating below full employment can lead to an increase in real GDP and a decrease in unemployment, as businesses hire more workers to meet the higher demand. Since the economy has excess capacity and resources are underutilized, this initial increase in demand might not put much upward pressure on prices, meaning inflation remains low.\n\nHowever, if the tax cut is too large or if the economy is close to full employment, this could lead to inflationary pressures as demand outpaces supply. But in this scenario, the economy is far below full employment, so there's more room to increase production without triggering high inflation.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\nThis seems plausible because the tax cut increases aggregate demand, leading to higher production and employment, but since there's excess capacity, prices don't rise much.\n\nB. Unemployment rises with little inflation.\n\nThis doesn't make sense because a tax cut that increases aggregate demand should lead to higher employment, not higher unemployment.\n\nC. Unemployment falls with rampant inflation.\n\nThis might happen if the economy were near full employment, but since it's far below full employment, there should be enough spare capacity to increase production without causing rampant inflation.\n\nD. Unemployment rises with rampant inflation.\n\nThis is contradictory because rising unemployment usually accompanies economic downturns, not inflationary periods. Inflation typically occurs when demand outpaces supply, which is not likely when unemployment is rising.\n\nTherefore, the most likely result is option A: unemployment falls with little inflation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other factors that could influence this outcome. For example, if the tax cut leads to increased investment or changes in consumer behavior that affect productivity, but in the short run, the primary effect would be through increased consumption and aggregate demand.\n\nAlso, I should consider the multiplier effect. A tax cut increases disposable income, which leads to increased consumption, which in turn leads to further increases in income and consumption, amplifying the initial effect. This could make the impact on real GDP and employment more significant.\n\nMoreover, if the tax cut is targeted in a way that it reaches households that are more likely to spend the additional income, the effect on aggregate demand could be stronger.\n\nIn conclusion, given that the economy is far below full employment, a household tax cut is likely to lead to a decrease in unemployment with little inflation, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
