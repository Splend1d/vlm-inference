                    "text": "To figure out which of these measurements equals one square foot, I need to understand the relationship between feet and inches, especially in terms of area.\n\nFirst, I know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. But since we're dealing with area, not just length, I have to consider square feet and square inches.\n\nA square foot is a square that measures 1 foot on each side. Similarly, a square inch is a square that measures 1 inch on each side.\n\nSo, to find out how many square inches are in one square foot, I need to calculate the area of a square that is 12 inches by 12 inches.\n\nArea is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, for a square foot:\n\nArea = 12 inches * 12 inches = 144 square inches.\n\nTherefore, one square foot is equal to 144 square inches.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 50 square inches\n\nB. 77 square inches\n\nC. 100 square inches\n\nD. 144 square inches\n\nThe correct answer is D. 144 square inches.\n\nI can double-check this by considering that there are 12 inches in a foot, and when dealing with area, I square that number. So, 12 squared is 144. That confirms that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
