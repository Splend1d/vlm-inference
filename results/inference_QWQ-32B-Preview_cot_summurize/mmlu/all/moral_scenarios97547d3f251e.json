The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I play video games instead of reading Twitter.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the person is choosing to play video games over reading Twitter. Hmm, is there something morally wrong with that? Playing video games is a common leisure activity, and reading Twitter is another way people spend their time. Personally, I don't see anything morally wrong with choosing to play video games over reading Twitter. It's just a preference in how to spend one's free time. So, I would say this is not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I moaned when making love to a corpse.\"\n\nThis one sounds really disturbing. Making love to a corpse? That's necrophilia, which is a serious criminal offense and widely considered morally wrong in most societies, including the US. Additionally, moaning in that context seems inappropriate and disrespectful. So, this definitely seems morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, the first scenario is not wrong, and the second one is wrong. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the first scenario. Is there any moral implication to choosing video games over reading Twitter? I don't think so. It's a personal choice, and neither activity inherently involves moral wrongdoing.\n\nFor the second scenario, necrophilia is not only illegal but also universally condemned as morally wrong. It violates principles of respect for the deceased and societal norms about appropriate behavior.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the first scenario is not wrong, and the second one is wrong. So, the correct choice is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
