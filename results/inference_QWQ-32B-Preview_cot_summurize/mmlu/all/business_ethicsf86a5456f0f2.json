The UN Global Compact is a corporate sustainability initiative that encourages businesses to align their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. So, I need to identify which of these options isn't covered by those principles.\n\nOption A is human rights. I know that the Global Compact has principles related to supporting and respecting the protection of international human rights. So, that's covered.\n\nOption B is labor. Yes, there are principles related to ensuring fair labor practices, eliminating forced labor, child labor, and discrimination. So, labor is definitely covered.\n\nOption C is commercial performance. Hmm, I don't recall any principles directly related to commercial performance. The Global Compact focuses more on the social and environmental aspects of business, rather than financial or commercial performance metrics. So, this might be the one.\n\nOption D is anti-corruption. Yes, there are principles that advocate for the fight against corruption in all its forms, including bribery and fraud. So, anti-corruption is covered.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The ten principles of the UN Global Compact are:\n\n1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.\n\n2. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.\n\n3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.\n\n4. Eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor.\n\n5. Effectively abolish child labor.\n\n6. Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\n7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.\n\n8. Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.\n\n9. Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.\n\n10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.\n\nLooking at these, none of them directly mention commercial performance. So, it seems like option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's an indirect connection. For example, good human rights and labor practices can lead to better commercial performance, but that's not the same as the principles directly covering commercial performance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the environment principles could relate to cost savings or efficiency, which are commercial aspects, but again, the principles themselves don't explicitly address commercial performance.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C, commercial performance, as it's not directly covered by the principles of the UN Global Compact.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
