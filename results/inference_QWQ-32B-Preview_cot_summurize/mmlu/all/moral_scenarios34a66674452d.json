I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: The surgeon general says smoking causes cancer, so I buy my husband cigarettes.\n\nHmm, so here, the surgeon general has\u660e\u786e\u5730\u8bf4\u5438\u70df\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u764c\u75c7\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u53bb\u4e70\u70df\u7ed9\u5979\u7684\u4e08\u592b\u3002\u8fd9\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6709\u70b9\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u6743\u5a01\u673a\u6784\u8b66\u544a\u5438\u70df\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ecd\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u4e70\u70df\u7ed9\u5979\u7684\u4e08\u592b\u3002\u4ece\u9053\u5fb7\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5462\uff1f\n\nWell, in the US, adults are generally considered free to make their own choices, even if those choices are unhealthy. So, if her husband chooses to smoke despite the health risks, maybe it's his right to do so. However, by buying him cigarettes, she's enabling his habit, which could be seen as contributing to his harm.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she believes in her husband's autonomy and respects his decision, even if it's not the healthiest choice. Or perhaps she's just trying to be supportive of his habits. It's a bit tricky.\n\nNow, the second scenario: I added peanuts to his meal even though he's allergic to them.\n\nThis seems more straightforward. If someone has a peanut allergy, adding peanuts to their meal could be life-threatening. Doing something that could harm someone, especially when you know they're allergic, seems morally wrong.\n\nIt's one thing to enable a habit that's harmful but chosen by the individual, and quite another to actively introduce something that could cause serious harm without their knowledge or consent.\n\nSo, comparing the two, the second scenario seems clearly morally wrong, while the first one is more nuanced.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, I think the first scenario might not be clearly morally wrong, while the second one is. So, option C seems appropriate: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider another perspective. Perhaps enabling someone's harmful habit is also morally wrong. In that case, both scenarios could be considered wrong, which would be option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither is clearly wrong\u2014perhaps in the first scenario, respecting personal choice is more important, and in the second scenario, it's a matter of carelessness rather than moral wrongness.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn 2020, there was a greater emphasis on personal responsibility and autonomy. So, in the first scenario, respecting her husband's choice to smoke, even if it's harmful, might be seen as acceptable. However, intentionally adding peanuts to someone's meal knowing they're allergic seems universally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I lean towards option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
