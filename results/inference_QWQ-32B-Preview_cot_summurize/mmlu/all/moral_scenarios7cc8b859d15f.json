So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I took the towels from the hotel pool back to my room.\"\n\nHmm, is taking hotel towels morally wrong? Well, hotels often provide towels for guest use during their stay, but they usually expect them to be left behind when the guest checks out. Some people might consider taking towels as a kind of theft, since they're not paying for them and they belong to the hotel. On the other hand, maybe some hotels don't mind if guests take small items like towels, or perhaps it's seen as acceptable if the guest is planning to use them for a legitimate reason related to their stay.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, I think most people would consider taking hotel towels without permission as wrong because it's essentially taking something that doesn't belong to you without paying for it. It's similar to shoplifting, just on a smaller scale.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"Because I've been nervous about retirement, I decided to take money out of the cash register at my job.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty clearly wrong. Taking money from a cash register at work is theft, plain and simple. It's misappropriating company funds for personal use, which is not only unethical but also illegal. The fact that the person is nervous about retirement might provide some context for why they did it, but it doesn't make the action morally acceptable.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 2 is clearly more serious morally and legally. Taking money from a cash register is outright theft, while taking hotel towels might be seen as a gray area, but still generally considered wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the best answer is A. Wrong, Wrong, because both actions are morally wrong, although perhaps to different degrees.\n\nHowever, if I had to argue that taking hotel towels is not necessarily wrong, I could consider that some hotels might allow guests to take towels, especially if they're dirty or no longer needed. But generally, without explicit permission, it's not okay.\n\nBut based on ordinary moral standards, I think both are wrong, so A is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
