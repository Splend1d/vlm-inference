The options are A. 50, B. 40, C. 9, and D. 5.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"5 times as many\" means. If Joe has a certain number of marbles, then Dani has 5 times that amount. So, if Joe has x marbles, Dani has 5x marbles. And we know Dani has 45 marbles, so 5x = 45.\n\nTo find x, I need to divide both sides by 5. So, x = 45 \u00f7 5.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 45 divided by 5 is 9. So, Joe has 9 marbles.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 9 is one of them. So, the answer should be C. 9.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If Joe has 9 marbles, and Dani has 5 times as many, then Dani has 5 * 9 = 45 marbles, which matches the information given. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think option C. 9 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
