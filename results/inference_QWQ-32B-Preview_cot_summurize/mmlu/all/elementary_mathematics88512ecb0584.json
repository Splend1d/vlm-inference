                    "text": "So I have this word phrase: \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected.\" And I need to turn that into an algebraic expression. The options are A. 4t, B. t over 4, C. t minus 4, and D. t plus 4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the phrase is saying. It's talking about some number of cans that are 4 times what Tom collected. So, if Tom collected a certain number of cans, and I need to find out what 4 times that amount would be, how do I represent that algebraically?\n\nI think I should let t represent the number of cans Tom collected. So, t is the variable for Tom's cans.\n\nNow, \"4 times as many cans as Tom collected\" means I need to multiply Tom's cans by 4. So, that would be 4 times t, which is 4t.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 4t - that's what I just thought.\n\nB. t over 4 - that means t divided by 4, which is not the same as 4 times t.\n\nC. t minus 4 - that's subtraction, which isn't what the phrase is saying.\n\nD. t plus 4 - that's addition, which also doesn't match.\n\nSo, it seems like A. 4t is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any other way to interpret the phrase?\n\n\"4 times as many cans as Tom collected\" - the key words here are \"times\" and \"as many as.\" \"As many as\" usually means equivalent in quantity, and \"times\" indicates multiplication.\n\nSo, again, 4 times t is 4t.\n\nI don't think B. t over 4 makes sense because that would be dividing Tom's cans by 4, which is different from multiplying.\n\nSimilarly, C and D involve subtraction and addition, respectively, which don't fit the description of \"times as many.\"\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that A. 4t is the correct algebraic expression for the given word phrase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
