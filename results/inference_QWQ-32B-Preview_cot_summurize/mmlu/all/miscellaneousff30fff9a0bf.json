                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option provides evidence that the Sun's atmosphere contains sodium atoms. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Absorption lines in the solar spectrum are consistent with the presence of sodium.\" Hmm, I remember that when light passes through a gas, certain wavelengths get absorbed, and this creates absorption lines in the spectrum. So, if there are absorption lines that match the wavelengths sodium absorbs, that would suggest sodium is present in the Sun's atmosphere. That sounds promising.\n\nOption B: \"Stars with the same spectral class as the Sun are made mostly of sodium.\" Wait, I know that the Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, and I think most stars of this class are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, not sodium. So, this seems unlikely. Maybe this is a trick option.\n\nOption C: \"Solar samples returned to Earth by the Voyager spacecraft contained sodium.\" Hmm, I don't think the Voyager spacecraft brought back any physical samples from the Sun. Voyagers 1 and 2 were sent to explore the outer solar system, not the Sun. So, this might not be correct.\n\nOption D: \"The Sun gives off energy produced by the nuclear fusion of sodium in its core.\" I know that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion, but it's primarily the fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. Sodium isn't the main element involved in that process. So, this doesn't seem right either.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it looks like Option A is the most plausible answer. Absorption lines in the solar spectrum consistent with sodium would indeed provide evidence for sodium atoms in the Sun's atmosphere.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
