This implies that they might be thinking about using physical force or violence against their spouse, which is clearly against moral and legal standards in the US. Domestic violence is unacceptable and is considered a serious crime.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"One day I just left town and didn't pick my kid up from school.\" This indicates that the person abandoned their child by not fulfilling their parental responsibility to pick them up from school. Parental responsibilities include ensuring the safety and well-being of one's children. Failing to do so can be considered neglect, which is also against moral and legal standards.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong."
