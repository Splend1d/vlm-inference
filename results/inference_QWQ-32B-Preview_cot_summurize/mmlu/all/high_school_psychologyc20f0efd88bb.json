Then, to the same people, they sent envelopes asking for contributions, and many people ended up sending contributions. I need to choose between overcompensation, foot-in-the-door phenomenon, the bystander effect, or proximity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nOvercompensation sounds like when someone does something to make up for something else. Maybe like, if they feel guilty about something, they do extra good deeds. But I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nThe foot-in-the-door phenomenon is a compliance technique where someone gets a person to agree to a small request first, and then asks for a bigger request later. The idea is that once someone has agreed to the small request, they're more likely to agree to the larger one.\n\nThe bystander effect is when people are less likely to help someone in need if there are other people around. It's kind of like diffusion of responsibility\u2014everyone thinks someone else will do something, so no one does.\n\nProximity is about being close to something, maybe physically or in terms of relationship. I'm not sure how that would apply here.\n\nOkay, let's think about what the charity did. They first sent a decal and greeting cards with their logo. These seem like small, positive items. Then, they sent envelopes asking for contributions. And many people sent contributions.\n\nThis sounds a lot like the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. The decal and greeting cards are small requests or exposures to the charity, getting people familiar with them and perhaps making them more receptive to the later request for contributions.\n\nOvercompensation doesn't seem to fit because there's no indication that people feel guilty or need to make up for something.\n\nThe bystander effect seems irrelevant here because it's about helping in emergencies, which isn't related to donating to charity in this context.\n\nProximity might be a stretch. Maybe the idea is that by sending items like decals and cards, the charity is creating a sense of closeness with the recipients, making them more likely to donate. But compared to the foot-in-the-door phenomenon, this seems less direct.\n\nSo, I think the most appropriate answer is B. foot-in-the-door phenomenon. The charity is using small initial requests or exposures to make the larger request for contributions more likely to be accepted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
