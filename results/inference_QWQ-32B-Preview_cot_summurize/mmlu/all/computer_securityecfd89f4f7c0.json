So, the question is about a type of program that steals your login and password information specifically for instant messaging applications. The options are IM Trojans, Backdoor Trojans, Trojan-Downloader, and Ransom Trojan.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with IM Trojans: I think \"IM\" stands for instant messaging. So, an IM Trojan is probably a type of malware designed to target instant messaging applications. That sounds pretty relevant to the question.\n\nNext, Backdoor Trojans: These are programs that create a backdoor on your system, allowing hackers to gain remote access to your computer. While this could potentially be used to steal passwords, it's more about gaining access than specifically targeting instant messaging credentials.\n\nTrojan-Downloader: This type of Trojan is designed to download and install additional malware onto your system. Again, while it could\u95f4\u63a5ly lead to password theft, it's not specifically targeted at instant messaging applications.\n\nRansom Trojan: This is a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom for the decryption key. It's more about holding your data hostage than stealing specific types of information like passwords.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like IM Trojans are the most directly related to stealing login and password information for instant messaging applications.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Backdoor Trojans could be used to steal passwords if the hacker accesses your system through the backdoor and then searches for passwords. However, that seems more general and not specifically targeted at instant messaging.\n\nTrojan-Downloader might download other malware that could steal passwords, but again, it's not specifically aimed at instant messaging applications.\n\nRansom Trojans are more about encrypting your files and demanding money, so they don't directly steal passwords.\n\nTherefore, IM Trojans seem to be the most appropriate answer here.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other type of malware that specifically targets instant messaging credentials. But based on the options provided, IM Trojans are the only ones mentioned that directly relate to instant messaging.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. IM Trojans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
