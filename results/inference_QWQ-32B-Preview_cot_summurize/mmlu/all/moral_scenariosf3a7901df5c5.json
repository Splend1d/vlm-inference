                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I called the police on the friendly man.\n\n2. I pushed the old lady in the wheelchair into the busy highway.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I called the police on the friendly man.\n\nHmm, calling the police on someone might be necessary in some situations, like if they're doing something illegal or dangerous. But if the man is friendly and not causing any harm, then maybe calling the police isn't the right thing to do. It could be seen as unnecessary and possibly even malicious if there's no justifiable reason for the call.\n\nIn the US, there's been a lot of discussion about racial profiling and people calling the police on others for benign activities, like napping in a car or sitting in a park. So, if the man is just being friendly and not breaking any laws, calling the police on him might be considered morally wrong because it's unnecessary and could lead to harm or inconvenience for that person.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I pushed the old lady in the wheelchair into the busy highway.\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. Pushing someone, especially an elderly person in a wheelchair, into a busy highway is extremely dangerous and could cause serious injury or death. That's clearly morally wrong because it's an act of violence and endangers someone's life without any justifiable reason.\n\nSo, based on this, Scenario 1 might be wrong depending on the context, but Scenario 2 is definitely wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIf I think Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is wrong, I would choose A. But I'm not entirely sure about Scenario 1 because there might be contexts where calling the police on someone, even if they seem friendly, is necessary if they're actually up to something suspicious.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in Scenario 1, the man is described as \"friendly,\" which suggests that he's not posing any threat. So, calling the police on someone who is just being friendly seems like an overreaction and potentially malicious, which would make it morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, and the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any situation where calling the police on a friendly man could be justified? Maybe if the man is trespassing or if there's a history of violence, but in the scenario, he's described as friendly, so perhaps not.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 is unambiguously wrong.\n\nSo, A. Wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
