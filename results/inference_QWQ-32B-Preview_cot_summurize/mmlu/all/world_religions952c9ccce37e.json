Prayers on behalf of people outside of the Sikh community\n\nB. Communal confession to cleanse the community\n\nC. Inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day\n\nD. Doctrinal instruction for discussion in the community\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Guru's Vak means in Sikhism. I believe \"Vak\" refers to the Guru's word or command, which is essentially the teachings found in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism. Sikhs consider the Guru Granth Sahib as their eternal Guru after the line of human Gurus ended.\n\nIn the morning, Sikhs often participate in a practice called \"Amrit Vela,\" which involves rising early to meditate and recite prayers. So, hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning is likely tied to this practice.\n\nOption A suggests prayers on behalf of people outside the Sikh community. While Sikhs do pray for the well-being of all humanity, I'm not sure if that's the primary purpose of hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning.\n\nOption B mentions communal confession to cleanse the community. Sikhism does have practices for personal and communal reflection, but I don't recall if there's a specific communal confession ritual in the morning.\n\nOption C talks about inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day. This seems plausible because the morning prayers and hearing the Guru's word could set the tone for the day and provide spiritual guidance and inspiration for personal reflection.\n\nOption D suggests doctrinal instruction for discussion in the community. While the Guru Granth Sahib contains doctrinal teachings, I'm not sure if the morning hearing of Vak is specifically for discussion purposes.\n\nLet me think about this. In Sikhism, the Guru Granth Sahib is opened and read daily, and the hukam or command, which is a random passage from the scripture, is read as the Guru's word for the day. This is meant to be a guiding message for the community and individuals.\n\nSo, hearing the Guru's Vak in the morning would likely provide spiritual inspiration and guidance for the day ahead. It's a way to connect with the Guru's wisdom and apply it to one's life.\n\nTherefore, option C, inspiration for personal meditation throughout the day, seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider the other options again.\n\nOption A, prayers on behalf of others, might be a part of Sikh morning prayers, but it doesn't seem to capture the primary purpose of hearing the Guru's Vak.\n\nOption B, communal confession, doesn't align with my understanding of Sikh practices. Sikhs do have a practice called \"seva\" or selfless service, and they reflect on their actions, but I don't recall a specific communal confession ritual in the morning.\n\nOption D, doctrinal instruction for discussion, might happen in gurdwaras during gatherings, but I don't think that's the main purpose of hearing the Vak in the morning.\n\nHence, I'll go with option C as the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
