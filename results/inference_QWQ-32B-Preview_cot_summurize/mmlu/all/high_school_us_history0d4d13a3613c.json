                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Supreme Court decisions and the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. The quote is from Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, where the Court ruled that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal and thus unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. So, Brown v. Board of Education is famous for overturning the \"separate but equal\" principle in the context of public education.\n\nNow, the question is asking about which decision validated the practice of \"separate but equal\" facilities for blacks and whites. So, it's asking for the case that established this doctrine before it was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Marbury v. Madison - I know that this case is about the principle of judicial review, which allows the Supreme Court to invalidate legislative and executive actions that it finds unconstitutional. It's a foundational case for the power of the judiciary, but it doesn't deal with racial segregation or \"separate but equal.\"\n\nB. Bradwell v. Illinois - This case was about whether a state could deny a woman a license to practice law. The Court upheld Illinois' decision to deny Myra Bradwell's application, basically saying that states could restrict women's professional opportunities if they chose to. While it's a significant case for women's rights, it's not about racial segregation.\n\nC. Plessy v. Ferguson - This one rings a bell. I think Plessy v. Ferguson is the case that established the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. In 1896, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public facilities was legal as long as the facilities provided to each race were equal. This case involved a black man, Homer Plessy, who had sat in a white-only railway car in Louisiana and was arrested for it. The Court's decision in Plessy v. Ferguson justified the Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the South.\n\nD. Holden v. Hardy - I'm not as familiar with this case. From what I recall, Holden v. Hardy was about labor laws and specifically whether a state could set maximum hours for miners. The Court upheld the law, saying it was a valid exercise of the state's police power to protect the health and safety of workers. Again, this doesn't relate to racial segregation or the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems clear that Plessy v. Ferguson is the case that validated the practice of \"separate but equal\" facilities for blacks and whites. Brown v. Board of Education later overturned that doctrine, declaring that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about the timeline: Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 established \"separate but equal,\" and Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 overturned it, saying that separate facilities are inherently unequal, especially in education.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
