                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have this spelling checker program that uses a hash table to check if words are correctly spelled based on whether they appear in a dictionary. The hash table has Boolean variables initialized to false, and for each word in the dictionary, the corresponding entry in the hash table is set to true using a hash function.\n\nNow, the questions are:\n\nI. true means the word was in the dictionary.\n\nII. false means the word was not in the dictionary.\n\nIII. Hash table size should increase with document size.\n\nAnd we have options A through D to choose which of these statements are correct.\n\nLet's tackle statement I first. It says that \"true means the word was in the dictionary.\" According to the description, the hash function is applied to each word in the dictionary, and the corresponding entry in the hash table is set to true. So, if a word is in the dictionary, its hash table entry should be true. That seems correct.\n\nStatement II says \"false means the word was not in the dictionary.\" Hmm, this is a bit tricky. If the hash table entry is false, it could mean that the word is not in the dictionary. But, we also need to consider the possibility of hash collisions. Since multiple words could hash to the same entry, if a word is not in the dictionary but its hash collides with a word that is in the dictionary, the entry would still be true. Wait, no, actually, in this setup, each word's hash sets its own entry to true, so collisions shouldn't directly affect the correctness, assuming the hash function distributes keys uniformly and the table is large enough.\n\nBut, more importantly, in this system, if a word is not in the dictionary, its entry should remain false, assuming no collisions. However, in practice, hash tables can have collisions, where different keys map to the same slot. If two different words hash to the same slot, and one is in the dictionary and the other isn't, setting the slot to true for the word that is in the dictionary would not affect the other word. But in this specific implementation, since each entry corresponds to a Boolean value, and assuming each word maps to a unique slot, false should indeed mean the word is not in the dictionary.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each entry is a Boolean variable initialized to false,\" and \"the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true.\" It doesn't specify if there are mechanisms to handle collisions, like chaining or open addressing. If there are no mechanisms to handle collisions, and two different words hash to the same slot, setting that slot to true would make it seem like both words are in the dictionary, which might not be the case.\n\nSo, in an ideal scenario with a perfect hash function with no collisions, false would indeed mean the word is not in the dictionary. But in reality, with possible collisions, false probably still means the word is not in the dictionary, because only words in the dictionary set their slots to true. If a word not in the dictionary hashes to a slot that's already true because another word hashed there, that wouldn't change the fact that its own entry should remain false.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. This seems similar to a Bloom filter, but simpler, since Bloom filters can have false positives but not false negatives.\n\nIn this case, it's a bit like a simple hash set with Boolean values indicating presence. If a word is in the dictionary, its slot is true; if not, it's false. Assuming the hash function is perfect or that collisions are handled appropriately, false should mean the word is not in the dictionary.\n\nBut in practice, with imperfect hash functions and possible collisions, there could be scenarios where a word not in the dictionary has its slot set to true if it collides with a word that is in the dictionary. However, the problem states that each entry corresponds to a Boolean variable, and the hash function is applied to each word in the dictionary to set the appropriate entry to true.\n\nGiven that, and assuming that the hash function is such that each word maps to a unique slot (no collisions), then false would indeed mean the word is not in the dictionary.\n\nBut in reality, hash functions can have collisions, so there might be cases where a word not in the dictionary hashes to a slot that's already true because some other word in the dictionary hashed there. In such a case, the spelling checker would incorrectly indicate that the word is in the dictionary, even though it's not.\n\nWait, but according to the problem description, it's a hash table with Boolean variables, and each entry corresponds to a specific hash value. If two different words hash to the same slot, they would overwrite each other's values, unless there's a mechanism to handle collisions, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nAssuming there are no mechanisms to handle collisions, and the hash function isn't perfect, there could be false positives, meaning that a word not in the dictionary is indicated as being in the dictionary because its hash slot was set to true by another word.\n\nBut, given the problem's simplification, perhaps we're to assume that the hash function is perfect or that collisions don't occur. In that case, false would indeed mean the word is not in the dictionary.\n\nSo, statement II could be considered correct under the assumption of a perfect hash function or mechanisms to handle collisions.\n\nMoving on to statement III: \"Hash table size should increase with document size.\"\n\nThis seems like it might not be necessarily true. The size of the hash table is typically determined by the size of the dictionary, not the size of the document being checked. The document size doesn't directly affect the hash table size needed for the spelling check, as the hash table is used to store information about the dictionary words, not the document words.\n\nIn other words, the hash table is built based on the dictionary, and its size should be appropriate for the number of words in the dictionary, considering factors like load factor and collision resolution, but it shouldn't need to change based on the document size.\n\nThe document size affects only the number of lookups performed on the hash table, not the size of the hash table itself.\n\nTherefore, statement III seems incorrect.\n\nSo, considering statements I and II as potentially correct, and III as incorrect, options C (I and II only) might be the answer.\n\nBut I need to consider whether statement II is always correct, considering the possibility of hash collisions.\n\nIf there are collisions, and a word not in the dictionary hashes to a slot that's already true because another word in the dictionary hashed there, then the spelling checker would incorrectly indicate that the word is in the dictionary.\n\nIn that case, false would correctly indicate that the word is not in the dictionary, but true could be either a true positive or a false positive due to collisions.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to assume an idealized hash table without collisions or with properly handled collisions, so perhaps in this context, statement II is considered correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
