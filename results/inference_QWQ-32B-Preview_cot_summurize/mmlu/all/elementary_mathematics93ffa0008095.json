                    "text": "So there are 10 red chips and 5 blue chips in a bag, and I need to find out the chances of picking a blue chip if I pick one without looking. The options are:\n\nA. 1 out of 5\n\nB. 2 out of 15\n\nC. 5 out of 10\n\nD. 5 out of 15\n\nAlright, first I need to understand what probability is. Probability is like figuring out the chances of something happening. In this case, the chance of picking a blue chip.\n\nSo, there are red and blue chips in the bag. Total number of chips would be the red ones plus the blue ones. Let's see: 10 red and 5 blue, so total chips are 10 + 5 = 15 chips.\n\nNow, the probability of picking a blue chip would be the number of blue chips divided by the total number of chips. So, that would be 5 blue chips divided by 15 total chips. So, 5/15.\n\nBut I feel like this can be simplified. Both 5 and 15 can be divided by 5. So, 5 divided by 5 is 1, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, 5/15 simplifies to 1/3.\n\nBut looking at the options, 1/3 is not directly listed. Let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 1 out of 5 is the same as 1/5.\n\nB. 2 out of 15 is 2/15.\n\nC. 5 out of 10 is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nD. 5 out of 15 is 5/15, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, so 5/15 is the same as 1/3, which is what I got earlier.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nTotal chips: 10 red + 5 blue = 15 chips.\n\nProbability of picking a blue chip: number of blue chips divided by total chips = 5/15.\n\nSimplifying 5/15 by dividing both numerator and denominator by 5: 5 \u00f7 5 = 1, 15 \u00f7 5 = 3, so 1/3.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, D is 5 out of 15, which is 5/15, and that simplifies to 1/3.\n\nBut option A is 1 out of 5, which is 1/5, and that's different from 1/3.\n\nOption B is 2 out of 15, which is 2/15, also not equal to 1/3.\n\nOption C is 5 out of 10, which is 5/10 = 1/2, which is different from 1/3.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D, 5 out of 15, since that's the exact fraction I got initially.\n\nBut wait, the question might be expecting the simplified form, which would be 1 out of 3, but that's not listed directly.\n\nHowever, in the options, only D represents 5 out of 15, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nIs there any possibility that the probability could be different?\n\nWell, if the chips are well-mixed and I pick one at random, then yes, it should be 5 out of 15.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes probabilities can be expressed in different ways, like decimals or percentages, but here all options are in \"out of\" format.\n\nSo, sticking with the fraction approach, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
