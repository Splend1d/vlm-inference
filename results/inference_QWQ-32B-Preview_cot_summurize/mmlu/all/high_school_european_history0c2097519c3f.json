He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe themes of the passage and the mode in which Pangloss tells them show the influence of\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Voltaire's \"Candide,\" and I need to figure out which influence is shown in the themes and the way Pangloss tells his story. The options are Medievalism, Empiricism, Rationalism, and Romanticism. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Pangloss is and what he represents in the story. From what I remember, Pangloss is Candide's tutor, and he's known for his optimistic philosophy that \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.\" This idea comes from Leibniz, a philosopher who believed in pre-established harmony and that God had created the universe in the most optimal way possible.\n\nIn this passage, Pangloss is recounting his adventures after being hanged, dissected, whipped, and forced into galley slavery. Despite all these hardships, he still maintains his optimistic view, crediting Leibniz's philosophy and refusing to retract his beliefs.\n\nSo, the theme here seems to be the persistence of optimism in the face of adversity, and the intellectual commitment to a philosophical system despite empirical evidence to the contrary.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Medievalism - This refers to the ideas and practices of the Middle Ages, which were characterized by feudalism, religious authority, and a focus on the afterlife. \"Candide\" is set in the 18th century, during the Enlightenment, which was a reaction against medieval thinking. So, it's unlikely that the passage is influenced by Medievalism.\n\nB. Empiricism - This is the philosophical approach that knowledge comes from sensory experience and observation. Empiricists emphasize evidence and experimentation over abstract reasoning. Pangloss, on the other hand, holds onto his theoretical beliefs despite his empirical experiences of suffering. So, it seems like he's going against empiricism.\n\nC. Rationalism - This is the belief that reason and logical thinking are the primary sources of knowledge. Rationalists often prioritize theoretical understanding over sensory experience. Pangloss's unwavering commitment to Leibniz's rationalist philosophy, even in the face of contrary evidence, suggests that his mode of thinking is rationalist.\n\nD. Romanticism - This movement emerged in the late 18th century and emphasized emotion, individualism, and a return to nature. It often rejected the rationalism of the Enlightenment. In this passage, Pangloss's rationalist optimism is being presented, and there's not much emphasis on emotion or nature. So, Romanticism seems less likely.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the influence on the themes and Pangloss's mode of telling his story is Rationalism. Pangloss adheres strictly to his philosophical beliefs, relying on reason and theory, even when his experiences suggest otherwise.\n\nBut wait, Voltaire is known for critiquing optimistic philosophy and, by extension, the excessive reliance on rationalism without considering empirical evidence. So, perhaps the passage is showing the pitfalls of rationalism when it ignores reality.\n\nHowever, the question is about the influence on the themes and Pangloss's mode, not necessarily Voltaire's critique of that mode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Empiricism is the answer because Pangloss's story is about his experiences, and the passage details his empirical trials: being hanged, dissected, whipped, and enslaved. But despite these experiences, he doesn't change his beliefs, which are rationalist in nature.\n\nBut the question is about the influence on the themes and his mode of telling, not about which approach he's favoring or ignoring.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\n- Medievalism: Unlikely, given the time period and the philosophical content.\n\n- Empiricism: Pangloss's experiences are empirical, but his beliefs are rationalist.\n\n- Rationalism: His beliefs and mode of thinking are rationalist.\n\n- Romanticism: Doesn't seem to fit with the emphasis on rationalist philosophy.\n\nI think the answer is C. Rationalism, because Pangloss's insistence on maintaining his philosophical beliefs despite his empirical experiences illustrates the rationalist approach of prioritizing reason over sensory data.\n\nMoreover, the mention of Leibniz's pre-established harmony, plenum, and materia subtilis are all concepts from rationalist philosophy, further supporting this choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
