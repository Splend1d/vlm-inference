                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Sally Sobriety and her properties, Greenacre and Blackacre. She owns both, and her only heir is her daughter, Betty Boozer, who has a drinking problem. Sally wants to encourage Betty to stop drinking, so she sets up these conditions in conveying her properties.\n\nFirst, she conveys Greenacre to \"Friend and her heirs, but if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then to Betty.\" Then, she conveys Blackacre to \"Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\" A year later, both Friend and Associate start hosting wine-tasting events on their properties and personally consume substantial alcohol. Sally is shocked and has a stroke, dying shortly after.\n\nThe question is about determining the property interests of Greenacre and Blackacre after these events. The options are:\n\nA. Betty // Betty\n\nB. Friend // Betty\n\nC. Betty // Associate\n\nD. Friend // Associate\n\nI need to figure out who owns each property now, given the conditions Sally set up.\n\nLet's start with Greenacre. It was conveyed to \"Friend and her heirs, but if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then to Betty.\" So, there's a condition attached here: if liquor is consumed on Greenacre, it goes to Betty.\n\nNow, Friend hosted wine-tasting events and consumed substantial alcohol on the property. So, the condition has been triggered: liquor was consumed on Greenacre. Therefore, according to the conveyance, the property should go to Betty.\n\nNext, Blackacre was conveyed to \"Associate and her heirs, but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\" So, here the condition is specific: if Associate consumes alcohol on the property, it goes to Betty.\n\nAssociate did consume alcohol on Blackacre during the wine-tasting events. Therefore, the condition is triggered, and Blackacre should go to Betty as well.\n\nSo, both Greenacre and Blackacre should go to Betty.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nFirst, for Greenacre:\n\n- Conveyed to Friend with a condition: if liquor is consumed on the property, it goes to Betty.\n\n- Friend consumed liquor on the property.\n\n- Therefore, condition is met, and Greenacre goes to Betty.\n\nFor Blackacre:\n\n- Conveyed to Associate with a condition: if Associate consumes alcohol on the property, it goes to Betty.\n\n- Associate consumed alcohol on the property.\n\n- Therefore, condition is met, and Blackacre goes to Betty.\n\nSo, both properties should go to Betty.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Betty // Betty\n\nB. Friend // Betty\n\nC. Betty // Associate\n\nD. Friend // Associate\n\nOption A matches my conclusion.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps there are differences in the way the conditions are worded for each property.\n\nLet's look closely at the conditions again.\n\nFor Greenacre: \"but if liquor is ever consumed on the property, then to Betty.\"\n\nThis seems like a condition subsequent that is triggered by any consumption of liquor on the property, by anyone.\n\nFor Blackacre: \"but if Associate ever consumes alcohol on the property, then to Betty.\"\n\nThis condition is specifically tied to Associate's consumption of alcohol on the property.\n\nIn both cases, the conditions have been met:\n\n- For Greenacre, liquor was consumed by Friend on the property.\n\n- For Blackacre, Associate consumed alcohol on the property.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, the property should revert to Betty.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Betty // Betty.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I need to consider the state of the property interests at the time of Sally's death.\n\nSally conveyed both properties with conditions, and the conditions were triggered before her death.\n\nSo, at the time of Sally's death, the properties should already have transferred to Betty, assuming the conditions were met during Friend's and Associate's ownership.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a difference in the type of condition or the way the conveyance is structured that affects the outcome.\n\nLet me consider the legal aspects.\n\nIn property law, a condition subsequent is a provision in a deed that, if violated, causes the property to revert to the grantor or to an alternative recipient specified in the deed.\n\nIn this case, for Greenacre, the condition is that if liquor is consumed on the property, it goes to Betty.\n\nFor Blackacre, the condition is that if Associate consumes alcohol on the property, it goes to Betty.\n\nSince both conditions were met, the properties should revert to Betty.\n\nHowever, since Sally is dead, and the conditions were met before her death, the properties should already be Betty's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a difference in the wording that affects who gets the property.\n\nWait a minute, for Greenacre, the condition is if liquor is consumed on the property, it goes to Betty. This seems like a general condition that could be triggered by anyone consuming liquor on the property.\n\nFor Blackacre, the condition is specific to Associate consuming alcohol on the property.\n\nBut in both cases, the conditions were met.\n\nTherefore, both properties should go to Betty.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Betty // Betty.\n\nBut let's consider why there might be other options.\n\nOption B is Friend // Betty.\n\nThis would mean that Greenacre stays with Friend, and Blackacre goes to Betty.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the condition for Greenacre was triggered.\n\nOption C is Betty // Associate.\n\nThis would mean Greenacre goes to Betty, and Blackacre stays with Associate.\n\nBut again, the condition for Blackacre was triggered.\n\nOption D is Friend // Associate.\n\nThis would mean neither condition was triggered, which isn't the case.\n\nTherefore, the only logically consistent answer is A. Betty // Betty.\n\nUnless there's something I'm missing about the differences in the conditions or the timing of the events.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the legal effect of the conditions being met while Sally was still alive.\n\nIf the conditions were met before Sally's death, then perhaps the properties already transferred to Betty before Sally died.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Sally's death affects the ownership in some way.\n\nBut based on standard property law, once the condition is met, the property reverts to the specified party, which in this case is Betty.\n\nTherefore, at Sally's death, Betty would own both properties.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Betty // Betty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
