                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The expected selling price for a new product is $19.00, and management wants to get a 20% contribution margin on all sales. The product has variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00 per unit, and I need to find the target variable manufacturing cost. The options are A) $12.20, B) $12.80, C) $15.80, and D) $18.20.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a contribution margin is. I recall that the contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable costs, and it contributes to covering fixed costs and profit. The contribution margin ratio is the contribution margin divided by the selling price, and in this case, it's supposed to be 20%.\n\nSo, if the contribution margin ratio is 20%, that means that 20% of the selling price is the contribution margin. Let me write that down:\n\nContribution Margin Ratio = Contribution Margin / Selling Price\n\nGiven that the contribution margin ratio is 20%, and the selling price is $19.00, I can calculate the contribution margin:\n\nContribution Margin = Selling Price * Contribution Margin Ratio\n\nContribution Margin = $19.00 * 20% = $19.00 * 0.20 = $3.80\n\nSo, the contribution margin is $3.80 per unit.\n\nNow, I know that the contribution margin is also equal to the selling price minus the total variable costs. Total variable costs include both variable manufacturing costs and variable selling and distribution costs.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nContribution Margin = Selling Price - Total Variable Costs\n\nTotal Variable Costs = Variable Manufacturing Costs + Variable Selling and Distribution Costs\n\nI'm given that the variable selling and distribution costs are $3.00 per unit. So:\n\nTotal Variable Costs = Variable Manufacturing Costs + $3.00\n\nNow, plugging back into the contribution margin equation:\n\n$3.80 = $19.00 - (Variable Manufacturing Costs + $3.00)\n\nLet me solve for Variable Manufacturing Costs:\n\n$3.80 = $19.00 - Variable Manufacturing Costs - $3.00\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n$3.80 = $16.00 - Variable Manufacturing Costs\n\nNow, isolate Variable Manufacturing Costs:\n\nVariable Manufacturing Costs = $16.00 - $3.80 = $12.20\n\nSo, the target variable manufacturing cost is $12.20 per unit.\n\nLooking back at the options, A) $12.20 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\nContribution Margin = Selling Price * Contribution Margin Ratio\n\n$3.80 = $19.00 * 0.20\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen:\n\nContribution Margin = Selling Price - Total Variable Costs\n\n$3.80 = $19.00 - (Variable Manufacturing Costs + $3.00)\n\nYes, and solving for Variable Manufacturing Costs:\n\n$3.80 = $16.00 - Variable Manufacturing Costs\n\nVariable Manufacturing Costs = $16.00 - $3.80 = $12.20\n\nEverything checks out. I think A) $12.20 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA) $12.20"
