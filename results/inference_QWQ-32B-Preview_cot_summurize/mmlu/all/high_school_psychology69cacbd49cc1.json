                    "text": "So Eli is starting to sit up on his own, and I need to figure out how old he probably is based on that. I remember that babies develop certain skills at specific ages, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact timelines.\n\nLet me think about this. Sitting up is a milestone in a baby's development, right? I think babies start to sit without support around a certain age, but I'm not sure exactly when.\n\nOption A is 1 month. That seems way too young. I don't think babies can sit up at just 1 month old. They're still pretty newborn-like at that age, and they can't hold their heads up steadily yet, let alone sit up.\n\nOption B is 3 months. Hmm, that seems a little early too, but maybe some babies can start to sit with support around that age. I recall that around 3 months, babies can lift their heads and chest when they're on their stomachs, but sitting up independently seems too advanced.\n\nOption C is 6 months. This sounds about right. I think most babies can sit up with some support around 6 months, and maybe even independently by the end of 6 months or a little after.\n\nOption D is 9 months. That seems a bit late if Eli is just beginning to sit up. If he's 9 months old and only now starting to sit up, that might be a bit delayed.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up when babies typically start to sit up. But since this is a question, I should probably use my knowledge to make an educated guess.\n\nI know that around 4-7 months, babies usually start to sit up with support, and by about 6-8 months, they can sit up independently for short periods. So, if Eli is just beginning to sit up, it might be around 6 months old.\n\nBut option C is 6 months, and option D is 9 months. Maybe some babies take a little longer, but 9 months seems a bit late.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some babies can sit up a bit earlier, like around 4 months, but that also seems young.\n\nLet me consider that \"just beginning to sit up\" might mean with some support, not necessarily independently. So, if Eli is starting to sit up with support, that might happen a bit earlier than sitting independently.\n\nI think around 4-5 months, babies can sit up with support, and by 6 months, they can sit up somewhat on their own.\n\nSo, if Eli is just beginning to sit up, perhaps with support, he might be around 4-5 months old. But looking at the options, the closest would be 3 months or 6 months.\n\nWait, 3 months seems too early, as I don't think most babies can even sit with support at that age. Maybe some premature development, but generally, not at 3 months.\n\nOn the other hand, 6 months seems more plausible. Maybe he's around 6 months and just starting to sit up independently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question means that Eli is starting to sit up without support, which would be more around the 6-month mark.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should consider that all babies develop at different paces, and some might sit up earlier or later.\n\nHowever, since the question says \"assuming he is developing at a typical pace,\" I should go with the average age for this milestone.\n\nI think the average age for sitting up independently is around 6 months. So, option C seems most appropriate.\n\nBut let me double-check. If Eli is just beginning to sit up, and it's around 6 months, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if it's 9 months, and he's just starting to sit up, that might be a bit delayed, but again, development can vary.\n\nBut since the question assumes typical development, I'll go with 6 months.\n\nSo, my answer is C. 6 months.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
