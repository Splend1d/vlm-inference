                    "text": "I think the answer is D. All of these. Let me see why each one is correct according to general relativity.\n\nFirst, option A says \"mass distorts spacetime.\" Yes, that's a fundamental idea in general relativity. Einstein's theory proposes that massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and this curvature affects the path that other objects take. So, mass doesn't just attract other masses through some action at a distance; instead, it warps the fabric of spacetime.\n\nOption B says \"gravity affects clocks.\" Again, this is consistent with general relativity. The theory predicts that gravity can affect the rate at which time passes. This is known as gravitational time dilation. Clocks in stronger gravitational fields run slower compared to those in weaker fields. This effect has been experimentally confirmed.\n\nOption C states \"light can\u2019t escape from a black hole.\" This is also a direct consequence of general relativity. A black hole is a region in spacetime where the gravitational field is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The boundary of this region is called the event horizon.\n\nSo, since all three statements are accurate descriptions of predictions made by general relativity, the correct answer should be D. All of these.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any scenario where one of these might not hold true.\n\nLet's think about option A. Is there any situation where mass doesn't distort spacetime according to general relativity? Well, the theory is built on the idea that mass-energy warps spacetime, so no, in the framework of general relativity, mass always distorts spacetime.\n\nOption B: gravity affecting clocks. This is a well-established prediction of the theory, observed in experiments and essential for the functioning of technologies like GPS, which have to account for both gravitational and kinetic time dilation.\n\nOption C: light can\u2019t escape from a black hole. This is a defining characteristic of a black hole in general relativity. However, with the inclusion of quantum effects, Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes can emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. But this is a combination of general relativity and quantum mechanics, going beyond pure general relativity. In the context of general relativity alone, light cannot escape from within the event horizon of a black hole.\n\nTherefore, sticking to the framework of general relativity, all three statements are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
