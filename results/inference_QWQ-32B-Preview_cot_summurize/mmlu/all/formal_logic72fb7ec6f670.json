                    "text": "So I've got this logic problem here, and I need to symbolize this sentence: \"Either England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture or China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\" Whew, that's a mouthful. Okay, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the sentence. It says \"either... or...\", which suggests that there are two main parts connected by a disjunction. So, I'm looking for a formula that has a disjunction, meaning it uses the \"or\" connective.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nB. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2261 C)\n\nC. (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n\nD. (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C)\n\nAll of these have a disjunction, so that matches. Now, I need to see which one correctly represents the conditions stated in the sentence.\n\nThe sentence has two parts:\n\n1. \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture\"\n\n2. \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds\"\n\nI need to translate each of these parts into logical expressions.\n\nStarting with the first part: \"England's importing beef is a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture.\"\n\nIn logic, \"A is a necessary condition for B\" is translated as B \u2283 A. So, if England's importing beef (E) is necessary for France's subsidizing agriculture (F), then it's F \u2283 E.\n\nOkay, so the first part should be F \u2283 E.\n\nNow, the second part: \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds.\"\n\n\"This given that\" sounds like a conditional. \"China promotes human rights (C) given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds (~S)\" would be ~S \u2283 C.\n\nSo, the second part is ~S \u2283 C.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the whole sentence is \"either (first part) or (second part)\", so it should be (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C).\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches option D.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check because sometimes there can be different ways to interpret these.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret \"necessary condition\" or the \"given that\"?\n\nI don't think so. Necessary conditions are clearly translated as B \u2283 A, and \"given that\" is typically a conditional, i.e., A given B is B \u2283 A.\n\nIn this case, \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds\" is ~S \u2283 C.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's quickly look at the other options to ensure there's no better fit.\n\nOption A: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nHere, the first part is E \u2283 F, which would mean \"England's importing beef is sufficient for France's subsidizing agriculture,\" which is not what the sentence says. The sentence says it's a necessary condition, not sufficient. So, this doesn't match.\n\nOption B: (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2261 C)\n\nThe first part is F \u2283 E, which matches our interpretation of the necessary condition. The second part is ~S \u2261 C, which means \"South Africa doesn't supply diamonds if and only if China promotes human rights.\" But the original sentence says \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,\" which is a conditional, not a biconditional. So, this doesn't match perfectly.\n\nOption C: (E \u2283 F) \u2228 (S \u2283 ~C)\n\nFirst part is E \u2283 F again, which is incorrect for the necessary condition. The second part is S \u2283 ~C, which would be \"if South Africa supplies diamonds, then China doesn't promote human rights.\" But the original says \"China promotes human rights given that South Africa doesn't supply diamonds,\" which is ~S \u2283 C. So, this doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct one: (F \u2283 E) \u2228 (~S \u2283 C), as it accurately captures both parts of the sentence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
