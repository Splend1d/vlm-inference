The scenarios are:\n\n1. I threw rocks at the birds in the backyard.\n\n2. I brought a nurse in for career day.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I threw rocks at the birds in the backyard.\n\nHmm, throwing rocks at birds, that sounds harmful. Birds can get hurt if rocks hit them, right? And intentionally harming animals is generally considered morally wrong in the US. We have laws and ethical considerations that protect animals from cruelty.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like throwing rocks at birds is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I brought a nurse in for career day.\n\nBringing a nurse to speak at a career day seems like a positive thing. It's educational; it's about exposing people to different career options. Nurses are important professionals, and sharing their experiences can be beneficial for students or whoever is attending the career day.\n\nI don't see anything morally wrong with this action. It seems perfectly fine and even commendable.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nScenario 1: Wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches with option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider some other perspectives.\n\nFor Scenario 1, throwing rocks at birds is harmful and against moral standards. But perhaps in certain contexts, it might be acceptable? Like if the birds are causing damage or something? But in general, without any special context, it's wrong to harm animals unnecessarily.\n\nFor Scenario 2, bringing a nurse for career day is straightforwardly positive. No moral issues there.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
