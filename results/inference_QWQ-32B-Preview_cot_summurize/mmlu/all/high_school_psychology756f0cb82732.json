                    "text": "Let's think about this scenario. Edy is giving out cookies with \"Vote for Edy\" on them as part of her campaign for school president. We need to figure out which psychological concept best explains why this approach might help her chances in the election.\n\nOption A is the \"foot-in-the-door\" technique. This is where someone gets a person to agree to a small request first, and then asks for a larger request later. The idea is that once someone has agreed to something small, they're more likely to agree to something bigger. In this case, Edy is giving out cookies, which is a positive and small gesture, and then implicitly asking for their vote. So, this could be a possible reason.\n\nOption B is the \"mere-exposure effect.\" This suggests that people develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar with them. By giving out cookies with her name on them, Edy is increasing her visibility and familiarity among the students. So, this could also be a reason why her approach might improve her chances.\n\nOption C is the \"central route of persuasion.\" This is part of the Elaboration Likelihood Model, where persuasion occurs when people are motivated and able to process the message centrally. In this case, if students receive the cookies and think positively about Edy's campaign message, they might be persuaded to vote for her through the central route. However, this seems a bit more indirect compared to the other options.\n\nOption D is \"pluralistic ignorance,\" which is when individuals look to others for cues on how to behave in an ambiguous situation and assume that the group's behavior reflects the correct behavior, even if it's not accurate. This doesn't seem directly related to Edy's cookie-giving strategy.\n\nConsidering these options, both A and B seem plausible. The foot-in-the-door technique uses a small favor to gain a larger one, and the mere-exposure effect suggests that familiarity can lead to preference. In this context, giving out cookies is a positive interaction that could make students more likely to vote for Edy, either because they feel obliged after receiving a gift (foot-in-the-door) or because they become more familiar with her name and face (mere-exposure effect).\n\nPerhaps the best answer is the mere-exposure effect because it directly relates to the increased familiarity that comes from seeing her name on the cookies. However, the foot-in-the-door technique is also relevant because giving cookies is a small positive action that could lead to a larger favor, like voting for her.\n\nI think the mere-exposure effect is a strong candidate here because it specifically addresses how repeated exposure to her name and face through the cookies could make students more likely to vote for her, assuming that familiarity breeds liking.\n\nBut let's consider the context of an election campaign. In politics, name recognition is crucial. The more people know your name, the more likely they are to consider voting for you, especially if they have positive associations with that name. Giving out cookies is a nice gesture that could create positive associations.\n\nOn the other hand, the foot-in-the-door technique is about compliance\u2014getting people to agree to a small request to make them more likely to agree to a larger one later. While this could work, it might not be as directly applicable as the mere-exposure effect in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the mere-exposure effect is one reason that this approach might improve Edy's chances in the election.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B. mere-exposure effect}} \\]"
