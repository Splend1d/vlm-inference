                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character took naked pictures of women with their consent. So, the key points here are that the pictures are naked, and that the women consented to having their pictures taken.\n\nFirst, taking naked pictures of someone generally involves a higher level of privacy and sensitivity. In many cultures, including the US, nudity is considered private and personal. However, if the women consented to having their pictures taken, that changes the moral landscape significantly.\n\nConsent is a crucial element in determining the morality of such actions. If the women freely and knowingly agreed to have their naked pictures taken, then it's harder to argue that the main character did something morally wrong. In fact, respecting their consent would be morally appropriate.\n\nHowever, there are other factors to consider. For example, what was the context? Were these pictures taken in a professional setting, like a photo shoot, or was it something more personal? Also, what was the intention behind taking these pictures? Was it for artistic purposes, personal keepsakes, or something else?\n\nAssuming that the consent was informed and voluntary, and that there were no ulterior motives or exploitation involved, then taking naked pictures with consent doesn't necessarily constitute a moral wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the main character left the movie theater without notifying anyone. This seems like a relatively innocuous action at first glance. People leave places all the time without announcing their departure to everyone present.\n\nHowever, to determine if this is morally wrong, we need to consider the circumstances. For instance, did the main character have a responsibility to notify someone of their departure? Were they in a group, and leaving without letting others know could cause inconvenience or concern?\n\nIf the main character was attending the movie alone, and no one was expecting them to stay for the entire show, then leaving without notifying anyone is probably not morally wrong. It's their choice to leave whenever they please.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were with friends or family, and leaving without letting them know could cause confusion or worry, then perhaps there is a moral obligation to inform them before leaving.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems like leaving a movie theater without notifying anyone is not inherently morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Taking naked pictures with consent \u2013 likely not morally wrong, assuming consent is genuine and there's no exploitation.\n\n- Scenario 2: Leaving a movie theater without notifying anyone \u2013 not morally wrong, unless specific circumstances suggest otherwise.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
