                    "text": "Let's dive into this trust and estate law problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a lady who owns a house in fee simple absolute. That means she has complete ownership of the property with no restrictions. She devises the house to her cousin in trust for her grandchild, for the grandchild's life, and then to the children appointed in a will by her grandchild. If there's no such appointment, it goes to any surviving children of the grandchild in equal shares.\n\nNow, the grandchild dies in debt. The question is whether the creditors can attach the house.\n\nOption A says yes, because of the rule in Shelley's case. I need to recall what that is. The rule in Shelley's case is a common law rule that relates to conveyances of real property where there is a grant to a person for life, followed by a remainder to that person's heirs. Essentially, it merges the life estate and the remainder into a fee simple absolute. But in this scenario, the remainder isn't to the grandchild's heirs; it's to the grandchild's children, either as appointed in a will or in equal shares if no appointment is made. So, I don't think Shelley's rule applies here. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like this rule doesn't fit the situation.\n\nOption B says no, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds. Hmm, that sounds plausible. A special power of appointment allows the donee to decide how to distribute the property, but it's limited in certain ways. Generally, property subject to a special power of appointment is protected from the donee's creditors because the donee doesn't have complete control over the property. They can only appoint it to certain takers as specified in the power. So, in this case, the grandchild has a special power of appointment over the trust property through their will. Therefore, perhaps the creditors can't reach the house. This seems like a strong argument.\n\nOption C says yes, because the will is invalidated by the rule of sequential appointments, and the grandchild does not take at all. I'm not familiar with a \"rule of sequential appointments.\" Maybe it's another term for something else. Could it be related to the Rule Against Perpetuities or the Rule in Russel v. Russel, which deals with contingent remainders? I'm not sure. If the will is invalidated for some reason, maybe the house would go back to the cousin or to the original owner, but I don't think that directly answers whether creditors can attach it. Also, if the grandchild doesn't take at all, perhaps the creditors have no interest in the property. This option is confusing to me.\n\nOption D says no, because the will as written violates the rule against perpetuities, and reconstructed, the funds revert to the original owner or her heirs. The Rule Against Perpetuities is a legal rule that invalidates interests in property that are too remote or uncertain. In this case, the trust provides for the grandchild's life, then to the children appointed in the grandchild's will, or if not, to any surviving children of the grandchild in equal shares. I need to think about whether this violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. The Rule generally requires that any condition must determine whether an interest is vested within a certain period, usually lives in being plus 21 years. Here, the interest shifts to the grandchild's children, who are presumably identifiable, so it might not violate the rule. But even if it does, the consequence would be that the contingent remainder fails, and the property might revert to the grantor or to the cousin, the trustee. In either case, it wouldn't be subject to the grandchild's creditors. So, this could also be a reason why creditors can't attach the house.\n\nBetween options B, C, and D, B seems the most directly applicable. The property is held in trust with a special power of appointment, which generally protects it from the donee's creditors. Options C and D are more about potential invalidation of parts of the will or trust due to legal rules, but even if those rules apply, the property might still not be available to creditors.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B: No, because when property is put in a trust through a donee's special power of appointment, creditors cannot reach the funds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
