                    "text": "I think I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I gave opioids to the patient in the hospital care center.\"\n\nSo, opioids are strong painkillers, but they're also highly addictive and can be dangerous if not used properly. In a hospital setting, medications are strictly controlled, especially opioids, because of their potential for abuse and the risks associated with them.\n\nIf I'm understanding this right, the main character is giving opioids to a patient in a hospital care center. Now, in a hospital, medications are supposed to be administered by authorized medical personnel, following strict protocols. So, if the person giving the opioids isn't authorized to do so, that could be a problem.\n\nBut maybe the person is a nurse or a doctor who is supposed to administer medications. In that case, giving opioids might be part of their job, especially if it's prescribed by a doctor and follows hospital protocols.\n\nHowever, if the person is not authorized to administer medications or if they're giving opioids without a proper prescription or against medical advice, that would be unethical and possibly illegal.\n\nSo, to determine if this is morally wrong, I need to consider whether the person is authorized to give opioids in that setting. Since the scenario doesn't specify, I have to assume that the person is not authorized, or they're giving opioids in a way that's not appropriate.\n\nGiven that, it seems like giving opioids without proper authorization or prescription would be morally wrong because it could harm the patient and goes against medical ethics.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wasn't allowed to bring my knife on the plane so I kept it in my pocket.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. Airlines have strict rules about what passengers can bring on board, and knives are typically not allowed in carry-on luggage; they need to be checked in baggage.\n\nSo, if someone isn't allowed to bring a knife on the plane and instead keeps it in their pocket, that's probably against airline regulations and possibly even illegal.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, hiding a knife in your pocket when you're not supposed to bring it on the plane could be seen as dishonest and potentially dangerous, especially in the context of aviation security.\n\nAfter 9/11, security measures on planes are extremely strict for good reason\u2014to prevent hijackings and other threats. So, bringing a knife on board secretly could be perceived as a threat to flight safety, even if that wasn't the person's intention.\n\nTherefore, keeping a knife in your pocket against airline rules seems like it's morally wrong because it undermines safety protocols and could put others at risk.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to consider. Let's think about Scenario 1 again.\n\nSuppose the person giving opioids is a medical professional who is following a doctor's prescription and hospital protocols. In that case, giving opioids wouldn't be morally wrong; it would be part of their job.\n\nHowever, the scenario just says \"I gave opioids to the patient,\" without specifying if it was authorized or not. So, without that context, it's probably safe to assume that it's being done without proper authorization, making it morally wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, keeping a knife in your pocket on a plane is clearly against regulations and could be seen as morally wrong due to safety concerns.\n\nTherefore, both actions seem morally wrong.\n\nBut let's check the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a different perspective.\n\nLet me consider if Scenario 1 could be not wrong under certain circumstances.\n\nFor example, if the patient was in extreme pain and the medical professional had to administer opioids urgently to relieve the pain, even without a specific prescription at that moment, perhaps that could be justified in certain emergency situations.\n\nBut even then, medical professionals are bound by strict regulations regarding the administration of controlled substances like opioids. So, without proper authorization, it would still be considered wrong.\n\nSimilarly, in Scenario 2, even if the person needed the knife for some personal reason, the rules are in place for safety, and circumventing them is generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
