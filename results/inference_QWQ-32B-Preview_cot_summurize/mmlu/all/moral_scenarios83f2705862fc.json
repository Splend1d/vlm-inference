Generally, seeking to understand someone's feelings is a positive thing, and asking directly can be a straightforward way to do so, provided it's done respectfully and considerately. There's nothing inherently morally wrong with wanting to know how someone feels about you or asking them about it. In fact, open communication is often encouraged in relationships. So, in this case, it seems like the character is not doing something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the character sees their sister's name in a men's bathroom stall and crosses it out. This action could be interpreted in a few ways. First, writing on bathroom stalls is generally considered vandalism or defacement of property, which is against the rules in most public places and is often considered disrespectful. Additionally, crossing out someone's name could be seen as an act of erasing their presence or marking their action as invalid, which might be considered rude or disrespectful towards the sister.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the character is concerned about their sister's safety or appropriateness of her action in writing her name in a men's bathroom stall. But even if that's the case, crossing out her name isn't necessarily the most appropriate way to address the issue. A better approach might be to talk to her about why she did it and discuss any potential concerns.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards, actions that involve disrespect for property or for someone's feelings are generally considered wrong. Therefore, in this scenario, the character is likely doing something morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
