                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. We have two ice skaters on frictionless ice, which means there's no external force acting on them except during the collision. One skater is 50 kg moving west at 4 m/s, and the other is 75 kg moving north at 2 m/s. They collide and stick together. We need to figure out which statement about conservation is true.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the principles of conservation in collisions. There are two main things to consider: linear momentum and kinetic energy.\n\nLinear momentum is always conserved in a closed system, meaning the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision, as long as there are no external forces acting on the system. In this case, the ice is frictionless, so the only forces are internal during the collision.\n\nKinetic energy, on the other hand, is only conserved in elastic collisions, where the objects bounce off each other without losing any kinetic energy. In inelastic collisions, some kinetic energy is lost, usually to other forms like heat or deformation.\n\nIn this scenario, the skaters stick together after the collision, which means it's a perfectly inelastic collision. So, kinetic energy is not conserved.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is nonzero during the collision.\n\nB. Only the kinetic energy of the system is conserved because it is an inelastic collision.\n\nC. Only the kinetic energy of the system is conserved because it is an elastic collision.\n\nD. The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\nLet's analyze each one:\n\nA. This says momentum is conserved because the net force is nonzero. But actually, momentum is conserved when the net external force is zero, not nonzero. So this seems incorrect.\n\nB. It says only kinetic energy is conserved because it's an inelastic collision. But in inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved; some of it is lost to other forms. So this can't be right.\n\nC. This says only kinetic energy is conserved because it's an elastic collision. But the problem states it's an inelastic collision since the skaters stick together. So this is also incorrect.\n\nD. This says linear momentum is conserved because the net force on the system is zero. On frictionless ice, with no external forces except during the collision, the net external force is zero, so momentum should be conserved.\n\nWait a minute, during the collision, there are internal forces between the skaters, but these internal forces don't affect the total momentum of the system. So, the net external force is zero, and momentum is conserved.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut let's double-check why the other options are wrong.\n\nOption A is incorrect because momentum is conserved when the net external force is zero, not nonzero.\n\nOption B is incorrect because in inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is not conserved.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the collision is inelastic, not elastic.\n\nOption D is correct because the net external force is zero, so linear momentum is conserved.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should calculate the momentum before and after the collision to confirm.\n\nBefore the collision:\n\nThe 50-kg skater is moving west at 4 m/s, so their momentum is 50 kg * 4 m/s west, which is 200 kg\u00b7m/s west.\n\nThe 75-kg skater is moving north at 2 m/s, so their momentum is 75 kg * 2 m/s north, which is 150 kg\u00b7m/s north.\n\nSince these are perpendicular directions, the total momentum before the collision is the vector sum of these two momenta. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nMagnitude: sqrt((200)^2 + (150)^2) = sqrt(40000 + 22500) = sqrt(62500) = 250 kg\u00b7m/s\n\nDirection: tan(theta) = opposite/adajcent = 150/200 = 0.75, so theta = 36.87 degrees north of west.\n\nAfter the collision, they stick together. Let's find their common velocity.\n\nTotal mass after collision: 50 kg + 75 kg = 125 kg\n\nTotal momentum after collision: 125 kg * v\n\nBy conservation of momentum, total momentum before equals total momentum after:\n\n125 kg * v = 250 kg\u00b7m/s at 36.87 degrees north of west\n\nSo, v = 250 / 125 = 2 m/s at 36.87 degrees north of west.\n\nThis confirms that momentum is conserved.\n\nNow, if I were to check kinetic energy:\n\nBefore the collision:\n\nKE1 = 0.5 * 50 * (4)^2 = 0.5 * 50 * 16 = 400 J\n\nKE2 = 0.5 * 75 * (2)^2 = 0.5 * 75 * 4 = 150 J\n\nTotal KE before = 400 + 150 = 550 J\n\nAfter the collision:\n\nKE_after = 0.5 * 125 * (2)^2 = 0.5 * 125 * 4 = 250 J\n\nSo, KE is not conserved; it decreased from 550 J to 250 J, which is expected in an inelastic collision.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is indeed D: The linear momentum of the system is conserved because the net force on the system is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
