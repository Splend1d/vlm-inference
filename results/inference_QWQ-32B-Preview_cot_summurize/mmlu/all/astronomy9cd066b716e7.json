So, the correct answer is D. all of the above.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the rings of these planets vary in size, composition, and visibility. Saturn is most famous for its prominent and extensive ring system, which is easily visible from Earth with a telescope. Jupiter also has a ring system, but it is much fainter and less extensive than Saturn's. Uranus has a complex ring system that was discovered later, and Neptune also has rings, though they are relatively faint and were discovered even more recently.\n\nSo, while all jovian planets have rings, their characteristics differ significantly."
