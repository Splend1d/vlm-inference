The formula for the NMR frequency (\u03bd) is:\n\n\u03bd = \u03b3 * B\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03bd is the NMR frequency in MHz\n\n- \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus in MHz/T\n\n- B is the magnetic field strength in Tesla (T)\n\nFirst, we need to find the gyromagnetic ratio (\u03b3) for 31P. The gyromagnetic ratio is a characteristic property of each nucleus and can be found in tables of nuclear properties.\n\nLooking up the gyromagnetic ratio for 31P, we find that it is approximately 17.23 MHz/T.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\n\u03bd = 17.23 MHz/T * 20.0 T\n\n\u03bd = 344.6 MHz\n\nRounding to one decimal place, this is approximately 345.0 MHz.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 345.0 MHz\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
