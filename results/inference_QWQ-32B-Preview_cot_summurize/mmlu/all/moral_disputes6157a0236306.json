So, Michael Walzer is a political philosopher, and I think he has written about terrorism and how societies should respond to it. The question is asking about his view on how to break out of the \"terrorist cycle.\"\n\nOption A suggests attacking quickly, swiftly, and with full force. That sounds like a strong military response. But I recall that Walzer emphasizes proportionality and justice in warfare, so maybe a blind, full-force attack isn't aligning with his views.\n\nOption B proposes using the same tactics that terrorists use. That seems counterintuitive because retaliating with similar methods might escalate the violence and perhaps make things worse. I don't think Walzer would advocate for that.\n\nOption C is about avoiding playing the terrorism game. This sounds interesting. Maybe Walzer suggests that engaging directly with terrorists only reinforces their tactics and gives them the attention they seek. So, perhaps by not reacting in the way they expect, a society can break the cycle.\n\nOption D mentions using psychological tactics rather than military ones. This could be about addressing the root causes of terrorism or undermining their ideological foundations.\n\nConsidering Walzer's emphasis on moral considerations in conflict, I think option C, avoiding playing the terrorism game, might be closest to his view. It suggests a more nuanced approach that doesn't simply resort to military might but tries to disrupt the cycle through other means.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some of Walzer's writings on terrorism to confirm.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that Michael Walzer has indeed written about terrorism and political violence. In his book \"Just and Unjust Wars,\" he discusses how societies should respond to terrorism. He argues that while terrorism is unjustified, states must still adhere to moral constraints in their responses.\n\nWalzer emphasizes that states should not respond to terrorism by abandoning their moral principles. He might argue that engaging in the same tactics as terrorists would lower the state to their level and perhaps even legitimize their methods.\n\nGiven that, option C, avoiding playing the terrorism game, seems consistent with Walzer's approach. It suggests not giving in to the terrorists' demands and not responding in kind, which aligns with maintaining moral superiority and not escalating the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nOption A, attacking quickly and with full force, might be seen as proportional in some contexts, but Walzer also cautions against excessive force that causes unnecessary harm to civilians.\n\nOption B, using the same tactics as terrorists, is contrary to Walzer's emphasis on ethical conduct in warfare.\n\nOption D, using psychological tactics, might be part of a broader strategy, but it's not as directly aligned with Walzer's primary concerns about maintaining moral standards in response to terrorism.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: avoid playing the terrorism game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
