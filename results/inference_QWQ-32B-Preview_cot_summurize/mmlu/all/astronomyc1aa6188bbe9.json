                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how much brighter the Sun would need to be for Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, to receive the same amount of solar energy that Earth does. Earth is about 1 AU from the Sun, and Jupiter is roughly 5 AU away. Europa orbits Jupiter, so it's also about 5 AU from the Sun.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how solar flux changes with distance. I think it follows the inverse square law, meaning that the flux is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. So, if Earth is at 1 AU and receives 1380 W/m\u00b2, then at 5 AU, the flux would be (1/5)\u00b2 times that, which is 1/25 of 1380 W/m\u00b2.\n\nLet me calculate that: 1380 divided by 25 is 55.2 W/m\u00b2. So, at 5 AU, the natural solar flux would be 55.2 W/m\u00b2.\n\nBut the question is asking how much brighter the Sun would need to be for Europa to receive 1380 W/m\u00b2, the same as Earth. So, I need to find out what factor to multiply the Sun's brightness by to go from 55.2 W/m\u00b2 to 1380 W/m\u00b2.\n\nSo, I'll divide the desired flux by the current flux at 5 AU: 1380 / 55.2. Let's do that calculation.\n\n1380 divided by 55.2 is... hmm, 55.2 times 25 is 1380, because 55.2 times 20 is 1104, and 55.2 times 5 is 276, so 1104 + 276 is 1380. So, the Sun would need to be 25 times brighter.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. If the Sun is 25 times brighter, then at 5 AU, the flux would be 25 times the natural flux at that distance. We calculated the natural flux at 5 AU as 55.2 W/m\u00b2, and 25 times that is indeed 1380 W/m\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between brightness and distance. If the Sun is brighter, it's like having a more powerful light source. The flux at a given distance is proportional to the luminosity divided by the distance squared.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- L is the luminosity of the Sun.\n\n- D is the distance in AU.\n\n- F is the flux.\n\nSo, F = L / (4 * \u03c0 * D\u00b2)\n\nBut for simplicity, since we're dealing with AU and knowing that at 1 AU, F = 1380 W/m\u00b2, we can set L = 1380 * 4 * \u03c0 * (1 AU)\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated than needed.\n\nAlternatively, since flux is inversely proportional to distance squared, and we want the same flux at 5 times the distance, we need the Sun to be 25 times brighter, because (1/5)\u00b2 = 1/25, so to counter that, the Sun needs to be 25 times brighter.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the formula for flux:\n\nF = L / (4 * \u03c0 * D\u00b2)\n\nWe want F to be the same at 5 AU as it is at 1 AU.\n\nSo, F_Earth = 1380 W/m\u00b2 at 1 AU.\n\nF_Europa = F_Earth, which is 1380 W/m\u00b2 at 5 AU.\n\nSo, F_Europa = L_new / (4 * \u03c0 * (5 AU)\u00b2)\n\nBut F_Earth = L_original / (4 * \u03c0 * (1 AU)\u00b2) = 1380 W/m\u00b2\n\nSo, L_new / (4 * \u03c0 * 25 AU\u00b2) = 1380 W/m\u00b2\n\nBut L_original / (4 * \u03c0 * 1 AU\u00b2) = 1380 W/m\u00b2\n\nTherefore, L_new / 25 = L_original\n\nSo, L_new = 25 * L_original\n\nTherefore, the Sun would need to be 25 times brighter.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 25 times brighter.\n\nBut let's see what the options are:\n\nA. 100 times brighter\n\nB. 25 times brighter\n\nC. 2 times brighter\n\nD. 50 times brighter\n\nYes, B is 25 times brighter.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
