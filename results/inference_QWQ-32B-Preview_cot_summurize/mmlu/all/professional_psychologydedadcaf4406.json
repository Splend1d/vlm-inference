                    "text": "I'm going through a multiple regression analysis, and I've come across a predictor variable that has a negative regression coefficient. I'm a bit confused about what this means, and I have a few options here, but I'm not sure which one is correct.\n\nOption A says that I should eliminate that predictor from the regression equation. But is that really necessary just because the coefficient is negative? I thought regression coefficients could be positive or negative depending on the relationship between the predictor and the outcome.\n\nOption B says that the predictor has an inverse relationship with the criterion. That sounds plausible. If the coefficient is negative, it means that as the predictor increases, the outcome decreases, and vice versa.\n\nOption C says that the predictor is uncorrelated with the other predictors included in the analysis. I don't think that's necessarily true. The sign of the coefficient doesn't tell me anything about its correlation with other predictors, right? Multicollinearity would be a concern if predictors are highly correlated with each other, but that's a different issue.\n\nOption D suggests that I've made a mistake in my data entry or calculations. Well, maybe, but I've double-checked my data entry, and the calculations are done using software, so I doubt that's the issue.\n\nLet me think about this. In simple linear regression, a negative coefficient indicates an inverse relationship between the predictor and the outcome. I don't see why that would change in multiple regression. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in multiple regression, the coefficient represents the relationship between the predictor and the outcome, holding all other predictors constant. So, even in the presence of other predictors, a negative coefficient still suggests that, when other variables are held constant, an increase in this predictor is associated with a decrease in the outcome.\n\nOption A doesn't make sense because a negative coefficient isn't a reason to eliminate a predictor. It's part of the model and provides information about the relationship.\n\nOption C is probably incorrect because the sign of the coefficient doesn't indicate anything about the correlation between predictors. That would be related to multicollinearity, which is a separate issue.\n\nOption D might be a possibility if there are errors in data entry or calculations, but I've already checked those.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: the predictor has an inverse relationship with the criterion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
