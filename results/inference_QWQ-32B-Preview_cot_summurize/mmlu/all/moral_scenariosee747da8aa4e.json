I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I sold my business to a competitor without my gym partner being present.\" Hmm, this sounds a bit fishy. If you have a business partner, especially a gym partner, it seems like you should involve them in decisions about selling the business. Selling it without their presence might mean you didn't get their consent or input, which could be unethical. Business partnerships usually involve shared decisions, so bypassing your partner like that might be considered wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I refused to take Jenny's portrait because she wouldn't pay.\" Okay, this seems different. If someone isn't willing to pay for your services, it's reasonable to not provide those services. As a professional, you have the right to expect payment for your work. So, refusing to take a portrait because she wouldn't pay seems within your rights and not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Is there a situation where refusing to take someone's portrait could be considered wrong? For example, if it's a matter of discrimination or denying service based on something other than payment. But in this scenario, it's clearly about payment, so I think it's okay to refuse service in this case.\n\nComparing the two, scenario 1 seems more problematic because it involves potentially violating partnership agreements or expectations, whereas scenario 2 is about upholding professional standards by expecting payment for services.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that scenario 1 is wrong, and scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other way to interpret these scenarios?\n\nIn scenario 1, if the business was solely owned by the main character, then maybe selling it without the gym partner being present isn't necessarily wrong. However, the term \"gym partner\" suggests some kind of partnership, so it's likely that the partner has a say in such decisions.\n\nIn scenario 2, unless there are extenuating circumstances, like if Jenny was unable to pay due to financial hardship and the main character could have offered a sliding scale or pro bono service, but the scenario doesn't mention that. It just says she wouldn't pay, so refusing service seems acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I stick with B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
