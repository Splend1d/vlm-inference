                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about solvents A and B forming an ideal solution. Solvent A has a vapor pressure of 345 torr, and solvent B has a vapor pressure of 213 torr, both at room temperature. I need to find the vapor pressure of a mixture where the mole fraction of A is 0.285. The options are 213 torr, 345 torr, 568 torr, and 251 torr.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an ideal solution is. An ideal solution is one where the vapor pressure is directly proportional to the mole fraction of each component. The total vapor pressure above the solution is the sum of the vapor pressures of each component, each multiplied by their mole fraction.\n\nThe formula for the total vapor pressure (P_total) of an ideal solution is:\n\nP_total = X_A * P_A\u00b0 + X_B * P_B\u00b0\n\nWhere:\n\n- X_A is the mole fraction of solvent A\n\n- P_A\u00b0 is the vapor pressure of pure solvent A\n\n- X_B is the mole fraction of solvent B\n\n- P_B\u00b0 is the vapor pressure of pure solvent B\n\nGiven that the mole fraction of A (X_A) is 0.285, I can find the mole fraction of B (X_B) since the total mole fraction must add up to 1:\n\nX_B = 1 - X_A = 1 - 0.285 = 0.715\n\nNow, plug in the values into the formula:\n\nP_total = (0.285 * 345 torr) + (0.715 * 213 torr)\n\nLet me calculate each term separately:\n\nFirst term: 0.285 * 345 torr\n\n0.285 * 345 = 98.325 torr\n\nSecond term: 0.715 * 213 torr\n\n0.715 * 213 = 152.295 torr\n\nNow, add them together:\n\nP_total = 98.325 torr + 152.295 torr = 250.62 torr\n\nRounding to three significant figures, that's approximately 251 torr.\n\nSo, the vapor pressure of the mixture is 251 torr.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 251 torr is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{251 \\text{ torr}} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
