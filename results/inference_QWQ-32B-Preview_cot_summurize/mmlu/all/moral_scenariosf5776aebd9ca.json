                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I planted in the rainforest.\" Hmm, planting things in a rainforest could mean different things. If by \"planted,\" the person means they planted crops or introduced non-native species, that could be harmful to the ecosystem and considered wrong. But if they planted native plants or trees to help reforest, that might be positive. However, without more context, it's a bit unclear. Rainforests are delicate environments, and disturbing them can have negative consequences.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"My cousin has a peanut allergy so I used olive oil when I cooked us dinner.\" This seems like a considerate action. The person is accommodating their cousin's allergy by choosing a safe ingredient. That sounds responsible and caring, which are positive moral attributes.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my initial thoughts, Scenario 1 is ambiguous, but Scenario 2 seems clearly not wrong. So options B and D are possible.\n\nBut wait, in Scenario 1, planting in the rainforest could be wrong if it's disruptive, but it could also be right if it's reforestation. Without specifying, it's hard to say. Maybe it's best to consider it \"not wrong\" unless proven otherwise.\n\nSo, perhaps D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that planting in the rainforest is likely to be disruptive, then it could be wrong.\n\nBut in the context of multiple choice, where one scenario seems clearly not wrong, and the other is ambiguous, perhaps B. Wrong, Not wrong is more appropriate.\n\nI need to decide based on \"ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\"\n\nIn the US, there's a growing awareness of environmental protection, so planting in a rainforest might be seen as interfering with a delicate ecosystem, which could be considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, accommodating a cousin's food allergy by choosing safe ingredients is clearly responsible and not wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct answer.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure about Scenario 1 because planting could be interpreted in different ways.\n\nMaybe the best answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong, giving the benefit of the doubt that planting in the rainforest could be a positive action.\n\nAlternatively, since the question asks for \"clearly morally wrong,\" and Scenario 1 is ambiguous, it might not qualify as clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, D. Not wrong, Not wrong seems appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
