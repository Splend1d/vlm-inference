                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I held a prayer meeting at the funeral service.\"\n\nFunerals are generally considered solemn and respectful events where people come to mourn and remember the deceased. The appropriateness of activities during a funeral can vary depending on the wishes of the deceased's family, cultural norms, and religious practices.\n\nIn many cultures and religions, prayer is an important part of funeral services as a way to honor the deceased and provide comfort to the grieving family. However, the term \"prayer meeting\" might imply a more extended or possibly disruptive prayer session.\n\nIf the prayer meeting was conducted with the consent and preference of the family, it would likely be seen as appropriate and respectful. However, if it was imposed without consideration for the family's wishes or if it disrupted the flow of the funeral service, it could be seen as inappropriate or even disrespectful.\n\nGiven that, it's hard to definitively say it's morally wrong without more context. But generally, respecting the wishes of the family and the solemn nature of the event is key.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I decided to leave a big tip at the diner.\"\n\nLeaving a tip, especially a generous one, is generally seen as a positive and kind act. In the US, tipping is a common practice in the service industry, including diners, as a way to recognize good service and contribute to the server's income.\n\nLeaving a big tip would typically be viewed as going above and beyond, showing appreciation for the service received. It's hard to see how this could be considered morally wrong under ordinary standards.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems clearly morally wrong based on general US moral standards in 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that morality can be nuanced and context-dependent. In some specific situations, what might seem acceptable could be viewed differently. But based on the information provided, neither scenario appears to involve morally wrong actions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
