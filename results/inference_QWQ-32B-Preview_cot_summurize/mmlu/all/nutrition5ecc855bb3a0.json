No significant difference; low-income urban and rural people face similar constraints in accessing food and consume similar diets in developing countries.\n\nB. It will reduce poverty and hunger because these are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas.\n\nC. Urban dwellers depend more than rural people on purchases to acquire food, have little opportunity to grow their own food, and so are much more vulnerable to food price increases.\n\nD. Poor city folk eat mainly sorghum, millet, maize, and root crops, so a lot more of those foods will need to be produced as the world urbanizes.\n\nFirst off, let's consider what urbanization means. It's the process by which cities grow as more people move from rural areas to urban centers. This is a global trend, but it's particularly pronounced in developing countries.\n\nOption A suggests that there's no significant difference in food access and diets between low-income urban and rural people in developing countries. Is this accurate? Well, both urban and rural poor face challenges in accessing adequate food, but their situations can differ based on factors like availability of jobs, market access, and social services. So, while there are similarities, it might not be accurate to say there's no significant difference.\n\nOption B claims that urbanization will reduce poverty and hunger because they are almost entirely concentrated in rural areas. This seems misleading. While it's true that historically, poverty and hunger have been more prevalent in rural areas, urban poverty is on the rise, especially in developing countries. In fact, the United Nations estimates that by 2050, about 68% of the world's population will live in urban areas, and a significant portion of them will be poor. So, hunger and malnutrition are not just rural issues anymore.\n\nOption C points out that urban dwellers are more dependent on purchased food and are thus more vulnerable to food price increases. This makes sense because urban residents typically don't have land to grow their own food, so they rely heavily on markets and possibly formal employment to access food. Therefore, any fluctuations in food prices can have a significant impact on their food security.\n\nOption D notes that poor city folk consume mainly sorghum, millet, maize, and root crops, implying that more of these foods will need to be produced as urbanization proceeds. While it's true that these foods are staples in many urban diets, especially among the poor, it's important to consider the overall nutritional quality of these diets. Simply producing more of these foods might not address issues of malnutrition, which often stem from a lack of diverse and nutritious foods.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to capture an important aspect of how urbanization affects food security and vulnerability to hunger and malnutrition. Urban dwellers' reliance on purchased food makes them more susceptible to price shocks, which can lead to reduced food intake or choices of less nutritious foods.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial to consider that urban areas offer opportunities for better employment and access to social services, which could potentially reduce poverty and hunger. But this depends on whether urban growth is managed effectively, with adequate housing, jobs, and social safety nets.\n\nMoreover, urbanization can lead to changes in dietary patterns, with increased consumption of processed and convenience foods, which might contribute to different forms of malnutrition, such as obesity and related non-communicable diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, while option C highlights a significant vulnerability of urban dwellers to food price increases, it's essential to view urbanization's impact on hunger and malnutrition more broadly, considering both the challenges and opportunities it presents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
