                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an office building's floor space. It says the building has 300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 square feet of floor space, and I need to write that in standard form. The options are A. 30,561, B. 35,610, C. 300,561, and D. 305,610. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"standard form\" means in this context. I think it means to write the number in its usual numeric form, like how we normally write numbers with all the digits in their correct places. So, I need to add up these amounts: 300,000, 5,000, 600, and 10, and then see which option matches the total.\n\nLet me start by adding these numbers step by step. Beginning with 300,000 and 5,000:\n\n300,000\n\n+ 5,000\n\n= 305,000\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, add 600 to that:\n\n305,000\n\n+ 600\n\n= 305,600\n\nAlright, and finally, add 10:\n\n305,600\n\n+ 10\n\n= 305,610\n\nSo, the total floor space is 305,610 square feet. Now, looking at the options, D is 305,610, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in adding those numbers. Starting again:\n\n300,000\n\n+ 5,000 = 305,000\n\n+ 600 = 305,600\n\n+ 10 = 305,610\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could think about place values. Let's break it down:\n\n- 300,000 is three hundred thousand.\n\n- 5,000 is five thousand.\n\n- 600 is six hundred.\n\n- 10 is ten.\n\nSo, putting it all together: three hundred thousand, five thousand, six hundred, and ten. That should be 305,610.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the place values:\n\n- The 3 is in the hundred thousands place.\n\n- There's no ten thousands, so it's 0.\n\n- The 5 is in the thousands place.\n\n- The 6 is in the hundreds place.\n\n- There's no tens, so it's 1 (wait, no, 10 is ten, so it's 1 in the tens place).\n\n- And 0 in the ones place.\n\nWait, maybe I should write it out in expanded form to verify:\n\n300,000 (hundred thousands)\n\n+ 5,000 (thousands)\n\n+ 600 (hundreds)\n\n+ 10 (tens)\n\n= 305,610\n\nYes, that matches my earlier sum.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 30,561 \u2013 That's too small; I need at least 300,000.\n\nB. 35,610 \u2013 Again, too small.\n\nC. 300,561 \u2013 Hmm, that's close, but it's missing the 5,000. Let's see: 300,000 + 500 + 60 + 1 would be 300,561, but in the problem, it's 5,000, not 500.\n\nD. 305,610 \u2013 This seems correct based on my calculations.\n\nI think the answer is D. 305,610.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The question says \"300,000 + 5,000 + 600 + 10 square feet of floor space\" and asks for the number in standard form. It seems straightforward addition of these amounts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the plus signs are separating different parts of the building, like different floors or sections, but in terms of total floor space, it should still be the sum of these parts.\n\nI don't see any other interpretation that makes sense in this context. Therefore, I'm confident that D. 305,610 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
