But first, I need to convert the percentage to a decimal. 60% is the same as 60 out of 100, so that's 0.60. So now, it's 0.60 times 30.\n\nLet me do the multiplication: 0.60 \u00d7 30. Well, 0.60 times 30 is like 0.6 times 30, which is 18. So, 60% of 30 is 18.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1.8\n\nB. 18\n\nC. 180\n\nD. 1800\n\nThe correct answer should be B. 18.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think another way. If 100% of 30 is 30, then 50% would be 15, and 60% should be a little more than that, which is 18. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of fractions. 60% is the same as 60/100, which simplifies to 3/5. So, 3/5 of 30 is (3/5) \u00d7 30 = (3 \u00d7 30)/5 = 90/5 = 18. Again, that confirms that the answer is 18.\n\nI think option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
