                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about guinea pigs. It says that in a population, 4% are black, which is recessive, and 96% are brown. I need to find out the frequency of the heterozygous condition. The options are 16%, 32%, 40%, or 48%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what heterozygous means. Heterozygous means having two different alleles for a particular gene. In this case, since black is recessive, let's denote the brown allele as B (dominant) and the black allele as b (recessive).\n\nSo, the genotypes would be:\n\n- BB: brown\n\n- Bb: brown (since B is dominant)\n\n- bb: black\n\nGiven that black is recessive, only the bb genotype will be black, and both BB and Bb will be brown.\n\nThe problem gives me the percentages:\n\n- 4% black (bb)\n\n- 96% brown (BB + Bb)\n\nI need to find the frequency of heterozygous individuals, which are Bb.\n\nI think I can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is:\n\np\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1\n\nWhere:\n\n- p\u00b2 is the frequency of BB\n\n- 2pq is the frequency of Bb\n\n- q\u00b2 is the frequency of bb\n\nI know that q\u00b2 = 4% = 0.04.\n\nSo, q = sqrt(0.04) = 0.2\n\nSince p + q = 1, then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n\nNow, the frequency of heterozygous individuals is 2pq.\n\nSo, 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32, which is 32%.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nGiven that q\u00b2 = 0.04, so q = 0.2.\n\np = 1 - q = 0.8.\n\nThen, 2pq = 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32, which is 32%.\n\nSo, the answer should be 32%.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, the frequency of brown individuals is 96%, which is p\u00b2 + 2pq.\n\nBut I already have q\u00b2 = 4%, so q = 0.2, p = 0.8.\n\nAgain, 2pq = 0.32, or 32%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the answer could be different.\n\nWait, sometimes in these types of problems, the population might not be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, but the problem doesn't specify that. So, I think it's safe to assume Hardy-Weinberg here.\n\nTherefore, the frequency of heterozygous individuals is 32%.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 32 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
