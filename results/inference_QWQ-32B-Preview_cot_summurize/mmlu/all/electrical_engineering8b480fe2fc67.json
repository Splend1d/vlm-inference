                    "text": "In an ideal inductor, the power dissipation is zero. This is because an ideal inductor is a purely reactive component that stores and releases energy in its magnetic field without any resistance or energy loss. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Zero.\n\nTo understand this better, let's consider the basics of an inductor. An inductor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. The relationship between the voltage across an inductor and the current through it is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ V = L \\frac{di}{dt} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( V \\) is the voltage across the inductor,\n\n- \\( L \\) is the inductance (a measure of the inductor's ability to store magnetic energy per unit of current),\n\n- \\( \\frac{di}{dt} \\) is the rate of change of current with respect to time.\n\nIn an ideal inductor, there is no resistance, which means that no energy is dissipated as heat. The energy stored in the inductor is purely magnetic and is returned to the circuit when the current changes direction or magnitude.\n\nPower in an inductor is given by the product of voltage and current:\n\n\\[ P = V \\times I \\]\n\nSubstituting the voltage equation:\n\n\\[ P = L \\frac{di}{dt} \\times I \\]\n\nThis expression shows that the power in an inductor is proportional to the product of the inductance, the rate of change of current, and the current itself. However, in an ideal inductor, since there is no resistance, the average power dissipated over a complete cycle is zero. This is because the energy stored in the inductor is periodically returned to the source, and there is no net energy loss.\n\nIn practical inductors, there is always some resistance in the winding, which causes some power dissipation as heat. This is known as copper loss. Additionally, there may be energy losses due to the magnetic core, known as core losses. These losses are not present in an ideal inductor, which is why the power dissipation in an ideal inductor is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
