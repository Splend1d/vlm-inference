                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out how the court should respond to the ship owner's motion for summary judgment in this case. So, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a longshoreman who fell to his death through an open hatch on the ship's deck. He was employed by a company that had a contract with the ship's owner for loading and unloading the ship. The incident happened at night, after the loading work was finished for the day, and there was no reason for the longshoreman to be near the hatch.\n\nNow, the ship's owner is moving for summary judgment in a negligence action filed against them for the longshoreman's death. They've provided evidence that it's customary for ship crews to open hatches for ventilation after the longshoremen have left the ship, and this evidence is unrebutted.\n\nSo, the question is, how should the court respond to this motion?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n\nB. Deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the ship's owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch.\n\nC. Deny the motion, because the probability of serious injury caused by falling down an open hatch clearly outweighs the burden of keeping the hatch closed.\n\nD. Grant the motion, because the custom should be considered conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n\nOkay, let's think about this.\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there's no genuine dispute about any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. So, the ship owner is arguing that based on the custom of opening hatches for ventilation, they aren't negligent in this situation.\n\nBut, in negligence cases, the key elements are duty, breach, causation, and damages. Here, the duty would be the ship owner's duty to ensure the safety of the longshoreman on their ship, especially regarding hazards like open hatches.\n\nNow, the ship owner is relying on a custom or industry practice to support their position that they weren't negligent. Customs can be relevant to show what is standard practice in the industry, but they aren't necessarily conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n\nCourts often consider customs and practices as evidence of what is reasonable under the circumstances, but they don't automatically determine negligence. So, option D, which says to grant the motion because the custom is conclusive, might be too absolute.\n\nOption A suggests denying the motion and letting the jury decide, with the instruction that the custom is relevant but not conclusive. That seems reasonable because the jury can consider the custom along with other factors to determine if the ship owner was negligent.\n\nOption B suggests denying the motion but instructing the jury that the ship owner should win if the longshoreman was improperly near the hatch. This seems to place the burden on the longshoreman's actions, which might not be entirely fair, especially if there's an argument to be made about the ship owner's duty to make the ship safe for the longshoremen.\n\nOption C denies the motion based on the probability of serious injury outweighing the burden of keeping the hatch closed. This seems to focus on the risk versus the effort to prevent it, which is a valid consideration in negligence cases.\n\nBut, considering all this, I think option A is the most appropriate. The custom is relevant to show what is standard practice, but it shouldn't be the only factor\u51b3\u5b9a negligence. The jury should consider all the circumstances, including the custom, the duty of care, and whether the ship owner breached that duty.\n\nAlso, since the evidence about the custom is unrebutted, the jury can take that into account, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the ship owner is not negligent. There might be other factors that suggest they should have taken additional precautions, especially if the risk of someone falling through the hatch is significant.\n\nSo, I would go with option A: deny the motion and submit the case to the jury with instructions that the custom is relevant but not conclusive on the issue of negligence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
