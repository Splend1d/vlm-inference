Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, \"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?\" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, \"Study this, baby!\" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?\n\nA. Burglary only.\nB. Attempted violation of the statute.\nC. Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.\nD. Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.\n"

                    "text": "This is a tricky question because it involves understanding both the legal definitions in the jurisdiction and the student's state of mind. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to look at the crimes mentioned: burglary and attempted violation of the statute regarding flashing or exposing oneself.\n\n**Burglary:**\nBurglary generally involves entering a building without permission with the intent to commit a crime inside. In this case, the student broke into a sorority house, which is a building, and his intent was to flash the sorority sisters. So, it seems like burglary could apply here.\n\nHowever, there's a twist: in this jurisdiction, flashing or exposing oneself in the nude is a felony, but the student was only wearing shorts, not completely nude. So, perhaps the act he intended to commit isn't actually a crime in this jurisdiction. Does that affect the burglary charge?\n\nWell, burglary requires the intent to commit a crime inside, but it's the intent that matters, not whether the act is actually a crime. So, even if flashing in shorts isn't a crime, if the student intended to commit what he believed was a crime, that might still satisfy the intent element for burglary. But I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\n**Attempted violation of the statute:**\nAn attempt requires an intent to commit a crime and taking a substantial step towards its commission, but falling short of completing it. Here, the student entered the sorority house with the intent to flash the sisters, and he did flash one sister before running away.\n\nBut again, flashing in shorts isn't a crime in this jurisdiction, so there's no underlying crime to attempt. Therefore, attempted violation of the statute wouldn't hold up.\n\nWait, but the student believed he was committing a crime. Does that make a difference?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, attempted crimes require that the defendant intended to commit a crime, and the act they were attempting was indeed a crime. Since in this case, flashing in shorts isn't a crime, perhaps there's no attempt.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the attempt is based on the intent to expose himself, regardless of whether it's a crime, but that seems shaky.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- **Burglary:** He broke into the sorority house with the intent to flash the sisters. Even if flashing in shorts isn't a crime, his intent was to commit what he believed was a crime. So, perhaps burglary still applies.\n\n- **Attempted violation:** Since flashing in shorts isn't a crime in this jurisdiction, there's no crime to attempt, so this charge likely wouldn't stick.\n\nTherefore, the student should be found guilty of burglary only.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe the jurisdiction has specific laws about exposure that aren't necessarily nudity. For example, exposure of private parts could be sufficient for the crime, not necessarily full nudity. If that's the case, then flashing in shorts might still be a crime.\n\nHowever, the question states that it's a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so presumably, exposure of private parts while wearing shorts wouldn't qualify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the jurisdiction has a broader definition that includes partial exposure, but based on the information given, it seems that only full nudity constitutes the crime.\n\nGiven that, the student's actions don't constitute the crime he thought he was committing, and therefore, there's no attempt.\n\nBut for burglary, since his intent was to commit what he thought was a crime, even if it's not actually a crime, does that satisfy the intent element for burglary?\n\nI think the correct answer is that he should be found guilty of burglary only.\n\nSo, option A is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
