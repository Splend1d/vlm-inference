                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a chef, his summer cottage, a neighbor, and a right-of-way. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the chef had a summer cottage on a lake and needed a way to get to it easily. So, he made an agreement with his neighbor, who owned the land next door. The neighbor gave the chef a right-of-way over a 30-foot wide, quarter-mile long strip of land along the eastern edge of their property. This was in writing, which is important.\n\nThen, without telling the neighbor, the chef improved the road by asphalt paving it to make it better for cars. A few years later, the neighbor started a sand business and did heavy hauling that damaged the asphalt. Ten years after that, the chef sold his lakefront property to his assistant.\n\nNow, after the assistant took possession, the neighbor put up wooden barriers across the road, blocking access to the assistant's property. The assistant is suing to have the barriers removed, and we need to figure out which argument is his strongest.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. An easement appurtenant is alienable, meaning that any conveyance transferring possession of the dominant tenement also passes the easement privilege.\n\nOkay, so an easement appurtenant is one that benefits the land (the dominant tenement) and is tied to the land, not to the owner personally. When the land is sold, the easement goes with it. So, if the chef had an easement appurtenant, it should pass to the assistant when he bought the property.\n\nB. The assistant, as a bonafide purchaser, is protected from the neighbor's obstruction, even though the easement was unrecorded.\n\nThis one is tricky. A bonafide purchaser is someone who buys property without knowing about any existing claims or encumbrances. If the easement wasn't recorded, the assistant might not have known about it, and depending on local recording laws, he might still have rights to it.\n\nC. Because the easement was created by implication, the chef's prior and continuous use gave rise to a prescriptive easement.\n\nPrescriptive easements are acquired through long-term, continuous use without the owner's permission. But in this case, the easement was granted in writing, so it's not a prescriptive easement. It was created by agreement, not by long-term use.\n\nD. The chef and the assistant, being in privity of estate, could \"tack on\" their successive use periods.\n\nPrivity of estate refers to a legal relationship between successive owners of the same land. Tacking allows their periods of use to be combined for certain legal purposes, like establishing an easement by prescription. But again, this easement was granted, not acquired by prescription.\n\nSo, let's think about this. The chef had an easement over the neighbor's land, granted in writing. When the chef sold the property to his assistant, did the easement go with the property?\n\nWell, easements appurtenant run with the land, so yes, the assistant should have the same right-of-way as the chef did.\n\nBut wait, was this an easement appurtenant or a easement in gross?\n\nAn easement appurtenant benefits a particular piece of land, while an easement in gross benefits a person or entity.\n\nIn this case, the right-of-way was for the chef's access to his cottage, so it seems to be appurtenant to the cottage property.\n\nTherefore, when the chef sold the cottage to his assistant, the easement should have passed to the assistant as well.\n\nSo, option A seems strong.\n\nBut what about option B? The assistant as a bonafide purchaser. If the easement wasn't recorded, the assistant might not have known about it, but since it was in writing, maybe it should have been recorded.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, easements need to be recorded to be enforceable against third parties. If it wasn't recorded, the assistant might not have notice of it, and thus might not be able to enforce it.\n\nBut in this case, the assistant bought the property from the chef, who had the easement. So, even if it wasn't recorded, the assistant might still have rights to it through the sale.\n\nOption C is about prescriptive easement, but since the easement was granted, not acquired through long use, this doesn't apply.\n\nOption D is about tacking, which is used for prescriptive easements to combine periods of use. Again, not applicable here since it's a granted easement.\n\nSo, between A and B, I think A is stronger. The easement appurtenant should pass to the assistant upon sale of the property, regardless of recording.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any issues with the improvement of the road by the chef.\n\nThe chef asphalted the road without notifying the neighbor. Maybe the neighbor didn't approve of this improvement, and now that it's damaged, he's blocking access.\n\nBut the easement was granted in writing, so the chef had the right to use the road. Improving it might be a different matter, but probably within the rights of the easement, especially if it was to make it more usable.\n\nAlso, the neighbor started a sand business and damaged the road. That might be relevant, but again, doesn't affect the easement itself.\n\nSo, in the assistant's lawsuit to remove the barriers, his strongest argument is likely that the easement appurtenant passed to him when he bought the property from the chef.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
