This is because, ethically, people have the right to know what they're getting into and agree to participate voluntarily. Let me see why the other options might not be the best choices.\n\nOption A: Have information that will be worth our effort to collect. While it's important that the data is valuable, ensuring that participants are informed and consent is a fundamental ethical requirement before collecting any data.\n\nOption B: Are going to be honest and forthright. We can't assume or require that participants are always honest; our responsibility is to create an environment where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts\u5982\u5b9e. But again, this isn't the primary concern before collecting data.\n\nOption D: Have been granted permission to participate by the IRB. While Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) approve research studies to protect participants, it's the researchers' responsibility to obtain informed consent from each participant. The IRB approves the process, but individual consent is still required.\n\nSo, I believe C is the most appropriate answer because informed consent is a cornerstone of ethical research involving human subjects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
