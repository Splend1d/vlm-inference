                    "text": "Let's see. There's this question about a personnel director raising the cutoff score for a selection test used in hiring. We need to figure out why they would do that. The options are about increasing true positives, decreasing false positives, increasing false negatives, or decreasing true negatives.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what these terms mean. In the context of testing, a true positive is when someone who has the desired characteristic (like being a good fit for the job) is correctly identified by the test. A false positive is when someone who doesn't have the desired characteristic is incorrectly identified as having it. A false negative is when someone who has the characteristic is missed by the test, and a true negative is when someone who doesn't have the characteristic is correctly identified as not having it.\n\nSo, if the personnel director raises the cutoff score, that means they're making it harder to pass the test. Only people who score higher than this new, higher cutoff will be considered.\n\nLet me think about what effect this would have on the different types of outcomes.\n\nIf the cutoff is raised, fewer people will pass the test. That means fewer people will be identified as positives, whether they're true positives or false positives.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- True positives: These are the people who actually have the desired characteristic and are correctly identified. If the cutoff is raised, some of these people who scored below the new cutoff might be missed, so the number of true positives could decrease.\n\n- False positives: These are people who don't have the desired characteristic but were incorrectly identified as having it. With a higher cutoff, fewer people will be identified as positives overall, so the number of false positives should decrease.\n\n- False negatives: These are people who have the desired characteristic but were not identified as such. As mentioned, some true positives might be missed if their scores are below the new cutoff, so false negatives could increase.\n\n- True negatives: These are people who don't have the desired characteristic and are correctly identified as such. With a higher cutoff, more people will be below the cutoff, so the number of true negatives might increase.\n\nWait, but actually, if the cutoff is raised, fewer people will be identified as positives, so more people will be identified as negatives. But among those negatives, some are true negatives and some are false negatives.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me try to think of it in terms of the consequences.\n\nIf the personnel director wants to be more selective, raising the cutoff makes sense because they want to hire only the top performers.\n\nBy raising the cutoff, they're reducing the number of people they consider for hiring, hoping that those who pass are more likely to be true positives.\n\nBut in doing so, they might miss some true positives who didn't score high enough, thus increasing false negatives.\n\nAt the same time, they're decreasing false positives because fewer people who don't have the characteristic will pass the higher cutoff.\n\nSo, the number of false positives decreases.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increase the number of true positives.\n\nBut actually, raising the cutoff might decrease true positives, not increase them, because some true positives might score below the new cutoff.\n\nB. decrease the number of false positives.\n\nThis seems likely, because with a higher cutoff, fewer people who don't have the characteristic will pass.\n\nC. increase the number of false negatives.\n\nYes, that could happen, because some true positives might be below the new cutoff.\n\nD. decrease the number of true negatives.\n\nWait, true negatives are people who don't have the characteristic and are correctly identified as such. With a higher cutoff, more people will be below the cutoff and correctly identified as not having the characteristic, so the number of true negatives might increase.\n\nBut the question is about what the personnel director is trying to achieve by raising the cutoff.\n\nProbably, they want to improve the quality of hires by ensuring that only the highest scorers are considered, which would mean reducing the number of false positives\u2014hiring people who aren't actually good fits.\n\nSo, decreasing false positives seems like the most likely reason.\n\nOption B.\n\nWait, but option C is increase the number of false negatives. Why would the director want that?\n\nIncreasing false negatives means missing out on some good candidates, which might not be desirable, unless the director is okay with that trade-off to minimize false positives.\n\nBut option B seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the director wants to decrease true negatives, meaning that fewer ineligible candidates are correctly rejected. But that doesn't make sense; why would they want to decrease true negatives?\n\nWait, decreasing true negatives would mean that more ineligible candidates are identified as positives, which is not desirable.\n\nSo, option D is probably incorrect.\n\nBetween options B and C, decreasing false positives seems more aligned with the goal of improving hiring quality.\n\nHowever, increasing false negatives might be an unintended consequence of raising the cutoff.\n\nBut the question is about the director's likely intention.\n\nI think the director is most likely trying to decrease false positives, i.e., reduce the number of ineffective hires.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. decrease the number of false positives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
