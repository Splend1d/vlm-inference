                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about real GDP. So, real GDP is a measure of a country's economic output, adjusted for inflation. It tells us the value of all goods and services produced in a country in a specific period, but it's adjusted to remove the effects of price changes. That way, we can see actual changes in production, not just changes in prices.\n\nThe question is: Suppose real GDP increases. We can conclude without a doubt that...\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. prices are higher.\n\nWell, real GDP adjusts for price changes. That's its whole point. So, if real GDP increases, it means that production has increased, not that prices have gone up. In fact, if prices were the only thing changing, real GDP would stay the same or maybe even decrease if prices went up and production stayed the same. So, I don't think A is correct.\n\nB. employment is higher.\n\nHmm, employment and GDP are related. Generally, when more people are employed, more stuff gets produced, which would increase GDP. But, it's not always a direct relationship. Productivity plays a role too. You could have the same number of people producing more if they become more efficient. So, while employment might be higher, we can't say for sure without more information.\n\nC. production is higher.\n\nThis seems promising. Real GDP is a measure of the total production of goods and services in an economy, adjusted for price changes. So, if real GDP increases, that directly means that more goods and services are being produced. That makes sense.\n\nD. prices and/or output is higher.\n\nThis option is a bit vague. It says \"prices and/or output.\" But remember, real GDP adjusts for prices. So, if real GDP increases, it's specifically because output has increased, not because prices have increased. If prices increased but output stayed the same, real GDP would actually decrease or stay the same, depending on how the adjustments are made.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is C. production is higher. Because real GDP increasing directly indicates that more is being produced in the economy.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again. If real GDP increases, it means that after accounting for price changes, the economy is producing more. So, production must have gone up.\n\nOption A is incorrect because real GDP adjusts for price changes.\n\nOption B might be true, but it's not a definitive conclusion from an increase in real GDP alone.\n\nOption D includes prices, which, as we've established, aren't the cause of an increase in real GDP.\n\nTherefore, C is the most accurate conclusion we can draw from an increase in real GDP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
