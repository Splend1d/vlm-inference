Any delay in beginning perestroika could have led to an exacerbated internal situation in the near future, which, to put it bluntly, would have been fraught with serious social, economic, and political crises.\nMikhail Gorbachev, Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World, 1987\nFrom the passage, one may infer that Gorbachev believed that\n\nA. the problems that required perestroika were the fault of capitalist enemies of socialism\nB. the problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society\nC. a socialist society could not work\nD. a socialist society could not coexist with capitalism\n"

                    "text": "Let's see what Gorbachev is saying here. He mentions that perestroika is an urgent necessity that arises from the profound processes of development in their socialist society. It seems like he's acknowledging that there are issues within the socialist system that need to be addressed, and he's emphasizing that these issues are internal, not caused by external forces like capitalist enemies.\n\nSo, option A says that the problems requiring perestroika were the fault of capitalist enemies of socialism. But from the passage, Gorbachev is saying that the problems are arising from within the socialist society itself. He doesn't blame external capitalist forces. So, A doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says that the problems requiring perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society. That aligns pretty well with what Gorbachev is saying. He mentions that the society is ripe for change and has been yearning for it, suggesting that the issues are internal.\n\nOption C states that a socialist society could not work. But Gorbachev is not saying that socialism can't work; he's saying that their socialist society needs restructuring to continue developing. So, he believes in socialism but acknowledges it needs reform.\n\nOption D says that a socialist society could not coexist with capitalism. Again, Gorbachev doesn't mention anything about coexisting with capitalism in this passage. He's focusing on internal issues within the socialist society.\n\nTherefore, the inference that best matches Gorbachev's statement is option B: the problems that required perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
