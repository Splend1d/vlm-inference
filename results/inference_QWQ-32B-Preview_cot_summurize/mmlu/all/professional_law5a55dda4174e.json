It's a summary offense carrying a $50 fine and no imprisonment. On the third offense, the fine is $500 and there is a 5-day jail sentence. The statute does not mention any requirement of criminal intent. John and his family are coming back from a weekend picnic when his children throw bags of refuse and the remains of their lunch out of the rear window of the moving vehicle. John is stopped and given a $50 ticket. Can he succeed with a defense that he didn't know what his children were doing and that he had no criminal intent to break any laws?\n\nA. No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.\nB. Yes, because he didn't know what his children were doing in the back seat and he had not participated in the violation nor did he know that they did it or were going to do it.\nC. Yes, because the police have no way of proving who in the car threw the garbage out the window.\nD. No, because his criminal intent is clearly established by the circumstances of the events.\n"

No, because this is likely a strict liability law that does not provide for defenses based on mental state.\n\nHere's why: The statute mentions that there's no requirement of criminal intent. That suggests it's a strict liability offense, meaning that whether or not John intended to litter isn't relevant. As long as the act of littering from a vehicle occurred, he can be held responsible.\n\nOption B says yes, because John didn't know what his children were doing. But since intent isn't required by the statute, his lack of knowledge might not be a valid defense.\n\nOption C says yes, because the police can't prove who threw the garbage. But again, if it's a strict liability offense, it might not matter who actually did it; the responsibility falls on the driver.\n\nOption D says no, because his criminal intent is clear. But the statute doesn't require intent, so this might not be the right reason.\n\nSo, I think A is the best answer because strict liability offenses don't require proof of intent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
