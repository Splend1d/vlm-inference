                    "text": "To determine the correct order of concentrations of the ions in a solution of sulfurous acid (H2SO3), we need to consider the dissociation steps of this weak diprotic acid in water.\n\nSulfurous acid is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons (H+) in two separate dissociation steps:\n\n1. First dissociation:\n\nH2SO3 \u21cc H+ + HSO3-\n\n2. Second dissociation:\n\nHSO3- \u21cc H+ + SO32-\n\nSince sulfurous acid is a weak acid, both dissociation steps are partial, meaning that at equilibrium, there will be significant amounts of the undissociated acid (H2SO3), the hydrogen sulfite ion (HSO3-), and the sulfite ion (SO32-) in the solution.\n\nMoreover, the first dissociation constant (Ka1) is larger than the second dissociation constant (Ka2), indicating that the first dissociation step is more extensive than the second. This means that more H2SO3 will dissociate to form HSO3- than HSO3- will dissociate to form SO32-.\n\nTherefore, the concentration of H2SO3 will be greater than that of HSO3-, which in turn will be greater than that of SO32-. So, the order should be:\n\n[H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. [SO32-] > [HSO3-] > [H2SO3]\n\nB. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]\n\nC. [H2SO3] > [HSO3-] = [SO32-]\n\nD. [SO32-] = [HSO3-] > [H2SO3]\n\nOption B matches the expected order based on the dissociation behavior of sulfurous acid.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's consider the equilibrium expressions for the dissociations:\n\nFor the first dissociation:\n\nKa1 = [H+][HSO3-]/[H2SO3]\n\nFor the second dissociation:\n\nKa2 = [H+][SO32-]/[HSO3-]\n\nGiven that Ka1 > Ka2, the first dissociation is more favorable, leading to a higher concentration of HSO3- compared to SO32-.\n\nAdditionally, in aqueous solutions, the concentration of the undissociated acid (H2SO3) is typically greater than that of its conjugate base (HSO3-), which in turn is greater than that of the doubly deprotonated form (SO32-).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is indeed:\n\n[H2SO3] > [HSO3-] > [SO32-]\n\nWhich corresponds to option B.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in some cases, the concentrations of HSO3- and SO32- might be similar if the solution is highly basic, but in the case of a solution of sulfurous acid in water, where the pH is likely to be acidic or neutral, option B should hold.\n\nHence, the answer is B."
