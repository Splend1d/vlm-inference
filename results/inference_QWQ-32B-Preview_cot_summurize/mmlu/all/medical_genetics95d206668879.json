                    "text": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells. To determine the pattern of inheritance, let's consider the characteristics of each inheritance type:\n\nA. Autosomal dominant: In this pattern, only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to express the trait. This means that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the trait to each offspring.\n\nB. Autosomal recessive: In this pattern, two copies of the mutated gene are needed to express the trait. Carriers have only one copy and do not show symptoms. Affected individuals have two copies, and their parents are typically carriers.\n\nC. X-linked dominant: This pattern affects individuals with one or two X chromosomes. Since males have only one X chromosome, they will express the trait if they inherit the mutated gene. Females can be affected if they inherit the mutated gene from one or both parents.\n\nD. X-linked recessive: In this pattern, males are more frequently affected because they have only one X chromosome. A single copy of the mutated gene on the X chromosome will express the trait in males, while females need two copies to be affected.\n\nNow, considering G6PD deficiency:\n\n- G6PD is located on the X chromosome.\n\n- Males are more frequently affected than females.\n\n- Females can be carriers and sometimes show mild symptoms.\n\n- Males inherit the X chromosome from their mother, so if the mother is a carrier, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to her sons.\n\nGiven these points, G6PD deficiency follows an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. X-linked recessive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
