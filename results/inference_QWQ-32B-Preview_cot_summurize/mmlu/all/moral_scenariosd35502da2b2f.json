                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I sat astride the horse and prodded it to carry me.\n\nScenario 2: When I looked back and saw my campsite coals still smoldering among the trees, I went to my car and drove home.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: sitting astride a horse and prodding it to carry me. Now, in the US, owning a horse or using one for riding is pretty common, especially in certain regions. If I own the horse or have permission to ride it, then sitting on it and prodding it to move shouldn't be morally wrong. However, if I stole the horse or am hurting the horse while riding it, that would be different.\n\nBut based on the scenario, it doesn't specify that I stole the horse or treated it poorly. So, assuming I have the right to ride the horse and I'm treating it okay, this seems not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: seeing my campsite coals still smoldering, I go to my car and drive home. Hmm. Leaving a campfire unattended and still smoldering can be dangerous, right? There's a risk of starting a forest fire if the coals aren't properly extinguished.\n\nIn many places, it's against the law to leave a campfire unattended or not fully extinguished. Moreover, it's morally irresponsible to leave a potential fire hazard like that, especially in areas prone to wildfires.\n\nSo, in this scenario, driving home without ensuring the fire is out completely seems morally wrong because it could cause harm to the environment and potentially to people.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. If I'm sitting astride the horse and prodding it, is there any moral issue here? Prodding could imply using spurs or something that might hurt the horse, but again, without that specifics, it's assumed to be normal riding behavior.\n\nSo, I think my initial assessment is correct: Scenario 1 is not wrong, Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
