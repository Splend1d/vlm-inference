The options are Quantitative, Qualitative, Non-probability, and Probability.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nQuantitative research is about measuring things and using numbers and statistics to analyze data. It's often used when you want to generalize findings to a larger population.\n\nQualitative research, on the other hand, is more about understanding concepts, experiences, and meanings. It often involves open-ended questions and doesn't focus on numerical data.\n\nNon-probability sampling is a method where not every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This can include things like convenience sampling or snowball sampling.\n\nProbability sampling is a method where every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. This includes methods like random sampling.\n\nNow, the question is about eliciting responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents. That sounds like something that would require a lot of data from different people, and the questions are set in advance, without much room for variation.\n\nQuantitative research often uses surveys and questionnaires with standardized questions to collect data from a large number of respondents. This data is then analyzed using statistical methods.\n\nQualitative research might use interviews or focus groups where the questions are more flexible and allow for deeper exploration of topics. It's not typically about standardized questions or large numbers of respondents.\n\nNon-probability and probability refer to sampling methods, not the type of research itself. However, both sampling methods can be used in quantitative or qualitative research.\n\nGiven that, it seems like quantitative research is the best fit for what the question is describing. It's about getting standardized responses from many people, which aligns with quantitative methods.\n\nBut wait, maybe probability sampling is also important here because it's about selecting respondents in a way that allows generalization to a larger population, which is often a goal in quantitative research.\n\nHowever, the question is asking about the type of research method, not the sampling method. So, while probability sampling might be used in quantitative research, the core type of research is quantitative.\n\nAlso, non-probability sampling could be used in quantitative research, but it's less ideal because it might not allow for generalization.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Quantitative.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if qualitative research could also use standardized questions. Maybe in some cases, but generally, qualitative research favors more open-ended approaches to gain deeper insights.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that quantitative research is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
