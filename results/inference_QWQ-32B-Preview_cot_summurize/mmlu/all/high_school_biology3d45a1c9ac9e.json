So, there's a lizard that doesn't have a chemical defense mechanism, but it looks just like another lizard that does have one. The question is asking what kind of coloration or mimicry this is.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Aposomatic coloration.\n\nB. Cryptic coloration.\n\nC. Batesian mimicry.\n\nD. M\u00fcllerian mimicry.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these terms means.\n\nAposomatic coloration, I think, is when an animal has bright, warning colors to signal that it's toxic or unpalatable. So, it's a way to deter predators by saying, \"Hey, don't eat me, I taste bad or could hurt you.\"\n\nCryptic coloration, that's when an animal blends into its environment to hide from predators or to sneak up on prey. Like camouflage.\n\nBatesian mimicry is when a harmless species evolves to look like a harmful species to avoid being eaten. So, it's kind of like fraud, where the harmless one is pretending to be dangerous.\n\nM\u00fcllerian mimicry is when two or more harmful species evolve to look alike, so that predators learn to avoid them all after experiencing one.\n\nNow, in this question, there's a lizard without a chemical defense mechanism, which means it's harmless in that sense, and it looks like another lizard that does have a defense mechanism, so that second lizard is harmful.\n\nSo, the harmless one is mimicking the harmful one to avoid being eaten, right? That sounds a lot like Batesian mimicry.\n\nWait, but M\u00fcllerian mimicry involves multiple harmful species looking alike. Here, one is harmful and one isn't, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAposomatic coloration is about the harmful species advertising their toxicity, not about mimicry.\n\nCryptic coloration is about hiding, not about mimicking another species.\n\nSo, Batesian mimicry seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is harmless, and the model is harmful. In this case, the lizard without the defense mechanism is the mimic, and the one with the defense is the model.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nI think the answer is C. Batesian mimicry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
