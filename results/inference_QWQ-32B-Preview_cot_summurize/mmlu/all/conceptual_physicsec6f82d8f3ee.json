                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"In a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases at a given temperature, the molecules having the greatest average speed are those of...\" and then it lists options A. hydrogen, B. oxygen, C. nitrogen, and D. but all have the same speed on average.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some basic principles about gas behavior, especially regarding molecular speeds. I think this has something to do with the kinetic theory of gases, where molecules are in constant motion and their speeds are related to temperature and mass.\n\nI remember that the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is directly proportional to the temperature. The formula for kinetic energy is (1/2)mv\u00b2, where m is the mass and v is the speed. So, at a given temperature, all gas molecules, regardless of their mass, have the same average kinetic energy.\n\nNow, if all molecules have the same average kinetic energy, but different masses, that must affect their speeds. Let me think about that. If kinetic energy is constant, and kinetic energy equals (1/2)mv\u00b2, then for lighter molecules, with smaller m, to have the same kinetic energy, their speed v must be higher.\n\nSo, lighter molecules should have higher speeds than heavier ones at the same temperature.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Hydrogen - H\u2082, which has a molar mass of about 2 g/mol.\n\nB. Oxygen - O\u2082, which has a molar mass of about 32 g/mol.\n\nC. Nitrogen - N\u2082, which has a molar mass of about 28 g/mol.\n\nD. All have the same speed on average.\n\nComparing the molar masses, hydrogen is the lightest, followed by nitrogen, and then oxygen is the heaviest.\n\nSo, according to what I just thought, hydrogen molecules should have the greatest average speed because they are the lightest.\n\nWait, but option D says all have the same speed on average. Is that possible? Well, I just argued that lighter molecules have higher speeds to maintain the same kinetic energy.\n\nBut, maybe I should look up the exact relationship between molecular speed and mass.\n\nI recall there's something called the root-mean-square speed (rms speed), which is a measure of the speed of gas molecules. The formula for rms speed is:\n\nv_rms = sqrt(3RT/M)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass of the gas.\n\nFrom this equation, it's clear that the rms speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, lighter molecules have higher speeds.\n\nLet me plug in the molar masses:\n\nFor hydrogen, M = 2 g/mol,\n\nFor nitrogen, M = 28 g/mol,\n\nFor oxygen, M = 32 g/mol.\n\nSo, sqrt(M) for hydrogen is sqrt(2), for nitrogen sqrt(28), and for oxygen sqrt(32).\n\nTherefore, the speed of hydrogen molecules should be higher than that of nitrogen, which in turn should be higher than that of oxygen.\n\nSo, the order should be hydrogen > nitrogen > oxygen in terms of average speed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. hydrogen.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider if there's any exception or special condition that might make all molecules have the same speed.\n\nI think that only in the case where all gases have the same mass would their speeds be the same, which is not the case here.\n\nAlso, perhaps at extremely high temperatures, the speeds might become more similar, but the question doesn't specify any particular temperature, so I think the general principle applies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the context of the question, there's a different consideration, but based on what I know, I think hydrogen should have the greatest average speed.\n\nI should also consider if the mixture affects the speeds. I don't think it does, because in an ideal gas mixture, each component behaves independently, following its own kinetic theory.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. hydrogen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
