So the expression is 25 + (25 + m), which is option A.\n\nBut let's make sure. If Ken makes 25, and Tami makes m more than Ken, that's 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m). That seems right.\n\nWait, is there a simpler way to write that? Maybe combine like terms. 25 + 25 is 50, so it's 50 + m. But looking at the options, option A is 25 + (25 + m), which is the same as 50 + m, but the question asks for the expression, not to simplify it.\n\nSo option A is correct. The other options don't make sense. Option B is 25 + 25m, which would be 25 plus 25 times m, which isn't what we want. Option C is just 25 + m, which doesn't include Tami's necklaces fully. Option D is 25m, which is 25 times m, doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nSo yes, A is the correct expression.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
