This service is typically provided by the local telephone company and may involve a small fee per call.\n\nOption A, the police, is reached by dialing '911', which is the standard emergency number in the United States.\n\nOption B, the White House, has a different phone number and is not accessible through '411'.\n\nOption D, Moviefone, is a movie information service that can be reached by dialing '555-1212' or '555-1234' in some areas, but not '411'.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. directory assistance."
