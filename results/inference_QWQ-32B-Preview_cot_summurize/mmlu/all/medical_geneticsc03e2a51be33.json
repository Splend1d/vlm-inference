                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about Hirschsprung disease. I need to identify which statement is incorrect among the options given. I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, option A: \"It shows an association with Down syndrome.\" I know that Hirschsprung disease is sometimes associated with other genetic conditions, and Down syndrome is one of them. So, I think this statement is correct.\n\nNext, option B: \"It is more common in girls than in boys.\" Hmm, I recall that Hirschsprung disease is more prevalent in boys. In fact, it's more common in males than in females. So, this statement seems incorrect because it says it's more common in girls.\n\nOption C: \"RET is a major susceptibility gene.\" I remember that the RET gene is involved in Hirschsprung disease. Mutations in this gene are known to increase the risk of developing the condition. So, this statement appears to be correct.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Recurrence risks are greater for long segment disease than for short segment disease.\" I need to think about recurrence risks in Hirschsprung disease. I believe that the recurrence risk can vary based on the severity of the disease, but I'm not entirely sure about whether long segment disease has higher recurrence risks than short segment disease. Maybe I should look into this further, but for now, I'll keep it in mind.\n\nGiven that, it seems like option B is the incorrect statement because Hirschsprung disease is actually more common in boys than in girls. I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
