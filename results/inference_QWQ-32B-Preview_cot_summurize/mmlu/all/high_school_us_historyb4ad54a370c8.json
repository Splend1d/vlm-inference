                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the First Great Awakening. So, we've got this quote from Roger Williams, who was a Puritan minister in the 17th century. He's talking about the separation of church and state, arguing that the civil powers shouldn't be imposing religion, worship, or even things like tithes and holy days on the people. It's clear that he believes in a strict division between temporal governance and spiritual matters.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the First Great Awakening and how it responded to something. We have four options: Puritanism, The Enlightenment, Transcendentalism, and Existentialism. Let's consider each one.\n\nFirst, Puritanism. Puritans were a group within the English Protestant tradition who sought to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic remnants. They were known for their strict moral code and emphasis on personal piety. The First Great Awakening was a series of religious revivals in the 18th century that emphasized personal faith and a direct relationship with God, often challenging the more formal, established churches. So, in a way, it can be seen as a response to the rigid structures and doctrines of Puritanism, offering a more emotional and personal approach to religion.\n\nNext, The Enlightenment. This was an intellectual movement in the 17th and 18th centuries that promoted reason, science, and individualism over tradition and religion. It emphasized human potential and progress. The First Great Awakening, with its focus on emotional religious experiences and personal salvation, can be seen as a reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment. While the Enlightenment encouraged people to question authority and think for themselves, the Awakening brought people back to a more passionate, faith-based approach to religion.\n\nTranscendentalism came later, in the 19th century, and was more about individual intuition and the inherent goodness of both people and nature. It didn't directly influence the First Great Awakening, which happened earlier.\n\nExistentialism is even later, in the 20th century, focusing on individual freedom and choice in an apparently meaningless world. That doesn't relate directly to the Awakening either.\n\nSo, between Puritanism and The Enlightenment, which one is the First Great Awakening responding to?\n\nWell, the Awakening did challenge some of the established religious practices and hierarchies that were hallmarks of Puritanism. It emphasized personal conversion and emotional religion over the more cerebral, rule-based approach of the Puritans. At the same time, it can be seen as a counter-movement to the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and skepticism towards religious authority.\n\nBut let's look back at the quote from Roger Williams. He's arguing against the civil state imposing religion and spiritual matters on the people. This seems to align more with the ideas of the Enlightenment, which questioned traditional authority and promoted individual rights and freedoms. So, perhaps the First Great Awakening was responding to the growing influence of Enlightenment ideas by emphasizing the importance of personal religious experience and faith.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the Awakening occurred in a time when Enlightenment ideas were becoming more prevalent in colonial America. The emphasis on reason and individualism might have led some people to question traditional religious authorities, prompting a religious response that reaffirmed the importance of faith and personal connection with God.\n\nGiven that, I think the First Great Awakening can be seen as a response to both Puritanism and The Enlightenment, but perhaps more directly to the Enlightenment's challenge to traditional religious authority.\n\nBut looking back at the options, we have to choose one. A is Puritanism, B is The Enlightenment, C is Transcendentalism, D is Existentialism.\n\nGiven that Transcendentalism and Existentialism come much later, they can be eliminated. Now, between Puritanism and The Enlightenment, I think the First Great Awakening was more a response to The Enlightenment. Here's why:\n\nThe Enlightenment emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional authority, including religious authority. The First Great Awakening, with its emphasis on personal religious experience and emotional connection to God, can be seen as a reaction to the rationalism of the Enlightenment, seeking to reassert the importance of faith and spiritual renewal.\n\nPuritanism, while certainly influential, was already on the wane by the time of the Awakening, and the Awakening can be seen as a continuation or evolution of certain Puritan ideas about personal piety and conversion, rather than a direct response to Puritanism itself.\n\nTherefore, I would go with B, The Enlightenment, as the movement that the First Great Awakening is responding to.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
