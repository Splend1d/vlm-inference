                    "text": "Let's think about this question step by step. So, the question is asking about which statement is true regarding program documentation. We have four options here:\n\nA. Program documentation should not be changed after it is first written.\n\nB. Program documentation is only needed for programs in development; it is not needed after a program is completed.\n\nC. Program documentation is useful when programmers collaborate but not when a programmer works individually on a project.\n\nD. Program documentation is useful during initial program development and also when modifications are made to existing programs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what program documentation is. Program documentation refers to the documentation that explains how a particular program works, how to use it, and how to maintain it. It's like a manual for the program, but more technical and detailed, especially for other developers or for future reference.\n\nOption A says that program documentation should not be changed after it is first written. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Programs evolve over time; they get updated, modified, and fixed. If the code changes, shouldn't the documentation reflect those changes to remain accurate? So, I think this statement is false.\n\nOption B claims that program documentation is only needed during development and not after the program is completed. Well, once a program is completed, it might still need maintenance, updates, or fixes in the future. If there's no documentation, it would be hard for someone else (or even the original developer, after some time) to understand the code and make changes effectively. So, this seems incorrect too.\n\nOption C says that documentation is useful for collaboration but not for individual work. I don't think that's accurate. Even if a programmer is working alone, having documentation can be helpful for remembering decisions made earlier, understanding complex parts of the code, and making updates easier in the future. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D states that documentation is useful during initial development and when modifications are made to existing programs. This sounds logical. During development, documentation helps in organizing thoughts, explaining decisions, and making the codebase understandable. When modifications are needed later, having good documentation can save a lot of time and effort in understanding the existing code.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I think option D is the correct answer. Program documentation is indeed useful during initial development and when making modifications to existing programs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
