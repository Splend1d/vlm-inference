It seems like the main character's parents are in bed, possibly sick or resting, and the character themselves went to the doctor. Is there something morally wrong with this action?\n\nWell, going to the doctor is generally a responsible thing to do, especially if you're unwell. However, the way this is phrased might be a bit confusing. It says \"as my parents laid in bed,\" which could imply that the parents are unwell, and the character is going to the doctor perhaps for themselves or maybe for the parents.\n\nBut without more context, it's hard to see anything morally wrong here. Going to the doctor is usually a positive action for maintaining health. Maybe if the character is neglecting their parents while going to the doctor, but that's not explicitly stated. So, I would say this is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"To make money, I make jewelry out of trash and sell it to people.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is creating jewelry from trash and selling it to make money. Is there anything morally wrong with this?\n\nCreating something from trash is resourceful and environmentally friendly. Selling handmade items is a common way to make money, and many people engage in crafts and sales legally and ethically. As long as the jewelry is safe and not misrepresenting its materials, there doesn't seem to be any moral issue here.\n\nPerhaps if the jewelry was made from someone else's trash without permission, that could be a problem, but the scenario says \"out of trash,\" which likely means garbage or discarded items.\n\nOverall, this seems like a creative and acceptable way to make money.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither scenario appears to involve morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
