                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about a six-month-old child's reaction when their attachment figure leaves. The options are attachment anxiety, reactive attachment disorder, object permanence, and separation anxiety. I need to figure out which one correctly describes this distress.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means.\n\nAttachment anxiety sounds like it might be related, but I think it's more about a type of attachment style where a child is overly worried about the availability of the attachment figure.\n\nReactive attachment disorder seems serious; I think it's a condition where children don't form healthy attachments, maybe due to neglect or trauma.\n\nObject permanence is a concept from Jean Piaget's theory, where children learn that objects continue to exist even when they can't see them. I think this happens around 8-12 months, so maybe not directly related to a six-month-old's distress.\n\nSeparation anxiety sounds like it fits: it's when a child gets upset when a caregiver leaves. But I'm not sure if it's specifically defined for six-month-olds.\n\nLet me think about what I know about infant development. At around six months, babies start to develop a sense of object permanence, but I'm not entirely sure about the timing.\n\nWait, Piaget said that object permanence develops around 8-12 months, so maybe not exactly six months.\n\nAttachment theory, developed by John Bowlby, suggests that infants form attachments to caregivers for survival. Separation anxiety is a normal part of this attachment process.\n\nSo, perhaps separation anxiety is the correct term here.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options.\n\nAttachment anxiety is a type of attachment style where children are overly anxious about the presence and availability of the attachment figure. It's more about the quality of the attachment rather than the reaction to separation.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a more severe condition associated with a lack of appropriate attachment in early childhood, often due to neglect or multiple caregivers.\n\nObject permanence is about understanding that things continue to exist even when out of sight, which is important for separation anxiety, but maybe not the direct answer here.\n\nSeparation anxiety is the distress shown by a child when the attachment figure leaves. It's a normal part of development, indicating that the child has formed an attachment and expects the figure to be present.\n\nGiven that, I think separation anxiety is the correct answer.\n\nBut the question specifies a six-month-old child. Is separation anxiety typical at this age?\n\nI recall that separation anxiety usually peaks around 10-18 months, but it can start earlier.\n\nMaybe six months is a bit early for typical separation anxiety, but perhaps some children show signs earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether I know that object permanence is necessary for separation anxiety, and since object permanence develops later, separation anxiety wouldn't be present at six months.\n\nWait, that might be it. If object permanence isn't fully developed until 8-12 months, then a six-month-old might not fully understand that the attachment figure continues to exist when out of sight.\n\nSo, perhaps separation anxiety isn't fully developed at six months.\n\nBut still, some sources might say that early signs of separation anxiety can be seen earlier.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider that at six months, if a child shows distress when an attachment figure leaves, it's an early form of separation anxiety, even if object permanence isn't fully established yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is object permanence, because without it, the child wouldn't experience true separation anxiety.\n\nWait, but object permanence is about knowing that the attachment figure exists even when not seen, which is necessary for feeling anxious about their absence.\n\nSo, if a child doesn't have object permanence, maybe they wouldn't experience true separation anxiety.\n\nBut the question says the child shows distress when the attachment figure leaves, which sounds like separation anxiety.\n\nHowever, if object permanence isn't fully developed yet, maybe the distress is related to something else.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is separation anxiety, acknowledging that it can begin to develop around six months, even if it's not fully mature.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into choosing separation anxiety without considering the development of object permanence.\n\nBut if I choose object permanence, that seems off because it's more of a cognitive concept rather than a response or reaction.\n\nReactive attachment disorder seems too extreme for a typical six-month-old's reaction.\n\nAttachment anxiety seems more about the quality of attachment rather than the reaction to separation.\n\nWait, maybe attachment anxiety is part of insecure attachment styles, like resistant or ambivalent attachment, where children are overly anxious about separation.\n\nBut again, that seems a bit too specific for a six-month-old.\n\nPerhaps the question is simply testing whether I know that separation anxiety is the term for distress upon separation from an attachment figure.\n\nGiven that, and considering that six months might be a bit early for typical separation anxiety, but still possible, I'll go with separation anxiety as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
