The options are social plan, social strategy, social audit, and social account. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA. Social plan: I think this might be a plan that an organization has to improve its social impact. Maybe it's about how they intend to contribute to society or handle social issues.\n\nB. Social strategy: This sounds like a broader approach or plan that an organization uses to manage its social responsibilities and interactions. It might include various tactics and goals related to social issues.\n\nC. Social audit: This term seems familiar. I think it's a process where an organization evaluates its social and environmental performance. It might involve looking at how well they're meeting their social responsibilities and identifying areas for improvement.\n\nD. Social account: I'm not sure about this one. It might be related to how an organization reports its social activities or perhaps it's about accounting for its social impacts in some way.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a process that enables the organization to assess and demonstrate its social, economic, and environmental benefits and limitations. So, it's not just about planning or having a strategy; it's about actually assessing and showing what the organization is doing and where it falls short.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- Social plan sounds more like a plan for future actions rather than an assessment of current impacts.\n\n- Social strategy seems more about the overall approach to social responsibilities rather than a specific process for assessment.\n\n- Social audit appears to be a process for evaluating social and environmental performance, which aligns well with assessing benefits and limitations.\n\n- Social account might be related to reporting, but it's not as clear as social audit in terms of assessing and demonstrating impacts.\n\nBased on this, I think the best answer is C. Social audit. It seems to fit the description of a process that allows an organization to assess and demonstrate its social, economic, and environmental impacts.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up these terms to confirm.\n\nStarting with social plan: A social plan is indeed a plan that outlines an organization's objectives and actions related to social responsibility. It's more about what they intend to do rather than assessing what they've done.\n\nSocial strategy: This is a broader term that encompasses the overall approach an organization takes to manage its social responsibilities, including policies, practices, and objectives.\n\nSocial audit: This is a systematic process that assesses an organization's social and environmental performance. It often involves measuring and evaluating the organization's impact on stakeholders, society, and the environment, and then reporting those findings.\n\nSocial account: This term is less common, but it might refer to the practice of accounting for social costs and benefits, or perhaps to the reporting of social activities. However, it doesn't seem as comprehensive as a social audit in terms of assessment and demonstration.\n\nGiven this information, it's clear that social audit is the most appropriate term for a process that enables an organization to assess and demonstrate its social, economic, and environmental benefits and limitations.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Social audit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
