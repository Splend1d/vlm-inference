Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says: \"A subject consistently provides wrong answers to every test item.\" Hmm, this sounds like the person is just not getting any of the questions right. But is this a constant error? Well, constant error refers to a consistent bias in the measurements or responses. So, if someone is always wrong, maybe there's a systematic issue here, but I'm not sure if this is the best example.\n\nOption B says: \"A psychometrician consistently underestimates IQ scores by 10 points.\" This seems more like a constant error to me. If the psychometrician is always off by the same amount in the same direction, that's a consistent bias. So, this sounds like a constant error.\n\nOption C says: \"A test item is answered incorrectly by every student in a given class.\" Okay, so every student gets this one question wrong. Is this a constant error? Well, it's consistent in that everyone got it wrong, but it's not necessarily an error in the measurement; it could be that the question is difficult or misleading. So, maybe not the best example of constant error.\n\nOption D says: \"A test-retest reliability coefficient is low for several samples.\" This is about reliability, meaning that when you test the same thing again, you don't get consistent results. That's not exactly a constant error, which is more about a consistent bias. In fact, low reliability might indicate variable error, not constant error.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option B seems to be the best example of constant error because it involves a consistent underestimation by the same amount each time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
