                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this ladder problem. So, we have a 26-foot ladder leaning against a building, and the foot of the ladder is moving away from the building at 3 feet per second. I need to find the rate at which the top of the ladder is moving down when the foot is 10 feet from the building.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the situation. There's a ladder forming a right triangle with the building and the ground. The ladder is the hypotenuse, which is constant at 26 feet. The base of the triangle is the distance from the building to the foot of the ladder, and the height is the distance from the ground to the top of the ladder.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the distance from the building to the foot of the ladder (base).\n- \\( y \\) as the distance from the ground to the top of the ladder (height).\n\nGiven that the ladder is 26 feet long, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 26^2\n\\]\n\nWe are given that \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 3 \\) feet per second (the rate at which the base is moving away from the building). We need to find \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\) when \\( x = 10 \\) feet.\n\nFirst, differentiate both sides of the equation \\( x^2 + y^2 = 676 \\) with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\nx \\frac{dx}{dt} + y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\n\\]\n\nWe need to solve for \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{x \\frac{dx}{dt}}{y}\n\\]\n\nWe know \\( x = 10 \\) feet and \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = 3 \\) ft/s. We need to find \\( y \\) when \\( x = 10 \\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[\n10^2 + y^2 = 26^2 \\\\\n100 + y^2 = 676 \\\\\ny^2 = 576 \\\\\ny = 24 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nNow plug in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{10 \\times 3}{24} = -\\frac{30}{24} = -\\frac{5}{4} \\text{ ft/s}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the top of the ladder is moving down. The problem asks for the rate \\( r \\), which is the absolute value of \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\), so \\( r = \\frac{5}{4} \\) ft/s.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, confirm the Pythagorean theorem application:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 26^2 \\\\\n10^2 + y^2 = 676 \\\\\n100 + y^2 = 676 \\\\\ny^2 = 576 \\\\\ny = 24 \\text{ feet}\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, the differentiation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 = 676 \\\\\n2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\\\\nx \\frac{dx}{dt} + y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{x \\frac{dx}{dt}}{y}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{10 \\times 3}{24} = -\\frac{30}{24} = -\\frac{5}{4} \\text{ ft/s}\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the rate is \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\) ft/s.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\( \\frac{46}{3} \\)\n\nB. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\nC. \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\)\n\nD. \\( \\frac{5}{2} \\)\n\nOption C is \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), which matches my answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other approach or if I missed something.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the relationship between the rates using similar triangles or trigonometric functions, but the Pythagorean theorem is the most straightforward method for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, we could consider the ladder's movement in terms of parametric equations, but that would be more complicated for this scenario.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial approach and solution are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{4}} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{4}} \\]"
