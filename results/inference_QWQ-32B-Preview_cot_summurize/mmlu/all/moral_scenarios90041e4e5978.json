                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I threw a flat stone deftly toward the lake.\n\nScenario 2: I stirred his meal with my hand.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1 first. \"I threw a flat stone deftly toward the lake.\" So, someone is throwing a stone into a lake. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, throwing stones into a lake is a common activity, especially if it's allowed in that particular place. Maybe it's a public area where people go to enjoy nature, and throwing stones into the water is acceptable. Unless there are specific rules against it, or it could harm someone or something, it seems generally okay.\n\nIs there any moral issue here? It doesn't seem like it. It's just someone enjoying themselves by skipping a stone on the water.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I stirred his meal with my hand.\" This one sounds a bit more questionable.\n\nStirring someone else's meal with your hand could imply a few things. Maybe you're helping them stir their food, or maybe you're doing it without their consent. Depending on the context, this could be either okay or not.\n\nIf you're stirring someone's meal with your hand in a sanitary manner, perhaps you're helping them because they can't do it themselves, that might be acceptable. But if you're doing it without permission or in a way that's unclean, that would be a problem.\n\nGiven that the scenario just says \"I stirred his meal with my hand,\" without any additional context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in general, touching someone else's food with your bare hands could be considered disrespectful or unhygienic, which might be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut is it clearly morally wrong? That's the key here. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, would most people consider stirring someone's meal with your hand as morally wrong?\n\nWell, hygiene is a big concern, especially with food. People generally expect their food to be handled properly, and using bare hands might not be acceptable in many situations, like in restaurants or when sharing meals.\n\nAlso, personal space and consent are important. Stirring someone's meal with your hand might invade their personal space or imply that you're making decisions about their food without their input.\n\nSo, overall, Scenario 2 seems more likely to be considered morally wrong compared to Scenario 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 seems not wrong, and Scenario 2 seems wrong. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way Scenario 1 could be considered wrong? Maybe if the lake is protected, and throwing stones is prohibited because it could harm the ecosystem or something like that. But the scenario doesn't mention any such constraints. It just says \"toward the lake,\" so without additional context, it seems okay.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, even if in some contexts stirring someone's meal with your hand could be acceptable, like if you're close friends and it's in a casual setting, generally speaking, it's probably better to use utensils for hygiene reasons.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
