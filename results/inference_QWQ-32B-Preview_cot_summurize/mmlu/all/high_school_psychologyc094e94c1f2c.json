The options are:\n\nA. demand characteristics\n\nB. double blind study\n\nC. single blind study\n\nD. Hawthorne effect\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and how they relate to bias in experiments.\n\nStarting with demand characteristics (option A), I recall that these are cues in an experiment that tell participants what behavior is expected of them. So, participants might adjust their behavior to meet these expectations, which can introduce bias. But controlling for demand characteristics isn't directly about controlling bias; it's more about managing how participants interpret the experiment. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nNext, a double-blind study (option B). I know that in a double-blind experiment, neither the participants nor the experimenter knows who is receiving a particular treatment. This is designed to eliminate both experimenter bias and participant bias. Experimenter bias can occur if the experimenter knows who is receiving which treatment and unintentionally influences the results. Participant bias, or placebo effect, can occur if participants know they are receiving a treatment and report benefits because they expect to, not because of the treatment itself. So, a double-blind study seems like it would control for both types of bias.\n\nA single-blind study (option C) is where only the participants are unaware of who receives which treatment. The experimenter knows, which means there's still potential for experimenter bias. So, this seems to control only for participant bias, not experimenter bias.\n\nThe Hawthorne effect (option D) is when participants change their behavior because they know they are being observed. This can introduce bias, but it's more about the effect of observation itself rather than a technique to control bias. In fact, it's something researchers need to be aware of and control for, not a method to control bias.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems that a double-blind study is the technique that controls for both experimenter and subject bias. The other options either don't control bias or only control one type of bias.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check what demand characteristics are. I thought they were cues that tell participants what behavior is expected, but perhaps they also relate to bias. If participants adjust their behavior based on these cues, isn't that a form of bias? Maybe controlling for demand characteristics is part of controlling bias, but it's not a technique per se; it's more of a phenomenon to be aware of.\n\nSimilarly, the Hawthorne effect is another phenomenon that can introduce bias, but again, it's not a technique to control bias.\n\nSo, between single-blind and double-blind studies, only the double-blind study controls for both types of bias by ensuring that neither the experimenter nor the participants know who is receiving which treatment.\n\nI think the answer is B, double blind study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
