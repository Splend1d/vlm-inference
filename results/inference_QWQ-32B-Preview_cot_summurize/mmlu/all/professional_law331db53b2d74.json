                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about executory contracts. So, the question is asking about which statement is the least correct concerning executory contracts, especially in the context where there might be a delay between when the contract is formed and when performance is completed.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what an executory contract is. From my knowledge, an executory contract is one where both parties still have obligations to fulfill. So, neither party has completed their performance yet.\n\nOption A says: \"A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party.\" That sounds right to me. In a wholly executory contract, both sides are still supposed to do something in the future; nothing has been performed yet.\n\nOption B: \"A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\" Hmm, this seems a bit off. If one party has completed their performance and the other hasn't started theirs, I think that would be considered a partially executed contract, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nOption C: \"An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.\" That makes sense. If both parties have done what they were supposed to do, then the contract is fully executed.\n\nOption D: \"A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.\" This seems broader than option B. If at least one party has started performing, even if neither has finished, that might be considered partially executed.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's overlap here. Let's try to clarify the terms.\n\nA wholly executory contract is where neither party has started performing yet; it's all promises.\n\nA partially executory contract could mean that one or both parties have started performing but haven't finished yet.\n\nAn executed contract is where both parties have fully performed their obligations.\n\nBut option B says that partially executed means one party has completed performance while the other has only promised. That seems more like a situation where one party has finished, and the other hasn't started yet.\n\nIs that correct? Or does partially executed imply that at least some performance has occurred from one or both sides?\n\nI think there might be some confusion in the terminology here. Maybe \"partially executed\" isn't the standard term, and that's why it's a bit tricky.\n\nLet me consider the standard contract law terms.\n\nIn contract law, there's a distinction between executed and executory contracts.\n\nAn executed contract is one where all performances have been completed.\n\nAn executory contract is one where there are future performances still owed by one or both parties.\n\nBut within executory contracts, there can be different degrees. For example, a contract might be wholly executory, meaning neither party has started performing, or partially executory, meaning some performance has occurred.\n\nSo, option D says that a partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance. That seems reasonable.\n\nOption B, however, says that partially executed means one party has completed performance while the other has only promised. That seems like a specific type of partially executed contract, but not the general definition.\n\nMaybe the least correct statement is option B because it's too narrow? Perhaps partially executed contracts can include situations where one party has completed and the other has only promised, but also situations where both parties have started performing but haven't finished.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is too restrictive and doesn't account for all possible scenarios in partially executed contracts.\n\nLet me think about this again. Is there a standard definition for a partially executed contract?\n\nActually, I'm not entirely sure about the term \"partially executed contract.\" Maybe that's part of the confusion. Perhaps the standard term is \"partially executed\" in the sense that performance is ongoing.\n\nOption C seems straightforward: an executed contract is where both parties have fully performed. That sounds correct.\n\nOption A also seems correct: wholly executory is where only promises have been exchanged, and no performance has occurred yet.\n\nOption D suggests that partially executed means at least one party has begun performance. That could include situations where one party has started performing, or both have started, but neither has finished.\n\nOption B is more specific: one party has completed, and the other has only promised.\n\nMaybe the least correct statement is option B because it doesn't account for situations where both parties have begun performance but haven't completed it.\n\nIn other words, partially executed contracts could include scenarios where:\n\n1. One party has completed, and the other has only promised.\n\n2. One party has started performing but hasn't finished, and the other has only promised.\n\n3. Both parties have started performing but haven't finished.\n\nOption B only covers the first scenario and ignores the other possibilities. Therefore, it's too limited and perhaps not entirely correct in a general sense.\n\nIn contrast, option D is broader and seems to cover more scenarios.\n\nSo, maybe the least correct statement is option B because it doesn't account for all possible situations in partially executed contracts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to look at this.\n\nLet me consider the legal definitions.\n\nIn contract law, the terms \"executed\" and \"executory\" refer to the performance status of the\u5408\u540c.\n\nAn executed contract is one where all performances have been completed.\n\nAn executory contract is one where there are future performances still owed.\n\nBut the term \"partially executed\" isn't as standard, and its meaning might vary.\n\nPerhaps \"partially executed\" refers to a contract where some performance has occurred, but not all.\n\nIn that case, option D seems more accurate because it says that at least one party has begun performance.\n\nOption B is more specific, saying one party has completed while the other has only promised.\n\nBut in reality, partially executed contracts could include situations where both parties have begun performing but haven't finished.\n\nTherefore, option B is too narrow and might not cover all cases, making it the least correct statement among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the least correct statement is different.\n\nLet me consider option A again: \"A wholly executory contract is where only promises have been exchanged and there has been no performance by either party.\"\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"An executed contract exists when both parties have fully performed and no obligations remain.\" Also correct.\n\nOption D: \"A partially executed contract means that at least one party has begun performance.\" This seems accurate.\n\nOption B: \"A partially executed contract means that one party has completed performance while the other party has only promised.\" This might not always be the case, as explained earlier.\n\nTherefore, I think option B is the least correct because it doesn't account for all possible scenarios in partially executed contracts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another interpretation.\n\nMaybe the term \"partially executed\" is not the standard term used in contract law, and that's why there's confusion.\n\nIn contract law, we often talk about contracts being \"partly executed\" or \"partially performed.\"\n\nIn that context, a partially performed contract would be one where at least one party has done something towards their performance, but complete performance hasn't occurred from one or both sides.\n\nSo, option D seems to align with that understanding.\n\nOption B, however, is more specific and perhaps too limiting.\n\nTherefore, I believe option B is the least correct statement among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
