                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract dispute between the retailer and the distributor. So, we have a written distribution agreement that says any order for windows placed by the retailer is only binding on the distributor when it's expressly accepted by them. That sounds pretty clear, right? The distributor doesn't have to fill an order unless they say yes to it explicitly.\n\nNow, for two years, the retailer sends orders, and the distributor fills them without issue. But in the third year, things turn sour. The distributor accuses the retailer of overcharging for installations. The retailer says it's none of the distributor's business how they set their installation prices. Then, when the retailer places another order, the distributor refuses to fill it. The retailer sues for breach of contract. Interesting.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.\n\nWell, according to the agreement, the distributor only has to fill an order if they expressly accept it. So, technically, unless they said yes each time, they weren't obligated. But they did fill orders for two years without issue. Maybe there's something about their past behavior that changes things.\n\nB. No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.\n\nHmm. The distributor thinks the retailer is overcharging for installations. But the agreement is about selling windows, not installation services. If the agreement doesn't cover installations, maybe the distributor can't refuse to fill orders based on that.\n\nC. Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.\n\nThis suggests that even if the distributor is unhappy with the retailer's installation prices, that doesn't affect their obligation to fill orders for windows, especially since the agreement seems to be solely about window distribution.\n\nD. Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.\n\nThis is interesting. In contract law, the course of dealing between parties can imply terms or modify agreements. So, if they've been doing business a certain way for two years, maybe that creates an expectation that the distributor will continue to fill orders without expressly accepting each one.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully.\n\nFirst, the agreement states that any order is binding on the distributor only when expressly accepted by them. That seems pretty straightforward. So, unless the distributor says yes to an order, they don't have to fill it.\n\nHowever, for two years, they've been filling orders without expressly accepting each one. So, maybe through their actions, they've changed the terms of their agreement.\n\nIn contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically section 2-202, deals with the acceptance of orders in sales contracts. It says that if the merchant doesn't object to shipping goods without an acceptance, then the acceptance is considered to have been made when the goods are shipped. But I'm not entirely sure if that applies here.\n\nAlso, under UCC section 1-303, course of dealing can supply omitted terms in a contract. So, if the parties have been doing business in a certain way, that can become part of their agreement.\n\nIn this case, for two years, the distributor filled orders without expressly accepting them. So, maybe the course of dealing implies that the distributor has waived the requirement for express acceptance.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the distributor can still stick to the original terms of the agreement and require express acceptance for each order.\n\nNow, considering that the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging for installations. If the agreement doesn't address installations, then perhaps that's outside the scope of the contract, and the distributor can't refuse to fill orders based on that.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a provision in the agreement that requires the retailer to conduct business in a certain manner, and overcharging violates that, then maybe the distributor has grounds to terminate or refuse orders.\n\nBut from the information given, it seems like the agreement is solely about the distribution of windows, and installations are a separate service.\n\nSo, if the retailer sues for breach of contract, arguing that the distributor should have filled the order, what's the likely outcome?\n\nOption A says no, because the retailer's forwarding of orders didn't create an obligation for the distributor to fill them. That seems consistent with the agreement, but what about the two years of filling orders?\n\nOption B says no, because the retailer's overcharging excused the distributor's refusal. But if installations are outside the scope of the agreement, maybe this isn't a valid excuse.\n\nOption C says yes, because the distributor's claims about overcharging are independent of their obligation to fill orders. This seems plausible.\n\nOption D says yes, because the course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the order.\n\nI think option D is strong, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distributor can still rely on the original terms of the agreement, requiring express acceptance for each order.\n\nWait, maybe both options A and D are possible, but D considers the course of dealing, which might override the original terms.\n\nIn contract law, course of dealing can modify the terms of a contract. So, if the distributor has been filling orders without expressly accepting them for two years, maybe that establishes a new norm.\n\nTherefore, even though the agreement says orders are only binding when expressly accepted, their actions have shown that they don't require that anymore.\n\nSo, perhaps the retailer could argue that the course of dealing binds the distributor to fill orders without needing express acceptance.\n\nBut, at the same time, the distributor might argue that they still reserve the right to require express acceptance, and that their past behavior was just a accommodation, not a modification of the agreement.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles involved.\n\nUnder the UCC, particularly section 2-202, where the merchant furnishes goods as ordered, this can be considered acceptance of the order.\n\nAdditionally, section 1-303 allows course of dealing to supply omitted terms or to interpret the agreement.\n\nIn this case, the term isn't omitted; it's specified that acceptance is required. However, their course of dealing suggests that they don't require express acceptance.\n\nSo, perhaps the course of dealing has modified the requirement for express acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the distributor is now obligated to fill orders without expressly accepting them.\n\nThus, when they refused to fill the order, it could be a breach of contract.\n\nBut, there's also the issue of the distributor's accusation about overcharging for installations.\n\nIf the agreement allows the distributor to terminate or refuse orders under certain circumstances, such as breach of contract by the retailer, then maybe the distributor had the right to refuse the order.\n\nHowever, since the agreement seems to be about window distribution and not installations, perhaps this isn't a valid reason to refuse the order.\n\nAlternatively, if the agreement includes provisions requiring the retailer to conduct business ethically or in a certain manner, and overcharging violates that, then the distributor might have grounds to refuse orders.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems like installations are outside the scope of the agreement, so the distributor's accusation might not be relevant.\n\nTherefore, the retailer is likely to prevail in their suit for breach of contract, because the distributor was obligated to fill the order due to the course of dealing between the parties.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C also suggests that the retailer would prevail, but for a different reason.\n\nOption C says yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging is independent of its obligation to fill the order.\n\nWhile this might be true, it doesn't account for the course of dealing, which I think is a stronger argument.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the better choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the retailer is likely to prevail because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order, despite the original terms requiring express acceptance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
