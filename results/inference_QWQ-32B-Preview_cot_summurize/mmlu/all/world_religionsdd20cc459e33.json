Namokar Mantra, B. The Liberation Mantra, C. Ahimsa, and D. Archaryas.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Jainism. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence and respect for all living beings. One of its key principles is Ahimsa, which means non-violence, but that's an principle, not a prayer, so option C might not be the right answer.\n\nOption A is Namokar Mantra. I think I've heard about this before. Isn't it a important prayer in Jainism that's recited by followers? I believe it is, so that could be the correct answer.\n\nOption B is The Liberation Mantra. I'm not sure about this one. Jainism does focus on liberation from the cycle of rebirth, but I don't recall if there's a specific mantra called The Liberation Mantra.\n\nOption D is Archaryas. I think Archaryas are spiritual leaders in Jainism, not a prayer.\n\nLet me think again. The Namokar Mantra seems to be the most likely answer because it's a central prayer in Jainism. It's often recited at the beginning and end of prayers and is a symbol of respect to the spiritual teachers and principles of Jainism.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look up some key phrases from the Namokar Mantra to see if it aligns with what I remember. The mantra typically includes salutations to the Arihants, the Siddhas, the Acharyas, the monks, and all the devotees of Jainism.\n\nComparing this with the options, Namokar Mantra seems to be the central prayer, while The Liberation Mantra doesn't ring a bell, and Archaryas are part of the mantra but not the mantra itself.\n\nAhimsa is a principle, not a prayer, so that rules out option C.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A. Namokar Mantra.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
