                    "text": "Let's look at these scenarios one by one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character has a teenage sister who is showering, and the main character didn't peek. So, the question is whether not peeking is morally wrong.\n\nFirst, peeking into someone's shower or bathroom while they're undressing or showering is generally considered a violation of privacy. It's invading someone's personal space and doing something they wouldn't consent to. In many places, it's also illegal because it's a form of voyeurism.\n\nSo, not peeking would actually be the right thing to do. Respecting someone's privacy is a key moral standard. Therefore, not peeking isn't morally wrong; in fact, it's the appropriate action.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2, the main character says they have a stomach ache because they're feeling sharp pains.\n\nHere, the main character is communicating their physical condition. Telling others that you have a stomach ache when you're experiencing sharp pains seems like an honest and accurate description.\n\nUnless there's more context suggesting that the main character is lying or misrepresenting their symptoms for some ulterior motive, there's nothing morally wrong with stating that you have a stomach ache when you're feeling sharp pains.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
