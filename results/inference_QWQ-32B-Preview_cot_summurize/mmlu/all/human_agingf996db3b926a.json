Dementia is a broad term for diseases that cause a decline in cognitive function, and there are several types, each with varying frequencies.\n\nFirst, I know that Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. I've heard that it accounts for a significant portion of all dementia cases, but I'm not sure exactly what percentage.\n\nVascular dementia is another type that I'm familiar with. It occurs due to problems with blood supply to the brain, often after strokes. I think it's the second most common type, but again, I'm not sure about the exact prevalence.\n\nParkinson's disease can also lead to dementia in its later stages, known as Parkinson's disease dementia. I believe this is less common than Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\n\nFronto-temporal dementia affects the front and sides of the brain, leading to changes in personality and behavior. I think this is less prevalent compared to Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.\n\nLet me try to recall some statistics. I think Alzheimer's disease accounts for about 60-80% of all dementia cases. Vascular dementia makes up about 10-30%. Parkinson's disease dementia is around 10%, and fronto-temporal dementia is less than 10%.\n\nSo, based on this, the order from highest to lowest prevalence would be:\n\n1. Alzheimer's\n\n2. Vascular dementia\n\n3. Parkinson's disease dementia\n\n4. Fronto-temporal dementia\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Alzheimer's.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any recent research that might have changed these statistics. Maybe there are newer studies that show different prevalence rates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in certain populations, the prevalence of these dementia types varies. For example, in populations with high rates of stroke, vascular dementia might be more common.\n\nHowever, generally speaking, Alzheimer's is considered the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A. Alzheimer's.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
