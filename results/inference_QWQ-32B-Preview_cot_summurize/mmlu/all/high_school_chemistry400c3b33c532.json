                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"How many electrons, neutrons, and protons are in an atom of 52Cr?\" And there are four options:\n\nA. 24 electrons, 24 protons, 24 neutrons\n\nB. 27 electrons, 27 protons, 24 neutrons\n\nC. 24 electrons, 28 protons, 24 neutrons\n\nD. 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what 52Cr means. Cr is the chemical symbol for Chromium, which you can find on the periodic table. The number 52 is the mass number of this particular isotope of Chromium.\n\nSo, the mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. The atomic number, which is unique to each element, tells us the number of protons in the atom. For Chromium, the atomic number is 24. That means every Chromium atom has 24 protons.\n\nIn a neutral atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons. So, if there are 24 protons, there should be 24 electrons as well.\n\nNow, the mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons. So, if the mass number is 52 and there are 24 protons, then the number of neutrons should be 52 minus 24, which is 28.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Protons: 24\n\n- Electrons: 24\n\n- Neutrons: 28\n\nLooking back at the options, option D matches this: 24 electrons, 24 protons, 28 neutrons.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nOption A has 24 electrons, 24 protons, and 24 neutrons. That would mean the mass number is 24 + 24 = 48, but the isotope is 52Cr, which has a mass number of 52, so that doesn't match.\n\nOption B has 27 electrons, 27 protons, and 24 neutrons. That would give a mass number of 27 + 24 = 51, but the isotope is 52Cr, so not a match.\n\nOption C has 24 electrons, 28 protons, and 24 neutrons. Protons: 28, neutrons: 24, mass number: 52, but Chromium's atomic number is 24, not 28. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption D has 24 electrons, 24 protons, and 28 neutrons, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about Chromium-52 having different isotopes or something, but in general, for a neutral atom of Chromium-52, the numbers should be as I calculated.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
