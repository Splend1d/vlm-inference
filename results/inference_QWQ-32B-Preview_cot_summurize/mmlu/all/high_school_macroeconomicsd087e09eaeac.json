                    "text": "Let's dive into this economics question. I need to identify which option is an example of an expansionary supply shock. First off, what's a supply shock? It's an event that affects the supply of goods and services in an economy, usually causing a sudden change in prices and output.\n\nNow, expansionary sounds like it's related to expansion, which in economics often means growth. So, an expansionary supply shock might be something that increases the supply, leading to lower prices and higher output. That makes sense because more supply would put downward pressure on prices and allow for more production.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Rapid increasing wages. Hmm, wages are a cost for businesses. If wages go up quickly, that would increase the cost of production, right? That would likely lead to higher prices for goods and services, not lower. So, that seems like it would be a negative supply shock, not expansionary.\n\nB. A greatly depreciated currency. Depreciation means the currency is worth less compared to others. This can make exports cheaper and imports more expensive. Cheaper exports might boost domestic production as more goods are sold abroad, which could increase supply. On the other hand, more expensive imports could raise input costs for some businesses. Maybe this has mixed effects, but perhaps it's considered expansionary because it can stimulate domestic production.\n\nC. Declining labor productivity. Productivity is output per unit of input. If productivity declines, that means businesses are getting less output from the same amount of input, which is inefficient. This would likely reduce the overall supply because it's costlier to produce each unit. So, this seems like a negative supply shock, not expansionary.\n\nD. Lower factor prices in major industries. Factors of production include things like labor, capital, land, and entrepreneurship. If the prices of these factors decrease, that means costs for businesses go down. Lower costs should allow businesses to produce more at a lower price, which sounds like it would increase supply. So, this seems like it could be an expansionary supply shock.\n\nComparing options B and D, both seem plausible, but let's think deeper.\n\nIn option B, a depreciated currency can stimulate domestic production by making exports more competitive. However, it also makes imports more expensive, which could increase the cost of raw materials or components that are imported. So, the net effect on supply might not be entirely positive, depending on how much businesses rely on imports.\n\nOption D, lower factor prices, directly reduces production costs across the board. This should unambiguously increase supply, as businesses can produce more for less. This seems like a clearer example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\nLet me double-check the definitions to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAn expansionary supply shock is one that increases the supply of goods and services, typically leading to lower prices and higher output.\n\nOption A: Rapid increasing wages would likely decrease supply because higher wages increase costs, leading to higher prices and potentially less output.\n\nOption B: A depreciated currency has mixed effects. It can boost exports but increase import costs. The net effect on supply isn't as straightforward as in option D.\n\nOption C: Declining labor productivity reduces supply by making production less efficient.\n\nOption D: Lower factor prices directly reduce costs, increasing supply.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Lower factor prices in major industries.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any scenario where option B could be considered expansionary. If the depreciated currency significantly boosts exports, leading to a large increase in domestic production, that could be considered expansionary. However, the increase in import prices could offset some of these gains, depending on the economy's structure.\n\nIn contrast, lower factor prices across major industries would generally lead to lower costs and higher supply, making option D the most straightforward example of an expansionary supply shock.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
