                    "text": "Let's see. Lucy is making gift baskets and she puts 3 apples in each basket. We need to find out how many baskets, b, she can make with 24 apples. So, I need to figure out which number sentence correctly represents this situation.\n\nOption A is 24 + 3 = b. That means if I add 24 and 3, I get the number of baskets. But that doesn't make sense because if she has 24 apples and puts 3 in each basket, adding them wouldn't give the number of baskets. Maybe I'm missing something, but I think this is probably not the right one.\n\nOption B is 3 + b = 24. This suggests that adding 3 to the number of baskets gives 24. Again, that doesn't seem right because if she makes b baskets, each with 3 apples, I think I should be multiplying, not adding.\n\nOption C is 24 \u00f7 b = 3. This means that if I divide 24 apples by the number of baskets, I get 3 apples per basket. Hmm, that sounds logical. If she has 24 apples and each basket gets 3, then the number of baskets would be 24 divided by 3, which is 8. So, this seems like a possible correct answer.\n\nOption D is 3 \u00d7 24 = b. This would mean that multiplying 3 apples by 24 gives the number of baskets. That would be 72 baskets, which doesn't make sense because she only has 24 apples. So, that can't be right.\n\nLooking back, option C seems to make the most sense. To confirm, if I rearrange the equation 24 \u00f7 b = 3, I can solve for b by multiplying both sides by b and then dividing by 3, which gives b = 24 \u00f7 3 = 8. That means she can make 8 baskets, which fits with my earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of apples divided by the number of apples per basket giving the number of baskets. So, 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 baskets.\n\nI don't think the other options make sense in this context. Option A is addition, which isn't relevant here. Option B suggests that adding the number of baskets to 3 gives the total apples, which doesn't make logical sense. Option D multiplies the number of apples per basket by the total apples, which would give a number that's way off.\n\nTherefore, the correct number sentence is 24 \u00f7 b = 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
