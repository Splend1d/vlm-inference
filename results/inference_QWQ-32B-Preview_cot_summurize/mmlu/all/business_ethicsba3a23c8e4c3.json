The options are:\n\nA. Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts\n\nB. Social evaluations, Social programmes, and Social impacts\n\nC. Social policies, Social evidencing, and Social impacts\n\nD. Social policies, Social programmes, and Social analysis\n\nI need to recall what Wood said in 1991 about the outcomes of CSR. I think Wood proposed a model that identified specific outcomes of CSR practices. Let me try to remember.\n\nFirst, I know that CSR involves companies considering the social and environmental impacts of their operations. So, the outcomes should relate to how companies manage their social responsibilities.\n\nOption A lists Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts. This seems plausible because companies often develop policies to guide their social responsibilities, implement programmes to execute those policies, and ultimately aim to have positive social impacts.\n\nOption B has Social evaluations instead of Social policies. Social evaluations could be part of CSR, like assessing the social performance of the company, but I think policies are more fundamental.\n\nOption C mentions Social evidencing, which I'm not sure about. I think \"evidencing\" might refer to documenting or providing evidence of social performance, but I don't recall that being one of the primary outcomes.\n\nOption D has Social analysis, which could be related to evaluating social issues, but again, it seems more like a step before implementing policies and programmes.\n\nLooking back, I think the correct sequence is policies, programmes, and impacts. Policies are the guidelines, programmes are the actions based on those guidelines, and impacts are the results of those actions.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is A: Social policies, Social programmes, and Social impacts.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption B: Social evaluations are important in CSR, but they are more about assessing the effectiveness of policies and programmes rather than being an outcome themselves.\n\nOption C: Social evidencing seems like it could be part of reporting or transparency in CSR, but it's not necessarily an outcome in the same way as policies, programmes, and impacts.\n\nOption D: Social analysis is likely part of the initial stages of CSR, where companies identify social issues and assess their impact, but again, not an outcome.\n\nTherefore, option A makes the most sense as it represents a logical progression from setting policies, implementing programmes, to achieving impacts.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
