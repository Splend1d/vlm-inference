                    "text": "I'm going through this multiple-choice question about confidentiality in psychology, specifically regarding what a child client discloses to a psychologist. The question is: \"Information disclosed by a child client to a psychologist may be kept confidential except when the client reports...\" and then it lists four options:\n\nA. sexual abuse\n\nB. frequent homosexual activities\n\nC. strong feelings of attraction to the therapist\n\nD. extreme feelings of depression\n\nSo, I need to figure out in which of these cases confidentiality might not be maintained.\n\nFirst, I should recall that confidentiality is a key aspect of the therapeutic relationship. It helps build trust between the client and the psychologist, allowing the client to open up about personal issues without fear of judgment or disclosure.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to confidentiality, especially when it comes to protecting the client or others from harm. Let's look at each option to see which ones might fall under these exceptions.\n\nOption A is \"sexual abuse.\" This is a clear case where confidentiality might need to be breached. In many jurisdictions, psychologists are mandated reporters, which means they are legally required to report cases of suspected child abuse, including sexual abuse, to the appropriate authorities. The welfare of the child is paramount, and reporting such abuse is essential to ensure the child's safety and well-being.\n\nOption B is \"frequent homosexual activities.\" Now, this one seems a bit tricky. Homosexuality is a normal variation of human sexuality, and engaging in consensual sexual activities is a private matter. In general, a psychologist should respect the client's confidentiality in this regard. However, if the activities are illegal or involve minors engaged in activities with other minors, there might be legal obligations to report. But based on the information given, it seems like this is about consensual activities among adults, which shouldn't require breaching confidentiality.\n\nOption C is \"strong feelings of attraction to the therapist.\" This is an important ethical issue in therapy. If a client, especially a child, expresses strong feelings of attraction to the therapist, it could indicate a potential boundary issue or even transference. While this information should generally be kept confidential, the psychologist might need to address these feelings in therapy, perhaps referring the client to another professional if the feelings are intense and could impair the therapeutic relationship. However, there's no legal mandate to report this; it's more about managing the therapeutic relationship ethically.\n\nOption D is \"extreme feelings of depression.\" Depression is a serious mental health condition, and if a client is experiencing extreme depression, there might be concerns about suicide or self-harm. In cases where a client expresses suicidal thoughts or intentions, psychologists have a duty to ensure the client's safety, which might involve breaching confidentiality to inform others who can help, such as family members or emergency services. So, in this case, confidentiality might not be maintained if there's an immediate risk to the client's life.\n\nConsidering all these points, the correct answer seems to be A, sexual abuse, because it involves potential harm to the child, and psychologists are mandated to report such cases. Option D, extreme feelings of depression, could also lead to a breach of confidentiality if there's an imminent risk of harm, but the question seems to be asking for exceptions to confidentiality based on what is reported, and sexual abuse is a clearer-cut case where reporting is mandatory.\n\nI should also note that option B, frequent homosexual activities, shouldn't generally lead to a breach of confidentiality, as it's about private sexual behavior that doesn't necessarily harm anyone else. And option C, feelings of attraction to the therapist, is an internal feeling that, while important to address in therapy, doesn't typically require reporting outside of the therapeutic context.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Sexual abuse.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
