She plans a middle school experiment in which an SRS of 30 eighth graders will be assigned four extra hours of reading per week, an SRS of 30 seventh graders will be assigned two extra hours of reading per week, and an SRS of 30 sixth graders with no extra assigned reading will be a control group. After one school year, the mean GPAs from each group will be compared. Is this a good experimental design?\n\nA. Yes.\nB. No, because while this design may point out an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\nC. No, because without blinding, there is a strong chance of a placebo effect.\nD. No, because grade level is a lurking variable which may well be confounded with the variables under consideration.\n"

The reading specialist is planning an experiment where different groups of students from different grades get different amounts of extra reading time, and then their GPAs are compared after a school year. The question is whether this is a good experimental design.\n\nFirst, option A says yes, it's a good design. But I need to make sure there are no flaws before I agree with that.\n\nOption B says no, because even if there's an association between reading and GPA, it can't establish cause and effect. Hmm, in experiments, isn't the whole point to establish cause and effect? So maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C mentions the need for blinding to avoid a placebo effect. But in this context, with reading time and GPA, does a placebo effect really apply? I don't think students would have a placebo response to reading time, like they might in a medical trial. So maybe this isn't the issue here.\n\nOption D says no, because grade level is a lurking variable that may be confounded with the variables under consideration. That sounds plausible. Let me think about that.\n\nIn this experiment, different grades are assigned different amounts of reading time: eighth graders get four extra hours, seventh graders get two, and sixth graders get none. But grade level itself could affect GPA. Maybe eighth graders have different academic pressures or abilities compared to sixth graders, independent of the extra reading time.\n\nSo, grade level could be a confounding variable that affects both the treatment (extra reading time) and the outcome (GPA). If that's the case, then any observed differences in GPA might be due to grade level differences rather than the extra reading time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reading specialist is trying to control for grade level by having separate groups from each grade. But by assigning different reading times based on grade, she might be introducing confounding.\n\nWait, perhaps random assignment to groups would help here. But she's already assigning based on grade, taking SRS from each grade. So, within each grade, the students are randomly selected, but the treatment is assigned based on grade.\n\nMaybe a better design would be to randomly assign students from the same grade to different treatment levels, so that grade level is controlled for.\n\nFor example, randomly assign some sixth graders to no extra reading, some to two hours, and some to four hours, and do the same for seventh and eighth graders. That way, you can compare the effects of extra reading time within the same grade level.\n\nBut in the current design, grade level and reading time are completely confounded because different grades receive different reading times.\n\nSo, yes, grade level is a lurking variable that's confounded with the treatment, which makes it hard to isolate the effect of reading time on GPA.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check why the other options aren't suitable.\n\nOption A: Saying yes, it's a good design, but given the confounding issue, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: About association vs. causation. Actually, experiments are designed to establish causation by controlling for other variables. But in this case, because of the confounding, causation might not be reliably established.\n\nOption C: Placebo effect is more relevant in medical trials where participants' expectations can affect outcomes. In this educational setting, with reading time and GPA, it's less clear that a placebo effect would be a major issue.\n\nSo, overall, D seems to be the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
