                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about John's inability to remember the pictures on different coins and bills. The options are confabulation, failure to reconstruct, failure to encode, and deep processing. I need to figure out which one best explains why John can't identify these images even though he's been handling money for 17 years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nConfabulation is when someone makes up information to fill in gaps in their memory. It's like they're telling a story without realizing it's not accurate. But in this case, John isn't making up anything; he's just not remembering the pictures. So, confabulation doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nFailure to reconstruct means that the memory is there, but John can't retrieve it when needed. It's like the memory is stored somewhere in his brain, but he can't access it. Maybe he saw the pictures before, but for some reason, he can't bring them to mind now.\n\nFailure to encode means that the information was never properly stored in the first place. So, even though John has been handling money for 17 years, maybe he never really paid attention to the pictures on the coins and bills, and therefore, they were never encoded into his long-term memory.\n\nDeep processing refers to the idea that the more meaning we attach to information, the better we remember it. If John didn't process the images deeply, perhaps because he didn't find them meaningful or interesting, then he might not remember them.\n\nNow, considering that John has been handling money for 17 years, it's likely that he has seen these coins and bills many times. However, just because he has seen them doesn't mean he has paid attention to the details, like the pictures on them. Maybe he was too focused on the value of the money or other things, and never really looked at the images.\n\nSo, it seems like the issue here is that he never encoded that information into his memory. He might have seen the pictures, but if he didn't pay attention to them or find them important, his brain didn't store that information.\n\nOn the other hand, if he did encode the information but can't retrieve it now, that would be failure to reconstruct. But given that he has been handling money for so long and still can't identify the pictures, it's more likely that the information was never properly encoded in the first place.\n\nDeep processing also ties into encoding. If he didn't process the images deeply, they wouldn't be well-encoded. But I think \"failure to encode\" is a more direct answer in this context.\n\nConfabulation doesn't apply here because there's no indication that John is making up information; he's just not remembering.\n\nTherefore, the most likely reason for John's inability to remember the pictures is failure to encode.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. failure to encode}} \\]"
