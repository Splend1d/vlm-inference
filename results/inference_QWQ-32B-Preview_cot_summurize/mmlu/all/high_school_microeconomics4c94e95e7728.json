                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns and how it affects different cost curves in the short run. The question is asking which of these statements is true regarding that law. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: AVC that first rises, but eventually falls, as output increases.\n\nWait, AVC is average variable cost. I think I remember that in the short run, as output increases, AVC typically decreases at first because of increasing marginal returns, and then it starts to increase because of diminishing marginal returns. So, it's more like AVC falls and then rises, not rises and then falls. Maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nOption B: AFC that first rises, but eventually falls, as output increases.\n\nAFC is average fixed cost. Fixed costs don't change with output, so as output increases, AFC should just keep falling because the same fixed cost is spread over more units. I don't think it rises at all. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: MP that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\nMP is marginal product. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns says that as you add more of a variable input (like labor), holding other inputs constant, eventually the marginal product starts to decrease. It doesn't say that MP falls and then rises again. In fact, it should keep falling as more input is added. So, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption D: MC that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\nMC is marginal cost. In the short run, with diminishing marginal returns, MC should increase as output increases because each additional unit costs more to produce. But before that, if there are increasing marginal returns initially, MC might decrease at first. So, MC falls and then rises. That sounds familiar.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In the short run, when you start increasing output, you might have increasing marginal returns initially, which means MP is increasing, so MC is decreasing. Then, once diminishing marginal returns set in, MP starts to fall, and MC starts to rise. So, overall, MC first falls and then rises as output increases.\n\nComparing this with option D, it matches: MC first falls, then rises.\n\nOption A said AVC first rises, then falls, but I think it's the other way around. AVC should fall initially and then rise due to diminishing returns.\n\nOption B is incorrect because AFC always falls as output increases.\n\nOption C is wrong because MP falls as output increases due to diminishing marginal returns, it doesn't rise again.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D: MC that first falls, but eventually rises, as output increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
