During the time this question is set (2020), there was a global pandemic, and wearing masks was widely recommended to prevent the spread of the virus. So, not wearing a mask when sick would be considered morally wrong because it puts others at risk.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is telling a new girl to wear a sundress because rain is forecasted. This seems a bit confusing. If the forecast calls for rain, maybe the person is advising her to wear something appropriate for the weather, but suggesting a sundress for rain doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. However, based on the information given, it doesn't seem like a morally wrong action. It might just be bad advice.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
