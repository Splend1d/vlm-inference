                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Mill's response to the criticism that utilitarianism is a doctrine worthy of swine. So, the criticism is suggesting that utilitarianism focuses only on pleasure, and therefore, it's no better than the pleasure-seeking behavior of pigs. Mill, being a utilitarian philosopher, would need to address this objection to show that utilitarianism is a more refined and higher moral theory.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Mill says about pleasures in his defense of utilitarianism. I remember that in \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill distinguishes between different kinds of pleasures, arguing that not all pleasures are equal. He suggests that some pleasures are more valuable than others because they are associated with higher faculties or because they are preferred by people who have experienced both types.\n\nOption A is \"purity.\" I'm not sure what Mill would mean by \"purity\" in the context of pleasures. Maybe it refers to the absence of negative consequences or impurities in the pleasure itself. But I don't recall Mill using the term \"purity\" specifically in his discussion of pleasures.\n\nOption B is \"quality.\" This seems promising. Mill does talk about the quality of pleasures, suggesting that some pleasures are inherently better than others because they engage higher faculties of the mind, such as intellectual or moral pleasures, as opposed to merely sensory pleasures.\n\nOption C is \"species.\" This could refer to different types or categories of pleasures, which aligns with Mill's classification of pleasures into higher and lower pleasures. So, this might also be a correct answer.\n\nOption D is \"weight.\" I think Mill uses the term \"weight\" in relation to the intensity and duration of pleasures when calculating the greatest happiness. So, \"weight\" might refer to how much a particular pleasure contributes to overall happiness.\n\nNow, considering the criticism that utilitarianism is a doctrine worthy of swine, Mill needs to show that human pleasures are different from animal pleasures. He argues that humans can experience higher pleasures that are qualitatively different from mere sensual pleasures. Therefore, the distinction he is making is about the type or quality of pleasures.\n\nIn \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill writes, \"It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied.\" This quote clearly indicates that Mill values certain kinds of pleasures over others based on their quality or the type of faculty they engage.\n\nSo, between options B and C, both \"quality\" and \"species\" seem relevant. However, \"species\" might refer more to the classification of pleasures into different types, while \"quality\" refers to the inherent value or superiority of certain pleasures.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is B. quality, because Mill emphasizes that some pleasures are superior in quality to others, and it's these higher-quality pleasures that utilitarianism aims to promote.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether \"species\" could also be correct. If \"species\" means different kinds or types of pleasures, then it aligns with Mill's distinction between higher and lower pleasures. So, C. species could also be a correct answer.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the aspect in which pleasures differ according to Mill's response. Given that the criticism is about the quality of pleasures\u2014suggesting that utilitarianism reduces human morality to the level of animals\u2014Mill's response would focus on the qualitative difference between human and animal pleasures.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate answer is B. quality.\n\nBut to make sure, let's look back at the question: \"Mill responds that pleasures differ in:\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. purity.\n\nB. quality.\n\nC. species.\n\nD. weight.\n\nGiven that \"quality\" directly relates to the inherent value or superiority of certain pleasures, and \"species\" relates to the type or kind of pleasures, I think \"quality\" is the better choice here.\n\nMoreover, in Mill's own words, he discusses that some pleasures are \"more desirable and more valuable\" than others, which ties into the concept of quality.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is B. quality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
