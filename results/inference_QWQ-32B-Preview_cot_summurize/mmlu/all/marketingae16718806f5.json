The question is about a commercial activity where one party lets another use their connection with a specific group of people, and in return, they get money, services, or resources. We need to choose the right term from the options: advertising, exchange, sponsorship, or public relations.\n\nFirst, let's think about what each of these terms generally means.\n\nAdvertising is when a company pays to promote its products or services through various media like TV, internet, newspapers, etc. It's about getting the message out to a wide audience to influence their purchasing decisions.\n\nExchange seems a bit vague here. In business, an exchange typically refers to trading goods or services of equal value. But in this context, it might not specifically relate to exploiting an association with a target audience.\n\nSponsorship is when a company supports an event, organization, or individual, usually in exchange for publicity or other benefits. It's common in sports, arts, and non-profit events. The sponsor gets associated with the event or person, which can help them reach a specific audience.\n\nPublic relations, or PR, is about managing the spread of information between an organization and the public. It's about building and maintaining a positive image and reputation through communication and networking.\n\nNow, looking back at the question, it mentions \"exploiting an association with a target audience in return for funds, services, or resources.\" This sounds a lot like sponsorship, where a company sponsors an event or personality to connect with the audience that follows them.\n\nAdvertising is similar, but it's more about direct promotion through media, not necessarily exploiting an existing association. Exchange is too general and doesn't specify the context of audience association. Public relations is about managing reputation and communication, not necessarily exchanging resources for audience exploitation.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Sponsorship.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a finer point I'm missing.\n\nAdvertising often involves paying for ad space to reach an audience, but it's not always about exploiting an existing association. For example, a TV commercial reaches viewers watching a particular show, but it's not necessarily exploiting the show's association with its audience.\n\nSponsorship, on the other hand, is directly about associating with something that already has a connection to a target audience. For example, sponsoring a sports team to reach sports enthusiasts.\n\nPublic relations activities might aim to build relationships with the audience, but they don't necessarily involve exchanging funds or services for that association.\n\nExchange is too broad and doesn't specify the nature of the association being exploited.\n\nTherefore, sponsorship seems to fit the description most accurately.\n\nI'll go with C. Sponsorship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
