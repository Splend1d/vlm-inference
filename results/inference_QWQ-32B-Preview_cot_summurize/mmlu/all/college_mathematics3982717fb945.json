                    "text": "So I have this function f(x) = e^x - c x, where c is a positive number, and I need to find its minimum value. The options are f(c), f(e^c), f(1/c), and f(log c). I'm not sure how to approach this. I think I need to find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero, but I'm a bit rusty on that.\n\nFirst, let's recall that to find the minimum of a function, we can take its derivative and set it equal to zero to find the critical points. Then, we can determine which of these points is a minimum by checking the second derivative or by analyzing the behavior of the function.\n\nSo, let's compute the first derivative of f(x):\n\nf(x) = e^x - c x\n\nf'(x) = e^x - c\n\nNow, set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:\n\ne^x - c = 0\n\ne^x = c\n\nTaking the natural logarithm on both sides:\n\nx = ln(c)\n\nSo, there's a critical point at x = ln(c). Now, I need to determine whether this is a minimum.\n\nLet's look at the second derivative:\n\nf''(x) = d/dx (e^x - c) = e^x\n\nSince e^x is always positive for all real x, the second derivative is always positive. That means the function is concave up at every point, so the critical point at x = ln(c) is indeed a minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = ln(c), which corresponds to option D, f(log c). Note that in mathematics, log typically refers to the natural logarithm, which is ln. So, log c is the same as ln c.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: f(c) = e^c - c*c = e^c - c^2\n\nOption B: f(e^c) = e^(e^c) - c*e^c\n\nOption C: f(1/c) = e^(1/c) - c*(1/c) = e^(1/c) - 1\n\nOption D: f(log c) = e^(ln c) - c*ln c = c - c*ln c\n\nNow, comparing these, option D seems to be the correct one because it corresponds to the critical point we found. But let's see if any of the others could make sense.\n\nOption A: f(c) is just plugging c into the function, but c is not necessarily the point where the minimum occurs.\n\nOption B: f(e^c) is plugging e^c into the function, which doesn't seem related to the critical point.\n\nOption C: f(1/c) is plugging 1/c into the function, again not related to the critical point.\n\nOption D: f(log c) is plugging ln c into the function, which is the critical point we found.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. f(log c).\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider a specific value for c. Let's say c = 1.\n\nThen, f(x) = e^x - 1*x = e^x - x\n\nf'(x) = e^x - 1\n\nSet e^x - 1 = 0 => e^x = 1 => x = 0\n\nSo, the critical point is at x = 0.\n\nf''(x) = e^x, which is e^0 = 1 > 0, so it's a minimum.\n\nNow, f(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nNow, let's see what the options give:\n\nA. f(c) = f(1) = e^1 - 1 = e - 1 \u2248 1.718 - 1 = 0.718\n\nB. f(e^c) = f(e) = e^e - e \u2248 15.154 - 2.718 \u2248 12.436\n\nC. f(1/c) = f(1) = same as A, 0.718\n\nD. f(log c) = f(ln 1) = f(0) = 1\n\nSo, in this case, the minimum is at f(0) = 1, which is option D.\n\nBut wait, in this specific case, option A gives a smaller value: 0.718, which is less than 1. But according to our earlier analysis, the minimum should be at x = ln c, which is x = 0 when c = 1, giving f(0) = 1.\n\nHmm, that seems inconsistent. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that for c = 1, ln c = ln 1 = 0, and f(0) = 1, but option A is f(1) = e - 1 \u2248 1.718 - 1 = 0.718, which is less than 1. But according to the derivative, the minimum is at x = 0, which gives f(0) = 1.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to reconsider the second derivative test or something.\n\nWait, let's compute f'(x) again:\n\nf(x) = e^x - c x\n\nf'(x) = e^x - c\n\nSet f'(x) = 0: e^x - c = 0 => e^x = c => x = ln c\n\nNow, f''(x) = e^x, which is always positive, so indeed, x = ln c is a minimum.\n\nBut in the case where c = 1, x = ln 1 = 0, and f(0) = 1, but f(1) = e - 1 \u2248 1.718 - 1 = 0.718, which is less than 1. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the second derivative test or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that f''(x) > 0 implies a minimum. But in this case, it should.\n\nWait, perhaps plotting the function for c = 1 would help.\n\nFor c = 1, f(x) = e^x - x\n\nf'(x) = e^x - 1\n\nSet f'(x) = 0: e^x - 1 = 0 => x = 0\n\nf''(x) = e^x, which is e^0 = 1 > 0, so minimum at x = 0\n\nBut f(0) = 1, but f(1) = e - 1 \u2248 1.718 - 1 = 0.718, which is less than 1. This doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating f(1). Let's check:\n\nf(1) = e^1 - 1*1 = e - 1 \u2248 2.718 - 1 = 1.718, which is greater than f(0) = 1.\n\nWait, actually, in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly thought f(1) was e - 1 \u2248 1.718, which is greater than f(0) = 1. So, actually, there is no contradiction. The minimum is at x = 0, which is x = ln 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated f(1). Let me recalculate:\n\nf(1) = e^1 - 1*1 = e - 1 \u2248 2.718 - 1 = 1.718, which is greater than f(0) = 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimum is indeed at x = 0, which is x = ln c when c = 1.\n\nTherefore, option D, f(log c), is correct.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that f(1) was less than f(0). It's actually greater.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of f is at f(log c).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
