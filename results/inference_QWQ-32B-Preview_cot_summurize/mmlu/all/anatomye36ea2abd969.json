                    "text": "I think the sinoatrial node is located in the upper wall of the right atrium. So, that would be option C. But let me make sure. The sinoatrial node, also known as the SA node, is often called the heart's natural pacemaker because it sets the rhythm for the heartbeat. I remember that it's located in the right atrium, specifically in the upper part near the entrance of the superior vena cava.\n\nLet me think about the other options to see why they might be wrong. Option A says between the left atrium and the left ventricle. I don't think that's correct because the SA node is more on the upper part of the heart, not between the left chambers.\n\nOption B says between the right atrium and the right ventricle. That sounds like the atrioventricular node, or AV node, which is located between the atria and ventricles. But the SA node is specifically in the atrium, not between the atrium and ventricle.\n\nOption D says in the upper wall of the left ventricle. That seems unlikely because the SA node is associated with the atria, not the ventricles, and specifically the right atrium.\n\nSo, I believe the correct answer is C: in the upper wall of the right atrium.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
