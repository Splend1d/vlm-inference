                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the trial judge should do in this situation. So, there's a paternity trial, and the mother's attorney wants to bring the baby girl, who is 36 months old, into the courtroom to show certain facial resemblances between the child and the alleged father. The defendant's attorney is objecting to this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about whether the child should be exhibited in court for the purpose of comparing facial features. The options are:\n\nA. Permit the child to be exhibited as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.\n\nB. Not permit the child to be exhibited because it would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\n\nC. Permit the child to be exhibited as within the hearsay exception of pedigree.\n\nD. Not permit the child to be exhibited because such an exhibition would be self-serving to the complainant.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about the rules of evidence and what's appropriate in a courtroom setting.\n\nLet me start by considering option A. Demonstrative evidence is usually physical evidence that helps to illustrate or explain something in the case. For example, photographs, charts, or models. Bringing a live child into court for the purpose of visual comparison seems different from typical demonstrative evidence. It might be more invasive and could potentially cause distress to the child. So, I'm not sure if this qualifies as a non-objectionable form of demonstrative evidence.\n\nOption B suggests that exhibiting the child would be highly prejudicial to the defendant. Prejudicial means that it could unduly influence the jury against the defendant in an unfair way. Showing the child in court might evoke emotions from the jury, such as sympathy for the child or the mother, which could affect their judgment on the paternity issue. So, there is a valid concern here about potential prejudice.\n\nOption C mentions permitting the child to be exhibited under the hearsay exception of pedigree. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The pedigree exception allows certain statements about family relationships to be admitted without being considered hearsay. However, exhibiting the child herself isn't a statement; it's a physical presentation. So, I'm not sure if this exception applies here.\n\nOption D says not to permit the child to be exhibited because it would be self-serving to the complainant. Self-serving evidence is evidence that supports the position of the party presenting it, but it might not be reliable or relevant. In this case, showing facial resemblances could be seen as supporting the mother's claim, but it's not clear if this is a reliable indicator of paternity.\n\nNow, considering the legal principles, paternity is typically determined through DNA testing, which is scientific and more reliable than visual comparisons. Facial resemblances can be subjective and may not accurately indicate biological relationships. Therefore, allowing such an exhibition might not be the best approach for determining paternity.\n\nAdditionally, bringing a young child into the courtroom could be traumatic or at least uncomfortable for the child. Courts generally try to minimize the impact on children, especially in sensitive cases like paternity trials.\n\nMoreover, the defendant's right to a fair trial must be considered. If exhibiting the child could unduly prejudice the jury against the defendant, it might violate that right.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's attorney is trying to make a point about resemblances, which they believe support their case. However, as I mentioned, this is not a reliable method for determining paternity.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most appropriate action for the trial judge would be to not permit the child to be exhibited, primarily because it could be highly prejudicial to the defendant, as stated in option B.\n\nOption A is less suitable because exhibiting a child for visual comparison isn't a standard form of demonstrative evidence, and it could be invasive for the child.\n\nOption C doesn't seem applicable because the pedigree exception relates to hearsay statements, not to the physical exhibition of a person.\n\nOption D might have some merit, but the term \"self-serving\" might not capture the full concern here, which is more about potential prejudice and the appropriateness of the method.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: not permit the child to be exhibited, because such an exhibition would be highly prejudicial to the defendant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
