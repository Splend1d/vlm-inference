A female customer purchased a hybrid model during the promotion period, followed all the rules, and recorded only 42 mpg in the first 60 days.

Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\nB. No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.\nC.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, there's this auto retailer that ran a marketing promotion for a new hybrid model sedan in 2013. They promised that if anyone bought the car during that year and didn't achieve at least 50 miles per gallon average gas mileage in the first 60 days, the company would pay them $10,000. There were record-keeping and inspection procedures to ensure accuracy.\n\nA female customer bought the car during the promotion period, followed all the rules, but only managed to get 42 mpg in the first 60 days. She asked for the rebate, but the company dragged their feet and eventually stopped responding. Now, the question is whether she has a contractual right to collect the $10,000.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because this is a classic bilateral contract, making it necessary that the company live up to its set of promises made to her.\n\nB. No, this was merely puffing, was not an offer to contract with any particular person and was without consideration.\n\nC. Yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\n\nD. No, because she did not formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before she started performing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what type of contract this is. A bilateral contract is where both parties promise to do something. For example, I promise to pay you money, and you promise to deliver a product. In this case, the company promised to pay $10,000 if the customer didn't meet the mileage, and the customer agreed to buy the car and follow the rules. So, it seems like a bilateral contract.\n\nOption A suggests it's a classic bilateral contract, and therefore the company should honor its promises. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B says it's merely puffing and not a real offer. Puffing is when sellers make exaggerated claims to sell a product, but they're not meant to be taken literally. However, in this case, the company made a specific promise: if you don't get 50 mpg, you get $10,000. That sounds like a concrete offer, not just puffing. So, option B might not be correct.\n\nOption C proposes it's a unilateral contract, where the acceptance is through performance rather than a promise. In unilateral contracts, one party makes an offer that can be accepted only by performing the requested act. For example, \"I'll pay you $100 if you mow my lawn.\" The acceptance is by mowing the lawn, not by promising to mow it.\n\nIn this scenario, the company made an offer: buy this car, follow the rules, and if you don't get 50 mpg, you get $10,000. The customer accepted by buying the car and following the rules. So, it could be seen as a unilateral contract where the performance is buying the car and driving it under the specified conditions.\n\nOption D says no, because she didn't formally notify the company that she was accepting the offer before starting to perform. But in unilateral contracts, acceptance is through performance, not through notification. So, this might not be applicable.\n\nLet me think about this again. In a unilateral contract, the offer is accepted by completing the act specified in the offer. Here, the act is buying the car and driving it under the specified conditions. The customer did that, so she has accepted the offer by performing the required act.\n\nMoreover, there were record-keeping and inspection procedures to ensure accurate reporting, which suggests that the company expected customers to follow through with the performance and to verify their claims.\n\nSo, based on this, option C seems correct: it's a unilateral contract, and the customer's performance constituted acceptance.\n\nOption A, about it being a bilateral contract, could also make sense because both parties are making promises. The company promises to pay $10,000 if the condition isn't met, and the customer promises to buy the car and follow the rules.\n\nHowever, in unilateral contracts, the acceptance is through action, not through a promise. So, perhaps option C is more accurate.\n\nOption B is likely incorrect because the company's promise seems concrete and specific, not just puffing.\n\nOption D doesn't hold because, in unilateral contracts, notification isn't required; the performance itself is the acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably C: yes, this was a unilateral contract in which the offeree acted upon the offer by performing the terms of the offer, thus creating a binding contract.\n\nThis means the customer has a contractual right to collect the $10,000 since she met the conditions specified in the offer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
