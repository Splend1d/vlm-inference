Now, the Romans had their own version of the Greek pantheon, and they basically took the Greek gods and gave them Roman names and slightly different characteristics.\n\nSo, let's see. Option A is Jupiter. I recall that Jupiter is the Roman king of the gods, and he's associated with lightning and thunder, just like Zeus. In fact, his name comes from \"Jovis,\" which is related to the Latin word for sky or heaven. So, that sounds a lot like Zeus.\n\nOption B is Juno. Now, Juno is the Roman goddess who is equivalent to Hera in Greek mythology. She's the queen of the gods and the wife of Jupiter. So, not Zeus.\n\nOption C is Dionysius. Hmm, I think Dionysus is the Greek god of wine and partying, and his Roman counterpart is Bacchus. So, that doesn't match Zeus.\n\nOption D is Neptune. Neptune is the Roman god of the sea, equivalent to Poseidon in Greek mythology. He's the one who controls the oceans and horses.\n\nSo, going back to option A, Jupiter seems to be the Roman counterpart to Zeus. Let me just double-check. Zeus is the chief deity in Greek religion, ruling over the sky and thunder, and Jupiter holds a similar position in Roman religion.\n\nI don't think there's any confusion here. So, the answer should be A. Jupiter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
