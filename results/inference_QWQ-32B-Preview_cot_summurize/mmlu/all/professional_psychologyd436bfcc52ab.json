This style is appropriate when subordinates are highly mature, meaning they have the necessary skills, experience, and motivation to perform their tasks effectively with minimal guidance.\n\nIn the delegating style, leaders provide minimal direction and support, allowing subordinates to take responsibility and make decisions on their own. This approach fosters autonomy and empowerment among subordinates, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and performance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. low task orientation and low relationship orientation\n"
