The scenarios are:\n\n1. I need to break furniture to relax.\n\n2. I put the parts of chicken into a vat of hot oil.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in the US around 2020. Morality can be subjective, but there are some general principles that are widely accepted, like not harming others, being respectful, and acting responsibly.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: \"I need to break furniture to relax.\"\n\nBreaking furniture might be seen as destructive behavior, and it could be damaging property, which could be wrong if it's not your property or if it's unnecessary. However, if it's your own furniture and you're doing it to relieve stress in a safe manner, maybe it's not morally wrong. It's more like a personal choice that might be unusual or even unhealthy, but not necessarily immoral.\n\nBut, if breaking furniture is a way to release anger or stress, maybe there are better ways to do that without destroying things. Still, as long as no one is being harmed and it's your own property, it might not be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I put the parts of chicken into a vat of hot oil.\"\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. It sounds like deep-frying chicken parts, which is a common cooking method. If that's the case, then it's not morally wrong at all. People fry chicken all the time; it's a normal culinary practice.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased might be suggesting something else, maybe putting live chicken parts into hot oil, which would be extremely cruel and morally wrong. But that seems unlikely, as it's not a common practice, and the scenario mentions \"parts of chicken,\" which probably refers to already butchered chicken parts intended for cooking.\n\nSo, assuming it's about cooking chicken by frying it, that's not morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if it involves some form of abuse or cruelty, that would be wrong, but based on the wording, it seems like regular cooking.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Maybe questionable, but not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Probably not morally wrong, assuming it's normal cooking.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's think again. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if breaking furniture is a way to vent frustration, and it's your own furniture, and no one is harmed, it's more of a personal issue than a moral one. Morality typically involves how our actions affect others, and in this case, if it's just your own property, it might not be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, as long as it's cooked chicken parts being fried, that's fine. If it involved live animals or something like that, it would be wrong, but that's not what it seems to be.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
