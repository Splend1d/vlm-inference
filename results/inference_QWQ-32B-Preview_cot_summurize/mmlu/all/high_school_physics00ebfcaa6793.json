                    "text": "To determine the position of stable equilibrium for a particle subjected to a conservative force with a given potential energy function, we need to analyze the function U(x) = (x \u2013 2)^3 \u2013 12x.\n\nFirst, recall that points of equilibrium occur where the first derivative of the potential energy with respect to position is zero. That is, where dU/dx = 0. Additionally, for the equilibrium to be stable, the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to position must be positive at that point, meaning d\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 > 0.\n\nLet's start by finding the first derivative of U(x):\n\nU(x) = (x \u2013 2)^3 \u2013 12x\n\nLet\u2019s compute dU/dx:\n\ndU/dx = d/dx [(x \u2013 2)^3] \u2013 d/dx [12x]\n\nUsing the chain rule for the first term:\n\nd/dx [(x \u2013 2)^3] = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 * d/dx [x \u2013 2] = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 * 1 = 3(x \u2013 2)^2\n\nAnd the derivative of 12x is 12.\n\nSo, dU/dx = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12\n\nSet this equal to zero to find equilibrium positions:\n\n3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12 = 0\n\nAdd 12 to both sides:\n\n3(x \u2013 2)^2 = 12\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n(x \u2013 2)^2 = 4\n\nTake square roots of both sides:\n\nx \u2013 2 = \u00b12\n\nSo, x = 2 + 2 = 4 or x = 2 \u2013 2 = 0\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium positions are at x = 4 and x = 0.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these is a position of stable equilibrium by checking the second derivative d\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 at these points.\n\nCompute the second derivative of U(x):\n\ndU/dx = 3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12\n\nDifferentiate again with respect to x:\n\nd\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 = d/dx [3(x \u2013 2)^2 \u2013 12] = 3 * 2(x \u2013 2) * d/dx [x \u2013 2] = 6(x \u2013 2) * 1 = 6(x \u2013 2)\n\nNow, evaluate d\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 at the equilibrium positions:\n\n1. At x = 4:\n\nd\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 = 6(4 \u2013 2) = 6*2 = 12 > 0\n\nSince d\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 > 0, this is a position of stable equilibrium.\n\n2. At x = 0:\n\nd\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 = 6(0 \u2013 2) = 6*(-2) = -12 < 0\n\nSince d\u00b2U/dx\u00b2 < 0, this is a position of unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the position of stable equilibrium is at x = 4.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. x = \u20134\n\nB. x = \u20132\n\nC. x = 0\n\nD. x = 4\n\nThe correct answer is D. x = 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
