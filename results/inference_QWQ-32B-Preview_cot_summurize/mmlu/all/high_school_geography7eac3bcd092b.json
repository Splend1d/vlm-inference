And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, let's understand what migration means. Migration generally refers to the movement of people from one place to another, often across national borders, to settle in a new location, especially for a significant period or permanently.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. They are crossing another country's borders.\n\nB. They are not taking anything with them.\n\nC. They are moving permanently.\n\nD. They will be gone more than one year.\n\nLet's evaluate each one.\n\nOption A: Crossing another country's borders. Well, if they're moving from their current country to Scotland, which is another country, then yes, they are crossing international borders. But is this the defining characteristic of their move being a migration?\n\nOption B: Not taking anything with them. This seems unlikely. People usually take some belongings when they move, especially if it's a permanent move. But perhaps in this scenario, they're leaving everything behind. However, whether they take things or not doesn't seem directly related to what makes their move a migration.\n\nOption C: Moving permanently. This aligns closely with the definition of migration, which often involves settling in a new location on a permanent basis.\n\nOption D: Being gone more than one year. This could refer to a long-term stay, but it's not necessarily permanent. migrations are typically considered permanent or at least of an extended duration.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C, \"They are moving permanently,\" seems to be the most accurate answer. Migration is often defined by the intention to settle in a new location indefinitely, which matches their plan to renovate and live in the family castle.\n\nHowever, to ensure completeness, let's think about whether other options could also be correct.\n\nOption A is relevant because crossing international borders is a common aspect of migration. But in some cases, migration can occur within the same country, like moving from one city to another for better opportunities. So, while crossing borders is often involved, it's not the sole defining factor.\n\nOption B seems irrelevant to the definition of migration. People can migrate while taking their belongings or leaving them behind, but the act of moving to a new place with the intent to stay is what constitutes migration.\n\nOption D, being gone more than one year, might indicate a long-term move, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's permanent. People might go abroad for work or study for several years but still intend to return home eventually. This would be more akin to expatriation or long-term residence rather than migration.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: They are moving permanently. This captures the essence of migration as a move with the intention to settle in a new location on a permanent basis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
