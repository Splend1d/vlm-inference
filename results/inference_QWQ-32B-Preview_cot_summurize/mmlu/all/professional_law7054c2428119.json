The parties agreed that the employment would be on an at-will basis. At the end of her first week of work, the employee was given a booklet entitled \"Employment Manual,\" with instructions to read the book in its entirety by the end of the following week. That evening, the employee began reading the manual. The first few pages described the history of the company and provided a personal biography of its president. On page 20, the manual stated that the company treats its employees \"as family\" and that employees will be discharged \"only with good cause. \" The employee finished reading the manual as requested. The employee interpreted the statement on page 20 as insuring continued employment unless good cause existed for termination. Over the next two months, the employee continually complained to her supervisor that the lighting in the accounting department was insufficient. Finally the supervisor, fed up with the complaints, fired the employee. The employee then sued the company, seeking to recover on grounds of promissory estoppel. Which of the following facts, if true and provable, would be most helpful for the employee's cause of action?\n\nA. At the time when the company hired the employee, the company subjectively intended that the employee be given job security.\nB. The employee interpreted the clause in the manual stating that company employees would be treated \"as family\" to mean that she would have job security and could only be fired for good cause.\nC. Just prior to receiving the manual, the employee seriously considered quitting, but continued to work for the company in reliance on the provisions contained on page 20 of the manual.\nD. The employee's complaints regarding the insufficient lighting were factually true and justifIable.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which fact would most help the employee's case for promissory estoppel. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the employee was hired on an at-will basis, which generally means either the employer or the employee can terminate the employment at any time, without cause. But then the company gave her an employment manual that said employees would be treated \"as family\" and discharged \"only for good cause.\" The employee took this to mean she had job security unless there was good cause to fire her.\n\nAfter two months, she was fired for complaining about lighting, which she thought was a valid concern. She's now suing for promissory estoppel. So, promissory estoppel is a legal concept that prevents someone from going back on a promise when the other party has relied on that promise to their detriment.\n\nIn this case, the employee is arguing that the company made a promise implied by the manual\u2014that she wouldn't be fired without good cause\u2014and she relied on that promise by continuing to work there.\n\nNow, I need to look at the options and see which one would most strengthen her case.\n\nOption A says that at the time of hiring, the company subjectively intended to give the employee job security. That might sound helpful, but promissory estoppel isn't just about the company's intentions; it's about whether the employee reasonably relied on a promise. So, while it might be relevant, it's not the strongest factor.\n\nOption B says the employee interpreted the \"as family\" clause to mean job security with termination only for good cause. Well, that's basically what she's already claiming. So, if anything, it reinforces her position, but it's more about her interpretation than a new fact that strengthens her case.\n\nOption C says that just before receiving the manual, she considered quitting but decided to stay in reliance on the provisions on page 20. This seems really significant because it directly ties her actions (continuing to work) to her reliance on the promise in the manual. That's a key element of promissory estoppel\u2014reliance to one's detriment.\n\nOption D says her complaints about lighting were factually true and justifiable. While that might make her seem like a good employee, it doesn't directly relate to the promissory estoppel claim. It might be relevant to whether there was good cause for termination, but that's not the focus here.\n\nComparing these, option C seems to be the most directly helpful to the employee's case because it shows that she relied on the promise in the manual to her detriment (i.e., she didn't quit when she was considering it). This reliance is a crucial element of promissory estoppel.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
