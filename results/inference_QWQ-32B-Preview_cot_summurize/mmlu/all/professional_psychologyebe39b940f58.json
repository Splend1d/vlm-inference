He developed a model that helps understand how people's roles and identities change over their lifetime.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Life career rainbow\n\nB. Life staircase\n\nC. Mandala\n\nD. Octagon\n\nI think the correct answer is A, the life career rainbow. I remember that in Super's model, different colors represent different life roles, and the rainbow illustrates how these roles evolve and interact over time.\n\nLet me think about this. The life career rainbow is a model that Super introduced to depict the various roles people undertake throughout their lives, not just their work or career roles, but also roles like student, worker, leisure person, citizen, partner, parent, and so on. Each role is represented by a different color, and the layers of the rainbow show how these roles stack up and change in importance at different life stages.\n\nOption B, life staircase, sounds like it might be related to career progression, maybe like moving up levels in a career, but I don't recall that being Super's model.\n\nC. Mandala \u2013 that sounds more like a concept from Eastern religions or psychology, perhaps related to self-realization or wholeness, but not specifically Super's work.\n\nD. Octagon \u2013 that sounds more like a geometric shape and doesn't seem directly related to Super's theories.\n\nSo, based on what I know, A. life career rainbow seems to be the correct answer. It's a model that Super developed to illustrate the multiple roles people have in their lives and how these roles change over time.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Let me recall some key points about Super's theory. He proposed that career development is a lifelong process and that individuals move through different stages with varying roles and identities. The life career rainbow is a visual representation of this idea, showing the complexity of life roles and how they intersect and change.\n\nI think that's solid. I'm fairly confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
