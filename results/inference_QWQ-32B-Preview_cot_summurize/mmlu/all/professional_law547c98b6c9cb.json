                    "text": "So here's this scenario: two friends are scuba diving and they see what they think is a large fin from a tuna, but it's actually another diver. Both of them shoot their spear guns at the same time, and one of them hits the diver, causing some injury. Now, the injured diver is suing both friends for damages, and we need to figure out what the judge should tell the jury to do in this case.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. In favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.\n\nB. Against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\n\nC. Against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.\n\nD. Against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the legal principles behind this. It seems like a case involving joint tortfeasors or something similar, where two people act together and cause harm.\n\nIn law, when two or more people participate in an activity that causes harm, they can both be held liable for the damages, even if only one of them actually caused the harm. This is sometimes called joint and several liability.\n\nLet me think about option A. If no evidence is presented showing who actually caused the injury, should the judge rule in favor of both defendants? That doesn't seem right because it was their actions that led to the injury. It's like saying, \"Well, since we don't know who did it, neither of them is responsible.\" That doesn't make much sense, especially when both participated in the risky behavior.\n\nOption B says that the jury should rule against both defendants jointly unless one of them can prove that he didn't shoot the spear that struck the victim. This sounds more plausible. It places the burden on the defendants to show that they weren't the ones who caused the harm. Since both acted together, they are both responsible unless one can exonerate themselves.\n\nOption C suggests that each defendant should be liable for half the damages because they acted independently. But in this case, they both shot their spear guns at the same time, aiming at the same thing. So, their actions were concurrent and directed towards the same object. It's not entirely clear that they acted independently; it seems more like they acted in concert, even if not explicitly planning together.\n\nOption D is similar to C but emphasizes that they shot simultaneously. Again, the issue is that their actions were concurrent and aimed at the same target.\n\nLet me consider the concept of concurrent causes. In tort law, when two or more parties act negligently and their actions combine to cause harm, they can both be held liable. If it's impossible to determine which one actually caused the harm, the law often imposes joint and several liability.\n\nIn this scenario, since both friends shot their spear guns at the same time at the same target, and only one spear hit the diver, it's impossible to know which one caused the injury. Therefore, it's reasonable to hold both liable jointly, unless one can prove that they didn't shoot the harmful spear.\n\nLooking back at option B, it aligns with this principle. It holds both defendants jointly liable unless one can prove that they didn't cause the harm. This seems fair because both engaged in the risky behavior and contributed to the possibility of harm occurring.\n\nOption A is too lenient; it would let both off the hook even though their actions led to the injury.\n\nOption C and D propose splitting the liability equally, but this might not account for the fact that only one spear actually caused the harm. It's possible that one of them is entirely innocent in causing the harm, but in practice, without knowing who did it, both are held responsible.\n\nHowever, in legal terms, when it's uncertain which of the defendants caused the harm, but their actions together created the risk, they can both be held jointly liable. This is to ensure that the injured party is compensated, and it encourages parties to be careful when engaging in risky activities.\n\nTherefore, the judge should instruct the jury to rule against both defendants jointly unless one of them can prove that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
