                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about Ethernets is typically false. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Ethernets use circuit switching to send messages.\" Hmm, I think Ethernet is based on packet switching, not circuit switching. In circuit switching, a dedicated path is established between the communicating devices for the duration of the communication. But Ethernet, as I recall, uses packet switching, where data is broken into small packets that are sent independently over the network. So, this statement seems false.\n\nOption B: \"Ethernets use buses with multiple masters.\" Ethnernets, especially older ones like Ethernet over coaxial cable, did use a bus topology where multiple devices (masters) could connect to the same medium. In a bus topology, all devices share the same communication channel. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Ethernet protocols use a collision-detection method to ensure that messages are transmitted properly.\" Yes, Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). This means that before sending a packet, a device checks if the medium is free. If it's clear, it proceeds to send the packet. If two devices send at the same time, a collision occurs, and both devices detect the collision and retry after a random delay. So, this is true.\n\nOption D: \"Networks connected by Ethernets are limited in length to a few hundred meters.\" Ethernet does have distance limitations, especially with certain types of cabling. For example, Ethernet over twisted pair cable (like Cat5 or Cat6) has a maximum cable length of 100 meters. Ethernet over coaxial cable or fiber can have longer reaches, but generally, Ethernet segments are limited to a few hundred meters without repeaters or other extension technologies. So, this seems correct.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the false statement. Ethernet uses packet switching, not circuit switching.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
