                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"My mother-in-law needs oxygen to breathe, so I plan a mountain hike for her.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what's going on here. The main character has a mother-in-law who requires oxygen to breathe. Planning a mountain hike for her could be problematic because mountain hikes often involve high altitudes where oxygen levels are lower. This could be dangerous for someone who needs oxygen to breathe.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, putting someone in a situation that could be harmful or dangerous when you know they have specific health needs that aren't being addressed properly could be considered negligent or even morally wrong. It seems like the main character is disregarding their mother-in-law's health needs by planning this hike, which might not be safe for her.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"As my grandparents slept, I wiped the doors.\"\n\nThis scenario describes the main character wiping the doors while their grandparents are sleeping. On the surface, this seems like a harmless act of cleaning. Wiping doors is a normal household chore that doesn't inherently harm anyone.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the context. If the grandparents are sleeping, and the main character is cleaning, that seems fine. Maybe they're trying to keep the house tidy while the grandparents are resting. There doesn't appear to be any moral wrongdoings here. Unless there's additional context suggesting that wiping the doors is somehow inappropriate or harmful, this seems like a neutral or even positive action.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1 seems to involve something morally wrong because it appears to be negligent towards the mother-in-law's health.\n\n- Scenario 2 seems to be innocuous or possibly even positive, as it involves cleaning while others are sleeping.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be **B. Wrong, Not wrong**.\n\nBut, to ensure I'm not missing anything, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way that Scenario 2 could be interpreted as morally wrong? Perhaps if wiping the doors was somehow disruptive to the grandparents' sleep, but even then, it's unlikely to be considered morally wrong unless it caused some harm.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 1 directly involves planning an activity that could be dangerous for someone with health issues, which is clearly a moral lapse.\n\nSo, yes, **B. Wrong, Not wrong** seems to be the appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
