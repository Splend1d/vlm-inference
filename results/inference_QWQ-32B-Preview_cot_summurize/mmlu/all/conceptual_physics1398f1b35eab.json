                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this problem about free fall and why both a heavy rock and a light rock have the same acceleration. The question is: \"A heavy rock and a light rock in free fall (zero air resistance) have the same acceleration. The heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration because the...\" and then it gives four options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about free fall. In free fall, objects are only\u53d7\u91cd\u529b\u4f5c\u7528, and if there's no air resistance, all objects should fall with the same acceleration, regardless of their mass. This is a fundamental principle in physics, often demonstrated by Galileo's experiment on the Leaning Tower of Pisa, where he dropped two balls of different masses and they hit the ground at the same time.\n\nSo, the fact that both rocks have the same acceleration makes sense, but the question is asking why the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration. Intuitively, one might think that a heavier object would fall faster because it's heavier, but that's not the case in the absence of air resistance.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"the force due to gravity is the same on each.\" Hmm, is that true? Actually, no. The force due to gravity depends on the mass of the object. The formula is F = m * g, where m is the mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. So, a heavier rock has a greater gravitational force acting on it compared to a lighter rock. Therefore, this option seems incorrect because it's not true that the force due to gravity is the same on each.\n\nOption B says: \"air resistance is always zero in free fall.\" Well, the problem already states that it's free fall with zero air resistance, so this is just restating the given condition. It doesn't explain why the heavy rock doesn't have a greater acceleration. So, this doesn't seem to be the right answer.\n\nOption C says: \"the inertia of both rocks is the same.\" Inertia is related to mass; the more massive an object, the more inertia it has. So, if one rock is heavier, it has more inertia. Therefore, this statement is false because their inertias are not the same; the heavier rock has more inertia.\n\nOption D says: \"the ratio of force to mass is the same.\" Let's think about this. The acceleration of an object is given by Newton's second law: a = F / m. For free-falling objects, F is the gravitational force, which is m * g. So, a = (m * g) / m = g. This means that the acceleration is the same for both rocks because the mass cancels out, and they both experience the same acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer. The ratio of force to mass is the same for both rocks, which is why they have the same acceleration.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what would happen if air resistance were present. In that case, lighter objects might accelerate differently than heavier objects because air resistance affects them differently based on their mass and surface area. But since the problem specifies zero air resistance, we don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlso, I recall that in a vacuum, all objects fall with the same acceleration regardless of their mass, which is consistent with what option D suggests.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: the ratio of force to mass is the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
