It's all about people reaching their full potential and stuff like that.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nB is behavioral. I know that behavioral psychology is more about how we learn from our environment, like through reinforcement and punishment. It's not really about self-esteem or potential.\n\nC is cognitive. That's about how we think and process information. While it might touch on some aspects of self-esteem, it's more focused on mental processes and problem-solving.\n\nD is psychodynamic. That's Freud's theory, right? It's more about unconscious thoughts and childhood experiences shaping who we are. Not really about self-esteem or actualizing potential in the way humanistic psychology is.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's A, humanistic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
