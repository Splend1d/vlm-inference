                    "text": "To determine which ion cannot be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor, we need to understand the basics of semiconductor doping.\n\nGermanium is a group 14 element, similar to silicon, and has four valence electrons. In pure germanium, all valence electrons are involved in covalent bonds, making it an intrinsic semiconductor with few free charge carriers.\n\nDoping involves introducing impurity atoms into the semiconductor lattice to increase the number of charge carriers. For n-type semiconductors, we need to add impurities that have more valence electrons than germanium, typically from group 15 (nitrogen family), which have five valence electrons. These extra electrons are not involved in covalent bonding and become free electrons in the conduction band, enhancing the conductivity.\n\nConversely, for p-type semiconductors, we add impurities with fewer valence electrons, typically from group 13 (boron family), which have three valence electrons. This creates holes in the valence band, which can accept electrons and increase conductivity.\n\nGiven this background, let's examine each option:\n\nA. As (Arsenic): Arsenic is a group 15 element with five valence electrons. It can donate an extra electron to the conduction band, making it suitable for n-type doping in germanium.\n\nB. P (Phosphorus): Phosphorus is also a group 15 element with five valence electrons. Like arsenic, it can provide an extra electron for conduction, making it appropriate for n-type doping.\n\nC. Sb (Antimony): Antimony is another group 15 element with five valence electrons. It too can contribute an extra electron, making it suitable for n-type doping in germanium.\n\nD. B (Boron): Boron is a group 13 element with three valence electrons. It is typically used for p-type doping because it creates holes in the valence band, not for n-type doping.\n\nTherefore, the ion that cannot be used as a dopant in germanium to make an n-type semiconductor is boron (B).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
