I need to figure out which one influenced the Maya in these areas.\n\nFirst, I know that the Maya are an ancient civilization from Mesoamerica, which is in the Americas. So, their neighbors would be other Mesoamerican cultures. The Olmec, for example, are often considered one of the earliest complex societies in Mesoamerica, and they had significant influence on later cultures like the Maya.\n\nOn the other hand, Mesopotamians are from the Middle East, specifically around modern-day Iraq, and they developed one of the earliest writing systems, cuneiform. The Chinese are from East Asia and have their own unique writing system. The Chavin culture was in South America, in the Andes region.\n\nGiven that the Maya are in Mesoamerica, it's more likely that their writing and mathematics were influenced by other Mesoamerican cultures rather than distant civilizations like the Mesopotamians, Chinese, or Chavin. So, the Olmec seem like the most plausible option.\n\nMoreover, I recall that the Olmec had a writing system and a calendar, which could have been passed down to the Maya. The Maya are famous for their intricate writing system and advanced mathematics, including the concept of zero, which was also used by the Olmec.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about the time periods. The Olmec flourished from around 1200 BCE to about 400 BCE, while the Maya civilization rose around 2000 BCE and had its classic period from 250 CE to 900 CE. So, there was overlap and possibility for cultural exchange.\n\nAlso, the Olmec are often referred to as the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica because many later civilizations, including the Maya, adopted and built upon Olmec traditions in art, religion, and culture.\n\nIn contrast, the Chavin culture was in South America, which is separated from Mesoamerica by thousands of miles, making direct influence less likely. While there might have been some cultural exchanges across the Americas, it's less probable that the Maya derived their writing and mathematics from the Chavin.\n\nSimilarly, the Mesopotamians and Chinese are even farther away, in different continents, and there's no known direct contact between these civilizations and the Maya in ancient times. So, it's unlikely that the Maya derived their writing and mathematics from them.\n\nTherefore, based on geographical proximity, temporal overlap, and cultural relationships, the most logical answer is that the Maya derived their writing and mathematics from the Olmec.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
