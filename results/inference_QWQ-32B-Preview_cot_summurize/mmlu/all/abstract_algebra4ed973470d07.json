                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false.\n\n**Statement 1:** \\( S_n \\) is non-abelian for all \\( n \\geq 3 \\).\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \\( S_n \\) represents. \\( S_n \\) is the symmetric group on \\( n \\) elements, which consists of all possible permutations of \\( n \\) elements. The group operation is the composition of permutations.\n\nNow, a group is abelian if the group operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) in the group, \\( a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a \\).\n\nSo, to check if \\( S_n \\) is non-abelian for \\( n \\geq 3 \\), I need to see if there exist at least two permutations in \\( S_n \\) that do not commute.\n\nLet's consider \\( n = 3 \\). In \\( S_3 \\), the permutations are:\n\n1. The identity permutation: \\( e \\)\n\n2. Transpositions: \\( (12), (13), (23) \\)\n\n3. 3-cycles: \\( (123), (132) \\)\n\nLet's take two permutations, say \\( (12) \\) and \\( (123) \\), and see if they commute.\n\nCompute \\( (12) \\cdot (123) \\):\n\n- Apply \\( (123) \\): 1 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 3, 3 \u2192 1\n\n- Then apply \\( (12) \\): 1 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 1, 3 \u2192 3\n\nSo, overall: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 3, 3 \u2192 1 \u2192 2\n\nThus, \\( (12) \\cdot (123) = (1)(23) = (23) \\)\n\nNow, compute \\( (123) \\cdot (12) \\):\n\n- Apply \\( (12) \\): 1 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 1, 3 \u2192 3\n\n- Then apply \\( (123) \\): 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 3 \u2192 1\n\nSo, overall: 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 3 \u2192 1\n\nThus, \\( (123) \\cdot (12) = (132) \\)\n\nSince \\( (12) \\cdot (123) = (23) \\) and \\( (123) \\cdot (12) = (132) \\), and \\( (23) \\neq (132) \\), the permutations do not commute.\n\nTherefore, \\( S_3 \\) is non-abelian.\n\nSimilarly, for \\( n > 3 \\), \\( S_n \\) contains \\( S_3 \\) as a subgroup, and since \\( S_3 \\) is non-abelian, \\( S_n \\) cannot be abelian.\n\nHence, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( a \\) is a permutation that is an \\( m \\)-cycle and \\( b \\) is a permutation that is an \\( n \\)-cycle, then \\( |ab| = \\text{lcm}(m,n) \\).\n\nThis statement is about the order of the product of two cycles in a symmetric group.\n\nFirst, recall that the order of a permutation is the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that \\( a^k = e \\), where \\( e \\) is the identity permutation.\n\nAlso, the least common multiple (lcm) of two integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both \\( m \\) and \\( n \\).\n\nNow, the statement claims that the order of the product \\( ab \\) is equal to the lcm of the lengths of the cycles \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nHowever, this is not always true. The order of \\( ab \\) depends not only on the lengths of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) but also on whether \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) commute and on their disjointness.\n\nIf \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are disjoint cycles, then they commute, and the order of \\( ab \\) is indeed the lcm of their lengths. This is because disjoint cycles act independently on different elements.\n\nFor example, let \\( a = (123) \\) and \\( b = (45) \\). These are disjoint cycles with lengths 3 and 2, respectively.\n\nThen, \\( ab = (123)(45) \\), and the order of \\( ab \\) is \\( \\text{lcm}(3,2) = 6 \\).\n\nIndeed, \\( (123)(45) \\) has order 6 because it takes 6 applications to return all elements to their original positions.\n\nHowever, if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are not disjoint, then their product \\( ab \\) does not necessarily have order equal to the lcm of their lengths.\n\nFor example, consider \\( a = (123) \\) and \\( b = (234) \\), which are not disjoint since they both move the elements 2 and 3.\n\nCompute \\( ab = (123)(234) \\):\n\nFirst, apply \\( (234) \\): 2 \u2192 3, 3 \u2192 4, 4 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 1\n\nThen apply \\( (123) \\): 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4, 3 \u2192 4 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 2 \u2192 3\n\nSo, overall: 1 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 4, 3 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 3\n\nThus, \\( ab = (1324) \\), which is a 4-cycle.\n\nThe order of a 4-cycle is 4, but \\( \\text{lcm}(3,3) = 3 \\), which is not equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, in this case, \\( |ab| \\neq \\text{lcm}(m,n) \\).\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n\nC.
