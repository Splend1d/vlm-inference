                    "text": "Let's see. So, the owner has a property in fee simple absolute, which means he owns it completely with no restrictions. He deeds it to his friend for life, and then to the heirs of the owner after that. Now, under common law principles, the conveyance to the heirs isn't effective, so it results in a life estate to the friend and a reversion back to the owner.\n\nI need to figure out which common law doctrine causes this result. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The rule in Shelly's case\n\nB. The doctrine of concurrent ownership\n\nC. The doctrine of worthier title\n\nD. The rule against perpetuities\n\nFirst, what's the rule in Shelly's case? I think it has something to do with defeating a remainder in a line of succession. Wait, maybe it's about defeating a remainder when the preceding estate is to a person higher in the line of succession. Hmm, not sure.\n\nNext, the doctrine of concurrent ownership. That sounds like it's about multiple people owning property at the same time, like joint tenants or tenants in common. Doesn't seem related to this situation.\n\nThe doctrine of worthier title. I've heard of that. It's something that prevents a grantor from creating a future interest in his own heirs because it's considered uncertain or something like that. Maybe that's it.\n\nLastly, the rule against perpetuities. That's about limiting interests that go too far into the future, to ensure they don't last forever. But in this case, it's just a life estate followed by the heirs, which shouldn't violate that rule.\n\nLet me think again. The problem says that under common law principles, the conveyance to the heirs isn't effective, so it results in a life estate to the friend and a reversion back to the owner.\n\nI think the doctrine of worthier title is the one that's applicable here. It's a principle that says when a grantor tries to convey property to a grantee for life, and then to the grantor's heirs, the conveyance to the heirs is invalid because the heirs are not sufficiently certain or determinable at the time of the conveyance.\n\nSo, essentially, the doctrine of worthier title invalidates the remainder to the grantor's heirs, and instead, creates a reversion back to the grantor.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any other doctrine that could cause this result? The rule in Shelly's case is about defeating a remainder when the preceding estate is to a person higher in the line of succession, but in this case, the friend isn't necessarily higher in the line of succession; they're just a friend.\n\nConcurrent ownership doesn't seem relevant here because it's about multiple owners at the same time, not about the sequence of estates.\n\nThe rule against perpetuities could potentially affect future interests, but in this case, it's a life estate followed by the heirs, which should comply with the rule if the life estate is measured by the life of the friend.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. The doctrine of worthier title.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
