                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this concept from the doctrine of double effect. It's about what makes an action intrinsically permissible. The options are:\n\nA. The action is okay on its own, without looking at what happens because of it.\n\nB. The action is only okay because of what happens because of it.\n\nC. No one would ever think this action is okay.\n\nD. The action is good because it's connected to other things that are inherently good.\n\nI think the key here is understanding what \"intrinsically permissible\" means. Intrinsically means that the action is good in itself, not because of its outcomes. So, for an action to be intrinsically permissible, it should be morally okay just by what it is, not depending on what comes out of it.\n\nOption A says that the action is morally permissible apart from its effects. That sounds like it's good in itself, regardless of what happens next. That seems to match the idea of intrinsic permissibility.\n\nOption B says the action is only okay because of its effects. That sounds more like consequentialism, where the ends justify the means. But intrinsic permissibility should be about the action itself, not its consequences.\n\nOption C says no actual person would endorse the action. That doesn't seem related to intrinsic permissibility. It's more about people's opinions than about the nature of the action itself.\n\nOption D says the action is valuable because of its relationship to other intrinsically valuable things. That sounds like it's deriving value from something else, not being valuable in itself.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is A. The action, apart from its effects, is morally permissible. That aligns with the idea that it's intrinsically permissible, meaning its permissibility comes from itself, not from what happens because of it.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about an example. Suppose someone tells the truth. Telling the truth is generally considered morally good in itself, regardless of the consequences. So, even if telling the truth leads to some negative outcome, the act of telling the truth is still intrinsically permissible because it's morally good on its own.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone tells a lie to protect someone's feelings, the lie itself might not be intrinsically permissible because lying is generally considered morally wrong. However, in this case, the positive effect (protecting feelings) might make the action acceptable under the doctrine of double effect, but that's a different scenario.\n\nSo, in summary, intrinsic permissibility seems to be about the action's moral status independent of its effects, which points to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
