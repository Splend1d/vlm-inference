                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking about. It's about binary liquid mixtures that obey Raoult's law. So, first things first, I need to recall what Raoult's law states.\n\nRaoult's law says that the partial vapor pressure of each component in a mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid phase. So, for a binary mixture, if we have components A and B, the partial pressure of A would be PA = PA* \u00d7 XA, where PA* is the vapor pressure of pure A, and XA is the mole fraction of A in the liquid mixture. Same goes for B.\n\nNow, the question lists three statements and asks which of them must be true about such a mixture.\n\nStatement I: \"The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture.\"\n\nWell, that sounds a lot like Raoult's law itself. So, if the mixture obeys Raoult's law, then this statement should definitely be true. So, I think I can tick this one as true.\n\nStatement II: \"The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing.\"\n\nHmm, this is about the volume behavior of the mixture. When two liquids are mixed, their volumes don't always add up perfectly. Sometimes there are volume changes due to molecular interactions. If the volume of the mixture equals the sum of the individual volumes, that would mean there's no volume change upon mixing, which is called ideal volume behavior.\n\nBut Raoult's law is about vapor pressures, not necessarily about volumes. So, I need to think if obeying Raoult's law implies anything about the volume behavior.\n\nI recall that ideal solutions obey Raoult's law, and in ideal solutions, there are no volume changes upon mixing. So, maybe statement II is also true for such mixtures.\n\nWait, but is Raoult's law only applicable to ideal solutions? I think not. Raoult's law can be applied to non-ideal solutions as well, but with some adjustments. However, if a mixture strictly obeys Raoult's law, does that imply it's an ideal solution?\n\nI think for a mixture to strictly obey Raoult's law, it should be an ideal solution, where there are no interactions between different molecules other than those present in the pure components. In that case, volume changes upon mixing would be zero, so statement II should be true as well.\n\nStatement III: \"Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components.\"\n\nThis seems related to the concept of ideal solutions as well. In ideal solutions, the intermolecular forces between A-A, B-B, and A-B molecules are the same, so there's no change in energy upon mixing.\n\nSo, if a mixture obeys Raoult's law, which is characteristic of ideal solutions, then the intermolecular interactions should be similar to those in the pure components.\n\nWait, but Raoult's law is specifically about vapor pressures, while this statement is about intermolecular interactions. Is there a direct link here?\n\nI think there is, because vapor pressure depends on the intermolecular forces at the liquid surface. If the interactions in the mixture are similar to those in the pure components, then the vapor pressure should behave as predicted by Raoult's law.\n\nSo, statement III also seems true for mixtures that obey Raoult's law.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that Raoult's law can sometimes be applied to non-ideal solutions if corrections are made. So, does obeying Raoult's law necessarily mean that the intermolecular interactions are identical to those in the pure components?\n\nMaybe not always, but for the sake of this question, if a mixture strictly obeys Raoult's law, it's reasonable to assume that it's an ideal solution with similar intermolecular interactions as the pure components.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, all three statements seem to be true for a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nStatement I is directly in line with Raoult's law.\n\nStatement II is about volume behavior, which for ideal solutions should hold true.\n\nStatement III is about intermolecular interactions, which again, for ideal solutions, are assumed to be similar to those in the pure components.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut wait, the options say:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. III only\n\nC. I and III only\n\nD. I, II, and III\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, D is the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I recall that sometimes in chemistry, especially in thermodynamics, assumptions can be nuanced. Maybe there's a catch here that I'm missing.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nRaoult's law: PA = PA* \u00d7 XA\n\nThis is for ideal solutions, where there are no volume changes upon mixing, and intermolecular interactions are similar to pure components.\n\nSo, if a mixture obeys Raoult's law, it's behaving ideally in terms of vapor pressure.\n\nBut does this necessarily mean that the volume is additive? In ideal solutions, yes, volume is additive.\n\nSimilarly, does it necessarily mean that intermolecular interactions are identical to those in pure components? Again, in ideal solutions, yes.\n\nTherefore, I think all three statements are true for such mixtures.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
