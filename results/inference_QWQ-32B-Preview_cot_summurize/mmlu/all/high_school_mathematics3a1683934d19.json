                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a 48-inch television, and the customer is unsure whether that measurement is the horizontal length or the diagonal of the screen. Given that the ratio of the length to the height is 5:3, I need to find out how much shorter the horizontal length would be if the 48 inches refers to the diagonal instead of the horizontal length. And I need to round to the nearest inch.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between measuring the screen along the horizontal length and measuring it along the diagonal. In TVs, especially older cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs, the screen size was often referred to as the diagonal length. However, with flat-screen TVs, it's more common to refer to the diagonal as well, but sometimes people might\u8bef think it's the width.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume that the advertised 48 inches could be either the horizontal length or the diagonal, and I need to find the difference in the horizontal length in these two scenarios.\n\nThe ratio of the length to the height is 5:3, which means for every 5 units of length, there are 3 units of height. This is important because it helps me find the actual dimensions once I know one of them.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\( l \\) as the horizontal length\n\n- \\( h \\) as the height\n\nGiven the ratio \\( l:h = 5:3 \\), I can express \\( l = 5k \\) and \\( h = 3k \\), where \\( k \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nNow, depending on whether the 48 inches is the horizontal length or the diagonal, I'll have different scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:** 48 inches is the horizontal length.\n\nSo, \\( l = 48 \\) inches.\n\nThen, \\( 5k = 48 \\), so \\( k = \\frac{48}{5} = 9.6 \\) inches.\n\nTherefore, the height \\( h = 3k = 3 \\times 9.6 = 28.8 \\) inches.\n\nNow, to find the diagonal \\( d \\) in this case, I can use the Pythagorean theorem, since the screen forms a rectangle:\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{l^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{48^2 + 28.8^2} = \\sqrt{2304 + 829.44} = \\sqrt{3133.44} \\approx 55.98 \\) inches.\n\nSo, if the horizontal length is 48 inches, the diagonal is approximately 56 inches.\n\n**Scenario 2:** 48 inches is the diagonal.\n\nSo, \\( d = 48 \\) inches.\n\nAgain, using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{l^2 + h^2} \\)\n\nBut since \\( l = 5k \\) and \\( h = 3k \\), substitute these in:\n\n\\( 48 = \\sqrt{(5k)^2 + (3k)^2} = \\sqrt{25k^2 + 9k^2} = \\sqrt{34k^2} = k\\sqrt{34} \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( k = \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{34}} \\)\n\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{34} \\approx 5.83095 \\), so \\( k \\approx \\frac{48}{5.83095} \\approx 8.232 \\) inches.\n\nNow, the horizontal length \\( l = 5k \\approx 5 \\times 8.232 \\approx 41.16 \\) inches.\n\nSimilarly, the height \\( h = 3k \\approx 3 \\times 8.232 \\approx 24.696 \\) inches.\n\nWait a minute, in scenario 1, when horizontal length is 48 inches, diagonal is approximately 56 inches.\n\nIn scenario 2, when diagonal is 48 inches, horizontal length is approximately 41.16 inches.\n\nThe question is asking for how much shorter the horizontal length would be in scenario 2 compared to scenario 1.\n\nSo, difference = 48 inches - 41.16 inches \u2248 6.84 inches.\n\nRounding to the nearest inch, that's 7 inches.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 7\n\nC. 8\n\nD. 9\n\nSo, the answer seems to be B. 7 inches.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, in scenario 1:\n\n\\( l = 48 \\) inches\n\n\\( h = 3k = 3 \\times \\frac{48}{5} = 28.8 \\) inches\n\n\\( d = \\sqrt{48^2 + 28.8^2} = \\sqrt{2304 + 829.44} = \\sqrt{3133.44} \\approx 55.98 \\) inches.\n\nIn scenario 2:\n\n\\( d = 48 \\) inches\n\n\\( k = \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{34}} \\approx \\frac{48}{5.83095} \\approx 8.232 \\) inches\n\n\\( l = 5k \\approx 5 \\times 8.232 \\approx 41.16 \\) inches\n\nDifference: 48 - 41.16 = 6.84 inches, which rounds to 7 inches.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to confirm this.\n\nAnother way is to consider the ratio of the sides.\n\nGiven the ratio 5:3, the sides are in the proportion 5:3:\u221a34 for a right-angled triangle.\n\nSo, if the diagonal is 48 inches, the horizontal length is \\( \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{34}} \\times 48 \\).\n\nSimilarly, if the horizontal length is 48 inches, the diagonal is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{34}}{5} \\times 48 \\).\n\nThen, the difference would be:\n\n\\( 48 - \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{34}} \\times 48 = 48 \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{34}}\\right) \\)\n\nCalculating \\( \\sqrt{34} \\approx 5.831 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 1 - \\frac{5}{5.831} \\approx 1 - 0.8575 \\approx 0.1425 \\)\n\nTherefore, \\( 48 \\times 0.1425 \\approx 6.84 \\) inches, which again rounds to 7 inches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 7 inches.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"
