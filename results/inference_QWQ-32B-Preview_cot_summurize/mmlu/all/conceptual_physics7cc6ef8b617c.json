                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking which of Newton's laws explains why the acceleration due to free fall is the same for all masses. The options are his first, second, third law, and then law of action-reaction, which I think is the same as the third law.\n\nSo, first, I need to recall Newton's laws of motion. The first law is about inertia, right? An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The second law is F=ma, force equals mass times acceleration. And the third law is about action and reaction: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nNow, the question is about free fall and acceleration being the same for all masses. I remember that in free fall, regardless of the mass of an object, they accelerate at the same rate in the absence of air resistance. That's why feathers and hammers fall at the same rate on the Moon, for example.\n\nSo, how does this relate to Newton's laws? Maybe it's about the force of gravity and how it affects different masses. Let me think about that.\n\nAccording to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity between two masses is given by F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance between their centers.\n\nIn the case of an object falling towards the Earth, m1 would be the mass of the object, and m2 would be the mass of the Earth. So, the force acting on the object is F = G * (m * M_earth) / r^2.\n\nNow, according to Newton's second law, F = m * a, where a is the acceleration. So, if F = G * (m * M_earth) / r^2, and F = m * a, then m * a = G * (m * M_earth) / r^2.\n\nI can solve for a: a = G * M_earth / r^2. Notice that the mass of the object, m, cancels out. So, the acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object. That's why all objects fall with the same acceleration in a vacuum.\n\nSo, it seems like Newton's second law is key here because it relates force, mass, and acceleration, and shows how the mass cancels out in the expression for acceleration due to gravity.\n\nBut wait, the question also mentions Newton's third law, which is about action and reaction. Is that relevant here? Well, in the context of gravity, the Earth exerts a force on the object, and the object exerts an equal and opposite force on the Earth. But in terms of acceleration, since the Earth's mass is so large compared to the object, its acceleration is negligible. But still, it's not directly explaining why all masses accelerate at the same rate.\n\nSo, I think the answer is Newton's second law, which is option B.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe it's a combination of laws. For example, perhaps the universal law of gravitation combined with the second law explains this phenomenon.\n\nWait, the universal law of gravitation is actually part of Newton's work, but it's not listed as one of the options here. The options are only the first, second, third law, and law of action-reaction, which is the third law.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is trying to test understanding of how Newton's second law relates to the acceleration due to gravity being independent of mass.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the equivalence principle, which states that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equivalent, but I don't think that's covered in Newton's laws.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with Newton's second law as the explanation for why acceleration due to free fall is the same for all masses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
