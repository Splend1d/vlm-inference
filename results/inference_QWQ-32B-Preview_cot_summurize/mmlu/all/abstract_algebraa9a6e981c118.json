                    "text": "So I have this problem: find all zeros in the finite field \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) of the polynomial \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 \\). The options are A) 1, B) 2, C) 2 and 3, D) 6. Okay, finite fields are a bit tricky for me, but let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) is. I think it's the integers modulo 7, which means the field consists of the elements {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, and all operations are done modulo 7. So, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are all modulo 7.\n\nThe problem is to find all the values of \\( x \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) that satisfy the equation \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 = 0 \\) modulo 7.\n\nSince \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) is a small field, with only 7 elements, maybe the best way is to plug in each value and see if it satisfies the equation. That seems straightforward, but perhaps there's a more efficient method. Anyway, let's try plugging in the values.\n\nStart with \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 0^3 + 2*0 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \\), which is not congruent to 0 modulo 7.\n\nNext, \\( x = 1 \\):\n\n\\( 1^3 + 2*1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \\), which is not 0 mod 7.\n\nOption A is 1, but 5 is not 0 mod 7, so 1 is not a root.\n\nNow, \\( x = 2 \\):\n\n\\( 2^3 + 2*2 + 2 = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \\), and 14 mod 7 is 0. So, 2 is a root. Option B is 2, and option C is 2 and 3, so maybe 3 is also a root.\n\nLet's check \\( x = 3 \\):\n\n\\( 3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35 \\), and 35 mod 7 is 0. So, 3 is also a root.\n\nOption C is 2 and 3, and option D is 6. Let's check \\( x = 6 \\):\n\n\\( 6^3 + 2*6 + 2 = 216 + 12 + 2 = 230 \\). Now, 230 mod 7... Let's see, 7*32 = 224, so 230 - 224 = 6, which is not 0 mod 7. So, 6 is not a root.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, both 2 and 3 are roots, and 6 is not. But option C says 2 and 3, and option D says 6. So, perhaps the answer is C) 2 and 3.\n\nBut the problem says \"all zeros\", so maybe there are more roots. Let's check the other values.\n\n\\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\( 4^3 + 2*4 + 2 = 64 + 8 + 2 = 74 \\). 74 mod 7: 7*10 = 70, 74 - 70 = 4, which is not 0.\n\n\\( x = 5 \\):\n\n\\( 5^3 + 2*5 + 2 = 125 + 10 + 2 = 137 \\). 137 mod 7: 7*19 = 133, 137 - 133 = 4, not 0.\n\nSo, only x=2 and x=3 are roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\).\n\nWait, but the polynomial is cubic, so it should have at most 3 roots. We've found two, and the others don't work. Maybe there are only two roots in this field.\n\nBut in some fields, polynomials can have fewer roots than their degree. Maybe that's the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check x=2 and x=3.\n\nFor x=2:\n\n\\( 2^3 = 8 \\), 2*2=4, plus 2 is 14, which is 0 mod 7. Correct.\n\nFor x=3:\n\n\\( 3^3 = 27 \\), 2*3=6, plus 2 is 35, which is 0 mod 7. Correct.\n\nFor x=6:\n\n\\( 6^3 = 216 \\), 2*6=12, plus 2 is 230. 230 - 224 = 6, which is not 0 mod 7. Correct.\n\nFor x=4:\n\n\\( 4^3 = 64 \\), 2*4=8, plus 2 is 74. 74 - 7*10 = 74 - 70 = 4, not 0.\n\nFor x=5:\n\n\\( 5^3 = 125 \\), 2*5=10, plus 2 is 137. 137 - 133 = 4, not 0.\n\nAnd x=0 and x=1 already checked.\n\nSo, only x=2 and x=3 are roots.\n\nBut the options are A)1, B)2, C)2 and 3, D)6.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C)2 and 3.\n\nBut the question says \"all zeros in the indicated finite field\", and according to my calculations, it's 2 and 3.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are multiple roots or something, but in a field, roots are distinct unless there are repeated roots, but for a cubic polynomial, that's possible.\n\nBut in this case, since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) is a field, and the polynomial is over this field, perhaps it doesn't have repeated roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the polynomial can be factored.\n\nLet me see: \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 \\). If x=2 is a root, then (x-2) is a factor.\n\nSimilarly, if x=3 is a root, then (x-3) is a factor.\n\nSo, perhaps the polynomial factors as (x-2)(x-3)(x - something else).\n\nLet me try to perform polynomial division or use expansion to see.\n\nFirst, (x-2)(x-3) = x^2 - 5x + 6.\n\nWait, but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), -5 is equivalent to 2, since -5 + 7 = 2.\n\nSo, (x-2)(x-3) = x^2 -5x +6 = x^2 + 2x +6 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\).\n\nNow, divide \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 \\) by x^2 + 2x +6.\n\nPerforming polynomial division:\n\nDivide x^3 by x^2 to get x.\n\nMultiply x^2 + 2x +6 by x: x^3 + 2x^2 +6x.\n\nSubtract this from x^3 + 0x^2 +2x +2:\n\n(x^3 + 0x^2 +2x +2) - (x^3 + 2x^2 +6x) = -2x^2 -4x +2.\n\nNow, divide -2x^2 by x^2 to get -2.\n\nMultiply x^2 + 2x +6 by -2: -2x^2 -4x -12.\n\nSubtract: (-2x^2 -4x +2) - (-2x^2 -4x -12) = 0 + 0 + 14.\n\n14 is 0 mod 7.\n\nSo, the polynomial factors as (x-2)(x-3)(x - something), but the remainder is 0, so it should be (x-2)(x-3)(x - a), but the remainder is 0, which suggests it factors completely.\n\nWait, but 14 is 0 mod 7, so the division is exact.\n\nTherefore, \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 = (x-2)(x-3)(x - a) \\), and the last root should satisfy a such that (x - a) is the last factor.\n\nFrom the division, the linear factor should be (x - a), where a is the third root.\n\nBut since the remainder is 0, and we have x^3 + 2x + 2 = (x-2)(x-3)(x - a), and the constant term should match.\n\nLet me expand (x-2)(x-3)(x - a):\n\nFirst, (x-2)(x-3) = x^2 -5x +6 = x^2 +2x +6 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\).\n\nNow, (x^2 +2x +6)(x - a) = x^3 + (2-a)x^2 + (6 -2a)x -6a.\n\nBut our original polynomial is x^3 + 0x^2 +2x +2.\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\n1. Coefficient of x^2: 2 - a \u2261 0 mod 7 \u21d2 a \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\n2. Coefficient of x: 6 -2a \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\nIf a \u2261 2, then 6 -4 = 2, which matches.\n\n3. Constant term: -6a \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\nIf a \u2261 2, then -12 \u2261 -12 +14 = 2 mod 7, which matches.\n\nSo, a \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\nWait, but if a \u2261 2, then the polynomial would be (x-2)^2 (x -2) = (x-2)^3, which would mean a triple root at x=2.\n\nBut earlier, both x=2 and x=3 seemed to be roots.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is only one root, x=2, with multiplicity 3.\n\nBut then, why did x=3 also satisfy the equation?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that x=3 is a root.\n\nLet me recheck x=3:\n\n\\( 3^3 + 2*3 + 2 = 27 + 6 + 2 = 35 \\), 35 mod 7 is 0.\n\nBut if the polynomial is (x-2)^3, then it should only have x=2 as a root.\n\nWait, perhaps I did the factorization wrong.\n\nLet me try to expand (x-2)^3:\n\n(x-2)^3 = x^3 -6x^2 +12x -8.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), -6 \u22611, 12\u22615, -8\u2261-8+14=6.\n\nSo, (x-2)^3 = x^3 +x^2 +5x +6.\n\nBut our polynomial is x^3 +0x^2 +2x +2.\n\nThese are not the same, so the polynomial is not (x-2)^3.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it factors differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use polynomial division to factor it properly.\n\nWe have \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 \\), and we know x=2 is a root, so (x-2) is a factor.\n\nLet me divide \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 \\) by (x-2).\n\nAs before, division gives:\n\n(x^3 + 0x^2 +2x +2) / (x-2) = x^2 +2x +6, with remainder 0.\n\nThen, \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 = (x-2)(x^2 +2x +6) \\).\n\nNow, check if \\( x^2 +2x +6 \\) has any roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\).\n\nTo find roots of \\( x^2 +2x +6 = 0 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), use the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 -4ac) ] / 2a.\n\nHere, a=1, b=2, c=6.\n\nDiscriminant d = b^2 -4ac = 4 -24 = -20 \u2261 -20 +21 =1 mod 7.\n\nSo, sqrt(1) = \u00b11 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\).\n\nThus, x = [ -2 \u00b11 ] / 2.\n\nSo, x = (-2 +1)/2 = (-1)/2 \u2261 6/2 \u2261 3 mod 7.\n\nAnd x = (-2 -1)/2 = (-3)/2 \u2261 4/2 \u2261 2 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=3 and x=2, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nSo, the polynomial \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 \\) factors as (x-2)(x-3)(x - a), with a being another root.\n\nBut according to the quadratic, the only roots are x=2 and x=3.\n\nWait, but the polynomial is cubic, so it should have three roots in the algebraic closure, but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), it may have fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a repeated root.\n\nBut according to the quadratic formula, the quadratic factor has two distinct roots, 2 and 3.\n\nTherefore, the cubic polynomial has three distinct roots: 2, 3, and possibly another one.\n\nBut in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), we've only found 2 and 3 as roots.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I expanded (x-2)(x-3)(x - a), and equated coefficients, I got a=2, which would suggest a triple root at x=2, but that contradicts x=3 being a root.\n\nI must have made a mistake there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the polynomial factors as (x-2)^2 (x-3).\n\nLet's check:\n\n(x-2)^2 (x-3) = (x^2 -4x +4)(x-3) = x^3 -7x^2 +16x -12.\n\nIn \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\), -7x^2 \u22610, 16x\u22612x, -12\u22612.\n\nSo, x^3 +0x^2 +2x +2, which matches the original polynomial.\n\nTherefore, \\( x^3 + 2x + 2 = (x-2)^2 (x-3) \\).\n\nSo, x=2 is a double root, and x=3 is a simple root.\n\nTherefore, the zeros in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_7 \\) are x=2 (with multiplicity 2) and x=3 (with multiplicity 1).\n\nBut in terms of distinct zeros, it's x=2 and x=3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) 2 and 3.\n\nHowever, option C says \"2,3\", but perhaps it should specify multiplicities.\n\nBut the problem says \"all zeros\", so likely it expects the distinct roots, even if there are multiplicities.\n\nSo, the answer is C) 2 and 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C) \\ 2,3} \\]"
