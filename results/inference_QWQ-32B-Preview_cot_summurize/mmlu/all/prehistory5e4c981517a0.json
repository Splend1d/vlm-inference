So, I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"Neandertals adorned themselves with pendants and necklaces.\" I've heard that Neandertals were capable of symbolic behavior, and wearing pendants and necklaces would be a way to express that. I think there have been archaeological findings of beads and other decorative items in Neandertal sites. So, it seems likely that they did adorn themselves.\n\nOption B: \"Neandertals buried their dead.\" I remember learning that Neandertals practiced burial of their deceased. There are several sites where Neandertal remains have been found in burial sites, sometimes with grave goods. This suggests they had some concept of death and maybe even an afterlife. So, evidence supports this.\n\nOption C: \"Neandertals produced and used complex stone tools.\" Neandertals are known for their Mousterian tool culture, which includes a variety of stone tools like scrapers, points, and hand axes. These tools are quite sophisticated and show a high degree of skill in their manufacture. So, yes, there's definitely evidence for this.\n\nOption D says: \"All of the above.\" Well, if all the previous options have evidence supporting them, then this would be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\n- Adorning with pendants and necklaces: Evidence found in archaeological sites.\n\n- Burial of the dead: Multiple burial sites documented.\n\n- Production and use of complex stone tools: Mousterian tool culture is well-established.\n\nSo, it seems that all three options A, B, and C have evidence supporting them. Therefore, the correct answer should be D: All of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
