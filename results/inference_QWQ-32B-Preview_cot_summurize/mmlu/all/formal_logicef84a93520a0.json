I need to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the predicate Ixyz means. It says \"x introduces y to z.\" So, in this context, x is the person doing the introducing, y is the person being introduced, and z is the person being introduced to.\n\nGiven that, in the sentence \"Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin,\" Jos\u00e9 is the one doing the introducing, Wilma is being introduced, and Kevin is the one being introduced to.\n\nSo, translating this into the predicate, it should be Ijwk, where:\n\n- x is j (Jos\u00e9)\n\n- y is w (Wilma)\n\n- z is k (Kevin)\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Iwkj: This would mean Iwjk, which is Wilma introduces Jos\u00e9 to Kevin. That's not what the original sentence says.\n\nB. Ijwk: This matches my interpretation: Jos\u00e9 introduces Wilma to Kevin.\n\nC. Iwjk: This is similar to A, meaning Wilma introduces Jos\u00e9 to Kevin.\n\nD. Ijkw: This would mean Jos\u00e9 introduces Kevin to Wilma.\n\nSo, only option B matches the original sentence.\n\nWait a minute, but option A is listed as Iwkj, which should correspond to Iwjk, not Iwkj. Maybe there's a typo in the option labels. But based on the way it's written, I think A is Iwkj, which would be Iwjk, meaning Wilma introduces Jos\u00e9 to Kevin.\n\nAnyway, regardless of any potential typo in the options, based on my understanding, B. Ijwk is the correct translation.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the positions again:\n\n- The first position in Ixyz is the introducer: Jos\u00e9 (j)\n\n- The second position is the one being introduced: Wilma (w)\n\n- The third position is the one being introduced to: Kevin (k)\n\nSo, Ijwk makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if there's confusion about the order, perhaps the predicate is defined differently. But according to the given definition, I think B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
