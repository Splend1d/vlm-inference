It focuses on understanding how different nutrients and foods influence the risk of developing diseases and how alterations in dietary patterns can lead to better health outcomes. Therefore, both the role of nutritional factors in causing disease and the potential benefits of changing food intake to promote health are central to the field of nutritional epidemiology."
