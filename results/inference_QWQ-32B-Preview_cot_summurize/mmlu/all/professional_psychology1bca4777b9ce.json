Let's look at each option:\n\nOption A says it explores early childhood experiences related to the problem. Hmm, I think crisis-oriented therapy is more focused on the present crisis rather than delving into past experiences. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B suggests trying to ensure the client becomes calm and relaxed. While calming the client might be part of the process, I feel like there's more to brief crisis-oriented therapy than just relaxation. It probably involves more active problem-solving.\n\nOption C mentions agreeing on clear-cut goals and keeping sessions focused on these goals. That sounds promising. Brief therapy is often goal-oriented and focuses on specific issues to be addressed in a limited number of sessions.\n\nOption D describes being open and nondirective, allowing the client to explore all aspects of the crisis situation. While it's important for the therapist to be supportive, crisis-oriented therapy might require more direction to resolve the immediate issue efficiently.\n\nConsidering these points, I think option C is the most accurate description of brief crisis-oriented therapy. It emphasizes setting clear goals and maintaining focus on them throughout the sessions, which aligns with the time-limited and problem-focused nature of this approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
