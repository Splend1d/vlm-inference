She was smoking marijuana, blowing it out the open window, and not sharing it with the driver. The driver fell asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and go into a ditch where it landed upside-down. Both the driver and passenger were seriously injured. She sued the operator for negligence. The operator filed a counterclaim asking for damages against the passenger by arguing that the passenger was herself negligent by \"smoking weed\" and causing him to fall asleep. Is the court likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim?\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n"

                    "text": "This is a complex legal scenario involving issues of negligence, contributory negligence, and potentially the concept of a joint enterprise. Let's break down the situation and analyze each option step by step.\n\nFirst, the facts:\n\n- The driver and passenger are in a car on a highway at night.\n\n- The passenger is smoking marijuana and blowing smoke out the window.\n\n- The driver falls asleep, causing the car to veer off the highway and land upside-down in a ditch.\n\n- Both are seriously injured.\n\n- The passenger sues the driver for negligence.\n\n- The driver countersues the passenger, arguing that her smoking marijuana caused him to fall asleep, contributing to the accident.\n\nNow, the question is whether the court is likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Yes, because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\n\nThis option suggests that the passenger's actions were insufficient to establish negligence on her part. To evaluate this, we need to consider whether the passenger's smoking marijuana contributed to the accident in a way that makes her negligent.\n\n- Smoking marijuana is illegal, and if it impairs the driver, it could be considered negligent.\n\n- However, in this case, the passenger was blowing the smoke out the window, suggesting minimal exposure to the driver.\n\n- The driver chose to drive while potentially under the influence of marijuana, which could be seen as his own negligence.\n\n- There might be an argument that the passenger should have foreseen that her actions could impair the driver, but this seems tenuous.\n\nGiven these points, it's possible that the passenger's motion to dismiss could be granted because her actions may not be directly linked to the driver falling asleep.\n\nB. Yes, because a vehicle operator is always liable and a passenger cannot be made liable for the driver's actions under any circumstances.\n\nThis option presents an absolute rule that drivers are always liable and passengers cannot be held liable for the driver's actions. However, this is not accurate in all jurisdictions. In some cases, passengers can be held liable if they actively contribute to the accident through their negligence.\n\n- For example, if a passenger distractions the driver or encourages reckless driving.\n\n- In this case, the passenger's smoking marijuana might be seen as contributing to the driver's impairment, especially if the driver inhaled secondhand smoke.\n\n- Therefore, this option is too broad and may not hold up.\n\nC. No, because the driver has properly alleged a joint enterprise situation where the passenger is liable for her share of the negligence in causing the accident.\n\nThis option suggests that the driver has alleged a joint enterprise, which could make the passenger liable for her negligence.\n\n- A joint enterprise is a legal concept where parties share a common purpose and mutual control over the activities.\n\n- In some jurisdictions, passengers can be held liable if they were part of a joint enterprise and their negligence contributed to the accident.\n\n- However, in this case, it's not clear that there was a joint enterprise. They were simply traveling together after a night class.\n\n- Additionally, the passenger was not actively participating in the driving or encouraging reckless behavior.\n\nTherefore, it may be unlikely that a joint enterprise exists here, and the court might grant the motion to dismiss.\n\nD. No, because the passenger was breaking the law, making her negligent per se.\n\nThis option argues that since the passenger was smoking marijuana, which is illegal, she is negligent per se, meaning her illegal act automatically constitutes negligence.\n\n- Negligence per se applies when someone violates a law intended to protect a class of persons from a particular type of harm.\n\n- In this case, smoking marijuana in the car could be seen as violating laws against drug use or possibly endangering others.\n\n- However, the connection to the accident is tenuous, as the passenger was blowing smoke out the window, minimizing exposure to the driver.\n\n- Therefore, while the passenger may be negligent per se for smoking marijuana, it's not clear that this directly contributed to the accident.\n\nGiven these considerations, option A seems the most plausible: the court is likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim because the passenger was not actively participating in a joint enterprise and did not do enough to contribute to the cause of the accident.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the specifics of the law can vary by jurisdiction, and courts might interpret the circumstances differently. Additionally, if there were other factors or allegations not mentioned here, they could influence the outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, the court is likely to grant the passenger's motion to dismiss the counterclaim, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
