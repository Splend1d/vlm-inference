                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out why Arnold Gesell is important in the history of school psychology. I have four options here:\n\nA. He identified the four major periods of cognitive development.\n\nB. He established the ethical standards of the National Association of School Psychologists.\n\nC. He developed a version of the thematic apperception test appropriate for use with children.\n\nD. He devised a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children.\n\nOkay, first I need to recall who Arnold Gesell was. I think he was a pediatrician and child psychologist known for his work on child development. So, that might relate to option D, about normative assessment for infants and young children.\n\nOption A mentions four major periods of cognitive development. I think that sounds more like Jean Piaget's work. Piaget is famous for his stages of cognitive development, which include sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational periods. So, that probably isn't Gesell.\n\nOption B talks about establishing ethical standards for the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). I don't recall Gesell being involved with NASP's ethics. Maybe that's someone else.\n\nOption C mentions the thematic apperception test (TAT). I know that the TAT was developed by Henry Murray and Christiana Morgan, primarily for use with adults, but there are versions adapted for children. I'm not sure if Gesell developed one of those.\n\nGiven that Gesell was known for his work on child development, especially normative developmental stages, option D seems the most likely. I think he developed the Gesell Developmental Schedules, which are assessments to evaluate a child's developmental progress compared to norms for their age.\n\nLet me double-check. Gesell was a pioneer in studying child development and emphasized the importance of maturation and the role of heredity in development. He observed children over time and created detailed descriptions of what was typical at different ages.\n\nSo, his work was foundational in creating normative assessments that could help identify if a child was developing typically or if there were delays that might need intervention.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer: He devised a prototypical normative assessment for infants and young children.\n\nI should probably remember this for any future quizzes or exams on the history of school psychology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
