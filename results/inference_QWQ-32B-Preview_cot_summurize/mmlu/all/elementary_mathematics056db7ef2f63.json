Start with \u22129.\n2. Next is \u22126, which is greater than \u22129.\n3. Then \u22123, which is greater than \u22126.\n4. followed by 7, which is greater than \u22123.\n5. Finally, 11, which is greater than 7.\n\nThis sequence is correctly ordered from least to greatest.\n\n**Option B: \u22123, \u22126, 7, 11, \u22129**\n\n1. Start with \u22123.\n2. Next is \u22126, which is less than \u22123. This is not in order.\n3. Then 7, which is greater than \u22126.\n4. followed by 11, which is greater than 7.\n5. Finally, \u22129, which is less than 11.\n\nThe sequence is not correctly ordered because \u22126 comes after \u22123, which is incorrect.\n\n**Option C: 11, \u22129, 7, \u22126, \u22123**\n\n1. Start with 11.\n2. Next is \u22129, which is less than 11.\n3. Then 7, which is greater than \u22129.\n4. followed by \u22126, which is greater than 7.\n5. Finally, \u22123, which is greater than \u22126.\n\nThis sequence is not ordered correctly because it jumps back and forth between positive and negative numbers without a consistent increase.\n\n**Option D: 7, 11, \u22126, \u22123, \u22129**\n\n1. Start with 7.\n2. Next is 11, which is greater than 7.\n3. Then \u22126, which is less than 11.\n4. followed by \u22123, which is greater than \u22126.\n5. Finally, \u22129, which is less than \u22123.\n\nThis sequence also jumps back and forth and is not ordered correctly.\n\nBased on this analysis, only Option A is correctly ordered from least to greatest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
