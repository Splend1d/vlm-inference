                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about oligopolies and I need to pick the most likely characteristic from these options. An oligopoly is a market structure where only a few sellers dominate the market. So, thinking about that, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says \"normal profits in the long run.\" Normal profits usually mean that firms are earning just enough to cover their opportunity costs, so there's no economic profit. But in an oligopoly, firms often have some market power because there are only a few of them, so they might be able to earn higher than normal profits. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B says \"no opportunities for collusive behavior.\" Collusion is when firms in an oligopoly secretly agree to fix prices or divide markets to maximize their joint profits. Since there are only a few firms, it's actually more likely that they can coordinate such behaviors. So, this seems incorrect because oligopolies do have opportunities for collusion.\n\nOption C says \"significant barriers to entry.\" Barriers to entry are things that make it hard for new firms to enter the market. In an oligopoly, these barriers are usually high because the existing firms might have control over key resources or economies of scale that make it difficult for new competitors to enter. This sounds plausible.\n\nOption D says \"price-taking behavior.\" Price takers are firms that have to accept the market price and can't influence it. But in an oligopoly, firms have some control over the price because there are only a few of them. So, they are more likely to be price makers rather than price takers.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the most accurate description of an oligopoly. Significant barriers to entry prevent new firms from easily entering the market, which allows the existing few firms to maintain their market power.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
