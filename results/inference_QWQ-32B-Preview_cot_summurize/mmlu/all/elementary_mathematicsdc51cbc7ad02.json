                    "text": "So I have this problem: write 7 over 33 as a decimal. The options are A. 0.021 repeating, B. 0.21 repeating, C. 0.22 repeating, and D. 0.2121. Okay, so 7 over 33 is a fraction, and I need to convert it to a decimal. I remember that to convert a fraction to a decimal, I can just divide the numerator by the denominator. So, I need to divide 7 by 33.\n\nLet me try doing that. 33 goes into 7 zero times, so I need to add a decimal point and some zeros. So, 7.0000 divided by 33. Okay, 33 goes into 70 two times because 33 times 2 is 66, which is less than 70. So, 2 times 33 is 66. Subtract 66 from 70, and I get 4. Then, bring down the next 0, making it 40. 33 goes into 40 once, because 33 times 1 is 33. Subtract 33 from 40, and I get 7. Now, bring down the next 0, making it 70 again.\n\nWait a minute, this seems familiar. I had 70 earlier, and I know that 33 goes into 70 two times again. So, it's going to be 2 again, and then the same process repeats. So, it looks like the decimal is going to be 0.212121..., repeating.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 0.21 repeating, which matches what I just found. Option C is 0.22 repeating, which is different because it's 0.2222..., and that's not what I got. Option D is 0.2121, which doesn't indicate repeating, and option A is 0.021 repeating, which is way smaller than what I expect.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again: 7 divided by 33. 33 goes into 7 zero times, so 0., and then 70. 33 goes into 70 two times, 2 times 33 is 66, subtract from 70, gets 4. Bring down 0, makes 40. 33 goes into 40 once, 1 times 33 is 33, subtract, gets 7. Bring down 0, makes 70 again. So, it's repeating 21, 21, 21, and so on.\n\nSo, the decimal representation of 7/33 is 0.21 repeating. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 0.21 repeating.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another way to check this. I could use long division again, but I already did that. Alternatively, I could convert the repeating decimal back to a fraction and see if I get 7/33.\n\nLet's say x = 0.21 repeating. So, x = 0.212121...\n\nTo eliminate the repeating part, I can multiply both sides by 100, because the repeating block is two digits long. So, 100x = 21.212121...\n\nNow, subtract the original x from this: 100x - x = 21.212121... - 0.212121..., which gives 99x = 21.\n\nTherefore, x = 21/99. Simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, 99 \u00f7 3 = 33. So, x = 7/33.\n\nYes, that matches the original fraction. So, confirming that 0.21 repeating is indeed equal to 7/33.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series. The decimal 0.21 repeating can be written as 0.21 + 0.0021 + 0.000021 + ..., which is a geometric series with first term a = 0.21 and common ratio r = 0.01.\n\nThe sum S of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r). Plugging in the values: S = 0.21 / (1 - 0.01) = 0.21 / 0.99 = 21/99, which again simplifies to 7/33.\n\nSo, all these methods confirm that 7/33 is equal to 0.21 repeating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 0.21 repeating.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
