It's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have a veterinarian who owns a 50-acre farmland and sells it to an investor for $300,000 through a land-sale agreement. The agreement is for 30 monthly installments of $10,000 each, and the veterinarian is supposed to deliver a warranty deed only after the last payment is made. This kind of arrangement is often called a land contract or an installment sale.\n\nNow, the investor has made the first 10 payments but then finds out there's an unrecorded mortgage on the property. The veterinarian has been making mortgage payments and isn't in default. The jurisdiction has a recording statute that says: \"No conveyance or instrument is good as against any subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless the same be recorded prior to subsequent purchase.\"\n\nThe investor stops making payments and sues the veterinarian for breach of contract, claiming that the unrecorded mortgage breaches the land-sale agreement. The question is, if judgment is rendered in favor of the veterinarian, what would be the reason?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The installment land-sale agreement is a security device.\n\nB. Although the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage, it does not impair the investor's right of redemption.\n\nC. The prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement.\n\nD. The time for the veterinarian, as seller, to deliver marketable title has not yet arrived.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nature of the land-sale agreement. In many jurisdictions, an installment land sale is treated as a mortgage or a security device rather than an outright sale. This is because the seller retains title until all payments are made.\n\nOption A suggests that the land-sale agreement is a security device. That might be relevant, but I'm not sure how it directly relates to the issue of the unrecorded mortgage.\n\nOption B mentions that the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage and that it doesn't impair the investor's right of redemption. I need to think about whether the existence of another mortgage affects the investor's rights under the land-sale agreement.\n\nOption C states that the prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement. This seems similar to option B but more direct.\n\nOption D says that the time for the veterinarian to deliver marketable title hasn't arrived yet because the last payment hasn't been made.\n\nLet me consider the recording statute. It says that no conveyance or instrument is good against a subsequent purchaser for value and without notice, unless it's recorded before the purchase.\n\nThe investor purchased the land-sale agreement and presumably didn't have notice of the unrecorded mortgage because it wasn't recorded. So, under the recording statute, the unrecorded mortgage shouldn't be good against the investor.\n\nBut the veterinarian is the one who has the mortgage, not the investor. So, how does this affect the investor's rights?\n\nWait a minute. The investor is buying the land from the veterinarian via the land-sale agreement. The veterinarian owns the land subject to the mortgage. When the investor buys the land, is he buying subject to the mortgage, or is he expecting the veterinarian to have marketable title?\n\nIn a typical land-sale agreement, the buyer expects the seller to convey marketable title at the end of the installment period. Marketable title means title that is free from reasonable doubt or litigation, except for exceptions specified in the deed.\n\nIn this case, the land-sale agreement provides that the veterinarian will deliver a warranty deed upon payment of the last installment. A warranty deed generally warrants that the title is good and marketable.\n\nSo, if there's an unrecorded mortgage, that could cloud the title and make it unmarketable.\n\nBut the investor discovered the mortgage after making 10 payments and then stopped making further payments, claiming breach of contract.\n\nIf the veterinarian is not in default on the mortgage and is regularly making payments, the mortgage shouldn't immediately affect the investor's rights, especially since the investor didn't have notice of it at the time of the purchase.\n\nGiven the recording statute, since the mortgage was unrecorded, and the investor is a subsequent purchaser without notice, the mortgage shouldn't be enforceable against the investor.\n\nHowever, in an installment land-sale agreement, the buyer's interest is also not recorded until the final payment is made and the deed is conveyed. So, the investor doesn't yet have record notice against third parties.\n\nBut in this scenario, the third party is the mortgage holder, and the investor is claiming breach against the veterinarian.\n\nI think the key here is that the investor is claiming breach because there's an unrecorded mortgage, implying that the title is not marketable.\n\nBut according to the recording statute, since the investor is a subsequent purchaser without notice, the unrecorded mortgage shouldn't affect the investor's rights.\n\nTherefore, the veterinarian could argue that the unrecorded mortgage doesn't affect the investor's rights under the land-sale agreement, which would align with option C.\n\nOption D also seems plausible because the time for delivering marketable title hasn't arrived yet, as the last payment hasn't been made. So, perhaps the veterinarian hasn't yet breached the agreement because the time for performance hasn't come.\n\nBut I think option C directly addresses the issue of the prior mortgage's legal effect on the investor's rights.\n\nOption A about the installment land-sale agreement being a security device might be factually correct, but I don't see how it directly resolves the issue of the unrecorded mortgage.\n\nOption B mentions that the land-sale agreement is actually a mortgage, which could be debated, but again, it doesn't directly address the effect of the prior mortgage on the investor's rights.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: the prior mortgage has no legal effect on the investor's rights under the installment land-sale agreement, given the recording statute and the investor's status as a subsequent purchaser without notice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
