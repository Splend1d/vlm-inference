                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. Mary and Pam scored at the 64th and 56th percentiles on the same test. I need to figure out which statement about their scores is true.\n\nFirst, I should remember what a percentile means. If someone is at the 64th percentile, it means that they scored higher than 64% of the test-takers. Similarly, at the 56th percentile, Pam scored higher than 56% of the test-takers.\n\nOption A says, \"Mary scored eight more points than Pam.\" But percentiles don't tell us about the actual score differences in points. They just tell us the percentage of people who scored below a certain score. So, I don't think this is necessarily true.\n\nOption B says, \"Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's.\" Again, percentiles don't directly translate to percentage differences in scores. So, this probably isn't correct either.\n\nOption C says, \"Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.\" Let's think about this. Mary is at the 64th percentile, and Pam is at the 56th percentile. The difference between these percentiles is 64% - 56% = 8%. So, 8% of the test-takers scored between Pam and Mary. That seems logical.\n\nOption D says, \"Thirty-six people scored higher than both Mary and Pam.\" But percentiles don't give us information about the number of people who scored higher; they give us percentages. Unless we know the total number of test-takers, we can't determine the exact number of people who scored higher. So, this can't be confirmed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option C seems to be the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
