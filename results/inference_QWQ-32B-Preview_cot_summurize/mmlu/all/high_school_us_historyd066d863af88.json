                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage from William Bradford's \"History of Plymouth Plantation.\" It's a fascinating glimpse into the early interactions between the Pilgrims and the Native Americans. So, the question is asking for the perspective of William Bradford based on this passage. The options are:\n\nA. The only good Indian is a dead Indian.\n\nB. The native peoples of America need to be converted to Christianity.\n\nC. Native Americans need to be incorporated into their new colony.\n\nD. Surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Bradford is saying here. He mentions that Indians were skulking around them, showing themselves from a distance but running away when approached. They even stole tools once. But then, on March 16th, a certain Indian named Samoset came boldly among them and spoke to them in broken English. Bradford was surprised and marveled at this, especially since Samoset could name some English ship captains and knew some English words.\n\nSamoset provided valuable information about the local area, the people, their names, numbers, strength, and who was in charge. He also mentioned another Indian named Squanto, who was a native of the area and had been to England, speaking English better than Samoset.\n\nSo, Bradford seems to be surprised and perhaps impressed that these Native Americans could speak English and provide useful information. He notes that this was profitable unto them, meaning it was beneficial for the Pilgrims.\n\nOption A, \"The only good Indian is a dead Indian,\" seems extreme and doesn't align with Bradford's account here. He doesn't express any hostility or desire to harm the Indians; instead, he's interested in their information and seems open to communication.\n\nOption B, about converting Native peoples to Christianity, isn't directly addressed in this passage. While Bradford was a Pilgrim and likely had religious motivations, this specific passage focuses on the practical information and communication with the Native Americans rather than their religious conversion.\n\nOption C suggests that Bradford thought Native Americans needed to be incorporated into their new colony. While it's possible that the Pilgrims had such intentions, this passage doesn't explicitly state that. It's more about the initial interactions and the surprise at finding Indians who could speak English.\n\nOption D seems to capture Bradford's perspective accurately. He expresses surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries, providing valuable information about the local area and people.\n\nLet me double-check. Bradford marvels at Samoset's English and his knowledge of English ships and people. He also notes that Samoset was profitable to them by providing information about the country and the people. Additionally, Samoset mentioned Squanto, who had been to England and could speak English better, suggesting that there were Native Americans who had interacted with the English and had learned their language.\n\nSo, Bradford's perspective here is one of surprise and recognition of the utility of having Native Americans who could speak English and act as intermediaries between the Pilgrims and the local tribes.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: Surprise that Native Americans could learn English and serve as cultural intermediaries.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
