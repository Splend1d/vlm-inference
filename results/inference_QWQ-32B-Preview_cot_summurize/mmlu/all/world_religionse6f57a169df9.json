                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Jaina traditions. The term is \"ajiva.\" Let's see what that means.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Jainism. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence and respect for all living beings. It has its own unique set of beliefs and terms.\n\nNow, \"ajiva\" sounds like it might be related to \"jiva.\" I think \"jiva\" means soul or living substance in Jainism. So, maybe \"ajiva\" is the opposite of that.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Soul\n\nB. Sound\n\nC. Non-matter\n\nD. Non-soul\n\nIf \"jiva\" is soul, then \"ajiva\" should be non-soul. So, option D seems likely.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Jain philosophy, the world is divided into two categories: jiva and ajiva. Jiva refers to conscious entities or souls, and ajiva refers to non-conscious entities or non-souls.\n\nSo, ajiva includes everything that is not alive or doesn't have a soul. That would include material things, like objects, as well as abstract concepts.\n\nOption C says \"non-matter,\" but that might be a bit misleading. Ajiva includes matter, but it also includes other non-soul elements that are not matter, like time and space.\n\nTherefore, \"non-soul\" seems like the most accurate definition.\n\nI think the answer is D. Non-soul.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
