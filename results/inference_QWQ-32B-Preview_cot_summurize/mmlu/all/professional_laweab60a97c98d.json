When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.\nB. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\nC. No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.\nD. No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.\n"

It's about a law school graduate who moves to a new city for a job in an entertainment law firm, but the job is contingent on passing the state bar exam in July. She plans to take a bar review course to prepare, but she arrives late to register because of traffic. When she gets there, registration is already done, and the course has started. She sees everyone inside taking notes and gets panicky. There are course materials on the registration table, and since no one is there to take payment, she picks up the materials and enters the lecture without paying. Later, she sends a cashier's check for the full enrollment fee to the bar review company.\n\nBut the company's regional director notices that she entered without paying, finds out who she is, and files a complaint with the local prosecutor, leading to a warrant for her arrest for larceny by trick. The complaint says she deliberately failed to pay for services rendered. After the complaint is issued, her check arrives, the company deposits it but doesn't inform the prosecutor that payment has been received. She gets arrested and held overnight, which causes her severe emotional distress due to local newspaper coverage and the humiliation of being arrested and held in custody. Because of this, she misses the bar exam and loses her job at the entertainment law firm.\n\nNow, she's considering suing the bar review company for infliction of emotional distress. The question is, will she prevail?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what infliction of emotional distress is. There are two types: intentional and negligent. Intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) requires that the defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that caused severe emotional distress to the plaintiff. Negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) involves the defendant's negligent conduct causing severe emotional distress to the plaintiff.\n\nGiven the options, it seems like the question is focusing on IIED, so I'll concentrate on that.\n\nOption A says yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company. But intent to defraud isn't directly relevant to whether the company is liable for infliction of emotional distress. The graduate's intent is separate from the company's conduct.\n\nOption B says yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full. This seems like a possible factor, but I need to see if failing to inform the prosecutor constitutes extreme and outrageous conduct.\n\nOption C says no, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress. This gets at the intent required for IIED.\n\nOption D says no, because filing the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.\n\nLet's analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, did the company engage in extreme and outrageous conduct?\n\nFiling a complaint with the prosecutor leading to the graduate's arrest seems like a serious action. But was it extreme and outrageous? The company discovered that the graduate entered the lecture without paying and filed a complaint for larceny by trick. They may have had a legitimate concern that she didn't pay, especially since she entered without registering.\n\nHowever, once her check arrived and was deposited, they should have informed the prosecutor that payment had been made, but they didn't. This omission could be seen as contributing to the harm she suffered.\n\nWas their conduct intended to cause her emotional distress? Probably not. It seems like their primary concern was to ensure payment for the service provided.\n\nBut in IIED, intent can be reckless as well as intentional. Reckless conduct is when someone knows or should know that their actions could cause severe emotional distress, but they proceed anyway.\n\nIn this case, the company may have been reckless in not verifying payment status before filing the complaint, especially if there was a possibility that she had sent payment.\n\nAlso, after receiving the payment, they failed to inform the prosecutor, which led to her arrest and detention.\n\nThis failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment seems particularly problematic. They knew or should have known that the basis for the complaint may have been resolved, but they didn't take steps to rectify the situation.\n\nThis could be considered reckless disregard for the harm their actions could cause to the graduate.\n\nNow, was the conduct extreme and outrageous? In general, filing a criminal complaint is a serious step, and if done without\u5145\u5206\u7684\u8c03\u67e5 or if based on incomplete information, it could be seen as extreme and outrageous.\n\nIn this scenario, it seems like the company may have acted hastily without fully investigating the situation. The graduate had every intention to pay and did send the payment promptly after attending a couple of classes.\n\nThe fact that they didn't inform the prosecutor after receiving payment suggests a lack of concern for the consequences their actions would have on the graduate.\n\nGiven that she suffered severe emotional distress, including publicity in local newspapers, humiliation from arrest and detention, and ultimately lost her job, the harm was significant.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that a court could find the company's conduct to be extreme and outrageous, especially considering their failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment.\n\nOption C says no, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.\n\nBut in IIED, intent can be intentional or reckless. If the company recklessly disregarded the risk of causing severe emotional distress, that could still meet the intent requirement.\n\nIn this case, their failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment could be seen as reckless, knowing that the graduate was facing criminal charges and potential arrest.\n\nOption D says no, because filing the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.\n\nBut considering the circumstances\u2014failing to verify payment status before filing, and not informing the prosecutor after receiving payment\u2014it could be argued that their conduct was indeed outrageous.\n\nGiven all this, I think the graduate might prevail in a claim for infliction of emotional distress against the bar review company.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.\n\nThis option highlights the company's failure to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment, which seems to be a key factor in causing the graduate's continued distress and ultimate arrest.\n\nOption A is less relevant because the graduate's intent isn't directly at issue in the company's liability for her emotional distress.\n\nOption C is too broad because even if the company didn't intend to cause distress, reckless conduct can still satisfy the intent requirement for IIED.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, in this context, filing the complaint without proper investigation and failing to inform the prosecutor after receiving payment could be considered outrageous conduct.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
