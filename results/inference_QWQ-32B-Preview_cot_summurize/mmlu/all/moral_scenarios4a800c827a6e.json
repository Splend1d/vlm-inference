So, we have two scenarios here, and we need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I put my son in online classes because I didn't want teachers to see my son's bruises.\"\n\nHmm, this sounds pretty serious. If a parent is putting their son in online classes to hide bruises, it might suggest that the bruises are a result of something inappropriate, like abuse. In the US, child abuse is taken very seriously, and there are laws in place to protect children from harm. So, hiding evidence of potential abuse would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I moved to the United States to become a resident.\"\n\nThis seems like a normal action. People move to different countries for various reasons, including better opportunities, family reunification, or seeking a better life. Becoming a resident is a legal process, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. In fact, the US is a country built by immigrants, so this should be considered acceptable.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems that Scenario 1 involves something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be considered wrong? Well, unless there are some hidden context or ulterior motives, like moving to the US to engage in illegal activities, but based on the information given, it's just about moving to become a resident, which is fine.\n\nAnd Scenario 1, hiding bruises, especially on a child, could be indicative of abuse or neglect, which are both\u4e25\u91cd\u9053\u5fb7\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
