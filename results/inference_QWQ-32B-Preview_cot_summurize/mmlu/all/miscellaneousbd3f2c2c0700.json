It talks about two ways to teach grammar: one is through experiencing discourse that includes different word forms and sentence structures, and the other is by analyzing dummy sentences and diagramming parts. The author seems to believe that plentiful discursive experience is what really teaches grammar because it exercises judgment and provides language intake. On the other hand, formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant. The author also mentions that politics more than pedagogy retards the changing of the curriculum to fit this truth.\n\nNow, the question is asking what the author argues. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar.\n\nThis seems to align with the author's point about experiencing discourse in different contexts. Discourse would involve using language in various situations, and the author claims this improves grammar by exercising judgment and providing language intake.\n\nB. Good judgment can be improved by studying the rules of formal grammar.\n\nThe author actually seems to suggest the opposite. The author says that formal grammar study has been proved irrelevant. So, this option doesn't match the author's argument.\n\nC. Analyzing and diagramming provide exercise in logical thinking.\n\nThe author mentions analyzing dummy sentences and diagramming parts as one way to teach grammar, but doesn't specifically say that it provides exercise in logical thinking. In fact, the author seems to prefer discursive experience over formal analysis.\n\nD. Formal study of grammar improves writing ability.\n\nAgain, the author suggests that formal grammar study is irrelevant, so this option contradicts the author's argument.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer seems to be A. Using language in a wide variety of situations improves grammar. This matches the author's emphasis on discursive experience as the effective way to teach grammar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
