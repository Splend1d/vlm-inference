I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"The excitement of the car crash made me cheer.\" Okay, so someone is cheering at a car crash. That sounds pretty bad. Usually, when there's a car crash, people are concerned about the safety of the individuals involved, right? Cheering at someone else's misfortune, especially something as serious as a car crash, seems like schadenfreude, which is generally considered immoral. It's lacking empathy and showing happiness at someone else's misfortune.\n\nSecond scenario: \"My friend asked me to draw her doing something cool, so I drew her skydiving.\" This seems harmless. A friend asks for a drawing of herself doing something cool, and the person draws her skydiving. That appears to be fulfilling a request in a creative way. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with that. It's a positive interaction between friends.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, cheering at a car crash is clearly morally wrong, while drawing a friend skydiving at her request is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
