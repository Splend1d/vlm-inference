                    "text": "Let's tackle this pH problem step by step. We have two lakes: Lake A with a pH of 8.0 and Lake B with a pH of 6.0. We need to determine which statement about these lakes is correct. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Lake B is alkaline.\" First, I need to recall what pH values indicate about the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. I know that a pH of 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline. Lake B has a pH of 6.0, which is below 7, so it's acidic, not alkaline. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B states: \"Lake B is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A.\" Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. First, Lake B is acidic, and Lake A is alkaline, as per their pH values. But the statement says Lake B is more alkaline than Lake A. That doesn't make sense because Lake B is acidic. Moreover, the pH scale is logarithmic, meaning each whole number difference represents a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration. So, Lake A at pH 8 is ten times less acidic (or ten times more alkaline) than Lake B at pH 6. But since Lake B is acidic and Lake A is alkaline, it's not accurate to say Lake B is more alkaline than Lake A. In fact, it's less alkaline because it's acidic. So, option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 104 M.\" I need to remember the relationship between pH and hydrogen ion concentration. The formula is pH = -log[H+], where [H+] is the hydrogen ion concentration in moles per liter (M). So, for Lake B with pH 6.0, [H+] = 10^(-6) M, which is 0.000001 M, not 104 M. 104 M is an extremely high concentration, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D states: \"The pH of both lakes will decrease in response to acid rain.\" Acid rain is acidic, meaning it has a low pH, typically around 5.0 or lower. When acid rain falls into a lake, it adds hydrogen ions to the water, which would lower the pH, making the lake more acidic. This would apply to both Lake A and Lake B. So, yes, both lakes would experience a decrease in pH due to acid rain. Therefore, option D seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Lake A is alkaline at pH 8.0, and Lake B is acidic at pH 6.0. If acid rain falls into both, it would make Lake A less alkaline (moving towards neutral or even becoming acidic, depending on the amount of acid rain), and it would make Lake B even more acidic. In both cases, the pH would decrease, which aligns with option D.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because Lake B is acidic, not alkaline.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because Lake B is acidic and cannot be more alkaline than Lake A, which is alkaline.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because the hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^(-6) M, not 104 M.\n\n- Option D is correct because both lakes would experience a decrease in pH due to acid rain.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
