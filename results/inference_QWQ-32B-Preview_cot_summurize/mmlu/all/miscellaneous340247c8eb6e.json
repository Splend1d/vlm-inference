I think BOOTP stands for Bootstrap Protocol. From what I recall, it's used for assigning IP addresses to computers on a network. So, it's more about network configuration rather than transporting web pages. So, probably not the answer here.\n\nNext, option B: HTTP. Hmm, HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. That sounds exactly like what would be used to transfer web pages from servers to browsers. I think this is the most likely candidate.\n\nOption C: SNMP. SNMP is Simple Network Management Protocol, which is used for managing and monitoring network devices. So, again, not directly related to transporting web pages.\n\nLastly, option D: SMTP. SMTP is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is used for sending emails. Not for transporting web pages.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like HTTP is the protocol used for transporting HTML pages from web servers to web browsers. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nFirst, BOOTP: definitely used for IP address assignment, not for web page transportation.\n\nHTTP: yes, that's the one used for web traffic, sending and receiving web pages.\n\nSNMP: used for network management, not for web page transfer.\n\nSMTP: used for email, not for web pages.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) HTTP.\n\nJust to be thorough, I might consider if there are any other protocols that could be involved in transporting web pages, but given the options provided, HTTP is clearly the right choice.\n\nSo, I'm confident with B) HTTP as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
