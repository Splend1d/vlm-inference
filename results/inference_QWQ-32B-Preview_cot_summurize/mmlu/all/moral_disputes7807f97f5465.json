It threatens identity and individuality.\n\nC. It will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.\n\nD. It perverts our values concerning parenthood and the raising of children.\n\nI need to figure out which one of these is not an objection that Kass makes against cloning.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Kass has said about cloning. Leon Kass is a well-known bioethicist who has expressed several concerns about human cloning. Let me think about his arguments.\n\nI remember that Kass is strongly against human cloning, and he has raised several ethical objections to it. One of his main concerns is that cloning undermines the uniqueness and individuality of human beings. So, option B seems like something he would object to.\n\nAlso, Kass has argued that cloning involves treating human beings as products or commodities, which he sees as dehumanizing. This relates to the way clones might be created and used, possibly perverting our values about parenthood and child-rearing. So, option D also aligns with his views.\n\nFurthermore, Kass has expressed concerns about the safety and welfare of cloned individuals, given the potential health risks and the uncertainty surrounding the technology. This could relate to option A, unethical experimentation, as cloning would involve experimenting on human subjects with unknown outcomes.\n\nNow, option C states that cloning will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones. I'm not sure if Kass specifically made this objection. His concerns seem more focused on the ethical implications and the potential psychological and social effects rather than the biological mutations over generations.\n\nI recall that Kass has discussed the \"yuck factor,\" which is a natural revulsion or disgust people feel towards certain practices, including cloning. He argues that such instincts can be indicators of deep moral intuitions. However, I don't recall him specifically mentioning cumulative biological mutations in clones over time.\n\nMoreover, most of the discussions about cloning focus on the first generation of clones and their well-being, rather than the effects of clones reproducing and producing further clones. So, it's possible that this specific point isn't one of Kass's main objections.\n\nLet me double-check. I know that Kass has written extensively on bioethics, including in his book \"Life, Liberty and the Defense of Dignity.\" I should look up his specific arguments against cloning to confirm.\n\nUpon reviewing some of Kass's writings, I see that he indeed raises concerns about cloning constituting unethical experimentation, threatening identity and individuality, and perverting values concerning parenthood. However, he does not specifically mention that cloning will produce harmful biological mutations as clones produce further clones.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option C is the correct answer\u2014that it is not an objection Kass makes against cloning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
