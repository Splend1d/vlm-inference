I know that English spelling can be tricky sometimes, so I need to double-check each one.\n\nStarting with option A: decieve. Hmm, that doesn't look right to me. I think the correct spelling is \"deceive\" with a \"b\" before the \"e\". So, decieve is probably misspelled.\n\nNext, option B: foriegn. That also seems off. I believe the correct spelling is \"foreign\" with only one \"r\" and the \"e\" before the \"n\". So, foriegn is not spelled correctly.\n\nOption C: hygiene. This one looks familiar. I think it's spelled correctly. Hygiene is related to cleanliness and health, and I recall that it's spelled with an \"y\" after the \"h\", followed by \"g\", \"i\", \"e\", and \"n\". So, I believe this one is correct.\n\nLastly, option D: wierd. That doesn't look right. I think the correct spelling is \"weird\" with an \"e\" instead of an \"i\". So, wierd is misspelled.\n\nBased on this, it seems like option C, hygiene, is the word that is spelled correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
