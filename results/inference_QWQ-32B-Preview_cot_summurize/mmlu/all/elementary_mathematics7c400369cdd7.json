                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about buses leaving a station at certain intervals, and I need to figure out when both Bus A and Bus B will leave at the same time again. Let's see what we've got.\n\nBus A has a long route and leaves every 75 minutes. Bus B has a short route and leaves every 15 minutes. They both start at 6:00 a.m. I need to find the next time they both leave at the same time.\n\nOkay, so this sounds like a problem involving least common multiples, or LCMs, because we're dealing with repeating events at different intervals. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.\n\nSo, if I find the LCM of 75 and 15 minutes, that should tell me after how many minutes from 6:00 a.m. both buses will leave together again.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 75 and 15.\n\nTo find the LCM, one way is to list the prime factors of each number.\n\nLet's factorize 75 and 15.\n\n75 divided by 5 is 15, and 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, 75 is 5 times 5 times 3, or 5 squared times 3.\n\n15 is 5 times 3.\n\nSo, the LCM would be the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. That would be 5 squared (which is 25) times 3, which is 75.\n\nSo, the LCM of 75 and 15 is 75 minutes.\n\nThat means that every 75 minutes, both buses will leave at the same time.\n\nNow, since they both leave at 6:00 a.m., the next time they'll both leave together is 75 minutes after that.\n\nSo, I need to add 75 minutes to 6:00 a.m.\n\nLet's see, 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nAdding that to 6:00 a.m.: 6:00 a.m. plus 1 hour is 7:00 a.m., plus another 15 minutes is 7:15 a.m.\n\nSo, the next time they both leave together is 7:15 a.m.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 7:00 a.m.\n\nB. 7:15 a.m.\n\nC. 7:30 a.m.\n\nD. 8:30 a.m.\n\nSo, option B is 7:15 a.m., which matches what I've calculated.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the multiples of each bus's interval and see when they coincide.\n\nBus A leaves at 6:00, then 6:75, but since 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes, that's 7:15 a.m.\n\nBus B leaves every 15 minutes: 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, etc.\n\nSo, looking at the departure times:\n\nBus A: 6:00, 7:15, 8:30, etc.\n\nBus B: 6:00, 6:15, 6:30, 6:45, 7:00, 7:15, etc.\n\nSo, yes, they both leave at 6:00 and again at 7:15 a.m.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 7:15 a.m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a shorter way to think about this.\n\nSince Bus B leaves every 15 minutes, and 75 is a multiple of 15 (because 75 divided by 15 is 5), that means that every 75 minutes, Bus A and Bus B will coincide.\n\nSo, again, that leads me to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 7:15 a.m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
