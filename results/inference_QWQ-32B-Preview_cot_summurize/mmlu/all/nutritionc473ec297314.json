This is because FFQs are cost-effective, easy to administer to large populations, and can provide a relatively comprehensive overview of an individual's usual dietary intake over a specified period, typically the past year. They are particularly useful for ranking individuals according to their intake of specific nutrients or food groups, which is crucial in epidemiological research where the relationship between diet and disease is studied in populations.\n\nWhile other methods like weighed diaries, unweighed diaries, and 24-hour recalls provide more detailed information about short-term intake, they are more time-consuming and burdensome for participants, making them less practical for large-scale epidemiological studies.\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cFFQs are preferred for their balance between detail and feasibility in such research settings."
