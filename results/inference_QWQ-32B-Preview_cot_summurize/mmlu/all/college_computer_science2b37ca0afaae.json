                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to determine which of the given sets could be the set of all common divisors of two integers. To do this, we need to recall some properties of divisors.\n\nFirst, what is a divisor? An integer \\( c \\) is a divisor of another integer \\( x \\) if there exists some integer \\( k \\) such that \\( x = c \\times k \\). For example, 2 is a divisor of 6 because \\( 6 = 2 \\times 3 \\).\n\nNow, a common divisor of two integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is an integer that divides both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). So, if \\( c \\) is a common divisor of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then \\( c \\) divides \\( x \\) and \\( c \\) divides \\( y \\).\n\nThe set of all common divisors of two integers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) includes all integers \\( c \\) such that \\( c \\) divides both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This set should have some specific properties:\n\n1. It should include both positive and negative divisors, because if \\( c \\) divides \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then \\( -c \\) also divides \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n2. It should include 1 and -1, because 1 is a divisor of every integer.\n\n3. It should not include 0, because 0 is not a divisor of any non-zero integer. (Note: Division by zero is undefined.)\n\n4. The set should be closed under taking divisors, meaning that if \\( d \\) divides \\( c \\) and \\( c \\) is in the set, then \\( d \\) should also be in the set.\n\nGiven these properties, let's examine each option:\n\n**Option A: \\(\\{-6, -2, -1, 1, 2, 6\\}\\)**\n\n- It includes both positive and negative divisors.\n\n- It includes 1 and -1.\n\n- It does not include 0, which is correct.\n\n- Let's check if it's closed under taking divisors. For example, 2 is in the set. Does it include all divisors of 2? The divisors of 2 are \\(\\{-2, -1, 1, 2\\}\\), and all of these are in the set.\n\n- Similarly, 6 is in the set. The divisors of 6 are \\(\\{-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6\\}\\). But in this set, -3 and 3 are missing.\n\nWait a minute, this set doesn't include -3 and 3, which are divisors of 6. So, if 6 is a common divisor, then its divisors should also be included. But -3 and 3 are missing. Therefore, this set is not closed under taking divisors. So, option A cannot be the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\n**Option B: \\(\\{-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6\\}\\)**\n\n- It includes 0, which is not a divisor of any non-zero integer. So, this set cannot be the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\n**Option C: \\(\\{-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6\\}\\)**\n\n- It includes both positive and negative divisors.\n\n- It includes 1 and -1.\n\n- It does not include 0, which is correct.\n\n- Let's check if it's closed under taking divisors. For example, 3 is in the set. The divisors of 3 are \\(\\{-3, -1, 1, 3\\}\\), all of which are in the set.\n\n- Similarly, 6 is in the set. The divisors of 6 are \\(\\{-6, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 6\\}\\), and all of these are in the set.\n\n- Another check: 2 is in the set. Its divisors are \\(\\{-2, -1, 1, 2\\}\\), which are all present.\n\n- This set seems to be closed under taking divisors.\n\nTherefore, option C could be the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\n**Option D: \\(\\{-6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6\\}\\)**\n\n- It includes 0, which is not a divisor of any non-zero integer. So, this set cannot be the set of all common divisors of two integers.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only set that could possibly be the set of all common divisors of two integers is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
