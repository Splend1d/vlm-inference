                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what happens when the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, assuming we have a Classical aggregate supply curve. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Classical aggregate supply curve looks like. In the Classical model, the aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full employment level of output. This is because, in the long run, the economy's output is determined by its factors of production and technology, and not by the price level.\n\nSo, if the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, meaning that at every price level, people want to buy more goods and services, how does this affect the equilibrium price level and equilibrium quantity of output?\n\nGiven that the aggregate supply curve is vertical, a shift in aggregate demand to the right would intersect the vertical AS curve at a higher price level but the same quantity of output. That makes sense because in the Classical model, the economy is always at full employment, so increased demand doesn't lead to more output; it just leads to higher prices.\n\nLet me visualize this. Initially, we have an aggregate demand curve intersecting the vertical aggregate supply curve at price level P and quantity Y. If AD shifts to the right to AD', it will intersect the vertical AS curve at a higher price level P' but still at the same quantity Y.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the equilibrium price level increases, while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nB. The equilibrium price level decreases while the equilibrium quantity of output increases.\n\nC. The equilibrium price level and quantity of output increase.\n\nD. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output remains unchanged.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option D seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In the Classical model, the economy is always at full employment, so output can't increase beyond that. Therefore, any increase in demand should only lead to higher prices, not higher output.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the equilibrium price level increases, and the equilibrium quantity of output stays the same.\n\nI think option D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
