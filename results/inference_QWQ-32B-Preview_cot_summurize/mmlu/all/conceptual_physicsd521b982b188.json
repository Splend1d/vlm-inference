Magnesium-22, B. Magnesium-20, C. Oxygen-18, and D. Oxygen-16.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Neon-20 means that the nucleus has a mass number of 20, which is the total number of protons and neutrons combined. Neon is element 10, so it has 10 protons. That means the number of neutrons in neon-20 is 20 minus 10, which is 10 neutrons.\n\nNow, the question says to remove two protons and two neutrons from this nucleus. So, if I start with 10 protons and remove two, I'll have 8 protons left. Similarly, starting with 10 neutrons and removing two, I'll have 8 neutrons left.\n\nNext, I need to figure out what element has 8 protons. Looking at the periodic table, element 8 is oxygen. So, the remaining nucleus should be oxygen.\n\nNow, the mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons, which is 8 protons plus 8 neutrons, equaling 16. So, it should be oxygen-16.\n\nLooking at the options, D. Oxygen-16 matches this.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the other options:\n\nA. Magnesium-22: Magnesium is element 12, which would require 12 protons, but we only have 8 protons left after removal. So, that doesn't make sense.\n\nB. Magnesium-20: Again, magnesium has 12 protons, but we have 8 protons, so this can't be right.\n\nC. Oxygen-18: Oxygen-18 would have 8 protons and 10 neutrons, but we removed two neutrons, so we should have only 8 neutrons, making it oxygen-16, not oxygen-18.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Oxygen-16.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
