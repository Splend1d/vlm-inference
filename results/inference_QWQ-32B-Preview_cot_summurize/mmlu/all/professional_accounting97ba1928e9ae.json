                    "text": "So I've got this question about how Poplar City should report its expenditures for the interest and principal payments on its general obligation bonds. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there's a debt service fund, which is a type of governmental fund used to account for resources set aside to pay interest and principal on bonded debt. The city paid $5,000 in interest and $20,000 in principal on its outstanding general obligation bonds. These payments were made from the debt service fund using cash that was transferred earlier in the same year from the general fund.\n\nNow, I need to determine how these expenditures should be reported in the general fund, debt service fund, and permanent fund.\n\nLet's start by understanding the flow of funds. The general fund transferred money to the debt service fund, which then used that money to make the interest and principal payments. So, the general fund is the source of the funds, and the debt service fund is the one making the payments.\n\nIn governmental accounting, expenditures are typically reported in the fund that incurred the expenditure. So, since the debt service fund is making the payments, it should report the expenditures, right? But, the general fund transferred the money, so maybe it has some reporting requirements as well.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. General fund: $25,000; Debt service fund: $25,000; Permanent fund: $0\n\nB. General fund: $0; Debt service fund: $25,000; Permanent fund: $20,000\n\nC. General fund: $25,000; Debt service fund: $5,000; Permanent fund: $0\n\nD. General fund: $0; Debt service fund: $25,000; Permanent fund: $0\n\nHmm. Option D seems plausible because the debt service fund is the one making the payments, so it should report the total expenditures of $25,000 ($5,000 interest + $20,000 principal). The general fund transferred the money but doesn't necessarily need to report the expenditures again since it's already reported in the debt service fund. And there's no mention of a permanent fund being involved, so its amount should be $0.\n\nBut wait, maybe the general fund needs to report the transfer as an expenditure. In governmental accounting, transfers out are sometimes reported as expenditures in the fund making the transfer. So, perhaps the general fund should report the $25,000 as an expenditure, and the debt service fund also reports it as an expenditure because it's using the funds to make the payments.\n\nOption A shows both funds reporting $25,000 in expenditures, which might make sense if both are reporting their respective activities. But I'm not sure if that's double-counting.\n\nOption B has the debt service fund reporting $25,000 and the permanent fund reporting $20,000. But there's no mention of the permanent fund being involved in this transaction, so that seems incorrect.\n\nOption C has the general fund reporting $25,000 and the debt service fund reporting only $5,000. That doesn't make sense because the debt service fund is paying both interest and principal.\n\nOption D has the debt service fund reporting $25,000 and the permanent fund at $0, which aligns with my initial thought.\n\nLet me look up a bit about how transfers and expenditures are reported in governmental funds.\n\nIn governmental accounting, transfers out from one fund to another are reported as expenditures in the fund making the transfer. So, the general fund would report the transfer to the debt service fund as an expenditure. Additionally, the debt service fund would report the expenditures for interest and principal payments.\n\nTherefore, both funds report expenditures: the general fund for the transfer out, and the debt service fund for the actual payments made.\n\nSo, in this case, the general fund would report a $25,000 expenditure for the transfer to the debt service fund, and the debt service fund would report $25,000 in expenditures for the interest and principal payments.\n\nThat means option A is correct.\n\nWait, but is that double-counting? In governmental accounting, it's acceptable to report expenditures in both funds because they represent different activities: one is the transfer, and the other is the actual payment.\n\nMoreover, in the government-wide financial statements, these would be netted out, but for the fund financial statements, both reports are necessary to show the activities of each fund.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: General fund $25,000, Debt service fund $25,000, Permanent fund $0.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any role for the permanent fund here. The question mentions a permanent fund, but there's no information suggesting that it's involved in this transaction. Permanent funds are used to account for assets restricted for use for producing income or returns, and the income is often used for specific purposes. Since there's no mention of permanent fund involvement, its expenditures should be $0.\n\nSo, in conclusion, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
