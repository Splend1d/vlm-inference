One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value.

                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is saying about the city of Ghana. It seems like there's a mix of Muslim and non-Muslim populations. The king's officials are mostly Muslims, but the king himself might not be, since only royalty can wear sewn clothes, and the king adorns himself like a woman with necklaces and bracelets. There's also a description of how people greet the king differently based on their religion.\n\nThe passage mentions that the king has a domed pavilion with ten horses standing around it. It says that when people who share the king's religion approach him, they kneel and sprinkle dust on their heads, which seems like a local way of showing respect. Muslims, on the other hand, greet him by clapping their hands.\n\nReligiously, the people are pagans and worship idols, but there's a significant Muslim presence with mosques, imams, and scholars. Beyond this country, there's another called Malal, whose king was attached to Islam, but his people remained polytheists.\n\nNow, regarding trade with Asia, the question is asking for evidence in the passage that suggests the Ghanians were involved, directly or indirectly, in trade with Asia. The options are:\n\nA. They kept horses in their court, which would have come from the Mongols.\n\nB. The Ghanian king had adopted the Chinese tradition of the kow-tow.\n\nC. The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.\n\nD. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Horses from the Mongols: The passage mentions horses in the king's pavilion, but it doesn't specify where the horses came from. The Mongols are not mentioned at all in the passage. So, this seems like a stretch.\n\nB. Chinese tradition of the kow-tow: The passage describes a greeting where people kneel and sprinkle dust on their heads, which is similar to the kow-tow, a formal way of showing respect in Chinese culture involving kneeling and bowing. However, the passage specifies that this is \"their way of greeting him,\" meaning it's a local custom, not necessarily adopted from China. So, it's possible, but not directly stated.\n\nC. Gold and jewels from India: The passage mentions that the king adorns himself with necklaces and bracelets, and that there are mines in the country that produce gold reserved for the king. However, it doesn't specify that the jewels are from India or that they are traded from Asia. So, this is also speculative.\n\nD. Silk robes in the court: The passage states that \"All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means.\" Silk is a product associated with Asia, particularly China, and its presence suggests trade connections. The fact that it's mentioned alongside cotton and brocade, which can be local or from other regions, still indicates that silk is available in Ghana, likely through trade routes.\n\nComparing these options, option D seems to be the most direct evidence of trade with Asia, as silk is a distinctive Asian product, and its availability in Ghana suggests that there were trade networks in place to transport it from Asia to West Africa.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. The people in his court wore silk robes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
