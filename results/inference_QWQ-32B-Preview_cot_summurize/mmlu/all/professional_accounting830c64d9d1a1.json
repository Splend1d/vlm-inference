                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the auditor should do when there's a change in accounting principles, but it doesn't have a big impact on how we compare the financial statements. So, the effect is not material. I have four options here, and I need to choose the right one.\n\nOption A says, \"Not refer to the change in the auditor\u2019s report.\" That sounds simple enough. If the change isn't material, maybe the auditor doesn't need to mention it.\n\nOption B says, \"Refer to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change.\" Hmm, so if the company has already explained the change in the notes, maybe the auditor just needs to point to that.\n\nOption C suggests, \"Refer to the change in an emphasis-of-matter paragraph.\" I know that emphasis-of-matter paragraphs are used when the auditor wants to draw attention to something important in the financial statements that isn't a qualification to the audit opinion.\n\nOption D says, \"Explicitly state whether the change conforms with GAAP.\" So, the auditor would need to confirm if the new accounting principle follows Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nLet me think about this. First, I need to recall what auditors are supposed to do when there are changes in accounting principles.\n\nI remember that changes in accounting principles are significant because they can affect the comparability of financial statements from one period to another. However, if the effect is not material, maybe the auditor doesn't need to make a big deal out of it.\n\nBut, I also know that auditors have a responsibility to ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with GAAP. So, even if the change isn't material, perhaps the auditor should still verify that the change conforms with GAAP.\n\nLet me look at the options again.\n\nOption A says not to refer to the change in the auditor's report. That seems plausible if the change isn't material, but I'm a bit unsure.\n\nOption B suggests referring to the note in the financial statements. If the company has already disclosed the change in the notes, maybe that's sufficient, and the auditor can just make a reference to that disclosure.\n\nOption C mentions using an emphasis-of-matter paragraph. Emphasis-of-matter paragraphs are used for matters that are appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements and that, in the auditor's judgment, are of such importance that they need to be brought to the attention of the users of the financial statements.\n\nOption D says the auditor should explicitly state whether the change conforms with GAAP. That seems like a direct approach, ensuring that the change is in accordance with accounting standards.\n\nI think I need to consider the auditing standards here. I believe there are specific standards that guide auditors on how to handle changes in accounting principles.\n\nLet me think about SAS (Statements on Auditing Standards) or maybe the AICPA guidelines. I recall that auditors need to consider the consistency of accounting principles over time unless a change is necessary and properly accounted for.\n\nIf there's a change in accounting principle, the company is supposed to disclose it in the notes to the financial statements, including the reason for the change and the effect of the change on the financial statements.\n\nSo, if the effect is not material, does the auditor still need to address it in the audit report?\n\nI think the auditor should still consider whether the change is properly accounted for and disclosed, even if the effect is immaterial.\n\nOption B says to refer to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change. That seems like a reasonable approach. The auditor can verify that the disclosure is adequate and then refer to it in the audit report.\n\nOption C, using an emphasis-of-matter paragraph, might be overkill if the effect is not material. Emphasis-of-matter paragraphs are typically used for material matters, so perhaps it's not necessary here.\n\nOption D, explicitly stating whether the change conforms with GAAP, seems important. The auditor should ensure that any change in accounting principle complies with GAAP, regardless of materiality.\n\nWait a minute, but if the effect is not material, does the auditor still need to opine on whether it conforms with GAAP?\n\nI think the auditor's responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with GAAP. So, even if the effect is immaterial, the change should still conform with GAAP.\n\nHowever, perhaps the auditor doesn't need to specifically mention it in the audit report if it's properly disclosed in the notes.\n\nLet me consider the implications of each option.\n\nIf I choose Option A, not referring to the change in the auditor's report, and the change is properly disclosed in the notes, and it's immaterial, maybe that's acceptable.\n\nBut, if the change doesn't conform with GAAP, even if it's immaterial, shouldn't the auditor mention it?\n\nWait, but if it doesn't conform with GAAP, that's a different issue. Maybe the auditor needs to ensure that the change does conform with GAAP, and if it does, and it's properly disclosed, then perhaps no further mention is needed in the audit report.\n\nOption B suggests referring to the note in the financial statements. That seems like a way for the auditor to indicate that they've considered the change and that it's disclosed appropriately.\n\nOption C, using an emphasis-of-matter paragraph, might be seen as drawing unnecessary attention to an immaterial item.\n\nOption D, explicitly stating whether the change conforms with GAAP, could be seen as providing assurance on a specific aspect, which might not be necessary if the overall opinion already covers conformity with GAAP.\n\nI think the key here is that the auditor's standard audit opinion already includes an assertion that the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP.\n\nSo, if the change is immaterial and properly disclosed, perhaps no additional mention is needed in the audit report.\n\nBut, to be safe, maybe referring to the disclosure in the notes is a good practice.\n\nLooking back at the options, Option B seems like the most appropriate choice.\n\nLet me see what Option D says again: \"Explicitly state whether the change conforms with GAAP.\" While it's important that the change conforms with GAAP, I'm not sure if the auditor needs to specifically state this in the audit report when the overall opinion already covers conformity with GAAP.\n\nMoreover, if the change doesn't conform with GAAP, that would be a misstatement, and the auditor would need to consider the implications for the audit opinion.\n\nTherefore, in the case where the change is immaterial and properly disclosed, Option B seems most suitable: referring to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change.\n\nThis way, the auditor is acknowledging that the change has been disclosed appropriately, and users can refer to the notes for details.\n\nI think that's the best approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nb."
