There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says: \"When the attacker replies to a message sent to it by the system.\" Hmm, that sounds like the attacker is just responding to a message, maybe trying to engage in a conversation or something. But I don't think that's what a replay attack is.\n\nOption B: \"An attack that continuously repeats, probing for a weakness.\" This sounds more like a brute force attack, where someone tries the same thing over and over again to find a vulnerability. Not sure if that's a replay attack.\n\nOption C: \"An attack that uses the system's own messages and so cannot be defended against.\" Using the system's own messages? That sounds dangerous, but I think replay attacks can be defended against, so maybe this isn't right.\n\nOption D: \"The attacker resends a captured message, and the site accepts it and responds in the attacker's favor.\" Okay, this sounds more like a replay attack. From what I've read, a replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a message and then resends it later to trick the system into performing an action again, maybe to make a transaction happen twice or to gain unauthorized access.\n\nLet me think about this. In a replay attack, the attacker is essentially re-playing a legitimate message to achieve some goal. So, it's not about replying to a message or continuously probing for weaknesses. It's specifically about capturing and resending a message that the system thinks is new and legitimate.\n\nAlso, I recall that there are ways to prevent replay attacks, like using timestamps or sequence numbers in messages, so that the system can detect if a message has already been processed. So, option C says that it cannot be defended against, which isn't true.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct definition of a replay attack. The attacker resends a captured message, and the system accepts it and responds in the attacker's favor.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: Replying to a message doesn't sound like a replay attack. It's more like interacting normally, but with malicious intent maybe. But replay attacks are about resending a previous message.\n\nOption B: Continuous repetition sounds more like a denial-of-service attack or a brute force attack, not specifically a replay attack.\n\nOption C: Saying it cannot be defended against is incorrect because there are mechanisms to prevent replay attacks.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. The attacker resends a captured message, and the site accepts it and responds in the attacker's favor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
