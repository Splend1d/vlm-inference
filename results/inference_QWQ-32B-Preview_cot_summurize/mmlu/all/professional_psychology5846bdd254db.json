                    "text": "Let's see. I need to choose the type of research where there's no manipulation of variables; they're just measured. So, I have four options: quasi-experimental, true experimental, correlational, and developmental research.\n\nFirst, I know that experimental research, whether quasi or true, involves some form of manipulation. In true experimental research, there's random assignment to control and experimental groups, and variables are manipulated to observe effects. Quasi-experimental is similar but doesn't have random assignment. So, in both cases, there's manipulation involved.\n\nDevelopmental research usually looks at how variables change over time, often involving different age groups. But depending on the study, there might be manipulation involved or not. I'm not entirely sure about this one.\n\nCorrelational research, on the other hand, is about finding relationships between variables without manipulating them. Researchers just measure variables as they naturally occur.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the type where variables are just measured and not manipulated, correlational research seems to fit.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe developmental research could involve just observing changes over time without manipulation. For example, studying how children's language skills develop naturally without intervening.\n\nSimilarly, some quasi-experimental designs might not involve manipulation, but I think quasi-experimental usually does include some form of manipulation, even if it's not as controlled as in true experiments.\n\nTrue experimental always involves manipulation.\n\nSo, between correlational and developmental, both could involve just measuring variables without manipulation.\n\nBut the question seems to be about the type of research where variables are just measured, not manipulated.\n\nI think correlational research is more directly about measuring relationships without manipulation, while developmental research could involve manipulation or just observation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably correlational research.\n\nWait, but developmental research can be purely observational, like longitudinal studies where researchers track participants over time without manipulating any variables.\n\nIn that case, both correlational and developmental research could fit the description.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting correlational research as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps developmental research is a type of correlational research.\n\nBut I think developmental research is a separate category.\n\nPerhaps the answer is both C and D, but the question seems to expect a single answer.\n\nMaybe I need to choose the one that most purely involves just measuring variables without manipulation.\n\nIn that case, correlational research is specifically about measuring relationships without manipulation, while developmental research could involve either manipulation or observation.\n\nSo, correlational research might be the better answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe quasi-experimental research sometimes doesn't involve manipulation, but I don't think that's accurate. Quasi-experimental still involves some form of manipulation, even if it's not as controlled as in true experiments.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n- True experimental: manipulation present\n\n- Quasi-experimental: manipulation present, but without random assignment\n\n- Correlational: no manipulation, just measuring variables\n\n- Developmental: can be with or without manipulation\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is correlational research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
