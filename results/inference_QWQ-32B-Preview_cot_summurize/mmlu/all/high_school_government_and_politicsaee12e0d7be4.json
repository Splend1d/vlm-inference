A. Commerce B. Ways and Means C. Education and the Workforce D. Resources.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which committee deals with tax policy.\n\nFirst, I should recall that the House of Representatives has various committees that handle different areas of legislation. Each committee specializes in certain policy areas, and members can serve on one or more committees based on their interests and expertise.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Commerce: I think the Commerce Committee deals with issues related to business, trade, and commerce. Maybe some aspects of tax relate to commerce, but I don't think it's the primary committee for tax policy.\n\nB. Ways and Means: This one sounds familiar. I believe the Ways and Means Committee is responsible for tax legislation. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nC. Education and the Workforce: This committee probably deals with education policies and labor issues. While tax policies can affect education and workforce development, it doesn't seem like the main committee for tax policy.\n\nD. Resources: I'm not sure what this committee specifically handles. Maybe natural resources or environment issues. Again, tax policies might touch on these areas, but it doesn't sound like the primary committee for tax matters.\n\nSo, based on my initial thoughts, Ways and Means seems like the most likely committee for influencing tax policy.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that in Congress, particularly in the House, the Ways and Means Committee has traditional jurisdiction over tax laws, social security, trade, and some other areas. So, yes, that aligns with my first impression.\n\nMaybe I should see what the other options are about to confirm.\n\nCommerce Committee: According to my knowledge, this committee deals with regulations, commerce, and trade issues. While taxes can impact commerce, it's not the main place for tax policy.\n\nEducation and the Workforce: This committee focuses on education policies, labor laws, and workforce development. Again, taxes might play a role, but it's not the primary arena for tax legislation.\n\nResources: I think this might be related to natural resources or environmental issues. Perhaps it's now called the Natural Resources Committee. In any case, tax policies related to environment or resources might be handled here, but overall, it's not the main tax committee.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Ways and Means.\n\nI think that makes sense. If a representative wants to influence tax policy, serving on the committee that has primary jurisdiction over taxes would be the most direct way to do that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
