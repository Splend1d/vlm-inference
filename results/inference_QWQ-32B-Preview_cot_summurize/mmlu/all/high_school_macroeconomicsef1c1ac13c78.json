The government should run a surplus.\n\nC. Increase taxes and government spending.\n\nD. Decrease government spending and taxes.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a recession is. It's when the economy is not doing well, right? GDP is down, unemployment is up, that sort of thing.\n\nNow, fiscal policy is about how the government spends its money and collects taxes to influence the economy.\n\nDuring a recession, the government might need to stimulate the economy to get things going again.\n\nOption A says the government should run a deficit. That means spending more than it earns in taxes. I think that makes sense because if the government spends more, it can create jobs and boost demand.\n\nOption B is the opposite: running a surplus, which means taking in more taxes than it spends. But in a recession, that might not be helpful because it could mean less money in circulation and potentially making the recession worse.\n\nOption C suggests increasing taxes and government spending. Hmm, that seems contradictory. If you increase taxes, people have less money to spend, but if you increase government spending, that could boost the economy. I'm not sure how those two would balance out.\n\nOption D is decreasing government spending and taxes. That sounds like the government is pulling back, which might not be what the economy needs during a recession.\n\nLet me think about this again. In a recession, private spending often drops because people and businesses are uncertain about the future. So, the government might need to step in and increase its spending to make up for that drop in private sector activity.\n\nAlso, if the government increases spending and/or cuts taxes, that puts more money in people's pockets, which can lead to increased consumption and investment.\n\nNow, regarding deficits and surpluses, I recall that during good economic times, it's better to run surpluses to pay off debt, but during recessions, running deficits can be necessary to stimulate the economy.\n\nSo, option A seems to make the most sense.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the government runs a deficit (option A), it's essentially borrowing money to spend more than it's taking in taxes. This can be inflationary if the economy is already at full capacity, but during a recession, there's usually excess capacity, so the risk of inflation is lower.\n\nOption B, running a surplus, would mean the government is paying down debt, but in a recession, this could exacerbate the downturn by reducing overall demand.\n\nOption C, increasing both taxes and spending, might not be effective because the higher taxes could offset the benefits of increased spending.\n\nOption D, decreasing spending and taxes, could lead to lower government intervention at a time when more is needed.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate fiscal policy to remedy a recession is likely option A: calling for the federal government to run a deficit.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
