                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: x and y are positive integers, and 3x + 7y is divisible by 11. I need to figure out which of the options A through D must also be divisible by 11. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since 3x + 7y is divisible by 11, that means (3x + 7y) \u2261 0 mod 11. I need to see which of the other expressions are also \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nLet's look at option A: 4x + 6y.\n\nI need to see if 4x + 6y is divisible by 11, given that 3x + 7y is. Maybe I can express 4x + 6y in terms of 3x + 7y.\n\nAlternatively, since we're dealing with modular arithmetic, perhaps I can find a relationship between x and y modulo 11.\n\nLet me try to solve for one variable in terms of the other from the given equation.\n\nStarting with 3x + 7y \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nI can solve for x in terms of y:\n\n3x \u2261 -7y mod 11\n\nBut -7y mod 11 is the same as 4y mod 11, because -7 + 11 = 4.\n\nSo, 3x \u2261 4y mod 11.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod 11.\n\nThe inverse of 3 mod 11 is a number z such that 3z \u2261 1 mod 11.\n\nTesting z=4: 3*4=12 \u2261 1 mod 11. Yes, z=4.\n\nSo, x \u2261 4*(4y) mod 11 \u2261 16y mod 11 \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nAlternatively, from 3x \u2261 4y mod 11, multiplying both sides by 4: 12x \u2261 16y mod 11.\n\nSimplify: 12x \u2261 x mod 11, since 12 \u2261 1 mod 11.\n\nSimilarly, 16y \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nSo, x \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nAlright, so x \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nNow, let's look at option A: 4x + 6y.\n\nSubstitute x \u2261 5y:\n\n4*(5y) + 6y \u2261 20y + 6y \u2261 26y \u2261 26 - 2*11 = 26 - 22 = 4y mod 11.\n\nSo, 4x + 6y \u2261 4y mod 11.\n\nThat's not necessarily 0, unless y is a multiple of 11. But the problem doesn't say that y is a multiple of 11. So, option A is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nOkay, moving on to option B: x + y + 5.\n\nAgain, substitute x \u2261 5y:\n\n5y + y + 5 \u2261 6y + 5 mod 11.\n\nThis isn't necessarily 0 mod 11. So, option B is out.\n\nOption C: 9x + 4y.\n\nSubstitute x \u2261 5y:\n\n9*(5y) + 4y \u2261 45y + 4y \u2261 49y \u2261 49 - 4*11 = 49 - 44 = 5y mod 11.\n\nSo, 9x + 4y \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nAgain, not necessarily 0 unless y is a multiple of 11. So, option C is not necessarily divisible by 11.\n\nOption D: 4x - 9y.\n\nSubstitute x \u2261 5y:\n\n4*(5y) - 9y \u2261 20y - 9y \u2261 11y \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nAh, this one comes out to 11y, which is clearly divisible by 11.\n\nSo, option D must be divisible by 11.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that substitution.\n\nWe have x \u2261 5y mod 11.\n\nSo, 4x - 9y \u2261 4*(5y) - 9y \u2261 20y - 9y \u2261 11y \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, since 3x + 7y \u2261 0 mod 11, I can try to express other linear combinations in terms of this.\n\nLet me consider a general linear combination ax + by and see if I can relate it to 3x + 7y.\n\nFrom 3x + 7y \u2261 0 mod 11, I can solve for x in terms of y, as I did before, or maybe find a relationship between a and b such that ax + by is a multiple of 3x + 7y.\n\nBut I think the substitution method I used is valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of linear dependence in modular arithmetic.\n\nBut anyway, time is limited, and option D seems to be the correct choice based on my calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 4x - 9y.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
