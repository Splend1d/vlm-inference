                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem about Doug Dogman and his dog Rover. So, Rover was chasing cars in the street, and Ginny Grandmother, who's 85, swerved to avoid hitting him. In the process, she hit a parked car and got a head injury. Now, Ginny is suing Doug under a strict liability theory. I need to figure out what the court will likely decide.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what strict liability means in this context. Strict liability is a legal doctrine that holds someone responsible for damages or injuries even if they didn't act negligently. In other words, intent or fault isn't considered; if certain conditions are met, the defendant is liable.\n\nIn the case of dog owners, strict liability often applies to injuries caused by dogs, especially if the dog has shown vicious propensities or if there are local laws about controlling pets in public areas.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\n\nThis seems plausible. If Rover chasing cars caused Ginny to swerve and get injured, then Rover's actions are a direct cause of Ginny's injuries. In strict liability, the focus is often on whether the defendant's actions (or inactions) were the cause of the harm.\n\nB. Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal.\n\nThis seems unclear. Just because Rover is a domesticated animal doesn't necessarily mean Doug is not liable. In fact, many strict liability laws pertain to domesticated animals, especially dogs.\n\nC. Doug, unless a statute or ordinance bans unleashed dogs on public streets.\n\nThis introduces the idea of local laws. If there's a law against having unleashed dogs in public streets, and Doug was in violation of that law, that could make him liable. However, the problem doesn't specify whether Rover was unleashed or not. It just says he was chasing cars in the street.\n\nD. Doug, because the strict liability rule for dogs would not include dogs not displaying vicious propensities.\n\nThis option suggests that strict liability for dog owners only applies if the dog has shown vicious tendencies before. In this case, Rover is described as a good, friendly dog who has never hurt anyone, so maybe strict liability doesn't apply here.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says Rover was chasing cars, but had never hurt anyone. So, no history of vicious behavior.\n\nLet me think about this again. Strict liability in dog bite cases often requires that the dog has shown vicious propensities before. This is known as the \"one bite rule\" in some jurisdictions, meaning the owner is liable only if they knew or should have known the dog was dangerous.\n\nBut in this case, it's not a dog bite; it's an injury caused by the dog's actions indirectly. Ginny was injured while trying to avoid hitting Rover.\n\nSo, maybe the strict liability rules are different for non-bite injuries.\n\nI recall that in some places, dog owners are strictly liable for any harm their dogs cause, regardless of the dog's history, if the dog was at large or not properly restrained.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify whether Rover was on a leash or not.\n\nLet's look back at the options.\n\nOption A says Ginny, because Rover was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries. That seems straightforward. If Rover hadn't been in the street chasing cars, Ginny wouldn't have swerved and gotten injured. So, there's a direct causal link.\n\nOption B says Doug, because Retriever is a domesticated animal. I'm not sure about this. Domesticated animals are often subject to strict liability in certain circumstances, so this answer seems unclear.\n\nOption C says Doug, unless there's a law against unleashed dogs on public streets. This might be relevant if Rover was unleashed, but we don't know that from the problem.\n\nOption D says Doug, because strict liability for dogs doesn't include dogs without vicious propensities. This might be applicable since Rover hasn't shown any vicious behavior before.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the key here is understanding what strict liability entails in this specific scenario.\n\nStrict liability usually means that the plaintiff doesn't need to prove the defendant was negligent; they just need to show that the defendant's actions caused the harm.\n\nIn dog cases, strict liability might apply to bites or other specific harms, but perhaps not to indirect injuries like this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Doug is strictly liable for any harm caused by his dog, regardless of how it happened.\n\nBut, considering that Rover was chasing cars, which might be seen as playful behavior for a dog, and he hadn't shown any vicious tendencies, maybe strict liability doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that Rover was in the street chasing cars constitutes a risk that Doug should have foreseen, making him liable.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles again.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, dog owners are strictly liable for bites or injuries caused by their dogs, especially if the dog has a history of aggression.\n\nHowever, in this case, it's not a bite; it's an indirect injury.\n\nPerhaps the court would look at whether Doug failed to control his dog in a way that a reasonable person would, leading to foreseeable harm.\n\nIf that's the case, then maybe Doug is liable.\n\nBut strict liability doesn't require foreseeability; it just requires that the defendant's actions caused the harm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up strict liability with negligence.\n\nIn negligence, the plaintiff has to show that the defendant failed to act as a reasonable person would, and that failure led to harm.\n\nIn strict liability, the focus is on the action itself, not on the defendant's state of mind or negligence.\n\nSo, under strict liability, if Doug's dog caused the harm, Doug is liable, period.\n\nBut, in dog cases, there are often qualifications. For example, the dog may need to have bitten someone or caused harm directly.\n\nHere, Rover didn't directly cause harm; Ginny was injured while trying to avoid hitting him.\n\nSo, is that considered harm caused by the dog?\n\nIt's a bit gray.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court would consider that Rover being in the street chasing cars is a hazardous action, and Doug should be responsible for any injuries that result from it.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe Doug isn't liable because Rover hadn't shown any vicious propensities, and this was just an accidental occurrence.\n\nI need to think about this differently.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: Ginny, because Rover was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\n\nThis seems strong. Cause in fact means that but for Rover's actions, Ginny wouldn't have been injured.\n\nOption D: Doug, because strict liability for dogs doesn't include dogs without vicious propensities.\n\nThis suggests that since Rover hadn't shown vicious behavior, strict liability doesn't apply.\n\nBut, perhaps strict liability applies regardless of the dog's behavior, and the fact that Rover hadn't shown vicious propensities is irrelevant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lack of vicious propensities is relevant in determining whether Doug should be strictly liable.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider real law on this matter.\n\nIn many states, dog owners are strictly liable for bites, but not necessarily for other types of injuries.\n\nIn this case, it's not a bite; it's an injury from swerving to avoid the dog.\n\nSo, perhaps strict liability doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are laws that hold owners strictly liable for any harm caused by their dogs when the dogs are at large or not on the owner's property.\n\nBut again, the problem doesn't specify whether Rover was on a leash or on Doug's property.\n\nAssuming Rover was in the street chasing cars, it's possible he was off-leash.\n\nBut we don't know for sure.\n\nOption C mentions a statute or ordinance banning unleashed dogs on public streets.\n\nIf such a law exists, and Rover was unleashed, then Doug might be liable for violating that law, which led to Ginny's injury.\n\nBut again, we don't know if Rover was unleashed.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me try to simplify.\n\nIf I had to choose one answer, I would go with Option A: Ginny, because Doug's dog was a cause in fact of Ginny's injuries.\n\nThis seems most directly in line with the concept of strict liability, where the focus is on causation rather than on the dog's behavior or the owner's knowledge.\n\nMoreover, in strict liability cases, even if the owner took all possible precautions, if the defendant's actions caused the harm, they are liable.\n\nIn this scenario, Rover's actions directly led to Ginny's injury, so it makes sense that Doug would be held liable.\n\nTherefore, the court would likely find for Ginny.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
