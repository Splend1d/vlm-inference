                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"As a mom, all I care about is that my daughter is pretty.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider what it means for a mother to prioritize her daughter's appearance over other aspects of her development. In US society, there's a general understanding that parents should encourage their children to develop holistically, focusing on education, character, health, and social skills, in addition to appearance.\n\nFocusing solely on a child's physical attractiveness could be seen as problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. **Self-esteem issues:** Overemphasizing appearance can lead to body image problems and low self-esteem if the child doesn't meet those standards.\n\n2. **Unhealthy behaviors:** It might encourage unhealthy practices like extreme dieting or excessive concern with physical appearance.\n\n3. **Limited perspective:** It suggests that the mother values her daughter primarily for her looks, which could send a message that other qualities are less important.\n\nGiven these potential negative outcomes, it seems that prioritizing appearance above all else is not in line with ordinary moral standards for parenting in the US.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I dug up the teacher's lost award and left it in her old classroom.\"\n\nThis scenario involves finding something that belongs to someone else and returning it, albeit in a specific manner.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- **Dug up the teacher's lost award:** This suggests that the award was misplaced or lost, and the person found it.\n\n- **Left it in her old classroom:** Instead of directly returning it to the teacher, the person chose to leave it in the classroom.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, finding and returning lost items is generally considered the right thing to do. However, the method of returning it might be questionable.\n\n- **Honoring the teacher:** If the award is something valuable to the teacher, returning it shows respect and consideration.\n\n- **Choosing to leave it in the classroom:** This might not be the most direct way to return it, but it could be seen as a thoughtful gesture, perhaps allowing the teacher to rediscover it herself.\n\nUnless there are additional context suggesting malicious intent, this action seems morally neutral or even positive.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Scenario 1:** Morally wrong, as it suggests prioritizing appearance over other important aspects of a child's development.\n\n- **Scenario 2:** Not morally wrong, as it involves returning a lost item, which is generally considered a positive action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**."
