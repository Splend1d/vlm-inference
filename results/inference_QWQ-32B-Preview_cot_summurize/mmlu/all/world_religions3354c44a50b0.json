                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the Continental Reformation. The options are years: 1545, 1517, 1492, and 1705. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the Continental Reformation is. I think it's related to the Protestant Reformation that happened in Europe, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that Martin Luther was involved in the Reformation, and he lived around the 1500s.\n\nLet me see, option B is 1517, which is when Martin Luther supposedly nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. That event is often considered the start of the Protestant Reformation. So, maybe B is the answer.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"Continental Reformation.\" I'm not sure if that's just another name for the Protestant Reformation or if it refers to something else. Maybe it's specifically about the Reformation on the European continent, as opposed to Reformation movements in other parts of the world.\n\nOption A is 1545, which is the year the Council of Trent began. The Council of Trent was a Roman Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation, so maybe that's not the start of the Continental Reformation.\n\nOption C is 1492, which is when Columbus discovered America. That seems unrelated to the Reformation.\n\nOption D is 1705, which is much later. That might be during the Enlightenment or something, but I don't think it's related to the start of the Reformation.\n\nSo, going back to option B, 1517, that seems like the most plausible answer. Martin Luther's actions in 1517 are often marked as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation in Europe.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should make sure that there aren't any earlier events that could be considered the start of the Continental Reformation. For example, was there any precursor to Luther's actions?\n\nI know that there were earlier reformers like Jan Hus in the Bohemian Reformation around the early 15th century, but his movement was suppressed, and he was burned at the stake in 1415. So, perhaps that's too early and not directly connected to the Continental Reformation.\n\nAnother thing is that the Reformation wasn't just about Luther; there were other reformers like John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli, but their activities came after Luther's in the 1520s and 1530s.\n\nAlso, the Reformation spread across different countries in Europe, so maybe \"Continental Reformation\" refers to the overall movement across the continent, starting with Luther in Germany.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Continental Reformation\" refers to reforms within the Catholic Church in response to the Protestant challenge, like the Counter-Reformation, which began around the time of the Council of Trent in 1545. But that seems more like a reaction to the Reformation rather than the Reformation itself.\n\nI think I need to consider the context in which the term \"Continental Reformation\" is being used. Is it possible that it refers to a specific branch or phase of the Reformation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Continental\" is used to distinguish it from the English Reformation, which had its own timeline and characteristics.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the Continental Reformation refers to the Reformation on the European mainland, excluding England.\n\nGiven that, the start would still be tied to Martin Luther's actions in 1517.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"Continental Reformation\" is not standard and the question is misphrased or using non-standard terminology.\n\nIn that case, I might need to interpret it broadly as the Reformation on the continent of Europe.\n\nGiven that, again, 1517 seems like the most logical starting point.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is about the spread of the Reformation across the continent, perhaps the answer could be later, like 1545, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the Continental Reformation refers to the period when the Reformation solidified and spread beyond Germany.\n\nFor instance, Zwingli's Reformation in Switzerland started around 1519, and Calvin's in Geneva was in the 1530s.\n\nBut even so, these are still after Luther's initial actions in 1517.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Continental Reformation is considered to have started with the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, which recognized Lutheranism in the Holy Roman Empire, but that seems too late.\n\nWait, the Peace of Augsburg was in 1555, which is after Luther's death in 1546.\n\nThat might be too late to be considered the start of the Reformation.\n\nAnother consideration: the Diet of Worms in 1521, where Luther was excommunicated, could be seen as a pivotal moment in the Reformation, but again, that's after 1517.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that 1517 is the most appropriate answer for the start of the Continental Reformation.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about major events around that time.\n\nIn 1517, Luther posts his Ninety-Five Theses, criticizing indulgences, which sparks a wide debate and leads to his excommunication and the beginning of the Lutheran movement.\n\nThis event is widely regarded as the starting point of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nTherefore, option B, 1517, is likely the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if any of the other dates have significance related to the Reformation.\n\n1545: Council of Trent, which was a response to the Reformation by the Catholic Church, so that's not the start.\n\n1492: Columbus's voyage, unrelated to the Reformation.\n\n1705: That's in the 18th century, well after the Reformation had run its course.\n\nHence, 1517 is the most logical choice.\n\nI think the answer is B. 1517.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
