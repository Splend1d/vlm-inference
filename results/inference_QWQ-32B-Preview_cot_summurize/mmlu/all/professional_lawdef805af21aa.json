                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem. It seems like a contract law scenario involving specific performance and equitable conversion. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a contract between Beeson and Sloan for the purchase of property in La Mirada for $250,000, with a deposit of $12,500 and the balance due at closing on December 1. The property was supposed to be used for building a commercial shopping mall. However, on November 24, the city council rezoned the property for single-family residential use only, which makes it unsuitable for the intended purpose.\n\nBeeson, as the buyer, refused to honor the contract because the property can no longer be used for the commercial shopping mall as agreed. Now, Sloan is seeking specific performance, arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the risk of loss on the buyer. Beeson is arguing that enforcing the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him.\n\nWe need to determine why, if the judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because of one of the options provided: A. Sloan assumed the risk, B. Sloan would be unjustly enriched, C. legal title remained in Sloan, or D. equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nLet's start by understanding what equitable conversion is. Equitable conversion is a doctrine that treats the buyer as the owner of the property for certain purposes once a valid contract has been entered into, even before the actual transfer of title. This means that any risk of loss or change in value typically passes to the buyer once the contract is signed.\n\nIn this case, Sloan is arguing that since there's a valid contract and equitable conversion has occurred, any risk, including changes in zoning, should be borne by the buyer, Beeson.\n\nHowever, Beeson is arguing that enforcing the contract under these new circumstances would be unfair or oppressive. So, if the court agrees with Beeson, it must be based on one of the reasons listed in the options.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Sloan assumed the risk.\n\nThis seems a bit unclear. If Sloan assumed the risk, it might imply that Sloan agreed to bear the risk of certain events occurring. However, in the context of equitable conversion, it's generally the buyer who assumes the risk after the contract is signed. So, this option might not fit well.\n\nB. Sloan would be unjustly enriched.\n\nUnjust enrichment is a legal concept where one party benefits at another's expense without justification. If Sloan were to receive the purchase price for property that can no longer be used for its intended purpose, that might seem unfair to Beeson. However, Sloan is the seller; he's already received a deposit and is seeking to enforce the contract to receive the full purchase price. If the contract is enforced, Sloan would be getting what he's entitled to under the contract. So, it's not clear that Sloan would be unjustly enriched in this scenario.\n\nC. Legal title remained in Sloan.\n\nThis is an interesting point. In most real estate transactions, legal title remains with the seller until closing, when it is transferred to the buyer. Under equitable conversion, even though legal title is still with Sloan, equity treats Beeson as the owner for certain purposes. However, in some jurisdictions, the rules regarding risk of loss and changes in condition may depend on who holds the legal title.\n\nD. Equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nThis option suggests that the court, in its equitable discretion, might relieve Beeson from having to perform under the contract because it would now be a bad bargain for him due to the zoning change.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the most plausible reason why the judgment might be for Beeson is option D: equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nHere's why:\n\nEquitable relief, such as specific performance, is discretionary. Courts consider whether equitability justifies granting specific performance. In this case, the zoning change has fundamentally altered the nature of the property, making it unsuitable for the agreed-upon use.\n\nBeeson entered into the contract based on the assumption that the property could be used for a commercial shopping mall. The zoning change has destroyed that use, and now requiring Beeson to purchase the property for residential use only would likely be a significant departure from what he contracted for and intended to use the property for.\n\nCourts may refuse to enforce a contract via specific performance if doing so would be unfair or oppressive to one party, especially when circumstances have changed significantly since the contract was signed.\n\nIn this scenario, the zoning change is an external event that neither party caused. However, it has made the property worthless for Beeson's intended purpose. Therefore, it might be equitable to relieve Beeson from the contract, especially since he didn't cause the zoning change and it's not due to any fault of his.\n\nOption A, Sloan assumed the risk, doesn't seem to fit because under equitable conversion, it's typically the buyer who assumes the risk after the contract is signed.\n\nOption B, Sloan would be unjustly enriched, is less applicable because Sloan is seeking to enforce the contract to receive the purchase price, which he is entitled to unless there's a valid reason to relieve Beeson from the contract.\n\nOption C, legal title remained in Sloan, might be relevant in some jurisdictions, but the key issue here is the change in the property's use due to zoning, which affects Beeson's ability to use the property as intended.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most appropriate reason why the judgment might be for Beeson: equity will relieve Beeson of a bad bargain.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the doctrine of frustration of purpose might also apply here. Frustration of purpose is a doctrine that may excuse performance when an event occurs after the contract is formed that destroys the fundamental purpose of the contract through no fault of either party. In this case, the zoning change has destroyed the fundamental purpose for which Beeson wanted to purchase the property.\n\nBut since the question is specifically about why the judgment would be for Beeson, and given the options provided, option D seems to be the best fit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
