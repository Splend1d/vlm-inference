                    "text": "To determine which molecules exhibit sp2 hybridization around the central atom, we need to analyze the Lewis structures and the steric number of the central atom in each molecule.\n\nFirst, let's consider CO2 (carbon dioxide):\n\n1. Central atom: Carbon (C)\n2. Valence electrons of C: 4\n3. Oxygen atoms: 2, each contributing 6 valence electrons\n4. Total valence electrons: 4 + 2*(6) = 16\n5. Lewis structure: O=C=O\n6. Steric number of C: 2 (two double bonds)\n7. Hybridization: sp\n\nNext, CO32- (carbonate ion):\n\n1. Central atom: Carbon (C)\n2. Valence electrons of C: 4\n3. Oxygen atoms: 3, each contributing 6 valence electrons\n4. Charge: -2, adding 2 electrons\n5. Total valence electrons: 4 + 3*(6) + 2 = 24\n6. Lewis structure: resonance structures with one double bond and two single bonds to oxygen atoms\n7. Steric number of C: 3 (three sigma bonds)\n8. Hybridization: sp2\n\nNow, NO2- (nitrite ion):\n\n1. Central atom: Nitrogen (N)\n2. Valence electrons of N: 5\n3. Oxygen atoms: 2, each contributing 6 valence electrons\n4. Charge: -1, adding 1 electron\n5. Total valence electrons: 5 + 2*(6) + 1 = 18\n6. Lewis structure: resonance structures with one double bond and one single bond to oxygen atoms\n7. Steric number of N: 3 (three sigma bonds)\n8. Hybridization: sp2\n\nFinally, NO3- (nitrate ion):\n\n1. Central atom: Nitrogen (N)\n2. Valence electrons of N: 5\n3. Oxygen atoms: 3, each contributing 6 valence electrons\n4. Charge: -1, adding 1 electron\n5. Total valence electrons: 5 + 3*(6) + 1 = 24\n6. Lewis structure: resonance structures with one double bond and two single bonds to oxygen atoms\n7. Steric number of N: 3 (three sigma bonds)\n8. Hybridization: sp2\n\nFrom this analysis:\n\n- CO2 has sp hybridization.\n- CO32- has sp2 hybridization.\n- NO2- has sp2 hybridization.\n- NO3- has sp2 hybridization.\n\nTherefore, the molecules that exhibit sp2 hybridization around the central atom are CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. CO2 and CO32- \u2192 CO2 has sp hybridization.\n\nB. NO2- and NO3- \u2192 Both have sp2 hybridization.\n\nC. CO32- and NO3- \u2192 Both have sp2 hybridization.\n\nD. CO32-, NO2- and NO3- \u2192 All three have sp2 hybridization.\n\nOption D includes CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-, all of which have sp2 hybridization. However, the question might be expecting the combination that exclusively includes molecules with sp2 hybridization, excluding CO2 which has sp hybridization.\n\nBut since CO32-, NO2-, and NO3- all have sp2 hybridization, option D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
