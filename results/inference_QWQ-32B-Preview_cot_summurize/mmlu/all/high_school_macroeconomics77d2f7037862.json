                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we have a bank with $1000 in checking deposits, and it's required to reserve $250. We need to find out the reserve ratio, the amount of excess reserves, and the size of the money multiplier. There are four options, and we have to pick the correct one.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the reserve ratio is. The reserve ratio is the proportion of deposits that the bank is required to hold as reserves. It's usually expressed as a percentage. So, if the bank has $1000 in deposits and must reserve $250, the reserve ratio would be $250 divided by $1000, which is 0.25, or 25%. So, that matches option A and C.\n\nNext, excess reserves are the amount of reserves the bank has beyond what is required. If the bank has $250 in required reserves, and let's say it has more than that, the excess would be the total reserves minus the required reserves. But in this question, it only mentions that the bank is required to reserve $250, and it has $1000 in deposits. It doesn't specify if the bank has more than $250 in reserves. Assuming that the bank only has the required reserves, then excess reserves would be zero. But that's not the case here because options suggest it has $750 in excess reserves.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. If the bank has $1000 in deposits and is required to reserve $250, then the excess reserves would be total reserves minus required reserves. But the question doesn't specify the total reserves the bank has. Maybe it's assuming that the bank has more reserves beyond the required $250.\n\nLet me look back at the question: \"If a bank has $1000 in checking deposits and the bank is required to reserve $250, what is the reserve ratio? How much does the bank have in excess reserves? What is the size of the money multiplier?\"\n\nHmm, it only says the bank is required to reserve $250, but it doesn't specify how much the bank actually has in reserves. Maybe it's assuming that the bank has more than $250 in reserves, and the excess is $750. Let's see.\n\nIf the bank has $1000 in deposits and is required to reserve $250, and if it has $1000 in reserves, then excess reserves would be $1000 - $250 = $750. That matches option A and C.\n\nBut wait, if the bank has $1000 in deposits and $1000 in reserves, that seems odd because normally reserves are a fraction of deposits, not equal to deposits. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me recall the formula for excess reserves: Excess Reserves = Total Reserves - Required Reserves.\n\nIn this case, Required Reserves are $250, but Total Reserves are not given. However, options A and C suggest excess reserves of $750, which would mean Total Reserves are $250 (required) + $750 (excess) = $1000.\n\nSo, Total Reserves are $1000, which is equal to the deposits of $1000. That might be possible, but it seems like the bank isn't lending anything out if it's holding all deposits as reserves.\n\nMoving on to the money multiplier. The money multiplier is calculated as 1 divided by the reserve ratio. If the reserve ratio is 25%, or 0.25, then the money multiplier would be 1 / 0.25 = 4. That matches option C.\n\nOption A says M = 1/4, which is 0.25, but that doesn't make sense because the money multiplier should be the reciprocal of the reserve ratio.\n\nOption B has a reserve ratio of 75%, which would make the money multiplier 1 / 0.75 \u2248 1.33, but that's not listed.\n\nOption D has a reserve ratio of 75% and M = 1/4, which is inconsistent.\n\nGiven that, option C seems correct: reserve ratio is 25%, excess reserves are $750, and the money multiplier is 4.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nReserve ratio: $250 / $1000 = 25%, correct.\n\nExcess reserves: $750, which would mean total reserves are $1000 ($250 required + $750 excess), correct.\n\nMoney multiplier: 1 / 0.25 = 4, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 25% $750 M = 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
