I'm looking at the Exner Scoring System for the Rorschach Inkblot Test, and I need to identify which of these categories isn't part of it: Color, Popular, Content, Location.\n\nFirst, I know that the Exner Scoring System is a comprehensive method developed by John Exner to standardize the scoring and interpretation of the Rorschach test. It breaks down responses into various components to analyze different aspects of an individual's perception and cognition.\n\nI recall that \"Color\" is indeed one of the scoring categories. In the Rorschach test, the way a person attends to and describes colors in the inkblots can provide insights into their cognitive processes and emotional states.\n\n\"Content\" also seems familiar. The content of a response refers to what the respondent sees in the inkblot, such as human figures, animals, or abstract designs. This category helps in understanding the respondent's perceptual style and symbolic thinking.\n\n\"Location\" likely refers to where on the inkblot the respondent focuses their attention. Some people might focus on the whole blot, while others might zero in on a specific detail. This can indicate aspects of their cognitive style, such as global versus local processing.\n\nNow, \"Popular\" isn't a term I recall from the Exner Scoring System. I think it might be a distractor, possibly confused with \"popular response\" or something similar. In the Rorschach test, some responses are more common than others, but I don't believe \"Popular\" is an official category in the Exner system.\n\nTo confirm, I should probably look up the Exner Scoring System to see the exact categories it includes. However, since this is a question from a test bank, and I'm supposed to choose the option that is not a category, I'm going to go with \"Popular.\"\n\nSo, my answer is B. Popular.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
