                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an object floating in water, and I need to find out what percentage of its volume is above the water surface. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I know that when an object floats, it displaces an amount of water equal to its own weight. That's Archimedes' principle, right? So, the weight of the water displaced by the part of the object that's underwater should be equal to the weight of the object.\n\nGiven that, I can set up the equation:\n\nWeight of the object = Weight of the water displaced\n\nI know the weight of the object is 6 N. Now, I need to find the weight of the water displaced.\n\nThe volume of the object is 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3. But since it's floating, only a part of it is submerged in water. Let's call the volume submerged V_sub.\n\nSo, Weight of water displaced = density of water \u00d7 V_sub \u00d7 gravity\n\nI need to remember that density of water is 1000 kg/m^3, and gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nBut wait, in the options, there are percentages, so maybe I can find the ratio of V_sub to the total volume and then subtract from 100% to get the percentage above water.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, Weight of object = weight of water displaced\n\n6 N = density of water \u00d7 V_sub \u00d7 g\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n6 = 1000 \u00d7 V_sub \u00d7 9.8\n\nNow, solving for V_sub:\n\nV_sub = 6 / (1000 \u00d7 9.8) = 6 / 9800 = 0.0006122 m^3\n\nNow, the total volume is 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3, which is 0.002 m^3.\n\nSo, the volume above water is total volume minus V_sub:\n\nV_above = 0.002 - 0.0006122 = 0.0013878 m^3\n\nNow, to find the percentage above water:\n\n( V_above / total volume ) \u00d7 100% = (0.0013878 / 0.002) \u00d7 100% \u2248 69.39%\n\nWait, that's approximately 70%. But let's check the options again.\n\nA. 12%\n\nB. 30%\n\nC. 60%\n\nD. 70%\n\nSo, D seems to be the answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me recalculate V_sub:\n\nV_sub = 6 / (1000 \u00d7 9.8) = 6 / 9800 = 0.0006122 m^3\n\nThen, V_above = 0.002 - 0.0006122 = 0.0013878 m^3\n\nPercentage above = (0.0013878 / 0.002) \u00d7 100% = 69.39%, which is closest to 70%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to look at this.\n\nI recall that the fraction of the object submerged is equal to the ratio of the object's density to the density of water.\n\nBecause, density of object = weight / volume = 6 N / 0.002 m^3 = 3000 kg/m^3\n\nBut wait, weight is in newtons, so to get mass, I need to divide by gravity.\n\nMass of object = weight / g = 6 / 9.8 \u2248 0.6122 kg\n\nThen, density of object = mass / volume = 0.6122 / 0.002 = 306.1 kg/m^3\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because density should be in kg/m^3, and 306.1 kg/m^3 seems too low for the object to float in water, which has a density of 1000 kg/m^3.\n\nWait, no. If the object's density is less than water, it should float, which is the case here.\n\nSo, the fraction submerged should be equal to the ratio of the object's density to the water's density.\n\nFraction submerged = density of object / density of water = 306.1 / 1000 \u2248 0.3061\n\nTherefore, percentage submerged is approximately 30.61%, so above water is 100% - 30.61% \u2248 69.39%, which again is about 70%.\n\nWait, but in the first method, I got the same result. So, why is the answer coming out to be 70%, but in the options, 70% is there.\n\nBut in the initial calculation, I got 69.39%, which rounds to 69%, but the closest option is 70%.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the density of the object.\n\nMass = weight / g = 6 / 9.8 \u2248 0.6122 kg\n\nDensity = mass / volume = 0.6122 / 0.002 = 306.1 kg/m^3\n\nFraction submerged = 306.1 / 1000 = 0.3061, so percentage submerged is 30.61%\n\nTherefore, percentage above water is 100% - 30.61% = 69.39%\n\nBut according to this, it should be 70%, but in the options, 70% is there.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are approximate, and 70% is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider more significant figures.\n\nLet me calculate more accurately.\n\nMass = 6 / 9.80665 \u2248 0.6116 kg\n\nDensity = 0.6116 / 0.002 = 305.8 kg/m^3\n\nFraction submerged = 305.8 / 1000 = 0.3058, so percentage submerged is 30.58%\n\nTherefore, percentage above water is 100% - 30.58% = 69.42%\n\nStill approximately 70%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nUsing buoyancy force equals weight:\n\nBuoyancy force = weight of water displaced = density_water \u00d7 V_sub \u00d7 g\n\nWeight of object = mass \u00d7 g = 0.6116 \u00d7 9.80665 \u2248 6 N\n\nSo, density_water \u00d7 V_sub \u00d7 g = 6 N\n\nTherefore, V_sub = 6 / (1000 \u00d7 9.80665) \u2248 0.0006116 m^3\n\nTotal volume = 0.002 m^3\n\nV_above = 0.002 - 0.0006116 \u2248 0.0013884 m^3\n\nPercentage above = (0.0013884 / 0.002) \u00d7 100% \u2248 69.42%\n\nAgain, approximately 70%.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be D. 70%.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I need to consider the precision of the given values.\n\nThe volume is given as 2 \u00d7 10^-3 m^3, which is two significant figures.\n\nThe weight is 6 N, which is one significant figure.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer should be reported to one significant figure, which would be 70%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 70%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
