                    "text": "To determine which pair of ratios cannot form a proportion, I need to check if the ratios in each pair are equivalent. If two ratios are equivalent, they form a proportion. So, I'll compare each pair by simplifying the ratios or cross-multiplying to see if they are equal.\n\nLet's start with option A: 4 over 5 and 24 over 30.\n\nFirst, I can simplify 24 over 30. Both 24 and 30 are divisible by 6, so 24 \u00f7 6 = 4 and 30 \u00f7 6 = 5. So, 24 over 30 simplifies to 4 over 5. Therefore, 4 over 5 is equal to 24 over 30, so they form a proportion.\n\nNext, option B: 4 over 5 and 20 over 25.\n\nLet's simplify 20 over 25. Both 20 and 25 are divisible by 5, so 20 \u00f7 5 = 4 and 25 \u00f7 5 = 5. So, 20 over 25 simplifies to 4 over 5. Therefore, 4 over 5 is equal to 20 over 25, so they form a proportion.\n\nNow, option C: 36 over 45 and 4 over 5.\n\nFirst, simplify 36 over 45. Both 36 and 45 are divisible by 9, so 36 \u00f7 9 = 4 and 45 \u00f7 9 = 5. So, 36 over 45 simplifies to 4 over 5. Therefore, 36 over 45 is equal to 4 over 5, so they form a proportion.\n\nFinally, option D: 4 over 5 and 20 over 30.\n\nLet's simplify 20 over 30. Both 20 and 30 are divisible by 10, so 20 \u00f7 10 = 2 and 30 \u00f7 10 = 3. So, 20 over 30 simplifies to 2 over 3. Now, 4 over 5 is not equal to 2 over 3 because 4 times 3 is 12 and 5 times 2 is 10, and 12 \u2260 10. Therefore, 4 over 5 is not equal to 20 over 30, so they do not form a proportion.\n\nSo, the pair of ratios that cannot form a proportion is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
