                    "text": "C. the preservation of their property\n\nJohn Locke, in his philosophical works, particularly in \"Two Treatises of Government,\" outlines that individuals enter into a social contract and form a commonwealth primarily to preserve their natural rights, especially the right to property. Locke believed that in the state of nature, people have certain inalienable rights, including life, liberty, and property. However, in the state of nature, there is no clear authority to protect these rights, leading to potential conflicts and injustices.\n\nTo address this issue, individuals agree to form a government that can enforce laws and protect their rights more effectively. Thus, the main purpose of forming a commonwealth, according to Locke, is to preserve their property and other natural rights in a more secure and orderly manner than what is possible in the state of nature.\n\nOption A, domination over other commonwealths, is not a primary end according to Locke. His focus was on the internal governance and protection of individual rights within a society, rather than on external expansion or domination.\n\nOption B, the preservation of the state of nature, contradicts Locke's reasoning for forming a commonwealth. He argued that the state of nature has inconveniences that necessitate the establishment of a government to provide stability and protection.\n\nOption D, the preservation of their absolute power, also misrepresents Locke's views. Locke believed in limiting governmental power to protect individual rights, not in preserving absolute power for individuals. In fact, he was critical of absolute monarchies and advocated for a government with separated powers and the consent of the governed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, the preservation of their property."
