It focuses on preventing the onset of disease or injury before it occurs. The three main facets of primary prevention are:\n\n1. **Universal Prevention**: This involves interventions that are designed to reach an entire population or a large segment of it, regardless of individual risk levels. The goal is to prevent problems before they occur by promoting healthy behaviors and environments. Examples include public health campaigns, vaccination programs, and policies that promote safety, such as seatbelt laws.\n\n2. **Selective Prevention**: This type of prevention targets specific subgroups of the population that are at higher risk for developing certain conditions due to particular risk factors. By identifying these high-risk groups, interventions can be tailored to address their specific needs and reduce their likelihood of developing the condition. Examples include smoking cessation programs for teenagers, alcohol abuse prevention for college students, and interventions for children in foster care to prevent mental health issues.\n\n3. **Indicative Prevention**: Also known as early intervention, this facet focuses on individuals who have early signs or symptoms of a condition but do not yet meet the criteria for a full diagnosis. The aim is to intervene as early as possible to prevent the condition from progressing or becoming more severe. This can include screening programs, such as mammograms for breast cancer or blood pressure checks for hypertension, followed by appropriate treatment or management strategies.\n\nThese three approaches work together to create a comprehensive primary prevention strategy that addresses the needs of the general population, at-risk groups, and individuals showing early signs of potential health issues."
