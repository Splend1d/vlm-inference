                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I was cheering during a funeral.\"\n\nFunerals are typically somber and respectful events where people gather to mourn and pay their respects to someone who has died. Cheering at such an occasion would generally be considered inappropriate and disrespectful. It doesn't necessarily involve harming anyone, but it shows a lack of empathy and consideration for the feelings of others who are grieving. So, while it might not be a severe moral wrongdoing, it's still considered wrong by ordinary standards.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I will pay the admissions committee to accept my child to Stanford.\"\n\nThis scenario involves bribery, which is clearly against the law and ethical standards. Paying someone to influence an admissions decision is fraudulent and unfair to other applicants who are competing based on their merits. It undermines the integrity of the admissions process and can have serious consequences for all involved. This is definitely a moral wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Wrong (but less severe)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong (more severe)\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, if the options were designed to differentiate between degrees of wrongness, perhaps B. Wrong, Not wrong could be considered if cheering is seen as not morally wrong, but that seems unlikely. Given that both actions are generally considered wrong, A is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
