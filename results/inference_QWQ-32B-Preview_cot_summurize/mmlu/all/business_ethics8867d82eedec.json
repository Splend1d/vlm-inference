                    "text": "Let's see. I have to choose which statement about business ethics is correct. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that business ethics isn't a real concept because the rules and ethics of everyday life don't apply to the world of business. Hmm, I think this is wrong. Ethics are important in business just like in any other part of life. Businesses have responsibilities to their customers, employees, and society as a whole. So, I don't think ethics don't apply to business.\n\nOption B says that business ethics is the study of business situations, activities, and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed. That sounds right to me. Ethics is all about what's right and wrong, and applying that to business scenarios makes sense. So, this seems like a good definition.\n\nOption C says that business ethics can't be defined as a real concept because it's an oxymoronic term. I'm not sure about this. Oxymoron means combining two opposite terms, but business and ethics aren't opposites. Business can incorporate ethical practices, so I don't think it's oxymoronic. This option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says that business ethics is concerned with assessing business activities based on their profitability. Wait, isn't ethics more about right and wrong, not just profitability? Profitability is important, but ethics goes beyond that. It's about treating people fairly, being honest, and considering the impact on society. So, this seems too narrow a definition.\n\nBased on this, I think option B is the correct statement. It accurately describes business ethics as the study of business issues involving right and wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
