                    "text": "In the given conditional proposition: \"When the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it,\" we need to identify the antecedent.\n\nFirst, let's understand what an antecedent is in a conditional statement. A conditional statement is typically structured as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. The antecedent is the condition that implies the consequent.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statement: \"When the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased to fit the \"If P, then Q\" structure more clearly. It would be: \"If the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\"\n\nFrom this, it's evident that:\n\n- P (antecedent): The university raises tuition.\n\n- Q (consequent): Either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent is \"The university raises tuition.\"\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nC. The board of trustees prevents it.\n\nD. The board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\n\nThe correct answer is A. The university raises tuition.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that options B and D are parts of the consequent, and option C is the negation of part of the consequent. But the antecedent is clearly A.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check to ensure there's no confusion. Sometimes, conditional statements can be worded in ways that make it tricky to identify the antecedent and consequent.\n\nLet's break it down again:\n\nThe original statement is: \"When the university raises tuition, then either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\"\n\nThe phrase \"when the university raises tuition\" is indicating a condition, which is equivalent to \"if the university raises tuition.\" So, again, the antecedent is \"The university raises tuition.\"\n\nThe consequent is \"either the governor approves of it or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\"\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any ambiguity here. Therefore, the antecedent is indeed option A.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any logical equivalence or rearrangement that might change this.\n\nFor example, sometimes conditional statements can be rewritten using logical equivalences, but in this case, the structure is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the terms involved.\n\nLet's look at the options again:\n\nA. The university raises tuition.\n\nThis directly matches the condition stated in the original proposition.\n\nB. The governor approves of it.\n\nThis is one part of the consequent.\n\nC. The board of trustees prevents it.\n\nThis is the negation of part of the consequent, as the consequent includes \"or the board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\"\n\nD. The board of trustees doesn't prevent it.\n\nThis is the other part of the consequent.\n\nSo, none of the other options represent the condition that triggers the consequent; only option A does that.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible misinterpretation of the word \"when.\"\n\nIn some contexts, \"when\" can be used to indicate a simultaneous occurrence rather than a conditional relationship. However, in this statement, \"when the university raises tuition, then...\" clearly sets up a conditional relationship, where the raising of tuition is the condition that leads to the consequent.\n\nAdditionally, the use of \"then\" further reinforces that this is a conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, there is no reasonable doubt that the antecedent is \"The university raises tuition.\"\n\nSo, the final answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
