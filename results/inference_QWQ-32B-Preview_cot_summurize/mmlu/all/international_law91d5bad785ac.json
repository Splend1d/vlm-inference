There are four options provided, and I need to pick the one that best describes the major difference between these two concepts.\n\nOption A says that naturalism is based on universal and objective rules, while positivism is based on a legal system created by states according to their interests and desires. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Naturalism often refers to the idea that there are inherent, natural rights or laws that exist independently of human creation. Positivism, on the other hand, asserts that law is a human construct, created by societies and states through their institutions. So, this option seems plausible.\n\nOption B states that naturalism serves only the theory of human rights law, whereas positivism has a wider and more general scope. I'm not sure about this one. Naturalism can be applied to various areas beyond just human rights, like morality or ethics in general. Positivism also has a broad application, not just limited to law. So, this option doesn't seem entirely accurate.\n\nOption C says that naturalism concerns the underlying values of international society, while positivism focuses on the international rules as such. This seems similar to option A, but perhaps a bit more specific to international law. Naturalism might emphasize the moral or ethical foundations of international law, whereas positivism would focus on the actual rules and regulations established by international bodies or treaties.\n\nOption D suggests that naturalism is advocated outside of Europe, while positivism is a Euro-centric theory. I don't think that's accurate. Both naturalism and positivism have historical roots in European philosophy. For example, natural law theory has ancient Greek and Roman origins, while legal positivism developed in Europe during the modern period. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nBetween options A and C, both seem reasonable, but option A provides a clearer distinction between naturalism and positivism in terms of their foundational principles. Naturalism is based on universal, objective rules that exist independently of human creation, while positivism is based on rules created by states based on their interests and desires.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
