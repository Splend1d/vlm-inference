                    "text": "Let's see what Hare is saying here. So, he's talking about someone who refuses to make any positive moral judgments. That means this person isn't making any affirmations about what's right or wrong, good or bad in a moral sense.\n\nOption A says that such a person is irrational. Now, irrationality generally means that someone's thoughts or actions don't make sense or are not based on reason. If someone refuses to make moral judgments, is that necessarily irrational? Well, it might depend on the context. Some people might argue that morality is a fundamental part of human reasoning, so refusing to make moral judgments could be seen as irrational. On the other hand, maybe this person has a coherent system where they don't see morality as applicable or relevant in certain situations. So, I'm not entirely sure about this one.\n\nOption B says the person is immoral. Immoral means acting against moral principles. But if someone refuses to make moral judgments, are they necessarily acting immorally? It's possible that they're just not making judgments, but their actions could still be moral or immoral depending on other factors. So, this seems a bit off.\n\nOption C says that such a person cannot coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests. Hmm, that's interesting. If someone refuses to make positive moral judgments, does that mean they can't use moral arguments to protect themselves? Well, if they don't accept moral judgments, then using morality to protect their interests might be inconsistent. They can't claim moral rights or protections if they don't\u8ba4\u53efmoral judgments in the first place. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says that such a person couldn't possibly exist. That seems too strong. There are plenty of philosophical positions where people might refuse to make positive moral judgments, like moral relativists, moral skeptics, or even amoralists. So, it's definitely possible for such people to exist.\n\nConsidering these options, I think option C makes the most sense. If someone refuses to make positive moral judgments, they might not be able to coherently use morality to protect their own interests because that would require accepting some moral principles, which they are refusing to do.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Hare is saying something else. Perhaps he thinks that refusing to make moral judgments is itself irrational, which would align with option A. Or maybe he thinks that such a refusal makes the person immoral, which is option B. Option D seems unlikely because, as I said, there are philosophical positions that reject or question moral judgments.\n\nPerhaps Hare is arguing that such a refusal leads to incoherence, especially if the person still tries to use moral language or concepts. That might connect back to option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's suggesting that refusing to make moral judgments is impossible, that every action or inaction implies some moral stance, making option D a possibility.\n\nWait, option D says \"couldn't possibly exist,\" which seems extreme. But perhaps Hare is arguing that trying to refuse all moral judgments leads to some kind of logical inconsistency, making such a position untenable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's saying that refusing to make positive moral judgments is irrational because morality is a necessary framework for evaluating actions, making option A more likely.\n\nI need to think more carefully about this.\n\nLet's consider what it means to make a positive moral judgment. A positive moral judgment affirms that something is good or right. Refusing to make any positive moral judgments would mean never affirming anything as morally good or right.\n\nNow, if someone refuses to make any positive moral judgments, are they being irrational? Well, irrationality is about inconsistency or lack of reasoning. So, if their refusal is based on a consistent philosophical position, like ethical nihilism, which holds that moral facts don't exist, then it might not be irrational. Unless, of course, there are arguments that show ethical nihilism is inconsistent.\n\nOption B says the person is immoral. But immorality typically involves acting against accepted moral standards. If someone refuses to make moral judgments, their actions might still be in accordance with moral standards, even if they don't acknowledge them. So, I don't think refusal to make moral judgments directly implies immorality.\n\nOption C suggests that such a person cannot coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests. This seems more plausible. If you refuse to make moral judgments, and someone threatens you, you might want to say, \"That's immoral, you shouldn't do that.\" But if you don't accept moral judgments, that statement doesn't make sense coming from you. It's like borrowing concepts you don't believe in to serve your own purposes, which could be incoherent.\n\nOption D is that such a person couldn't possibly exist. But we know that people hold various beliefs about morality, including refusal to make positive moral judgments. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nGiven this analysis, I think option C is the most appropriate. Hare is likely claiming that a person who refuses to make any positive moral judgments cannot coherently invoke morality to protect their own interests.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if Hare might be saying that such a refusal is irrational, as in option A.\n\nIf refusing to make moral judgments leads to inability to make decisions or act in the world, that might be considered irrational. However, many philosophical positions that refuse or question moral judgments still allow for decision-making based on other principles, like personal preferences or consequences.\n\nAlternatively, if the refusal leads to paradoxes or inconsistencies in their beliefs, that could be seen as irrational. For example, if they refuse to make moral judgments but still make claims about what one ought to do, there might be inconsistencies.\n\nBut overall, I still think option C is the best fit based on Hare's likely argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
