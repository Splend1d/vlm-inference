I remember that it's the initial stage where information from our senses is stored briefly before being either discarded or transferred to short-term memory. There are different types of sensory memory for each sense, like iconic memory for visual information and echoic memory for auditory information.\n\nNow, the question is asking about how long images and sounds are maintained in sensory memory. So, I need to think about both iconic and echoic memory durations.\n\nFirst, iconic memory. I think it holds visual information for a very short time, maybe around a quarter of a second or so. It's like a snapshot that fades away quickly unless attention is focused on it, in which case it can be transferred to short-term memory.\n\nEchoic memory, on the other hand, holds auditory information. I believe it lasts a bit longer than iconic memory, maybe up to four seconds or so. So, sounds can linger in echoic memory for a few seconds after they've been heard.\n\nGiven that, the total time for both images and sounds in sensory memory would be the combined duration of iconic and echoic memory. So, if iconic memory is about 0.25 seconds and echoic is up to 4 seconds, the total would be less than 5 seconds.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. an indefinite period of time. That doesn't sound right for sensory memory, as it's designed to hold information very briefly.\n\nB. minutes to days, depending on the depth of encoding. This sounds more like long-term memory, where deeper processing leads to longer retention.\n\nC. about 60 to 90 seconds. That seems too long for sensory memory.\n\nD. less than 5 seconds. This aligns with what I recall about iconic and echoic memory durations.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. less than 5 seconds.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check the exact durations of iconic and echoic memory.\n\nI remember that iconic memory was discovered by George Sperling in the 1960s through partial report experiments, where participants were able to recall a few letters from a matrix after the presentation, suggesting that they had a brief visual image to work from.\n\nEchoic memory was also studied, and it's known that auditory information can be held for a few seconds, allowing us to hear the end of a word or phrase and still process the beginning.\n\nSo, combining both, the total time in sensory memory would indeed be less than 5 seconds.\n\nOption A is definitely not correct because sensory memory is very short-lived.\n\nOption B refers to long-term memory, where information can be retained for much longer, but that's not relevant here.\n\nOption C, 60 to 90 seconds, is longer than the typical durations for sensory memory.\n\nTherefore, D seems to be the right answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
