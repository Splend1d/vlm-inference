                    "text": "So I've got this question about how Large City should report the expense for new roads in their statement of activities. The city spent $800,000 on the roads, which have a 20-year useful life, and they're not using the modified approach to account for them. I need to figure out what amount to report as an expense for the current year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"modified approach\" is. I think it's a method used in governmental accounting to handle certain capital assets, but since the city isn't using that approach, I have to figure out the standard way to account for road expenses.\n\nIn governmental accounting, roads are typically considered capital assets because they have a long useful life and provide benefits over multiple years. Therefore, the cost shouldn't be expensed all at once but should be allocated over their useful life through depreciation or amortization.\n\nHowever, governmental accounting standards might treat infrastructure differently. I recall that Statement No. 34 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requires governments to capitalize infrastructure assets, like roads, and depreciate them over their useful lives.\n\nGiven that, the $800,000 spent on new roads should be capitalized as an asset, and then depreciated annually over the 20-year useful life.\n\nTo find the annual depreciation expense, I would divide the cost of the roads by their useful life:\n\n$800,000 \u00f7 20 years = $40,000 per year.\n\nSo, the expense reported in the statement of activities for the current year should be $40,000.\n\nWait a minute, but the question mentions that the city does not use the modified approach. I need to make sure what the \"modified approach\" refers to in this context.\n\nI think the modified approach might be referring to the modified approach to accounting for infrastructure costs, which allows governments to account for infrastructure assets differently, perhaps not depreciating them. But since the city isn't using that approach, they would have to use the standard method, which is to capitalize and depreciate the infrastructure over its useful life.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the initial thought, the expense for the current year would be $40,000.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $20,000\n\nC. $40,000\n\nD. $800,000\n\nOption C seems to be the correct one based on my calculation.\n\nBut why is option B $20,000? Maybe there's something about the accounting method that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city capitalizes the roads but doesn't depreciate them for some reason. But according to GASB standards, they should depreciate them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the city uses some other method, like reporting the expenditure in the governmental activities without depreciating it.\n\nBut based on GASB standards, infrastructure assets should be depreciated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city capitalizes the roads but reports the expenditure in the government activities column as an other financing source and then depreciates it over time.\n\nBut regardless, the expense related to the roads in the statement of activities should reflect the depreciation for the year.\n\nSo, $40,000 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if they don't depreciate the roads, then maybe the expense is $0, which is option A. But that seems incorrect based on GASB standards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $800,000 is reported as an expense in the period it's incurred, which would be option D. But that wouldn't make sense for a capital asset with a long useful life.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different method for roads, but I think depreciating over the useful life is the standard approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the modified approach refers to something else entirely.\n\nWait, perhaps the modified approach is related to the modified accrual basis of accounting used in governmental activities.\n\nBut modified accrual accounting typically applies to the measurement focus for revenues and certain expenditures, not specifically to capital assets.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the modified approach in this context refers to the modified accrual basis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the modified approach refers to a method of accounting for roads where they're not depreciated, but that seems contrary to GASB standards.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the city capitalizes the roads and depreciates them, but reports the depreciation differently in the financial statements.\n\nBut in the statement of activities, the depreciation expense related to governmental activities should be reported.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is $40,000, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different method for roads in terms of their useful life or depreciation method, but based on the information provided, using straight-line depreciation over 20 years seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the useful life is different for roads, but the question specifies a 20-year useful life.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a requirement to report the expenditure in the period incurred, but again, for capital assets, they should be capitalized and depreciated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the city uses some form of capital projects fund, and the expenditure is reported there, but the depreciation would still be reported in the government-wide statements.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the statement of activities, which is part of the government-wide financial statements.\n\nTherefore, I think the expense for the current year related to the new roads should be the annual depreciation of $40,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $40,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
