                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a machine takes 12 minutes to fill 200 bottles of soda. I need to find out how many minutes it will take the same machine to fill 500 bottles at that same rate. The options are 25, 28, 30, or 40 minutes. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the rate at which the machine fills the bottles. If it fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, then I can calculate how many bottles it fills per minute. That might help me find out how long it takes to fill 500 bottles.\n\nSo, bottles per minute would be 200 bottles divided by 12 minutes. Let me do that calculation: 200 divided by 12. That's, let's see, 12 times 16 is 192, so maybe 16.67 bottles per minute. Yeah, 200 divided by 12 is approximately 16.67 bottles per minute.\n\nNow, if I know the machine fills about 16.67 bottles each minute, I can find out how many minutes it takes to fill 500 bottles by dividing 500 by 16.67. Let's try that: 500 divided by 16.67. Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to do this.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should use proportions here. If 200 bottles take 12 minutes, then 500 bottles will take x minutes. I can set up a proportion: 200 bottles is to 12 minutes as 500 bottles is to x minutes. So, 200/12 = 500/x. That might be easier to solve.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n200 / 12 = 500 / x\n\nNow, I can cross-multiply to solve for x. So, 200 * x = 12 * 500.\n\nThat gives me 200x = 6000.\n\nNow, divide both sides by 200 to solve for x: x = 6000 / 200.\n\nThat's x = 30 minutes.\n\nSo, according to this, it should take 30 minutes to fill 500 bottles.\n\nBut let me double-check if I did this correctly. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach could be to find out how many 200-bottle sets are in 500 bottles and then multiply by the time it takes to fill one set.\n\nSo, 500 divided by 200 is 2.5. That means there are 2.5 sets of 200 bottles in 500 bottles.\n\nSince each set takes 12 minutes, 2.5 sets would take 2.5 times 12 minutes.\n\nLet me calculate that: 2.5 * 12 = 30 minutes.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, it seems like 30 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this. Maybe using rates again.\n\nIf the machine fills 200 bottles in 12 minutes, the rate is 200 bottles per 12 minutes, which is the same as 200/12 bottles per minute.\n\nSimplifying that, 200 divided by 12 is approximately 16.67 bottles per minute, like I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, to fill 500 bottles at 16.67 bottles per minute, time would be 500 divided by 16.67.\n\nLet me do that division: 500 \u00f7 16.67.\n\nWell, 16.67 times 30 is 500. Yes, because 16.67 * 30 = 500.1, which is essentially 500.\n\nSo, again, that gives me 30 minutes.\n\nI think I'm consistent in getting 30 minutes as the answer. Let me see if there's any other perspective I should consider.\n\nPerhaps I should consider units to make sure I'm not making a mistake. In the proportion I set up, I had bottles over minutes equal to bottles over minutes, which should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of minutes per bottle and then scale up.\n\nFirst, find out how many minutes it takes to fill one bottle, and then multiply by 500.\n\nSo, 12 minutes for 200 bottles means minutes per bottle is 12 divided by 200, which is 0.06 minutes per bottle.\n\nThen, for 500 bottles, it would be 500 times 0.06, which is 30 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI feel pretty confident now that 30 minutes is the correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 30 minutes is one of the choices, so that should be the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me quickly go through why the other options are incorrect.\n\nA. 25 minutes: That would be too short, because 200 bottles take 12 minutes, so 500 bottles should take more than 12 minutes, and 25 is less than 30, which I've calculated as the correct time.\n\nB. 28 minutes: That's still less than 30 minutes and doesn't align with my calculations.\n\nD. 40 minutes: That's longer than 30 minutes, which might be a mistake if someone miscalculated the proportion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 30 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 30 \\ \\text{minutes}} \\]"
