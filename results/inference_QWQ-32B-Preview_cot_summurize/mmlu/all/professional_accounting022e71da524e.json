                    "text": "So I've got this question about audit procedures for accounts receivable. During the interim audit, the auditor finds a bunch of unexpected errors in the accounts receivable, which leads to a change in the risk assessment. Now, I need to choose the most appropriate audit response from the options given.\n\nLet me read the options again to make sure I understand them:\n\nA. Move detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim.\n\nB. Increase the dollar threshold of vouching customer invoices.\n\nC. Send negative accounts receivable confirmations instead of positive accounts receivable confirmations.\n\nD. Use more experienced audit team members to perform year-end testing.\n\nOkay, so first things first, what does it mean that there are numerous unexpected errors found in accounts receivable during the interim audit? Well, accounts receivable is a critical area because it involves significant risks like fraud, errors in recording transactions, or even misstatements in the financial statements. So, finding unexpected errors suggests that the initial assessment of risk might have been too optimistic.\n\nNow, risk assessment is crucial in auditing because it helps the auditor determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures. If the risk is higher than initially thought, the auditor needs to respond appropriately to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence.\n\nOption A suggests moving detailed analytical procedures from year-end to interim. Analytical procedures involve evaluating financial information by studying relationships between financial data and comparing it to expectations. If there are unexpected errors, perhaps performing more analytical procedures earlier in the audit process could help identify trends or anomalies sooner. However, analytical procedures might not be as effective in detecting specific errors compared to substantive tests like testing details of transactions or account balances.\n\nOption B proposes increasing the dollar threshold for vouching customer invoices. Vouching means checking the supporting documentation for transactions to ensure they are valid and correctly recorded. Increasing the dollar threshold would mean that only larger invoices would be checked, while smaller ones would be sampled less frequently or not at all. But if there are numerous errors, perhaps even small errors could accumulate to something material. So, increasing the threshold might not be the best response because it could lead to missing more errors.\n\nOption C suggests switching from positive to negative accounts receivable confirmations. In positive confirmations, the customer is asked to reply only if they disagree with the stated amount, while in negative confirmations, the customer is asked to reply only if they agree with the stated amount. Positive confirmations are generally more reliable because they require the customer to verify the amount, whereas negative confirmations rely on the customer responding only if there's a discrepancy. If there are already issues with accounts receivable, using negative confirmations might not provide sufficient assurance because they are less reliable.\n\nOption D recommends using more experienced audit team members for year-end testing. This seems like a reasonable approach because more experienced auditors might be better at identifying risks, designing appropriate audit procedures, and evaluating the results. Given that the risk assessment has changed due to unexpected errors, having more experienced team members could help in performing more effective and efficient audit procedures.\n\nLet me think about this again. The key here is that numerous unexpected errors were found during the interim audit, leading to a change in risk assessment. So, the auditor needs to respond by modifying the audit plan to address the increased risk.\n\nOption A suggests moving detailed analytical procedures to interim, but as I thought earlier, analytical procedures might not be as effective in detecting specific errors compared to substantive tests.\n\nOption B increases the dollar threshold for vouching, which could actually be counterproductive if there are many errors, as it might lead to missing more errors in smaller transactions.\n\nOption C switches to negative confirmations, which are less reliable, so that might not be the best choice when there are already issues with accounts receivable.\n\nOption D brings in more experienced auditors for year-end testing, which seems like a prudent step to handle the increased risk.\n\nComparing all these options, option D appears to be the most appropriate response because it directly addresses the need for a more thorough and skilled approach to testing in light of the unexpected errors found.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are other responses that could be equally or more appropriate. For example, perhaps the auditor should consider increasing the sample size for testing accounts receivable or performing more extensive substantive testing procedures.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, none of them specifically mention increasing the sample size or performing more substantive tests. Option D is about using more experienced team members, which could indirectly lead to better-designed tests and more effective auditing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the auditor should consider performing additional tests of controls to see if there are deficiencies in internal controls that are leading to these errors. However, that option isn't presented here.\n\nGiven the choices provided, I think option D is the most appropriate audit response to the situation described.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
