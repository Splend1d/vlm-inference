A defendant was tried in state court for violating the anti-smoking statute. The prosecution's evidence consisted of testimony regarding the defendant's cigarette smoking at a restaurant. During the prosecution's case-in-chief, they called a witness who testified to a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. The judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury. The state prosecutor appealed the ruling under a statute that permitted prosecutorial appeals in such circumstances. The state won the appeal, but the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant. However, the city attorney from the city in which the restaurant was located then sought to prosecute the defendant for the same incident under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which was identical to the state statute. The city attorney planned to call as her only witness a man who testified at the defendant's first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss on the grounds that the prosecution of the city charge would violate his rights against double jeopardy.

                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving double jeopardy and separate sovereigns. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a state statute that makes it a misdemeanor to smoke in certain establishments, like restaurants, bars, and cafes. A defendant was tried for violating this statute, and during the trial, the prosecution presented testimony about the defendant's smoking at a restaurant. However, they also mentioned a prior conviction of the defendant that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. As a result, the judge immediately granted a mistrial and excused the jury.\n\nThe state prosecutor appealed the judge's decision to exclude the prior conviction evidence, and they won the appeal. But interestingly, the prosecutor decided not to re-prosecute the defendant after that. Instead, the city attorney from the city where the restaurant was located wanted to prosecute the defendant for the same incident, but this time under the city's anti-smoking ordinance, which is identical to the state statute.\n\nThe city attorney planned to call the same witness who testified at the first trial. The defendant moved to dismiss the city's prosecution on the grounds that it would violate his rights against double jeopardy. Now, the court has to decide whether to grant or deny this motion.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.\n\nB. Grant the motion, because the law and the evidence will be identical at the second trial.\n\nC. Deny the motion, because the city and the state are separate sovereigns.\n\nD. Deny the motion, because the judge granted a mistrial.\n\nLet's consider each option.\n\nOption A says to grant the motion because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution. Jeopardy generally attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn in a jury trial, or when the first witness is sworn in a bench trial. In this case, there was a jury trial, so jeopardy likely attached at the beginning of the trial. However, since a mistrial was granted, we need to consider under what circumstances double jeopardy bars a retrial.\n\nOption B suggests granting the motion because the law and the evidence are identical. While the laws are identical, and the evidence is the same, double jeopardy doesn't necessarily bar prosecution by a different sovereign, which brings us to option C.\n\nOption C is to deny the motion because the city and the state are separate sovereigns. The separate sovereigns doctrine allows for successive prosecutions by different sovereigns for the same conduct, provided each sovereign is exercising its own penal authority. So, if the city and the state are considered separate sovereigns, then the city could prosecute even if the state had already prosecuted for the same conduct.\n\nOption D is to deny the motion because the judge granted a mistrial. But the reason for the mistrial was the prosecution's introduction of excluded evidence, which might be considered prosecutorial misconduct. In such cases, double jeopardy could bar a retrial.\n\nLet's delve deeper into the double jeopardy aspect.\n\nDouble jeopardy generally prevents a person from being tried twice for the same offense. However, there are exceptions, such as when a mistrial is declared due to manifest necessity or the defendant's own misconduct.\n\nIn this case, the mistrial was granted because the prosecution introduced evidence that had been excluded by the judge in a pretrial hearing. This could be seen as prosecutorial misconduct, which might bar a retrial in the interest of fairness.\n\nMoreover, the state won an appeal regarding the admissibility of the prior conviction, but the prosecutor chose not to re-prosecute. Now, the city attorney wants to prosecute for the same conduct under a parallel city ordinance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the city and the state are considered separate sovereigns for double jeopardy purposes.\n\nIn the United States, the separate sovereigns doctrine allows both state and federal governments to prosecute a person for the same conduct if they have concurrent jurisdiction. Similarly, if a city has its own penal code and law enforcement, it might be considered a separate sovereign from the state.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, cities are considered subdivisions of the state and not separate sovereigns for double jeopardy purposes. So, prosecution by the city after a state prosecution could be barred by double jeopardy.\n\nGiven that, option C might not hold water if the city is not considered a separate sovereign from the state.\n\nOption A seems plausible because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution, and due to the mistrial granted by the judge, double jeopardy might bar further prosecution.\n\nOption B also has merit because the laws and evidence are identical, suggesting that it's indeed the same offense.\n\nOption D suggests denying the motion because a mistrial was granted, but as mentioned earlier, if the mistrial was due to prosecutorial misconduct, double jeopardy might bar retrial.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that options A and B have stronger arguments for granting the motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's the city, not the state, seeking prosecution complicates things, depending on whether the city is considered a separate sovereign.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, cities are not separate sovereigns from the state for double jeopardy purposes. Therefore, prosecuting the defendant again by the city for the same conduct could violate double jeopardy.\n\nGiven that, the court should grant the motion to dismiss.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Grant the motion, because jeopardy attached in the first prosecution.\n\nOption B is also tempting, but it's more about the similarity of the laws and evidence, which is a factor, but the key issue is the attachment of jeopardy and the status of the city as a separate sovereign.\n\nOption C is likely incorrect because cities are usually not considered separate sovereigns from the state.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the mistrial was granted due to prosecutorial misconduct, which might bar retrial.\n\nHence, A is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
