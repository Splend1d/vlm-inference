                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a coat that originally costs $325.00. It didn't sell in November, so the merchant marked it down by 20%, and then in December, they marked it down an additional 10%. I need to find out what a Christmas shopper in December would pay for the coat. The options are A. $227.50, B. $234.00, C. $286.00, and D. $290.00.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, there's a 20% markdown in November. So, I need to calculate what 20% of $325.00 is and then subtract that from the original price to get the November sale price.\n\nSo, 20% of $325.00 is calculated as:\n\n20% of 325 = 0.20 * 325 = 65.00\n\nSo, the markdown in November is $65.00. Now, subtract that from the original price:\n\n325.00 - 65.00 = 260.00\n\nSo, the price after the first markdown is $260.00.\n\nNow, in December, there's an additional 10% markdown on this new price. So, I need to find 10% of $260.00 and subtract that from $260.00.\n\n10% of 260 = 0.10 * 260 = 26.00\n\nSo, the December markdown is $26.00. Subtract that from the November sale price:\n\n260.00 - 26.00 = 234.00\n\nTherefore, the final price in December is $234.00.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option B.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Sometimes, people might think you can just add the percentages together, like 20% plus 10% is 30%, and then take 30% off the original price. But that's not correct because the second markdown is applied to the already discounted price, not the original.\n\nLet me see: if I were to take 30% off of $325.00, that would be:\n\n30% of 325 = 0.30 * 325 = 97.50\n\nThen, 325 - 97.50 = 227.50\n\nThat's option A, but according to my earlier calculation, it should be $234.00.\n\nSo, which one is correct? I think the first method is right because the second discount is applied to the already reduced price, not the original.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using multiplication factors.\n\nOriginal price: $325.00\n\nFirst markdown: 20% off, so the customer pays 80% of the original price.\n\n80% of 325 = 0.80 * 325 = 260.00\n\nSecond markdown: 10% off the new price, so the customer pays 90% of $260.00.\n\n90% of 260 = 0.90 * 260 = 234.00\n\nAgain, $234.00.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the combined discount. The first discount is 20%, which means the customer pays 80% of the original price. Then, the second discount is 10% off the already discounted price, which means they pay 90% of the already discounted price.\n\nSo, the overall discount factor is 0.80 * 0.90 = 0.72, which means the customer pays 72% of the original price.\n\n72% of 325 = 0.72 * 325 = 234.00\n\nAgain, $234.00.\n\nWait, but if I calculate 30% off, I get $227.50, which is option A, but according to these calculations, it should be $234.00.\n\nMaybe I should check if there's a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me calculate 0.80 * 0.90 again: 0.80 * 0.90 = 0.72. That's correct.\n\nThen, 0.72 * 325:\n\nFirst, 325 * 0.70 = 325 * 70 / 100 = 325 * 0.70 = 227.50\n\nWait, no: 325 * 0.70 is 227.50, but I need 0.72 * 325.\n\nSo, 325 * 0.70 = 227.50\n\nPlus 325 * 0.02 = 6.50\n\nSo, 227.50 + 6.50 = 234.00\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, 325 * 0.72 = 234.00\n\nSo, the final price is indeed $234.00.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B. $234.00\n\nI think the merchant did not apply a cumulative 30% discount but rather sequential discounts of 20% and then 10% on the reduced price.\n\nSo, the shopper in December would pay $234.00 for the coat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{234.00} \\]"
