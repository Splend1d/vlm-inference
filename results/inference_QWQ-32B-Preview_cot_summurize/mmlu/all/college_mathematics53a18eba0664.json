                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about similar matrices. So, A and B are n x n invertible matrices, both similar to each other, and I is the identity matrix. I need to figure out which of these statements must be true:\n\nI. A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace.\n\nIII. A\u207b\u00b9 and B\u207b\u00b9 are similar matrices.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I, II, and III\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what it means for two matrices to be similar. Two matrices A and B are similar if there exists an invertible matrix P such that B = P\u207b\u00b9AP. That's the definition.\n\nAlright, let's tackle each statement one by one.\n\nStarting with statement I: A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.\n\nHmm, if A and B are similar, does that imply that A - 2I and B - 2I are similar?\n\nWell, let's use the definition of similarity. Since A and B are similar, B = P\u207b\u00b9AP for some invertible P.\n\nNow, let's compute B - 2I:\n\nB - 2I = P\u207b\u00b9AP - 2I\n\nBut I is the identity matrix, so P\u207b\u00b9IP = I, because P\u207b\u00b9P is the identity. So,\n\nB - 2I = P\u207b\u00b9AP - 2P\u207b\u00b9IP = P\u207b\u00b9(A - 2I)P\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nActually, yes:\n\nB - 2I = P\u207b\u00b9AP - 2I = P\u207b\u00b9AP - 2P\u207b\u00b9IP = P\u207b\u00b9(A - 2I)P\n\nSo, B - 2I = P\u207b\u00b9(A - 2I)P, which means that A - 2I and B - 2I are similar via the same matrix P.\n\nTherefore, statement I is true.\n\nOkay, moving on to statement II: A and B have the same trace.\n\nI know that similar matrices have the same eigenvalues, and the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues. So, if A and B have the same eigenvalues, they should have the same trace.\n\nBut wait, is that always true?\n\nLet me think about it. If A and B are similar, then B = P\u207b\u00b9AP, and the trace of B is trace(P\u207b\u00b9AP).\n\nI recall that the trace has a cyclic property, meaning that trace(P\u207b\u00b9AP) = trace(A P P\u207b\u00b9) = trace(A).\n\nSo, yes, trace(B) = trace(A).\n\nTherefore, statement II is true.\n\nNow, statement III: A\u207b\u00b9 and B\u207b\u00b9 are similar matrices.\n\nGiven that A and B are invertible and similar, does that mean their inverses are similar?\n\nLet's see. Since A and B are similar, B = P\u207b\u00b9AP.\n\nNow, let's find B\u207b\u00b9.\n\nB\u207b\u00b9 = (P\u207b\u00b9AP)\u207b\u00b9 = P\u207b\u00b9A\u207b\u00b9P.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, no. The inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order.\n\nSo, (P\u207b\u00b9AP)\u207b\u00b9 = P\u207b\u00b9A\u207b\u00b9(P\u207b\u00b9)\u207b\u00b9 = P\u207b\u00b9A\u207b\u00b9P.\n\nWait, but (P\u207b\u00b9)\u207b\u00b9 is P, so it should be P\u207b\u00b9A\u207b\u00b9P.\n\nWait, no, let's double-check.\n\nActually, (P\u207b\u00b9AP)\u207b\u00b9 = P\u207b\u00b9A\u207b\u00b9P.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, B\u207b\u00b9 = P\u207b\u00b9A\u207b\u00b9P, which means that A\u207b\u00b9 and B\u207b\u00b9 are similar via the same matrix P.\n\nTherefore, statement III is true.\n\nSo, all three statements I, II, and III are true.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. I, II, and III.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any case where A and B are similar, but A - 2I and B - 2I are not similar? I don't think so, because of the way similarity works.\n\nSimilarly, trace should be the same, and inverses should be similar.\n\nSo, yes, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
