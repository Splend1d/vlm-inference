                    "text": "This is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, we have three lots owned by a homeowner, his daughter, and his sister, all next to each other in the city. There's a downward slope from the homeowner's land to the sister's land. The homeowner's and daughter's lots were in their natural state, meaning nothing had been built or changed much, I guess. The sister lived in a house she built on her property for 10 years, so presumably, her land was developed to some extent.\n\nNow, the daughter decided to build a house on her lot. She excavated an area eight feet deep to build a basement. After building the house and macadamizing an area for a driveway, which means paving it with a surface like asphalt or concrete, she didn't change the former contours of the land. So, the shape of the land stayed more or less the same, I think.\n\nAfter that, the sister started complaining about flooding in her basement, saying it was previously dry. So, the sister built a concrete wall three feet along her border with the daughter's property to prevent rainwater from flowing onto her land from the daughter's property. This caused water to stand and become stagnant on the daughter's land.\n\nThe daughter demanded the sister remove the wall, but the sister refused, so the daughter sued to get the wall removed. We need to figure out the most likely result from the options given.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of such surface water.\n\nB. The sister must remove the wall at the daughter's expense.\n\nC. The sister may leave the wall without being liable to the daughter for money damages.\n\nD. The sister may leave the wall, but she will be liable to the daughter for money damages.\n\nOkay, so this seems to be about the rights regarding the flow of surface water between adjacent properties.\n\nI remember that in property law, there's a principle called \"common enemy rule\" or something like that, which deals with surface water drainage. In many jurisdictions, especially in urban areas, there are specific rules or regulations about how water should be managed between properties to prevent flooding and other issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation better. There's a downward slope from the homeowner's land to the sister's land. So, naturally, water would flow from higher to lower ground, which would be from the homeowner's land down to the sister's land.\n\nThe daughter's land is presumably in between or adjacent to both. She excavated to build a basement, which might have changed the ground levels somewhat, but she didn't change the former contours of the land after building the house and driveway. So, maybe the excavation allowed more water to collect or flow in a certain way.\n\nThen, the sister started experiencing flooding in her basement, which she claims was previously dry. So, it's possible that the daughter's construction activities have altered the water flow, causing more water to run onto the sister's property.\n\nIn response, the sister built a wall to prevent this flow, but that caused water to stagnate on the daughter's land.\n\nNow, the daughter is suing to have the wall removed.\n\nSo, the key legal issue here is whether the sister has the right to build the wall to prevent water from flowing onto her property, or whether she must allow the natural flow of water, even if it causes flooding on her property.\n\nI think this involves the rules about drainage and the rights of adjacent landowners regarding surface water.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there's the \"common enemy rule,\" which holds that each landowner is free to drain water from their land in any manner they see fit, even if it causes harm to neighboring properties. However, I believe this rule is less common nowadays, and there are more modern approaches that require landowners to manage water in a way that doesn't unreasonably harm their neighbors.\n\nAnother approach is the \"civilized standard of conduct\" rule, which requires landowners to drain their land in a reasonable manner, considering the effects on neighboring properties.\n\nAdditionally, there might be local ordinances or regulations that govern how water should be managed in developed areas.\n\nGiven that this is in a city, there are probably municipal codes that address drainage and runoff.\n\nIn this case, the sister is trying to protect her property from flooding by building a wall, but that's causing harm to the daughter's property by causing water to stagnate.\n\nSo, it seems like there's a conflict between their property interests.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA says the sister must remove the wall because she has no right to obstruct the flow of surface water. This might be the case if there's a legal requirement to allow the natural flow of water, or if the sister is deemed to have no right to interfere with the drainage from the daughter's property.\n\nB says the sister must remove the wall, but at the daughter's expense. This might suggest that while the sister has to remove the wall, the daughter has to pay for it, perhaps because the daughter's actions caused the flooding issue in the first place.\n\nC says the sister may keep the wall without being liable for money damages. This would mean that the sister has the right to protect her property from flooding, even if it causes stagnation on the daughter's land.\n\nD says the sister can keep the wall but must pay damages to the daughter for the harm caused by the stagnation.\n\nTo decide which is most likely, I need to consider the legal principles involved.\n\nFirst, I think it's important to note that the sister has been living on her property for 10 years with no issues, and the flooding started after the daughter's construction.\n\nThe daughter's excavation and construction might have altered the natural drainage patterns, causing more water to flow onto the sister's property.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the daughter should be responsible for mitigating the harm she caused.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has the right to protect her property from flooding, but her solution of building a wall has caused harm to the daughter's property.\n\nIt seems like a classic case of competing property rights.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, there's a doctrine called \"contributory negligence\" or \"comparative negligence,\" where both parties may be at fault to some extent.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a legal principle that requires landowners to find a reasonable solution that balances the interests of both parties.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible if the sister has the right to protect her property from flooding, and the stagnation on the daughter's land is an acceptable consequence.\n\nHowever, that might not be fair to the daughter, as she's suffering harm.\n\nOption D might be more balanced, as the sister can keep the wall but has to compensate the daughter for the harm caused.\n\nOption A would require the sister to remove the wall, allowing water to flow back onto her property, which might not be acceptable to her, especially since she was experiencing flooding.\n\nOption B is similar to A, but makes the daughter pay for the removal, which might not be fair if the sister was rightfully protecting her property.\n\nI think the most equitable solution would be D, where the sister can keep the wall but has to pay damages to the daughter for the harm caused by the stagnation.\n\nThis way, both parties are accommodated: the sister protects her property from flooding, and the daughter is compensated for the harm caused by the wall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better solution would be for the daughter to find another way to manage the water flow that doesn't cause harm to the sister's property, but since the daughter is suing to have the wall removed, that might not be an option here.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the daughter's actions in excavating and paving her land constitute a change that should be regulated by municipal codes or building regulations.\n\nIf there were permits required for such work, and she didn't obtain them, that could affect the outcome.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't mention anything about permits or code violations, so I'll assume that her construction was lawful.\n\nAlso, since the daughter completed her construction without changing the former contours of the land, perhaps the flooding is not directly caused by her actions, but by natural drainage patterns.\n\nBut the sister had no issues for 10 years until the daughter started her construction, so it's likely that the construction did affect the water flow.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the daughter should be responsible for mitigating the harm.\n\nBut the sister's wall is causing harm to the daughter's property now, so it's a reciprocal situation.\n\nIn terms of legal precedents, I recall that courts often try to find a balance between the rights of adjacent landowners, especially in urban areas where drainage is a managed system.\n\nPerhaps the sister has the right to protect her property from flooding, but she has to do so in a way that doesn't unreasonably harm her neighbor.\n\nBuilding the wall might be considered unreasonable if there are alternative solutions that cause less harm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sister can keep the wall but should be required to provide some compensation or accommodation to the daughter for the resulting stagnation.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most likely result: the sister may leave the wall but will be liable to the daughter for money damages.\n\nThis allows the sister to protect her property while compensating the daughter for the harm caused by the wall.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) the sister may leave the wall, but she will be liable to the daughter for money damages."
