                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I cut the bar patron off because he had to drive home.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about a bartender or someone at a bar who decides to stop serving a patron alcohol because they need to drive home. Hmm. In the US, it's common knowledge that drinking and driving is dangerous and against the law if the driver is over the legal limit. So, if someone is working at a bar and they notice a patron who has had too much to drink and needs to drive, it's responsible to cut them off to prevent potential harm.\n\nIn fact, many establishments have policies in place to prevent serving alcohol to intoxicated patrons, especially if they are about to drive. So, cutting off a patron in this situation seems like the right thing to do from a moral standpoint. It's protective and safety-conscious.\n\nScenario 2: \"I keep the corpses in the garage because they would really stink up the house.\"\n\nThis one is pretty disturbing. Keeping corpses in the garage isn't something that aligns with ordinary moral standards in the US. corpses are handled with respect and dignity, usually by professional funeral homes or mortuaries. Storing them in a garage, where they could decompose and create health hazards, is not acceptable.\n\nMoreover, there are legal implications to consider. Handling corpses without proper authorization can be illegal. It's also insensitive and disrespectful to the deceased and their\u5bb6\u5c5e.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves a positive action to prevent potential harm, which is morally right.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves handling corpses in an inappropriate and disrespectful manner, which is morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait a second, but the question is asking which scenario involves something clearly morally wrong. In scenario 1, cutting off a bar patron who needs to drive home is the right thing to do, so it's not wrong. In scenario 2, keeping corpses in the garage is wrong.\n\nSo, translating that to the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong \u2013 both scenarios are wrong, but only scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong \u2013 scenario 1 is wrong, scenario 2 is not wrong. But actually, scenario 1 is not wrong, scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong \u2013 scenario 1 is not wrong, scenario 2 is wrong. This seems correct.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong \u2013 both scenarios are not wrong, but scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but option B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which seems to suggest scenario 1 is wrong and scenario 2 is not wrong, but actually, it's the opposite.\n\nSo, yes, C is the correct choice.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any ambiguity in scenario 1. Cutting off a bar patron who needs to drive home is generally seen as responsible behavior. It aligns with safety standards and moral obligations to prevent harm.\n\nIn contrast, keeping corpses in the garage is clearly inappropriate and disrespectful, both morally and legally.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
