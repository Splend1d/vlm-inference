Let me think...\n\nOption A says, \"good is to be done, evil to be avoided.\" That sounds familiar. I think Aquinas mentioned something about doing good and avoiding evil as a fundamental principle. Maybe that's the one.\n\nOption B says, \"one ought to do what one will.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a statement about freedom or desire, but I don't recall Aquinas phrasing it like that in relation to natural law.\n\nOption C says, \"one ought to do only what can be done without contradiction.\" That seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's related to consistency in actions, but I'm not sure if that's the first precept.\n\nOption D says, \"pleasure is to be sought, pain to be avoided.\" That sounds more like hedonistic principles, not necessarily aligning with Aquinas's views on natural law.\n\nWait a minute, I remember that Aquinas talked about natural law being based on practical principles that are self-evident. The first precept would be something foundational.\n\nIn his Summa Theologica, Aquinas discusses the hierarchy of natural law precepts, with the first being a general principle that good should be done and evil avoided. That seems to match option A.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering. Is there a chance that the first precept is something else?\n\nOption B sounds like a subjective choice, which doesn't align with Aquinas's objective view of natural law.\n\nOption C seems to be about logical consistency, which might be important in natural law, but I don't think it's the first precept.\n\nOption D is more about seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, which is more akin to hedonism or utilitarianism, not Thomistic natural law.\n\nSo, based on what I recall, option A seems correct. Aquinas's first precept of natural law is that good is to be done and evil is to be avoided.\n\nMaybe I should look it up to be sure, but since this is a memory exercise, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
