                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Stephen Macedo's perspective on immigration ethics. The options are feminist, global, distributive, and international justice. I'm not entirely sure about Macedo's specific viewpoint, but I can try to think through this.\n\nFirst, I know that Stephen Macedo is a political philosopher, and he has written about immigration and citizenship. I think he is associated with the Princeton University Center for Human Values. From what I recall, his work often deals with the balance between open borders and the legitimate interests of nation-states.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Feminist justice: Feminist perspectives on justice often focus on issues of gender equality and the ways in which social structures affect women and other gender minorities. While immigration can have gendered impacts, I don't recall Macedo's work being specifically framed within feminist justice.\n\nB. Global justice: This perspective looks at justice issues across national borders, considering the moral responsibilities that nations have to each other and to people beyond their own citizens. Macedo does discuss international relations and the rights of immigrants, so this seems plausible.\n\nC. Distributive justice: This is about the fair allocation of resources and opportunities within a society. While immigration can impact resource distribution, I don't think Macedo's primary approach is through distributive justice.\n\nD. International justice: Similar to global justice, but might have a different emphasis, perhaps on the justice between nations or in international law.\n\nGiven that, both global and international justice seem relevant. Maybe I need to recall specific points from Macedo's work.\n\nI remember that Macedo argues for what he calls \"liberal nationalism,\" which suggests that nations have the right to control their borders but also have moral obligations to immigrants. He emphasizes the importance of immigrants' integration into the host society while respecting their cultural identities.\n\nGiven that, it seems like his perspective is more about the relationships between nations and the people moving between them, which aligns well with global justice.\n\nAlso, global justice often considers the moral implications of economic and political inequalities that drive immigration. Macedo, in his work, acknowledges these inequalities and argues for policies that are both compassionate and pragmatic.\n\nIn contrast, distributive justice might focus more on how immigrants affect the distribution of resources within the host country, which, while important, doesn't seem to be the primary lens through which Macedo approaches the issue.\n\nSimilarly, feminist justice, while valuable, doesn't seem directly tied to his main arguments about immigration.\n\nInternational justice might be close, but global justice seems more comprehensive, as it can include considerations of global inequality and moral obligations that go beyond formal international law or relations.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. global justice.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check a summary of his work or look up key points. However, since this is a memory-based question, I'll go with my best judgment.\n\nSo, I'll choose B. global justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
