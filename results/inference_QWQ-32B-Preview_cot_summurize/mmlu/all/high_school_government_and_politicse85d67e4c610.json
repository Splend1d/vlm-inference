Let's see what each group is generally known for.\n\nFirst, white Southerners. Historically, the South has been more conservative, especially on social issues. Even within the Democratic Party, there might be more moderate to conservative views among white Southerners compared to other groups.\n\nNext, labor union members. Unions are typically associated with the Democratic Party and often advocate for policies that support workers' rights, which can be considered liberal. So, their constituency might be more liberal.\n\nAfrican Americans have been a core part of the Democratic base for a long time, especially since the civil rights era. They generally support liberal policies on social justice and equality.\n\nNorthern ethnic minorities also tend to lean liberal, supporting policies that promote diversity and inclusivity.\n\nComparing all these, white Southerners might have the least liberal constituency within the Democratic Party. But I should double-check because times are changing, and political affiliations can shift.\n\nMaybe I should look up some recent election data or polls to see how these groups vote nowadays.\n\nFrom what I've read recently, there has been a trend of white Southerners moving towards the Republican Party, especially on social issues. So, within the Democratic Party, the white Southern constituency might be less liberal compared to the other groups listed.\n\nOn the other hand, labor union members, African Americans, and Northern ethnic minorities have remained strongly aligned with liberal policies.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. White Southerners.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider each option again.\n\nB. Labor union members: They are typically very liberal on economic issues, advocating for higher wages, better working conditions, and government regulations to protect workers.\n\nC. African Americans: They support liberal policies on civil rights, social justice, and often on economic issues as well.\n\nD. Northern ethnic minorities: This would include groups like Hispanics, Asians, and others in the Northern states, who generally support liberal views on immigration, diversity, and social issues.\n\nSo, again, white Southerners seem to be the group with the least liberal constituency among these options.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is A. White Southerners.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
