                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to write 270,240 in expanded form, and there are four options to choose from. Let's see what expanded form means. Expanded form is when you break down a number to show the value of each digit. For example, 245 would be 200 + 40 + 5. Each digit is multiplied by its place value.\n\nSo, for 270,240, let's identify each digit and its place value.\n\nStarting from the left:\n\n- The first digit is 2, which is in the hundred thousands place, so it's 200,000.\n\n- The next digit is 7, which is in the ten thousands place, so it's 70,000.\n\n- Then there's a 0 in the thousands place, which is 0, but we can just omit it in the expanded form.\n\n- Next is 2 in the hundreds place, which is 200.\n\n- Then 4 in the tens place, which is 40.\n\n- Finally, 0 in the ones place, which is 0, and we can omit that too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expanded form should be 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 4\n\nB. 200,000 + 7,000 + 200 + 40\n\nC. 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40\n\nD. 200,000 + 70,000 + 2,000 + 40\n\nComparing these with what I have:\n\nOption A has 7,000 instead of 70,000, and 4 instead of 40. That's not right.\n\nOption B has 7,000 instead of 70,000, but the correct 40. Still not right.\n\nOption C matches exactly with what I have: 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40.\n\nOption D has 2,000 instead of 200, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct choice should be C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying the place values.\n\nLet's write down the number again: 270,240.\n\n- 2 is in the hundred thousands place: 200,000\n\n- 7 is in the ten thousands place: 70,000\n\n- 0 is in the thousands place: 0 (omit)\n\n- 2 is in the hundreds place: 200\n\n- 4 is in the tens place: 40\n\n- 0 is in the ones place: 0 (omit)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people include zero place values in expanded form, but it's not necessary.\n\nSo, the correct expanded form is indeed 200,000 + 70,000 + 200 + 40, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
