                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We have a bag with 4 red and 6 blue marbles, making a total of 10 marbles. We're selecting two marbles one after the other without replacing the first one back into the bag. We need to find the probability that both marbles are the same color.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for both marbles to be the same color. There are two possibilities here:\n\n1. Both marbles are red.\n\n2. Both marbles are blue.\n\nSince these are two separate events, we can calculate the probability of each and then add them together to get the total probability of both marbles being the same color.\n\nLet's start with the probability of both marbles being red.\n\n**Probability of both marbles being red:**\n\n- The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is the number of red marbles divided by the total number of marbles. So, that's 4 red out of 10 total marbles, which is 4/10 or 2/5.\n\n- After selecting one red marble and not replacing it, there are now 3 red marbles left and a total of 9 marbles in the bag.\n\n- So, the probability of selecting another red marble is 3/9 or 1/3.\n\n- To find the overall probability of both events happening (both marbles being red), we multiply the probabilities: (2/5) * (1/3) = 2/15.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of both marbles being blue.\n\n**Probability of both marbles being blue:**\n\n- The probability of selecting a blue marble on the first draw is the number of blue marbles divided by the total number of marbles. There are 6 blue marbles out of 10 total, so that's 6/10 or 3/5.\n\n- After selecting one blue marble and not replacing it, there are now 5 blue marbles left and a total of 9 marbles in the bag.\n\n- So, the probability of selecting another blue marble is 5/9.\n\n- Again, we multiply these probabilities to find the overall probability: (3/5) * (5/9) = 15/45, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that both marbles are the same color, we add the probabilities of the two events:\n\nProbability (both red or both blue) = Probability (both red) + Probability (both blue) = 2/15 + 1/3.\n\nWait a minute, to add these fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominators are 15 and 3, so the least common denominator is 15.\n\nLet's convert 1/3 to a fraction with a denominator of 15:\n\n1/3 = 5/15.\n\nNow, add 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15.\n\nSo, the probability that both marbles are the same color is 7/15.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1/8\n\nB. 8/15\n\nC. 1/15\n\nD. 7/15\n\nOur answer matches option D. 7/15.\n\nWait, but let's double-check to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, probability of both red:\n\nFirst draw: 4/10 = 2/5\n\nSecond draw: 3/9 = 1/3\n\nMultiply: 2/5 * 1/3 = 2/15\n\nProbability of both blue:\n\nFirst draw: 6/10 = 3/5\n\nSecond draw: 5/9\n\nMultiply: 3/5 * 5/9 = 15/45 = 1/3\n\nNow, add 2/15 + 1/3 = 2/15 + 5/15 = 7/15\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the total number of ways to select two marbles of the same color compared to the total number of ways to select any two marbles.\n\nTotal number of ways to select two marbles from 10 is C(10,2) = 45.\n\nNumber of ways to select two red marbles: C(4,2) = 6\n\nNumber of ways to select two blue marbles: C(6,2) = 15\n\nSo, total number of favorable outcomes: 6 + 15 = 21\n\nProbability: 21/45 = 7/15\n\nThis confirms our previous result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 7/15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
