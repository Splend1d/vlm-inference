I see that there's a -2 multiplied by (2x - 4), so I should distribute that -2 into the parentheses.\n\nSo, -2 times 2x is -4x, and -2 times -4 is +8. So, the expression becomes:\n\n5x + 3 - 4x + 8\n\nNow, I can combine like terms. The like terms here are the x terms and the constant terms.\n\nCombining the x terms: 5x - 4x = x\n\nCombining the constants: 3 + 8 = 11\n\nSo, the simplified expression is x + 11.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 + x\n\nB. x + 11\n\nC. 5x + 3\n\nD. 7 + 2x\n\nThe correct answer is B. x + 11.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
