                    "text": "Let's dive into mutation-based fuzzing and see which statement accurately describes it.\n\nFirst off, what is mutation-based fuzzing? Fuzzing, in general, is a software testing technique that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as input to a program to find errors or vulnerabilities. Mutation-based fuzzing is a specific approach within fuzzing where new test inputs are generated by making small changes or mutations to existing inputs.\n\nOption A says: \"It generates each different input by modifying a prior input.\" That sounds pretty spot-on. Mutation-based fuzzing indeed starts with an initial input, often called a seed, and then makes modifications to it to create new test cases. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"It works by making small mutations to the target program to induce faults.\" Hmm, this sounds a bit different. Mutation-based fuzzing typically mutates the input data, not the program itself. So, this seems like a confusion between mutation testing and mutation-based fuzzing. Mutation testing involves modifying the program code to create mutants, but fuzzing focuses on inputs. Therefore, this doesn't seem accurate.\n\nOption C: \"Each input is a mutation that follows a given grammar.\" This is interesting. Some fuzzing techniques do use grammars to generate inputs, especially grammar-based fuzzing. However, mutation-based fuzzing doesn't necessarily follow a grammar; it just makes random changes to existing inputs. So, this doesn't seem right for mutation-based fuzzing.\n\nOption D: \"It only makes sense for file-based fuzzing, not network-based fuzzing.\" This seems limiting. Mutation-based fuzzing can be applied to various types of inputs, including files and network protocols. As long as there's an input being provided to the system under test, mutation-based fuzzing can be applicable. So, this doesn't sound accurate.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A seems to be the correct statement about mutation-based fuzzing. It accurately describes the process of generating new inputs by modifying prior inputs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
