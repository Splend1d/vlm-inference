                    "text": "On Thanksgiving Day, a father was carving a turkey for his family when he seriously cut his hand. The knife severed an artery, causing the father to lose a lot of blood. The mother telephoned their family doctor, who instructed her to drive the father to the local hospital. The doctor indicated that he would meet them there. A short time later at the hospital, the doctor treated the father and bandaged his hand. However, due to the fact that the father had lost a considerable amount of blood, the doctor ordered an immediate blood transfusion. After determining that the father's blood type was A-positive, the doctor orally instructed a nurse, who was employed by the hospital, to obtain the necessary blood for the transfusion. The nurse followed the doctor's instructions and telephoned the hospital's blood bank department and ordered a unit of A-positive blood. The person in the blood bank who received the nurse's call correctly wrote down the order for A-positive blood. However, someone working at the blood bank, whose identity cannot be determined, made an error in filling the order and labeling the unit of blood for the father. As a result, the blood bank sent a unit of B-positive blood mislabeled as A-positive blood. After being administered the wrong blood, the father died. The hospital has a written rule in effect whereby all orders for blood transfusions must be made in writing by the physician in charge of the patient's treatment. Although the doctor was aware of the hospital rule, he, like many other doctors at the hospital, frequently ordered blood transfusions by oral instructions. If the mother asserts a wrongful death action against the doctor, she will most likely\n\nA. prevail, because the doctor would be responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.\nB. prevail, because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.\nC. not prevail, because the doctor acted in the same fashion as many other doctors at the hospital.\nD. not prevail, because the unidentified person in the blood bank who was responsible for sending the wrong blood type was not an employee of the doctor.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this medical malpractice scenario. So, there's a father who gets hurt while carving a turkey on Thanksgiving, cuts his hand badly, loses a lot of blood. His wife calls their family doctor, who tells them to go to the local hospital, and he\u2019ll meet them there.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor treats the father, bandages his hand, but because he lost a lot of blood, the doctor orders an immediate blood transfusion. The father\u2019s blood type is A-positive, so the doctor tells a nurse to get A-positive blood. The nurse calls the blood bank and orders a unit of A-positive blood, and the person at the blood bank writes it down correctly.\n\nBut somehow, someone in the blood bank\u2014whose identity is unknown\u2014makes a mistake and sends B-positive blood instead, mislabeling it as A-positive. The father receives this wrong blood and dies as a result.\n\nNow, the hospital has a rule that all blood transfusion orders must be in writing by the physician in charge, but the doctor knew about this rule but often ordered transfusions orally, like many other doctors there.\n\nIf the mother sues the doctor for wrongful death, which option is most likely correct?\n\nA. She will prevail because the doctor is responsible for the blood bank's error in administering the wrong blood.\n\nB. She will prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule about writing orders for blood transfusions.\n\nC. She won't prevail because the doctor acted like many other doctors at the hospital.\n\nD. She won't prevail because the person who sent the wrong blood wasn't the doctor's employee.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the doctor knew about the hospital's rule requiring written orders for blood transfusions but chose to give an oral order anyway. This seems like a deviation from the standard procedure, which is intended to ensure accuracy and reduce the risk of errors.\n\nIn medical malpractice cases, doctors are expected to follow the standard of care, which includes adhering to hospital protocols designed to protect patients. By not following the rule, the doctor may have increased the risk of something going wrong, which in this case, unfortunately did.\n\nNow, the blood bank sent the wrong blood type, but the person responsible for that mistake is unknown. However, the doctor is being sued for wrongful death, so we need to consider whether the doctor's actions contributed to the father's death.\n\nOption A suggests that the doctor is responsible for the blood bank's error. That seems a bit broad because the blood bank is a separate department with its own responsibilities and employees. While the doctor's oral order might have contributed to the chain of events, directly holding the doctor responsible for the blood bank's error might not be entirely fair.\n\nOption B says she will prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule. This seems more plausible. By not following the established protocol, the doctor may have breached the standard of care, and this breach could be considered a contributing factor to the father's death.\n\nOption C suggests she won't prevail because the doctor acted like many other doctors at the hospital. But just because others were doing the same thing doesn't make it right or exempt the doctor from liability. If the hospital allows oral orders despite having a written rule, that's a management issue, but individually, each doctor is still expected to follow the rules.\n\nOption D says she won't prevail because the person who sent the wrong blood wasn't the doctor's employee. This seems similar to option A. The blood bank is part of the hospital, and the doctor is presumably affiliated with the hospital but not necessarily an employee. So, the relationship might be complicated, but the doctor's action of giving an oral order against hospital policy could still be considered negligent.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B is the most likely correct answer. The mother will probably prevail because the doctor didn't follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders. Adhering to hospital protocols is crucial in ensuring patient safety, and deviating from them can lead to errors and potential liability.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors.\n\nPerhaps the hospital could be considered liable too, for allowing oral orders despite having a written policy. But the question is about the mother suing the doctor, not the hospital.\n\nAlso, the fact that the blood bank sent the wrong blood type might indicate a systemic problem in the hospital's procedures, but again, the doctor's action of giving an oral order contributed to the chain of events leading to the error.\n\nIn legal terms, the doctor's failure to follow the hospital's rule could be seen as negligence, and if that negligence contributed to the father's death, then the doctor could be held liable.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: she will prevail because the doctor did not follow the hospital's rule regarding blood transfusion orders.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
