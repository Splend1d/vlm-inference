So, they're essentially counterfeiting money. Counterfeiting is illegal and it's also morally wrong because it's cheating the system and can cause harm to the economy. It's taking something that isn't yours and essentially stealing from everyone by devaluing currency. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this would be considered wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person makes small talk when they play cards. Making small talk is just casual conversation, which is normal and expected in social situations. It's not harming anyone and is generally considered polite. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong at all.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way that making small talk while playing cards could be considered morally wrong? Well, unless the small talk is inappropriate or disruptive, which it doesn't specify here, it's probably fine. So, no, it's not wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 1 is clearly wrong because counterfeiting is illegal and unethical.\n\nSo, B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
