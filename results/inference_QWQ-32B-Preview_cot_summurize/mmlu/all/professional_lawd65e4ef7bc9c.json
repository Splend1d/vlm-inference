                    "text": "I think the answer is C. Yes, the seller has a duty to make adequate disclosure of the known facts with respect to material defects. Here's why:\n\nFirst, the seller knew about the flooding issue in the basement because it happened whenever it rained heavily. There were even marks on the walls showing the level of floodwaters, and cracks in the foundation. So, the seller was aware of these problems.\n\nThen, instead of fixing the issues properly, the seller just painted over the walls and plastered over the crack lines. This seems like an attempt to hide the problems from potential buyers.\n\nThe buyer inspected the basement and didn't see any signs of flooding because of the paint and plaster covering up the marks and cracks. So, the buyer purchased the home based on what they saw, which was a clean, painted basement with no apparent issues.\n\nBut after the first heavy rain, the basement flooded again, revealing the original problem. Now, the buyer is probably upset because they didn't know about this issue when they bought the house.\n\nIn real estate transactions, sellers have a duty to disclose known material defects to potential buyers. Material defects are problems that could affect the value or desirability of the property, like structural issues or recurring flooding.\n\nBy painting over the flood marks and plastering the cracks, the seller may have intentionally concealed these defects, which violates their duty to disclose.\n\nSo, the buyer might have a case against the seller for not properly disclosing these material defects. The buyer could potentially sue for damages to cover the cost of fixing the flooding issue or to rescind the sale, meaning they could get out of the purchase agreement.\n\nOption A says \"No, the buyer always buys a used home 'as is.'\" But in many places, even in an \"as is\" sale, the seller still has to disclose known material defects. So, just selling \"as is\" doesn't necessarily mean the seller can hide problems.\n\nOption B says \"No, the seller has no duty to reveal defects in the property.\" That's generally not true. Sellers do have a duty to disclose known material defects, especially in real estate transactions.\n\nOption D says \"Yes, the seller is a guarantor that there are no major structural defects.\" Well, usually, sellers aren't guarantors unless specified in the contract. But in any case, they still have a duty to disclose known defects.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
