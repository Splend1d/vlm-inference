                    "text": "Let's tackle this accounting problem step by step. So, we have a company that paid $90,000 on October 31, year 1, for services that will be performed evenly over six months from November 1, year 1, through April 30, year 2. The company mistakenly expensed the entire $90,000 in October, year 1, instead of recognizing it as a prepaid expense.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a prepaid expense is. A prepaid expense is a payment made in advance for goods or services that will be received in the future. It is initially recorded as an asset on the balance sheet because it represents a future economic benefit. As the goods or services are received, the prepaid expense is reduced, and the expense is recognized on the income statement.\n\nIn this case, the company paid for six months of services starting from November 1, year 1, through April 30, year 2. Since the services are to be performed evenly over six months, each month's service cost would be $90,000 divided by 6, which is $15,000 per month.\n\nNow, the company's fiscal year-end is December 31, year 1. So, for year 1, the company should recognize the expense for the services received in November and December, which is two months. Therefore, the expense for year 1 should be $15,000 x 2 = $30,000.\n\nHowever, the company mistakenly expensed the entire $90,000 in October, year 1. This means that in year 1, they have already recorded $90,000 as an expense, but only $30,000 worth of services were actually received in year 1. Therefore, they need to adjust the expense by reversing the excess amount that was expensed prematurely.\n\nThe excess amount expensed in year 1 is $90,000 - $30,000 = $60,000. This $60,000 should not have been expensed in year 1; instead, it should be recorded as a prepaid expense (an asset) because the services will be received in the future (January through April, year 2).\n\nSo, to correct this, the company needs to make an adjusting entry at the end of year 1 (December 31, year 1) to:\n\n1. Reduce the services expense by $60,000 (since only $30,000 should be expensed in year 1).\n\n2. Recognize $60,000 as a prepaid expense (asset).\n\nIn journal entry terms, this would be:\n\nDebit Prepaid Services $60,000\n\nCredit Services Expense $60,000\n\nThis entry increases the asset Prepaid Services by $60,000 and decreases the expense Services Expense by $60,000, which corrects the overstatement of expense in year 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $30,000.\n\nB. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\nC. Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $30,000.\n\nD. Debit services expense and credit prepaid services for $60,000.\n\nThe correct answer is B. Debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only adjusts for $30,000, but the excess is $60,000.\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect because they have the wrong direction; prepaid services should be debited (increased), and services expense should be credited (decreased).\n\nTherefore, the adjusting journal entry that the company should record to properly report the prepayment in its year 1 financial statements is to debit prepaid services and credit services expense for $60,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
