                    "text": "So I've got this physics problem here. A stone is thrown horizontally from a bridge with an initial speed of 10 meters per second, and it falls 80 meters down to the water. I need to figure out how long it takes for the stone to hit the water, and I'm supposed to ignore air resistance. The options are 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, or 8 seconds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The stone is thrown horizontally, which means its initial velocity is completely horizontal. But it's falling vertically because of gravity. So, there are two components to its motion: horizontal and vertical.\n\nSince there's no air resistance, the horizontal motion doesn't affect the vertical motion. That means I can treat the vertical motion independently. The time it takes for the stone to fall vertically 80 meters is what I'm interested in here.\n\nSo, I need to use the equations of motion for the vertical direction. The stone starts with no initial vertical velocity because it's thrown horizontally. The only acceleration in the vertical direction is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared downward.\n\nThe equation that relates distance, initial velocity, time, and acceleration is:\n\n\\[ d = v_{0} t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \\]\n\nIn this case, the initial vertical velocity \\( v_{0} \\) is 0, the acceleration \\( a \\) is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, and the distance \\( d \\) is 80 meters. Plugging these values into the equation, I get:\n\n\\[ 80 = 0 \\times t + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times t^{2} \\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[ 80 = 4.9 t^{2} \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( t^{2} \\):\n\n\\[ t^{2} = \\frac{80}{4.9} \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ t^{2} \\approx 16.3265 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides to find \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t \\approx \\sqrt{16.3265} \\approx 4.04 \\text{ seconds} \\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 4 seconds is one of them. So, the closest answer is C. 4 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nThe vertical motion equation is:\n\n\\[ d = v_{0} t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^{2} \\]\n\nWith \\( d = 80 \\) m, \\( v_{0} = 0 \\) m/s, and \\( a = 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ 80 = 0 \\times t + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times t^{2} \\]\n\n\\[ 80 = 4.9 t^{2} \\]\n\n\\[ t^{2} = \\frac{80}{4.9} \\]\n\n\\[ t^{2} \\approx 16.3265 \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 4.04 \\text{ s} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. The horizontal velocity doesn't affect the time of fall, which makes sense because the horizontal and vertical motions are independent in the absence of air resistance.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if the horizontal velocity could have any impact. Since there's no air resistance, the horizontal velocity doesn't change and doesn't affect the vertical motion. So, the time to fall is solely determined by the vertical distance and gravity.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 4 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
