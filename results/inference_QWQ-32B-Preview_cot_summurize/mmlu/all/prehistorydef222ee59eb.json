The options are:\n\nA. \u201cA penny saved is a penny earned.\u201d\n\nB. \"If you've got it, flaunt it.\"\n\nC. \"Look before you leap.\"\n\nD. \"The last shall be first and the first shall be last.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about the attitude of ancient elites towards resource consumption. So, I need to think about how wealthy or powerful people in ancient times viewed using their resources.\n\nOption A is \u201cA penny saved is a penny earned.\u201d This sounds like a frugal attitude, valuing saving money or resources. But I think ancient elites might not have been so focused on saving; they probably had enough to spend freely.\n\nOption B is \"If you've got it, flaunt it.\" This seems more likely for elites. They probably wanted to show off their wealth and status through conspicuous consumption.\n\nOption C is \"Look before you leap.\" This is more about being cautious in decisions, not specifically about consumption.\n\nOption D is \"The last shall be first and the first shall be last.\" This seems more related to social hierarchy or morality, not to consumption patterns.\n\nConsidering this, option B appears to be the most fitting. Ancient elites likely consumed resources lavishly to display their power and status.\n\nBut maybe I should consider specific examples. For instance, in ancient Rome, elites built grand villas, held elaborate banquets, and commissioned artworks to showcase their wealth. Similarly, in ancient Egypt, pharaohs built pyramids and filled them with treasures to demonstrate their power and wealth.\n\nIn contrast, \u201ca penny saved is a penny earned\u201d is more aligned with middle-class or merchant values, focusing on thrift and prudence, which might not have been the primary concern for elites who had abundant resources.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. \"If you've got it, flaunt it.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
