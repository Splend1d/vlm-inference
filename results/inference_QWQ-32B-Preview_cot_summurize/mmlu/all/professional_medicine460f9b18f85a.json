She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, \"I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months.\" She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks?\"\n\nA. Adrenal insufficiency\nB. Anxiety\nC. Atlanto-axial instability\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this case here about a 44-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who's been experiencing increasing pain, stiffness, fatigue, and some weight loss. She also mentions these \"drop attacks\" where she feels weak and loses feeling in her legs for a few minutes, and once she became incontinent during one of these episodes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what rheumatoid arthritis is and how it can affect other parts of the body besides the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and stiffness. But it can also affect other organs and systems in the body.\n\nLooking at her symptoms, she has increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees, which is consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. She's also experiencing fatigue and weight loss, which can be associated with chronic inflammation from the disease. The facial plethora might indicate some other underlying issue, perhaps related to her medication or another condition.\n\nNow, the \"drop attacks\" are the main focus here. She describes them as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes, with one instance of incontinence. This sounds like a sudden onset of neurological symptoms, possibly related to the nervous system.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Adrenal insufficiency: This can cause fatigue, weight loss, and other symptoms, but typically doesn't present with \"drop attacks\" involving leg weakness and sensory loss.\n\nB. Anxiety: Anxiety can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue and weakness, but the description here seems more specific to neurological symptoms, which might not be solely explained by anxiety.\n\nC. Atlanto-axial instability: This refers to instability between the first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas and axis. In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation can affect the joints in the neck, leading to instability. This can compress the spinal cord and lead to neurological symptoms, including weakness and sensory loss in the limbs, which aligns with her \"drop attacks.\"\n\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia: While arrhythmias can cause syncope or fainting, the description here mentions leg weakness and sensory loss, which is more suggestive of a neurological issue rather than a cardiac one.\n\nGiven her history of rheumatoid arthritis and the symptoms described, atlanto-axial instability seems like the most likely cause of her \"drop attacks.\" It's important to consider that rheumatoid arthritis can affect the cervical spine and lead to instability, which can compress the spinal cord and cause these kinds of symptoms.\n\nI should also consider whether there are other possible causes, but based on the information provided, atlanto-axial instability appears to be the most plausible explanation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC. Atlanto-axial instability"
