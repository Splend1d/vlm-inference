Hindu and Buddhist\n\nB. Hindu and Muslim\n\nC. Muslim and Jewish\n\nD. Christian and Buddhist\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic information about the death practices in these religions.\n\nStarting with Hinduism, I know that cremation is a common practice. In Hindu culture, it's believed that fire helps the soul to ascend to the next world. So, Hindus generally cremate their dead.\n\nNow, Buddhism. Buddhism actually has varied practices depending on the region and tradition. In some Buddhist cultures, like in Thailand, cremation is common, while in others, like Tibet, sky burial is practiced. But overall, cremation is accepted and practiced in many Buddhist traditions.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible because both Hindus and Buddhists have traditions of cremation, even if practices vary.\n\nOption B is Hindu and Muslim. Hindus cremate, but Muslims generally practice burial instead of cremation. Islam considers burial as the preferred method, so cremation is not a long-held tradition in Islam.\n\nOption C is Muslim and Jewish. Again, Muslims prefer burial, and Jews also typically bury their dead promptly, following Jewish law. Cremation is not traditional in Judaism.\n\nOption D is Christian and Buddhist. Christianity has varied practices; some Christian traditions accept cremation, while others prefer burial. However, it's not accurate to say that Christianity has a long-held tradition of cremation universally.\n\nConsidering this, option A, Hindu and Buddhist, seems to be the most appropriate answer because both religions have a history of cremation practices, even if there is variation within Buddhism.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any exceptions or if I'm missing something.\n\nIn Hinduism, cremation is the norm, with some exceptions like for infants or saints who might be buried or have other forms of disposal.\n\nIn Buddhism, as I mentioned, practices vary, but cremation is accepted and common in many areas.\n\nIn contrast, Islam and Judaism have strong traditions against cremation, preferring burial.\n\nChristianity has had a mix of practices, with burial being more common historically, but cremation becoming more accepted in modern times in some denominations.\n\nTherefore, the pair that shares a long-held tradition of cremating their dead is indeed Hindu and Buddhist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
