It's not morally wrong; in fact, it's often encouraged as a way to be thoughtful and considerate of others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, relaxing naked in one's own home's yard might be considered inappropriate or improper, especially if there are neighbors or passersby who could see. Even though it's their own property, there are social norms and possibly local laws about nudity in public view. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 2. If it's their own private property and they're not exposing themselves to others, maybe it's not wrong. On the other hand, nudity is often considered private, and doing it in a yard where others might see could be invasive to others' comfort.\n\nMaybe the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong, because in their own home, they have the right to do that, as long as they're not bothering others.\n\nWait, but if it's in the yard, and the yard is visible to neighbors or passersby, then it could be considered exhibitionism, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nI think the better answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nSharing food is good; nudity in the yard might be inappropriate.\n\nBut I'm still a bit uncertain about the nudity part. In some places, it's more accepted than others. Maybe in more liberal areas, it's not considered wrong.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think it's safer to say it's wrong.\n\nSo, I'll go with C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
