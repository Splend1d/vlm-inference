                    "text": "To determine Palmyra Co.'s comprehensive income, we need to understand the components that make up comprehensive income and how they are accounted for.\n\nComprehensive income is a broader measure of a company's financial performance over a period and includes both net income and other comprehensive items that are not reflected in net income.\n\nHere are the components provided:\n\n1. Net income: $11,000\n\n2. Positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle\n\n3. $3,000 unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities\n\n4. Positive $2,000 foreign currency translation adjustment\n\n5. $6,000 increase in common stock\n\nFirst, let's clarify what each of these components represents:\n\n- Net income: This is the primary measure of a company's profit over a period.\n\n- Net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle: This is the adjustment required when a company changes its accounting principle, and it's reported net of tax.\n\n- Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: This is a loss that has not been realized through sale but is recognized due to market value changes. It's part of other comprehensive income.\n\n- Foreign currency translation adjustment: This arises from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into the reporting currency. It's also part of other comprehensive income.\n\n- Increase in common stock: This typically represents new issuance of shares and is part of equity but not directly part of comprehensive income.\n\nNow, to calculate comprehensive income, we need to add net income to other comprehensive income items.\n\nOther comprehensive income items here are:\n\n- Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: ($3,000)\n\n- Foreign currency translation adjustment: $2,000\n\nNet of these, other comprehensive income is ($3,000) + $2,000 = ($1,000)\n\nNow, comprehensive income = net income + other comprehensive income\n\n= $11,000 + ($1,000) = $10,000\n\nHowever, we also have the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, which is $1,000. This is typically reported net of tax and is added to net income.\n\nSo, adjusted net income = net income + net cumulative effect = $11,000 + $1,000 = $12,000\n\nThen, comprehensive income = adjusted net income + other comprehensive income\n\n= $12,000 + ($1,000) = $11,000\n\nWait, but in the initial calculation, without considering the change in accounting principle, comprehensive income was $10,000. Including the change in accounting principle increases net income to $12,000, and then adding other comprehensive income of ($1,000) gives $11,000.\n\nBut let's consider if the change in accounting principle is part of other comprehensive income or not. Actually, the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is added to net income, not to other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Start with net income: $11,000\n\n2. Add the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle: +$1,000\n\nThis gives adjusted net income: $12,000\n\n3. Add other comprehensive income items:\n\n- Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities: ($3,000)\n\n- Foreign currency translation adjustment: $2,000\n\nTotal other comprehensive income: ($3,000) + $2,000 = ($1,000)\n\n4. Comprehensive income = adjusted net income + other comprehensive income\n\n= $12,000 + ($1,000) = $11,000\n\nTherefore, the comprehensive income is $11,000.\n\nHowever, let's double-check if the increase in common stock should be considered. Typically, an increase in common stock due to new issuance is reported in the statement of shareholders' equity and does not directly affect comprehensive income. Comprehensive income affects retained earnings, which is a component of shareholders' equity, but the increase in common stock is a separate component.\n\nHence, the $6,000 increase in common stock does not impact the calculation of comprehensive income.\n\nSo, the final comprehensive income is $11,000.\n\nBut wait, option C is $11,000, which seems to be the answer based on this calculation. However, let's consider if there's any other aspect to consider.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that the net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is already included in net income, and other comprehensive income items are added separately.\n\nBut according to GAAP, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is reported net of tax and is added to net income in the period of change.\n\nTherefore, the initial net income of $11,000 already includes this $1,000, or it should be added separately. The question mentions \"positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,\" which suggests it's an additional amount beyond net income.\n\nIf that's the case, then adjusted net income is $11,000 + $1,000 = $12,000\n\nThen, other comprehensive income is ($3,000) + $2,000 = ($1,000)\n\nTherefore, comprehensive income is $12,000 + ($1,000) = $11,000\n\nThis aligns with option C.\n\nHowever, another perspective might be that the net cumulative effect is already included in the net income figure provided, meaning net income already reflects this change. If that's the case, then net income is $11,000, which includes the $1,000, and other comprehensive income is ($1,000), leading to comprehensive income of $10,000.\n\nBut based on the wording, \"net income of $11,000, a positive $1,000 net cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,\" it seems like the $1,000 is in addition to net income.\n\nTherefore, comprehensive income is $12,000 (net income plus change) plus other comprehensive income of ($1,000), totaling $11,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. $11,000\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nC. $11,000"
