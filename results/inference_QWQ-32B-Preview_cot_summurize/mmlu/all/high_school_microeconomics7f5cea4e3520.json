                    "text": "So I've got this question about international trade between the United States and Peru. They're trading salmon and anchovies, and it says they're basing this trade on relative opportunity costs. I need to figure out which option must be true given that.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what comparative advantage and absolute advantage are, because options A, B, C, and D mention both.\n\nComparative advantage is about who can produce something at a lower opportunity cost compared to another party. It's not about being the best at producing something, but about who gives up the least to produce it. On the other hand, absolute advantage is about who can produce more of something using the same amount of resources, or who can produce something using fewer resources.\n\nSo, since the question mentions \"relative opportunity costs,\" I think it's pointing towards comparative advantage.\n\nLet me look at option A: \"The United States has a comparative advantage in anchovy production, and Peru has a comparative advantage in salmon production.\"\n\nWait a minute, they're trading salmon for anchovies. So the U.S. is sending salmon to Peru and getting anchovies in return. If the U.S. has a comparative advantage in anchovy production, that would mean the U.S. is efficient at producing anchovies relative to Peru. But if that's the case, why would the U.S. be sending salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies? Wouldn't it make more sense for the U.S. to produce anchovies and Peru to produce something else?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let's consider option B: \"The United States has a comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovy production.\"\n\nIf the U.S. has a comparative advantage in salmon, that means it can produce salmon at a lower opportunity cost than Peru. Similarly, if Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovies, it can produce anchovies at a lower opportunity cost than the U.S.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the U.S. should specialize in producing salmon and trade for anchovies, which is exactly what's happening in the question. The U.S. is sending salmon to Peru and getting anchovies in return.\n\nThis makes sense because both countries can benefit from specializing in what they have a comparative advantage in and trading for the other good.\n\nLet me check option C: \"The United States has an absolute advantage in anchovy production, and Peru has an absolute advantage in salmon production.\"\n\nAbsolute advantage is about who can produce more of something using the same resources. But trade based on absolute advantage isn't as efficient as trade based on comparative advantage. Countries can still trade based on absolute advantage, but the gains might not be as significant.\n\nHowever, the question specifies that they're trading based on relative opportunity costs, which aligns more with comparative advantage. So option C might not be the best answer.\n\nOption D says: \"The United States has an absolute advantage in salmon production, and Peru has an absolute advantage in anchovy production.\"\n\nAgain, this is about absolute advantage, not comparative advantage. While it's possible they're trading based on absolute advantage, the question specifies relative opportunity costs, which points to comparative advantage.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option B seems to fit best: the U.S. has a comparative advantage in salmon production, and Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovy production. This would explain why the U.S. is exporting salmon to Peru in exchange for anchovies.\n\nLet me double-check. If the U.S. has a comparative advantage in salmon, it means that producing salmon is less opportunity-costly for them than producing anchovies. Similarly, Peru has a comparative advantage in anchovies, meaning producing anchovies is less opportunity-costly for them than producing salmon.\n\nTherefore, both countries benefit by specializing in their comparative advantage and trading.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
