Tapering\n\nC. The classic glycogen loading regime\n\nD. Exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these means and how they relate to endurance performance.\n\nStarting with A, carbohydrate loading: This is when athletes consume a high-carb diet in the days leading up to an event to maximize glycogen stores in their muscles and liver. Glycogen is the stored form of carbohydrate in the body, and it's a primary energy source during exercise. So, carb loading should help by providing more energy for the workout or race.\n\nOption B is tapering. Tapering is actually a training strategy where an athlete reduces their training load before a big event to allow their body to rest and recover. While tapering is important for performance, it's not a nutritional strategy. It's more about adjusting exercise volume and intensity. So, maybe this is the answer because it's not related to nutrition.\n\nOption C, the classic glycogen loading regime, sounds similar to carbohydrate loading. Glycogen is stored carbohydrate, so loading up on carbs should increase glycogen stores. Therefore, this should also help performance.\n\nOption D is exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise. This means consuming carbs while you're exercising, like energy gels, drinks, or bars. This can help maintain blood glucose levels and provide additional energy during long workouts or races.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, C, and D are all about manipulating carbohydrate intake to affect energy stores or supply during exercise, which should theoretically improve performance. Option B, tapering, is a training strategy, not a nutritional one.\n\nBut the question is asking for the nutritional strategy that will NOT improve performance during prolonged endurance exercise. Since tapering isn't a nutritional strategy, maybe the answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a nutritional aspect to tapering that I'm missing. Sometimes, during tapering, athletes might adjust their calorie intake or macronutrient ratios, but that's secondary to the reduction in training volume.\n\nWait, maybe the question is trying to trick me by including tapering, which is not a nutritional strategy at all. So, among the options provided, tapering is the only one that isn't a nutritional approach.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Tapering, because it's a training strategy, not a nutritional one, and thus doesn't directly improve performance through nutrition.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider if any of the other options might not improve performance.\n\nCarbohydrate loading (A) is a well-established method to enhance endurance performance by increasing muscle glycogen stores.\n\nThe classic glycogen loading regime (C) is essentially the same as carbohydrate loading, so it should also improve performance.\n\nExogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise (D) has been shown to delay fatigue and improve performance in events lasting longer than about an hour.\n\nSo, indeed, tapering (B) is the only option that isn't a nutritional strategy, and therefore, it doesn't improve performance through nutrition.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
