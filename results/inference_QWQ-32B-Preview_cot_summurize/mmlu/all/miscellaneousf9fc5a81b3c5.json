                    "text": "Let's tackle this question. I need to identify which list includes minerals only. So, first things first, I need to remember what a mineral is. A mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic substance with a specific chemical composition and crystal structure. Okay, got it.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Granite, gabbro, diorite, quartz, feldspar.\n\nHmm, granite, gabbro, and diorite sound familiar. I think these are types of rocks, not minerals. Quartz and feldspar, those are minerals, right? So, if the list includes rocks and minerals, it's not all minerals. So, option A is out.\n\nOption B: Gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, corundum.\n\nAlright, gold is definitely a mineral. Quartz, topaz, diamond, and corundum\u2014all of these sound like specific minerals. I don't recall any of these being rocks or other types of substances. So, this list seems promising.\n\nOption C: Gneiss, schist, phyllite, chlorite, mica.\n\nAgain, gneiss, schist, and phyllite are types of metamorphic rocks, right? Chlorite and mica are minerals. So, since there are rocks in the list, it's not all minerals.\n\nOption D: Coal, chert, limestone, dolomite, halite.\n\nCoal is a sedimentary rock, chert is a type of quartzite, limestone is a sedimentary rock, dolomite is both a mineral and a type of rock, and halite is a mineral (table salt). So, there are rocks and minerals in this list as well.\n\nWait a minute, dolomite is both a mineral and a rock? I might need to double-check that. I think dolomite can refer to the mineral calcium magnesium carbonate, and also to a type of sedimentary rock composed mostly of that mineral. So, in this context, perhaps dolomite is being referred to as a mineral.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll assume that dolomite here refers to the mineral. So, in that case, only coal, chert, and limestone would be rocks, while dolomite and halite are minerals. Still, since there are rocks in the list, it's not all minerals.\n\nSo, going back to option B, which has gold, quartz, topaz, diamond, and corundum. All of these are minerals. Gold is a native element, quartz is silicon dioxide, topaz is aluminum fluorosilicate, diamond is carbon, and corundum is aluminum oxide. All of them fit the definition of a mineral.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly recall:\n\n- Native elements are minerals composed of pure elements, like gold.\n\n- Silicates, like quartz, are minerals with silicon and oxygen in their structure.\n\n- Topaz and corundum are non-silicate minerals with specific chemical compositions.\n\n- Diamond is a carbon mineral with a distinct crystal structure.\n\nAll of these are indeed minerals.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
