                    "text": "This is a complex scenario involving contract law and the principles of sale, particularly regarding the delivery and acceptance of goods. Let's break down the situation step by step to determine who is most likely to prevail and in what amount.\n\nFirst, the contract between the collector and the seller specified that the delivery would be \"F.O.B. at the collector's establishment,\" with payment to be made one week after delivery. F.O.B., or \"Free On Board,\" is a term that defines the point at which the responsibility for the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer. In this case, \"F.O.B. at the collector's establishment\" means that the seller is responsible for the goods until they reach the collector's establishment. Once the goods are delivered there, the risk of loss passes to the collector.\n\nThe seller shipped the coin, and upon receipt, the collector noticed a large scratch across the face of the coin, which was not mentioned in the initial description provided by the seller. Despite this defect, the collector accepted the delivery. Acceptance of the goods generally indicates that the buyer is satisfied with the goods as received, or at least chooses to keep them despite any defects.\n\nHowever, the collector later sold the coin to another collector for $12,000, which is $2,000 more than the purchase price from the original seller. The collector has refused to pay the seller, leading to a breach of contract action by the seller and a counterclaim by the collector.\n\nLet's analyze the options one by one:\n\nA. The collector is entitled to nominal damages because the coin was received in a damaged condition.\n\nThis option suggests that the collector should receive nominal damages due to the damaged condition of the coin. However, the collector accepted the delivery despite the damage, which might imply that she is willing to keep the coin in its damaged state. Additionally, she sold it for a higher price, suggesting that the damage did not prevent her from reselling it profitably. Therefore, it's unlikely that the collector would be entitled to nominal damages in this scenario.\n\nB. Neither party should prevail because the risk of loss was on the seller, but the collector did not incur any loss, since she sold the coin for a profit.\n\nThis option considers that the risk of loss was on the seller until delivery, but since the collector sold the coin for a profit, she didn't incur any loss. However, the risk of loss transitioning to the collector upon delivery might not necessarily absolve her from paying for the goods, especially since she accepted the delivery. Moreover, the fact that she sold it for a higher price doesn't directly address her obligation to pay the original purchase price.\n\nC. The seller is entitled to $10,000 because the collector accepted delivery of the coin.\n\nThis option seems plausible. When the collector accepted the delivery of the coin, she acknowledged receipt of the goods, and in most contract law scenarios, acceptance of the goods implies an agreement to pay for them as per the contract terms. The fact that the coin was damaged might be a separate issue, potentially giving rise to a claim for breach of warranty or misrepresentation, but it doesn't necessarily negate the obligation to pay for the goods received.\n\nD. The seller is entitled to $12,000 because the collector's resale constituted a conversion.\n\nThis option is intriguing but likely incorrect. Conversion is a tort that involves the wrongful exercise of dominion or control over another person's property. In this case, the collector accepted the delivery of the coin, which means she had the right to possess it. By selling it, she was disposing of property that she had lawfully acquired, so it's unlikely to be considered conversion. Furthermore, the seller sold the coin to the collector for $10,000; any profit the collector made from reselling it shouldn't entitle the seller to that increased amount unless there was a specific agreement to share profits, which there wasn't.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most appropriate. The collector accepted the delivery of the coin and should therefore be obligated to pay the agreed purchase price of $10,000. The fact that the coin was damaged might allow the collector to seek remedies for the breach of warranty or misrepresentation regarding the condition of the coin, but that would be a separate claim from the obligation to pay for the received goods.\n\nIn conclusion, the seller is most likely to prevail in the breach of contract action, entitlement to $10,000 from the collector for the delivered coin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
