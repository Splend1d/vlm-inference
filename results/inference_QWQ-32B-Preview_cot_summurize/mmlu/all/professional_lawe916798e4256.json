The niece and her husband took immediate possession of the farm and lived there with their daughter and son. Thereafter, the husband died in an automobile accident. In 1972, two years after her father's death, the daughter moved to another state. The son lived with his mother on the farm until her death intestate in 1980. The son continued in exclusive possession of the farm until his death in 2001. In his will, the son devised the farm to a local charity. When he was alive, the son was unaware that his sister was still alive and that title to the farm had descended to the two of them as their mother's sole surviving heirs. Since his mother's death in 1980, the son has held himself out as the owner of the farm, maintaining it and paying all of the taxes on the property. The sister had not communicated with either her mother or her brother since her redomiciling in 1972. The jurisdiction in which the farm is located has a 20-year limitation period for the acquisition of property by adverse possession. What interest, if any, does the sister have in the property?\n\nA. None, because of her own laches.\nB. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\nC.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this farm that was owned by a farmer who devised it to his niece and her husband as tenants by the entirety. That means they own the property together, and neither can sell or dispose of it without the other's consent. When the husband died, what happens to the tenancy by the entirety?\n\nI think tenancy by the entirety is only available to married couples, so when one spouse dies, it converts to something else, maybe tenancy in common or sole ownership to the surviving spouse. But I'm not sure about the specifics here.\n\nThen, the daughter moves away in 1972, two years after her father's death, and the son stays with his mother until she dies intestate in 1980. So, when the mother dies intestate, how does that affect the ownership of the farm?\n\nI guess since the mother died intestate, meaning without a will, the farm would pass to her heirs according to the laws of intestacy in that jurisdiction. Who are her heirs? Her children, the son and the daughter.\n\nSo, presumably, the farm would be divided between the son and the daughter as heirs of their mother.\n\nBut the son continued to live on the farm and held himself out as the owner, maintaining it and paying taxes on it until his death in 2001. And in his will, he devised the farm to a local charity.\n\nHowever, the sister had moved away in 1972 and hadn't communicated with anyone since then. She was unaware that her mother had died and that her brother was exclusively possessing the farm.\n\nNow, the jurisdiction has a 20-year limitation period for acquiring property by adverse possession. So, if someone possesses land adversely to the true owner for 20 years, they can get title to it.\n\nBut in this case, the son was living on the farm and treating it as his own since his mother's death in 1980 until his own death in 2001, which is more than 20 years.\n\nBut the sister was unaware of all this because she was away and not communicating. So, does the 20-year limitation period still apply to her?\n\nI think there's a concept called \"tacking\" in adverse possession, where if multiple people possess the land adversely in a privity relationship, their possession periods can be added together.\n\nBut here, the son and the mother, maybe, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the mother died in 1980, and the son started possessing the land from then on. So, it's the son's possession from 1980 to 2001, which is 21 years, exceeding the 20-year period.\n\nBut the sister was unaware that her brother was exclusively possessing the farm and that she had an interest in it.\n\nSo, does her lack of knowledge affect the running of the limitation period against her?\n\nI think there's a principle that if a party is ignorant of the facts, the limitation period might not run against them.\n\nMoreover, the son was unaware that his sister was still alive and that title had descended to both of them.\n\nSo, was the son's possession adverse to the sister's title?\n\nWell, tenancy in common, if that's what they had after their mother's death, each owns a undivided half interest.\n\nIf the son was possessing the entire farm without acknowledging his sister's interest, that could be adverse possession.\n\nBut she was absent and unaware, so perhaps the limitation period doesn't run against her.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. None, because of her own laches.\n\nLaches is a doctrine that bars claims due to unreasonable delay in asserting a right, coupled with detrimental reliance by the other party.\n\nHere, the sister hasn't communicated or asserted her rights for a long time, but she was unaware.\n\nSo, maybe laches wouldn't apply because lack of knowledge.\n\nB. None, because the brother acquired title to the farm by adverse possession.\n\nWell, the brother possessed the farm for more than 20 years, but does that extinguish the sister's title?\n\nMaybe, but considering she was unaware and not on notice, perhaps not.\n\nC. An undivided one-half interest because the brother's possession was not adverse to her title.\n\nThis suggests that the brother's possession wasn't adverse, so he didn't acquire title via adverse possession.\n\nBut if they were co-tenants and he was excluding her, that seems adverse.\n\nD. An undivided one-half interest because the 20-year limitation period did not run against her because she was unaware of the brother's exclusive possession.\n\nThis seems plausible because her lack of knowledge might prevent the limitation period from running against her.\n\nSo, perhaps she still has her undivided one-half interest.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
