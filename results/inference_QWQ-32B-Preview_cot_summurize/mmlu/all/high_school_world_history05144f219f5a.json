When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich element of the Hindu religion can this passage be used to explain?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from the Rig Veda, which is one of the most ancient sacred texts in Hinduism. It talks about something called Purusa-Sukta, which seems to be a hymn describing the cosmic being named Purusa. The hymn describes how the gods performed a sacrifice using Purusa himself as the offering, and from this sacrifice, different parts of the universe and human society were created.\n\nSo, the passage mentions that from Purusa's mouth came the Brahmins (the priestly class), from his arms came the Ksatriyas (the warrior class), from his thighs came the Vaisyas (the commoner class), and from his feet came the Sudras (the servant class). This seems to be the basis for the caste system in Hindu society.\n\nNow, the question is asking which element of Hindu religion this passage can be used to explain. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The only requirement for salvation being faith.\n\nWell, this passage doesn't really talk about salvation or faith. It's more about the creation of the world and society through sacrifice. So, probably not A.\n\nB. The importance of environmental stewardship.\n\nHmm, environmental stewardship isn't directly addressed here. The passage mentions that from the sacrifice came different aspects of nature, like beasts of the air, forest, and village, but it doesn't\u5f3a\u8c03 environmental responsibility or stewardship. So, maybe not B.\n\nC. The importance of sacrifice to the gods.\n\nThis seems promising. The entire hymn is about a sacrifice performed by the gods using Purusa as the offering. It describes in detail what was used in the sacrifice\u2014spring as clarified butter, summer as kindling, autumn as oblation\u2014and what came out of it\u2014the different social classes, the Vedas, and various animals.\n\nSo, it appears that sacrifice is a central theme here. In Hinduism, sacrifice, or yajna, is indeed an important concept, representing a way to connect with the divine and maintain the order of the universe.\n\nD. The emphasis on karma, or right actions, to achieve enlightenment.\n\nAgain, this passage doesn't directly talk about karma or enlightenment. It's more about the creation myth through sacrifice.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the most appropriate choice. The passage can be used to explain the importance of sacrifice to the gods in Hindu religion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
