                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Grant Co.'s sales budget and I need to figure out how many units should be produced in the first quarter. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, there's a sales budget with projections for each quarter:\n\n- First quarter: 30,000 units\n\n- Second quarter: 40,000 units\n\n- Third quarter: 22,500 units\n\n- Fourth quarter: 27,500 units\n\nAnd the total for the year is 120,000 units. That checks out because 30,000 plus 40,000 is 70,000, plus 22,500 is 92,500, and then plus 27,500 does equal 120,000.\n\nNow, there's an inventory at the beginning of the year, which is budgeted at 9,000 units. And it says that the quantity of finished goods inventory at the end of each quarter should equal 30% of the next quarter's budgeted sales of units.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the production for the first quarter. To do that, I think I need to consider the sales for the first quarter and the desired ending inventory for that quarter.\n\nLet me recall the formula for production budget. It's something like:\n\nUnits to be produced = Sales + Ending inventory - Beginning inventory\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, for the first quarter:\n\nUnits to be produced (Q1) = Sales (Q1) + Ending inventory (Q1) - Beginning inventory\n\nNow, Sales (Q1) is 30,000 units.\n\nBeginning inventory is 9,000 units.\n\nAnd ending inventory for Q1 should be 30% of Q2's budgeted sales. Q2's sales are 40,000 units, so 30% of that is 0.3 * 40,000 = 12,000 units.\n\nSo, plugging these into the formula:\n\nUnits to be produced (Q1) = 30,000 + 12,000 - 9,000 = 33,000 units.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. The company needs to have enough units to sell 30,000 in Q1 and also have an ending inventory of 12,000 units for Q2. They start with 9,000 units in inventory.\n\nSo, they need to produce enough to cover the sales and the additional inventory needed.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n- They have 9,000 units at the start.\n\n- They produce X units in Q1.\n\n- They sell 30,000 units.\n\n- So, ending inventory should be beginning inventory plus production minus sales.\n\n- And that ending inventory should be equal to 12,000 units.\n\nSo, 9,000 + X - 30,000 = 12,000\n\nSolving for X: X = 12,000 + 30,000 - 9,000 = 33,000 units.\n\nYes, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, the production budget for the first quarter should show 33,000 units to be produced.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 36,000\n\nB. 33,000\n\nC. 24,000\n\nD. 12,000\n\nOption B is 33,000, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there anything else that affects production besides sales and inventory?\n\nIn this problem, it seems straightforward. They just need to meet the sales demand and maintain the desired ending inventory.\n\nLet me see if the other quarters make sense with this approach.\n\nFor example, second quarter:\n\nUnits to be produced (Q2) = Sales (Q2) + Ending inventory (Q2) - Beginning inventory (Q2)\n\nEnding inventory for Q2 should be 30% of Q3's sales, which is 22,500 * 0.3 = 6,750 units.\n\nBeginning inventory for Q2 is the ending inventory of Q1, which is 12,000 units.\n\nSo, Units to be produced (Q2) = 40,000 + 6,750 - 12,000 = 34,750 units.\n\nSimilarly, for Q3:\n\nEnding inventory for Q3 should be 30% of Q4's sales, which is 27,500 * 0.3 = 8,250 units.\n\nBeginning inventory for Q3 is the ending inventory of Q2, which is 6,750 units.\n\nSo, Units to be produced (Q3) = 22,500 + 8,250 - 6,750 = 24,000 units.\n\nAnd for Q4:\n\nEnding inventory for Q4 should be 30% of next year's Q1 sales, but since it's the end of the year and no information is given about next year, perhaps it's assumed to be zero, or perhaps it's not relevant for this question.\n\nBut since the question is only about the first quarter, I don't need to worry about the other quarters beyond using them to calculate the ending inventories.\n\nAnyway, back to Q1, it seems my calculation is correct, and the answer should be 33,000 units.\n\nI think option B is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
