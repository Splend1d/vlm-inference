                    "text": "Let's dive into this passage by William Morris. It's from his essay \"How I Became a Socialist,\" published in 1896. Morris was an influential writer, artist, and socialist activist in the 19th century. So, understanding his perspective is key to interpreting this text.\n\nFirst, Morris talks about his passions: producing beautiful things and hating modern civilization. He's clearly\u4e0d\u6ee1 with the society of his time, which he sees as sordid, aimless, and ugly. He criticizes the misuse of mechanical power, the vast wealth of a few while the common people are poor, and the destruction of art due to \"eyeless vulgarity.\" It's evident that he values beauty, simplicity, and a connection to the past.\n\nMorris mentions that in the past, there was a hope, but it's gone now. He feels that mankind's struggles over many ages have only led to this sordid confusion. He's particularly concerned about the future, thinking that it might make things worse by eliminating the last remnants of a better time before modern civilization took over.\n\nPersonally, Morris describes himself as someone who isn't interested in metaphysics, religion, or scientific analysis, but who has a deep love for the earth and its life, and a passion for the history of mankind. This gives us insight into his values and worldview.\n\nNow, the question is asking what we can infer about Morris from this passage, specifically regarding his choice to become a socialist. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.\n\nThis seems aligned with what Morris is expressing. He's critical of modern civilization's waste of mechanical power, the poverty of the commonwealth, and the richness of its enemies. He sees the organization of society as aimed at the misery of life, and he's concerned about the destruction of art and simple pleasures. So, it makes sense that these appallments would lead him to seek an alternative like socialism.\n\nB. Chose to become a socialist because of the persuasiveness of Marx's arguments.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention Marx or any specific intellectual influence. Morris says that he didn't know why things were so bad, and that the hope of past times was gone. He doesn't attribute his conversion to socialism to Marx's arguments. So, this option seems less supported by the text.\n\nC. Rejected socialism because it produced nothing but ugly confusion.\n\nThis directly contradicts the title of the essay, \"How I Became a Socialist.\" Morris is explaining his path to socialism, not his rejection of it. So, this can be ruled out.\n\nD. Rejected socialism because of a deep love of the Earth and the life on it.\n\nAgain, this contradicts the title and the content of the passage. Morris is explaining why he became a socialist, not why he rejected it. His love for the earth and life on it seems to be a motivation for wanting a better society, which led him to socialism.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate inference is option A: Morris chose to become a socialist because he was appalled by the great waste of resources and general misery caused by modern society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Morris was part of the socialist movement that sought to create a more equitable society, where the fruits of labor were shared more fairly, and where beauty and craftsmanship were valued over mass production and consumerism. His ideas influenced the Arts and Crafts movement, which aimed to restore the beauty and quality of handmade goods in opposition to industrialization.\n\nIn conclusion, Morris's disillusionment with modern civilization and his desire for a more beautiful, equitable world led him to embrace socialism. His specific criticisms of waste, misery, and the destruction of art are central to his argument for why socialism is a better path forward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
