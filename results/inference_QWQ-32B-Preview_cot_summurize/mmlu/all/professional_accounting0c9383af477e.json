                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about where to report the land donated to the city for windmills. The options are special revenue, capital projects, enterprise, or permanent fund. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each fund type is for:\n\n1. **Special Revenue Fund**: This is typically used to account for revenues that are legally restricted to expenditure for specific purposes other than debt service or capital projects. So, it's for money set aside for particular uses.\n\n2. **Capital Projects Fund**: This fund is used to account for financing and constructing major capital facilities like buildings, roads, or in this case, windmills. It's for big-ticket items that are not part of the day-to-day operations.\n\n3. **Enterprise Fund**: This is used to account for activities that are similar to private businesses, where the focus is on providing goods or services to the public on a cost-recovery basis. Utilities often fall under this category since they aim to generate revenue to cover their costs.\n\n4. **Permanent Fund**: This is for funds where the principal is intended to be kept intact, and only the income generated from it is used. Think of endowments or trusts where the original amount is preserved.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the city is constructing windmills to generate electrical power. The construction is financed through a residential property tax levy over ten years, and utility revenues are meant to offset all expenses associated with the windmills. The land was donated by a local farmer.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- The windmills are for generating electrical power.\n\n- Construction is financed by a property tax levy.\n\n- Utility revenues will offset expenses.\n\n- The land was donated.\n\nGiven these points, I need to decide which fund type the donated land should be reported in.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**A. Special Revenue Fund**: This seems unlikely because the land is a capital asset, not a revenue source. Plus, it's being used for a specific capital project, which might make more sense to report in a capital projects fund.\n\n**B. Capital Projects Fund**: This sounds promising because the windmills are a capital project. The land is part of this project, so it makes sense to report it in the capital projects fund.\n\n**C. Enterprise Fund**: While the windmills will generate utility revenues, which might suggest an enterprise fund, the construction phase is more aligned with a capital projects fund. However, once the windmills are operational, their ongoing operations might be reported in an enterprise fund.\n\n**D. Permanent Fund**: There's no indication that the land is intended to be held permanently with only its income being used. The land is being used for construction, so this doesn't seem applicable.\n\nConsidering this, it seems that the land should be reported in the Capital Projects Fund because it's a capital asset being used for a major capital project.\n\nBut wait, I should think about the entire life cycle of the project. During construction, it makes sense to use the capital projects fund, but after construction, once the windmills are operational, perhaps the assets would be transferred to an enterprise fund.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about the land donated for the windmills, and the construction is financed through a tax levy, with utility revenues offsetting expenses. The land was donated, so it doesn't have a monetary value assigned to it, but it's a valuable asset for the project.\n\nGiven that the construction is a capital project and the land is part of that project, it makes the most sense to report the land in the Capital Projects Fund.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Capital projects.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
