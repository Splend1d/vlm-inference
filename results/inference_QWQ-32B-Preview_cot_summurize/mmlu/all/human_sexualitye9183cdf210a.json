According to Freud, the phallic stage, which is when the penis becomes the major focus of pleasure-seeking, occurs between the ages of 3 and 6.\n\nDuring this stage, children begin to identify with their same-sex parent and develop feelings of rivalry and desire towards the opposite-sex parent, leading to the Oedipus complex in boys and the Electra complex in girls. Freud believed that successful resolution of this stage leads to the development of the superego, which internalizes societal rules and morals.\n\nIt's important to note that Freud's theories have been widely criticized and are not universally accepted in the field of psychology today. Many modern psychologists consider his ideas to be outdated, lacking empirical support, and overly focused on sexuality. However, understanding Freud's concepts is still valuable for historical and theoretical contexts in psychology."
