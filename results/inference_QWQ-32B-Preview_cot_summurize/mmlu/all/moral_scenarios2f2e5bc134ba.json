                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I shoplifted the Porsche.\n\n2. I guarded my best friend's dark secrets.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each scenario is saying.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person is shoplifting a Porsche. Shoplifting is stealing, right? Taking something without paying for it or without the owner's permission. Stealing is generally considered morally wrong because it violates the property rights of others. It's against the law, and morally, it's about respecting other people's possessions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is guarding their best friend's dark secrets. This seems like they are keeping something private for their friend, maybe something embarrassing or potentially harmful if revealed. Keeping secrets for a friend is often seen as being loyal and trustworthy. However, it depends on what the secrets are. If the secrets involve illegal activities or harm to others, then keeping those secrets might not be morally right because it could enable further wrongdoings.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, if the secrets don't harm anyone else, and it's just about privacy and trust between friends, then guarding those secrets might be considered morally acceptable.\n\nSo, considering that:\n\n- Shoplifting a Porsche is clearly morally wrong because it's stealing.\n\n- Guarding a friend's dark secrets might or might not be wrong, depending on what the secrets are. But without more context, it's generally seen as being a good friend, which is positive.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is wrong, and the second one is not necessarily wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems that option B fits: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is shoplifting clearly morally wrong? Yes, I think everyone would agree that stealing is wrong.\n\nAnd guarding a friend's secrets\u2014unless those secrets involve harming others\u2014is generally acceptable.\n\nSo, my answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
