                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options is considered a liability on a bank's balance sheet. I know that a balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Liabilities are what the bank owes to others, right?\n\nOption A is required reserves. I think required reserves are amounts that banks are required by regulators to hold onto and not lend out. So, are reserves an asset or a liability? Actually, reserves are part of the bank's assets because they are cash or deposits held at the central bank. So, probably not a liability.\n\nOption B is excess reserves. These are reserves beyond what is required. Again, since they are reserves, they should be part of the bank's assets, not liabilities.\n\nOption C is loans. When a bank makes a loan, it's essentially giving money to a borrower. So, loans are assets because they represent money that the bank expects to be repaid with interest. So, not a liability.\n\nOption D is deposits. Deposits are money that customers have placed with the bank. The bank owes this money to its customers, so customers can withdraw their deposits whenever they want (within certain limits). Therefore, deposits are liabilities of the bank because the bank owes this money to its depositors.\n\nSo, among the options given, deposits are the liability on the bank's balance sheet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
