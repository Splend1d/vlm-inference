There are two main types: categorical and hypothetical imperatives.\n\n1. **Categorical Imperative**: This is an unconditional command that applies universally, regardless of one's desires or goals. It is based on reason alone and is considered morally binding in all situations. The most famous formulation is \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\"\n\n2. **Hypothetical Imperative**: This type of imperative is conditional and depends on achieving a particular end or goal. It represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed. For example, \"If you want to be healthy, you should exercise regularly.\" Here, exercising is a means to the end of being healthy.\n\nGiven the description in the question, \"an imperative that represents an action as a necessary means to something that is willed,\" it clearly refers to a hypothetical imperative because it is conditional upon wanting to achieve a specific goal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. hypothetical."
