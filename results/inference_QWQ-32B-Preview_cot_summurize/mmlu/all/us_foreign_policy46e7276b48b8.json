It is composed of 15 members in total, but not all members have the same status or powers.\n\nLet's look at the options provided:\n\nA. 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power\n\nB. 5 permanent members and 10 rotating members, all with veto power\n\nC. 10 permanent members with veto power, and 5 rotating members without veto power\n\nD. 15 permanent members with veto power\n\nFirst, it's important to know that the Security Council has both permanent and non-permanent members. Permanent members are those that hold their seat continuously, while non-permanent members are elected for a set term and rotate.\n\nFrom historical context and the UN Charter, there are 5 permanent members of the Security Council. These are often referred to as the P5 and include China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries have held their positions since the founding of the UN and have special powers, including the veto power.\n\nVeto power allows a permanent member to prevent the adoption of a substantive resolution, even if it has the support of all other members. This is a crucial aspect of the Security Council's functioning, as it can block decisions that any one of these major powers opposes.\n\nNow, considering the non-permanent members: there are 10 non-permanent members that are elected by the General Assembly for two-year terms. These seats are distributed regionally to ensure representation from different parts of the world.\n\nUnlike permanent members, non-permanent members do not have veto power. They participate fully in the deliberations and voting on resolutions, but their votes cannot block a resolution in the same way a permanent member's veto can.\n\nGiven this information, let's evaluate the options:\n\nOption A states: 5 permanent members with veto power, 10 rotating members with no veto power. This aligns perfectly with what we've established.\n\nOption B suggests that all 15 members have veto power, which is incorrect because only the permanent members have veto power.\n\nOption C proposes 10 permanent members with veto power and 5 rotating members without veto power. This is not accurate; there are only 5 permanent members.\n\nOption D claims that all 15 members are permanent and have veto power, which is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A: 5 permanent members with veto power and 10 rotating members with no veto power.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while non-permanent members don't have veto power, their input and votes are still crucial for the passage of resolutions, as decisions in the Security Council require at least nine affirmative votes (excluding vetoes) to be adopted.\n\nIn summary, the structure of the United Nations Security Council consists of 5 permanent members who possess veto power and 10 non-permanent members who are elected for two-year terms and do not have veto power.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
