                    "text": "So Kelly has picked a mystery number that's a factor of 38. We need to figure out which one of these options could be her number: 2, 3, 4, or 8. Okay, let's start by understanding what a factor is. A factor of a number is an integer that divides that number completely without leaving a remainder. So, for 38, we need to find all the numbers that can divide 38 without leaving any remainder.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors of 38. To do that, we can find pairs of numbers that multiply to give 38.\n\n1. 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n\n2. 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n\nAlright, so from this, the factors of 38 are 1, 2, 19, and 38.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 8\n\nWe can see that 2 is in the list of factors we just found. So, 2 is definitely a possible mystery number.\n\nLet's check the others to make sure.\n\nOption B is 3. Is 3 a factor of 38? Well, 38 divided by 3 is 12 with a remainder of 2, because 3 times 12 is 36, and 36 plus 2 is 38. So, there's a remainder, which means 3 is not a factor of 38.\n\nOption C is 4. Let's divide 38 by 4. 4 times 9 is 36, and 36 plus 2 is 38, so again, there's a remainder of 2. Therefore, 4 is not a factor of 38.\n\nOption D is 8. Dividing 38 by 8, 8 times 4 is 32, and 32 plus 6 is 38, so there's a remainder of 6. Hence, 8 is not a factor of 38.\n\nSo, among the options given, only 2 is a factor of 38.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check if there are any other factors of 38 that might be missing. We already have 1, 2, 19, and 38. Is there any other number that can divide 38 without leaving a remainder? Let's see:\n\nLet's try 19. 19 times 2 is 38, which we already have. And 38 divided by 1 is 38, which is also already listed. So, no, those are all the factors.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is a factor of 38 is 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure that 38 doesn't have any other factors. Maybe by checking divisibility rules for the other options.\n\nFor example, for 4: A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4. In this case, 38, the last two digits are 38. 38 divided by 4 is 9.5, which is not an integer, so 4 is not a factor.\n\nFor 8: A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number that's divisible by 8. Since 38 is a two-digit number, we can directly divide it by 8, which gives 4.75, not an integer, so 8 is not a factor.\n\nFor 3: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. 3 + 8 = 11, and 11 is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a factor.\n\nSo, again, confirming that 2 is the only option that is a factor of 38.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
