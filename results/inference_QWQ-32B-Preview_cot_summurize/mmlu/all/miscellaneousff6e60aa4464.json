The teacher is talking to preschool students about colors, and the question gives examples like red, yellow, and blue. We need to figure out what kind of colors these are on the color wheel. The options are complementary, primary, secondary, or tertiary colors.\n\nFirst, I should remember what each of these terms means in the context of color theory.\n\nPrimary colors are the base colors that can be mixed to create other colors. In traditional color theory, especially in art and design, the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue. These are called the RYB model, which is commonly used in art education.\n\nSecondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors. For example, mixing red and yellow makes orange, yellow and blue make green, and blue and red make violet.\n\nTertiary colors are made by mixing a primary color with a secondary color. These are colors like red-orange, yellow-green, blue-violet, and so on.\n\nComplementary colors are pairs of colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, red and green are complementary colors, as are blue and orange, and yellow and violet.\n\nGiven that red, yellow, and blue are the base colors in the RYB model, it seems like they should be the primary colors. But let's double-check to make sure.\n\nIf I think about the color wheel, primary colors are placed equally spaced around the circle, and then secondary and tertiary colors are placed in between, depending on what they're mixed from.\n\nSo, red, yellow, and blue being the primary colors make sense because you can mix them to get secondary colors like orange, green, and violet.\n\nComplementary colors would be pairs like red and green, but the question is about red, yellow, and blue together, not as pairs.\n\nTertiary colors are more specific combinations of primary and secondary colors, which red, yellow, and blue are not.\n\nSecondary colors are what you get by mixing two primaries, so red and yellow make orange, for example, but red, yellow, and blue are the base colors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Primary.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's any other color model where red, yellow, and blue might be classified differently.\n\nIn the RGB color model used in digital graphics, the primary colors are red, green, and blue. But in that model, yellow would be a secondary color, created by mixing red and green.\n\nHowever, the question mentions a preschool setting, and traditionally, preschools use the RYB color model for art projects and color learning.\n\nAdditionally, the question specifies \"red, yellow, and blue,\" which aligns with the RYB primary colors.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Primary.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll look up quickly what red, yellow, and blue are called in color theory.\n\nYes, in the RYB color model, red, yellow, and blue are the primary colors.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. Primary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
