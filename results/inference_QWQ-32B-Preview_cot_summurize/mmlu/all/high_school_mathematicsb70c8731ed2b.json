                    "text": "So I have this algebra problem here. I need to rewrite the expression \\( 6j^2 - 4j + 12 \\) in the form \\( c(j + p)^2 + q \\), where \\( c \\), \\( p \\), and \\( q \\) are constants. Then, I have to find the ratio \\( \\frac{q}{p} \\). The options are 3, -34, -38, and 11.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. The expression is a quadratic in terms of \\( j \\), and I need to rewrite it in what looks like vertex form, which is \\( c(j + p)^2 + q \\). The vertex form is usually helpful for identifying the vertex of a parabola, but here, it's just about rewriting the expression in that specific format.\n\nSo, starting with the given expression:\n\n\\[ 6j^2 - 4j + 12 \\]\n\nI need to manipulate this into the form:\n\n\\[ c(j + p)^2 + q \\]\n\nI think the process involves completing the square. Completing the square is a method I've used before to rewrite quadratics in vertex form. Let me recall the steps for completing the square.\n\nFirst, I should factor out the coefficient of \\( j^2 \\) from the first two terms, if it's not already 1. In this case, the coefficient of \\( j^2 \\) is 6, so I'll factor that out from the first two terms:\n\n\\[ 6(j^2 - \\frac{4}{6}j) + 12 \\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\n\\[ 6(j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j) + 12 \\]\n\nNow, to complete the square inside the parentheses, I need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\( j \\). The coefficient of \\( j \\) inside the parentheses is \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\), so half of that is \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\), and its square is \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\).\n\nSo, I add and subtract \\( \\frac{1}{9} \\) inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 6(j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{9}) + 12 \\]\n\nNow, group the perfect square trinomial and the remaining term:\n\n\\[ 6[(j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9}) - \\frac{1}{9}] + 12 \\]\n\nThe trinomial \\( j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9} \\) is a perfect square and can be written as \\( (j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 \\). So, I have:\n\n\\[ 6[(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 - \\frac{1}{9}] + 12 \\]\n\nNow, distribute the 6 through the terms inside the brackets:\n\n\\[ 6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 - 6 \\times \\frac{1}{9} + 12 \\]\n\nCalculate \\( -6 \\times \\frac{1}{9} \\):\n\n\\[ -6 \\times \\frac{1}{9} = -\\frac{6}{9} = -\\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ 6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 - \\frac{2}{3} + 12 \\]\n\nNow, combine the constant terms \\( -\\frac{2}{3} \\) and 12. To do this, it's helpful to express 12 as a fraction with a denominator of 3:\n\n\\[ 12 = \\frac{36}{3} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ -\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{36}{3} = \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nTherefore, the expression is now:\n\n\\[ 6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nWait a minute, the form I'm aiming for is \\( c(j + p)^2 + q \\). In this case, I have \\( 6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + \\frac{34}{3} \\). The issue is that the sign in the parentheses is negative, but the standard vertex form has a plus sign. No big deal; I can adjust for that.\n\nRecall that \\( j - \\frac{1}{3} \\) is the same as \\( j + (-\\frac{1}{3}) \\). So, in this form, \\( p = -\\frac{1}{3} \\), \\( c = 6 \\), and \\( q = \\frac{34}{3} \\).\n\nBut let's double-check if this is correct. Let me expand this back to make sure it matches the original expression.\n\nStarting with:\n\n\\[ 6(j - \\frac{1}{3})^2 + \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nExpand the square:\n\n\\[ 6(j^2 - \\frac{2}{3}j + \\frac{1}{9}) + \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nDistribute the 6:\n\n\\[ 6j^2 - 4j + \\frac{6}{9} + \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nSimplify \\( \\frac{6}{9} \\) to \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ 6j^2 - 4j + \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{34}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[ 6j^2 - 4j + 12 \\]\n\nWhich matches the original expression. Great, so my completion of the square was correct.\n\nNow, according to this, \\( c = 6 \\), \\( p = -\\frac{1}{3} \\), and \\( q = \\frac{34}{3} \\).\n\nThe question asks for \\( \\frac{q}{p} \\). Plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\frac{q}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{34}{3}}{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\]\n\nDividing fractions: multiplying by the reciprocal:\n\n\\[ \\frac{34}{3} \\times -3 = -34 \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{q}{p} = -34 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options, -34 is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to directly match coefficients. Starting with the general form:\n\n\\[ c(j + p)^2 + q = c(j^2 + 2pj + p^2) + q = cj^2 + 2cpj + cp^2 + q \\]\n\nThis should equal the original expression:\n\n\\[ 6j^2 - 4j + 12 \\]\n\nSo, by comparing coefficients:\n\n1. \\( c = 6 \\) (from \\( j^2 \\) term)\n\n2. \\( 2cp = -4 \\) (from \\( j \\) term)\n\n3. \\( cp^2 + q = 12 \\) (constant term)\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\[ c = 6 \\]\n\nPlug into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 2(6)p = -4 \\]\n\n\\[ 12p = -4 \\]\n\n\\[ p = -\\frac{4}{12} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nNow, plug \\( c = 6 \\) and \\( p = -\\frac{1}{3} \\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[ 6\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 + q = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ 6\\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) + q = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{6}{9} + q = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{2}{3} + q = 12 \\]\n\n\\[ q = 12 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{34}{3} \\]\n\nSo, again, \\( p = -\\frac{1}{3} \\) and \\( q = \\frac{34}{3} \\), thus \\( \\frac{q}{p} = -34 \\).\n\nThis confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the answer should be B. -34.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a different form that might yield a different ratio. For example, if I were to factor out a negative sign or something like that, but in this case, since \\( c \\) is positive and we're dealing with a standard quadratic, it's unlikely.\n\nMoreover, the problem specifies the form \\( c(j + p)^2 + q \\), and I've followed that precisely. There doesn't seem to be any ambiguity in the interpretation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is B. -34.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-34} \\]"
