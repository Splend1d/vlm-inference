                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Cicero and what he thought was expedient. The options are A. just, B. generous, C. kind, and D. all of the above. I need to figure out which one is correct based on what Cicero believed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Cicero is. Marcus Tullius Cicero was a Roman philosopher, statesman, lawyer, orator, and politician who lived from 106 BC to 43 BC. He is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and is famous for his philosophical and political writings.\n\nNow, the question is about what Cicero considered expedient. \"Expedient\" means something that is practical or advantageous, especially in achieving a particular goal. So, I need to think about what Cicero thought was practical or advantageous for individuals or society.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A is \"just.\" Justice was a central theme in Cicero's philosophy. He was heavily influenced by Stoicism and believed in natural law, which holds that there are universal moral principles that should guide human behavior. Justice, in this context, would be acting in accordance with these natural laws and moral principles. So, it makes sense that Cicero would consider being just to be expedient because it leads to a well-ordered society and personal integrity.\n\nOption B is \"generous.\" Cicero did value generosity as a virtue. In his writings, he often praised generosity and saw it as a quality of a good leader and a virtuous person. For example, in \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), he discusses the importance of generosity in building relationships and maintaining social harmony. So, being generous seems to be something Cicero would consider expedient.\n\nOption C is \"kind.\" Kindness is another virtue that Cicero appreciated. In his philosophical works, he emphasizes the importance of compassion and kindness towards others. He believed that treating others with kindness not only improves their lives but also contributes to one's own happiness and the overall well-being of society. Therefore, being kind aligns with his views on what is expedient.\n\nOption D is \"all of the above.\" Given that Cicero valued justice, generosity, and kindness as virtues that contribute to individual and societal well-being, it seems that all these qualities would be considered expedient by him.\n\nBut let's double-check this. Maybe there's a specific text where Cicero discusses these qualities in terms of expediency.\n\nIn \"De Officiis,\" Cicero outlines the duties and virtues that guide moral behavior. He argues that virtues like justice, generosity, and kindness are not only morally right but also practically advantageous. For instance, he writes about the importance of justice in maintaining social order and the benefits of generosity in fostering goodwill and alliances.\n\nAdditionally, in \"De Republica,\" Cicero discusses the ideal state and the virtues that should govern its citizens. He emphasizes that a well-ordered republic requires citizens who are just, generous, and kind.\n\nTherefore, based on Cicero's philosophical works, it appears that he considered all these qualities\u2014justice, generosity, and kindness\u2014to be expedient.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
