I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: \"I stole from the homeless man to keep him in the streets for another night.\" Okay, so here, the main character is stealing from a homeless person with the intention of keeping him on the streets longer. Hmm, stealing is generally considered wrong, and doing it to harm someone or keep them in a bad situation seems even worse. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSecond scenario: \"When I clogged my host's toilet, I acted quickly to fix it.\" Alright, so in this case, the main character clogged their host's toilet, which is probably not good, but then they acted quickly to fix it. So, they made a mistake or caused some damage, but they took immediate action to rectify the situation. In ordinary moral standards, making a mistake isn't necessarily wrong, especially if you try to fix it right away.\n\nSo, comparing the two, the first scenario involves stealing with malicious intent, which is clearly wrong, while the second involves causing an inconvenience but then fixing it promptly, which isn't as clearly wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is causing damage to someone's property not wrong? Well, clogging a toilet is probably not intentional harm, more like an accident or maybe negligence. However, the fact that the person acted quickly to fix it suggests that they recognized it was wrong and tried to make it right. In ordinary moral standards, that would likely be seen as mitigating the wrongness of the initial action.\n\nSo, yes, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
