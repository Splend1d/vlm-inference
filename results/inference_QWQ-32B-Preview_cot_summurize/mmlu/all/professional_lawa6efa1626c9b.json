                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this law problem. It's about a company called Daylight Corp that makes steel cutting presses, specifically for cutting aluminum sheets into can covers. In 2002, another company, Goodboy Beverages, bought one of their deluxe models for $20,000. Then, in 2002 and 2003, Daylight heard from some customers that their cutting presses had some hazardous malfunctions. So, Daylight came up with a safety device and offered it to all their customers for $5,000, and they sent out a brochure mentioning that a few users had been injured. Goodboy got the brochure but didn't buy the safety device. Then, in 2004, one of Goodboy's workers got injured by the press.\n\nNow, at trial, Daylight is saying that if Goodboy had bought the safety device, the injury wouldn't have happened, and they're asking for a directed verdict. A directed verdict is when the judge decides the case without letting the jury decide, basically saying there's no question here, and Daylight should win.\n\nSo, the question is, should the court grant Daylight's motion or deny it? And there are four options:\n\nA. Grant Daylight's motion because Goodboy refused to buy the safety device, which is like accepting the risk.\n\nB. Deny the motion because Goodboy's negligence in not buying the safety device was less than Daylight's negligence in making an unsafe press.\n\nC. Deny the motion because a jury could think that Daylight could have foreseen that Goodboy wouldn't want to pay $5,000 for a safety device.\n\nD. Deny the motion because the press was inherently dangerous, so Daylight is strictly liable.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"assumption of risk\" means. Assumption of risk is a legal doctrine where a person knowingly takes on a risk, and if something goes wrong, they can't hold someone else liable for it. So, if Goodboy knew about the risk and didn't buy the safety device, maybe they assumed the risk.\n\nBut, in this case, Daylight sent out a brochure saying that there were some injuries and offering a safety device. So, Goodboy knew about the potential hazard and chose not to buy the safety device. Does that mean they assumed the risk?\n\nWell, assumption of risk usually requires that the user knows about the risk and voluntarily accepts it. Here, Goodboy knew about the risk because of the brochure, so maybe they did assume the risk by not buying the safety device.\n\nOption A says to grant the motion because Goodboy assumed the risk. That seems plausible.\n\nBut let's look at option B. It says to deny the motion because Goodboy's negligence was less than Daylight's. So, maybe Daylight was more negligent in making an unsafe press in the first place, so even if Goodboy was a little negligent by not buying the safety device, Daylight should still be liable.\n\nHmm, that makes sense too. Maybe the court should consider who was more at fault here.\n\nOption C says to deny the motion because a jury could find that Daylight could foresee that Goodboy wouldn't buy the safety device. So, if Daylight thought that customers might not buy the safety device, maybe they should have included it for free or made it standard.\n\nThat's an interesting point. Maybe Daylight should have anticipated that not everyone would spend an extra $5,000 on a safety device, especially if the risk was significant.\n\nOption D says to deny the motion because the press was inherently dangerous, so Daylight is strictly liable. Strict liability means that even if Daylight was careful in making the press, they're still responsible for any injuries because the product is inherently dangerous.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one is the most appropriate.\n\nFirst, considering assumption of risk: Goodboy knew about the risk and chose not to buy the safety device. But was the injury directly caused by Goodboy's decision not to buy the safety device?\n\nDaylight is arguing that if Goodboy had bought the safety device, the injury wouldn't have occurred. So, maybe the safety device was necessary to make the press safe to use.\n\nBut, was the press safe to use without the safety device? If it was inherently dangerous, then maybe Daylight should still be liable.\n\nAlso, offering the safety device for an extra $5,000 might suggest that the original press wasn't safe enough on its own.\n\nMoreover, Goodboy might have relied on Daylight to provide a safe product, and if Daylight knew about the hazards, they should have either fixed the press or included the safety device at no extra cost.\n\nLet me consider strict liability. In products liability, strict liability means that the manufacturer is liable for defects in the product, even if they were careful in making it, because the product is defective.\n\nIn this case, if the cutting press is defective because it's hazardous, then Daylight could be strictly liable.\n\nBut, if Goodboy assumed the risk by not buying the safety device, maybe they can't hold Daylight liable.\n\nHowever, assumption of risk usually applies when the user knows about the risk and voluntarily accepts it, and proceeds to use the product anyway.\n\nIn this case, Goodboy did know about the risk but didn't buy the safety device, so they continued to use the press without the additional safety measure.\n\nBut, was the press still unreasonably dangerous even with the safety device? Or was the safety device just an additional precaution?\n\nIf the safety device was necessary to make the press safe, then perhaps Daylight should have made it standard.\n\nAlso, charging $5,000 for the safety device is quite a lot. Maybe Goodboy thought it was too expensive, especially if they had already paid $20,000 for the press.\n\nPerhaps a jury could find that Daylight should have borne the cost of the safety device, as it was necessary to make the press safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Daylight should have recalled the presses and fixed them for free.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D is the best: deny the motion because the press was inherently dangerous, and Daylight is strictly liable.\n\nBut, I need to consider all options.\n\nOption A: Grant the motion based on assumption of risk.\n\nOption B: Deny the motion because Goodboy's negligence was less than Daylight's.\n\nOption C: Deny the motion because Daylight could have foreseen that Goodboy wouldn't buy the safety device.\n\nOption D: Deny the motion because of strict liability.\n\nI think option D is strong, but let's think about assumption of risk again.\n\nAssumption of risk might apply if Goodboy knew about the risk and voluntarily accepted it.\n\nBut, in products liability, manufacturers have a duty to provide safe products, and if the product is defective, they can be liable even if the user knew about the risk.\n\nSo, perhaps assumption of risk isn't a complete defense in products liability cases.\n\nMoreover, in some jurisdictions, assumption of risk is an affirmative defense, meaning that Daylight has to prove that Goodboy assumed the risk.\n\nBut, in this case, Daylight is moving for a directed verdict, which suggests that they think as a matter of law, Goodboy assumed the risk.\n\nHowever, perhaps it's for the jury to decide whether Goodboy assumed the risk.\n\nAlso, perhaps the fact that Goodboy didn't buy the safety device is just one factor in determining liability.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court should consider that Daylight had knowledge of the hazards and still sold the press without including the safety device.\n\nFurthermore, by offering the safety device separately, perhaps Daylight was trying to shift the burden onto the customers.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps the brochure that Daylight sent out could be seen as an admission that the press had defects.\n\nGiven all that, I think option D is the most appropriate: deny the motion because the press was inherently dangerous, and Daylight is strictly liable.\n\nThis approach focuses on the fact that the product itself was defective and dangerous, and the manufacturer should be held responsible for any injuries that result from those defects.\n\nTherefore, the court should deny Daylight's motion for a directed verdict.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Deny the motion, because since the press was inherently dangerous, Daylight was strictly liable."
