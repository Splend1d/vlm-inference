                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a researcher studying problem-solving skills in people of different ages. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThe researcher is testing problem-solving skills of twenty 10-year-olds, twenty 20-year-olds, and twenty 30-year-olds. The question is about the research method being used here. The options are:\n\nA. longitudinal\n\nB. stage\n\nC. developmental\n\nD. cross-sectional\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of research methods.\n\nStarting with longitudinal: This type of study observes the same variables over a long period, often involving the same subjects repeatedly over time. So, if the researcher was tracking the same group of people as they age, say testing them at age 10, then again at 20, and again at 30, that would be longitudinal.\n\nNext, stage: I'm not entirely sure what this refers to in research methods. It might be a less common term or perhaps it's a typo or mislabeling. I'll keep it in mind but I think it might not be the primary answer here.\n\nDevelopmental: This seems broad. Developmental research generally looks at how people change or grow over time, which could involve both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. So, it might be a category that includes other methods.\n\nLastly, cross-sectional: This type of study looks at different age groups at one point in time. So, comparing 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, and 30-year-olds all at the same time, without following them over years.\n\nGiven the description in the question, the researcher is testing these different age groups once, not following them over time. So, that sounds like a cross-sectional study.\n\nBut let's think about whether developmental could also be an answer. Developmental research often examines changes across the lifespan, and this study is looking at different age groups, which relates to development. However, \"developmental\" is more of a broad field of study rather than a specific research method. So, while it's related, it might not be the most precise answer for the method being used.\n\nLongitudinal is clearly not the right answer because there's no mention of tracking the same individuals over time.\n\nAs for \"stage,\" I'm not sure what that refers to in this context. Maybe it's a mislabeling or an option that doesn't directly apply here.\n\nSo, between the given options, cross-sectional seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other aspect to this study that might make another option more suitable.\n\nThe study is comparing different age groups at one point in time to see if there are differences in problem-solving skills. This is a classic cross-sectional design, which allows researchers to examine age differences without the need to wait years to follow participants over time.\n\nLongitudinal studies, on the other hand, would involve the same participants being tested multiple times as they age, which isn't the case here.\n\nDevelopmental research can use both methods, but the specific method used in this study is cross-sectional.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. cross-sectional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
