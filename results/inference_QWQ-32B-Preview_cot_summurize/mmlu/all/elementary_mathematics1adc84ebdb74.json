I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I look for parentheses. There's one: (12 \u2022 4). So, I'll calculate that first.\n\n12 \u2022 4 = 48\n\nNow, the expression becomes 5 + 2 \u2022 15 + 48.\n\nNext, I look for exponents, but there are none in this expression.\n\nThen, multiplication and division from left to right. The first multiplication is 2 \u2022 15.\n\n2 \u2022 15 = 30\n\nNow, the expression is 5 + 30 + 48.\n\nThere are no more multiplications or divisions, so I can proceed to addition.\n\n5 + 30 = 35\n\nThen, 35 + 48 = 83\n\nSo, the value of the expression is 83.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me write it down again: 5 + 2 \u2022 15 + (12 \u2022 4)\n\nFirst, (12 \u2022 4) = 48\n\nNow, 5 + 2 \u2022 15 + 48\n\nNext, 2 \u2022 15 = 30\n\nThen, 5 + 30 + 48\n\nFinally, 5 + 30 = 35, and 35 + 48 = 83\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Sometimes, expressions can be ambiguous depending on how they're written. For example, if the\u2022 symbol is not clearly indicating multiplication, but in this case, it's probably meant to be multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an implied multiplication, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother thing to consider is if there are any implicit parentheses or if the expression should be grouped differently, but based on the way it's written, I think I've interpreted it correctly.\n\nSo, the answer should be 83, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
