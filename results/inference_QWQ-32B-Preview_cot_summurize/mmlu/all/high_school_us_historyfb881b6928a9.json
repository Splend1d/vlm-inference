We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nWhich one of the following political movements most closely shared many of the goals outlined by the Populist Party?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the Populist Party Platform from 1892, and I need to figure out which political movement most closely shared many of their goals. The options are Progressivism of the early 1900s, Neoconservatism of the 1980s, Federalism of the late 1700s, and Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Populist Party was all about. From the platform, it seems like they were upset about corruption in politics, influenced by big money and corporations. They mentioned \"plundered people,\" \"capitals, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock,\" and so on. So, they were advocating for the common people against these powerful interests.\n\nThey also mention wanting to restore the government to the hands of \"the plain people\" and align themselves with the Constitution's goals, like promoting general welfare and securing liberty.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Progressivism of the early 1900s: Progressives were also concerned about corruption in government and the influence of big business. They pushed for reforms to make government more responsive to citizens and to regulate businesses that were exploiting workers and consumers. So, this seems pretty similar to the Populists' concerns.\n\nB. Neoconservatism of the 1980s: Neoconservatives were more focused on expanding military power, supporting free markets, and being interventionist in foreign policy. That doesn't seem to align with the Populists' concerns about corporate influence and helping the common people.\n\nC. Federalism of the late 1700s: Federalism was about the balance of power between the federal government and the states. While the Populists did talk about government reform, their main focus was on economic issues and corruption, not specifically on federal versus state powers.\n\nD. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s: Jacksonian Democracy was about expanding suffrage to all white men, regardless of property ownership, and was against elite rule. They were also critical of banks and supported states' rights. Some of this overlaps with the Populists' desire to empower ordinary people, but the Populists were more focused on economic reforms related to agriculture and corporate influence.\n\nComparing all these, Progressivism seems to share the most goals with the Populist Party. Both were concerned about corruption, the influence of big business, and wanted to implement reforms to help the average person.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Progressivism of the early 1900s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
