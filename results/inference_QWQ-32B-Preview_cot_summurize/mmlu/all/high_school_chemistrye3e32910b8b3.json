                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a strip of magnesium metal being oxidized by a solution of chromium(III) nitrate. We need to find the net ionic equation that represents a possible reaction happening in this scenario.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's going on here. When magnesium metal reacts with chromium(III) nitrate, it's a redox reaction where magnesium is being oxidized and chromium is being reduced.\n\nMagnesium is a\u6d3b\u6cfc\u91d1\u5c5e, and it tends to lose electrons easily, forming Mg2+ ions. Chromium(III) nitrate is an aqueous solution containing Cr3+ ions and nitrate ions (NO3-). In this reaction, the Cr3+ ions will gain electrons from magnesium, getting reduced to chromium metal.\n\nSo, the overall reaction should show magnesium metal turning into Mg2+ ions, and Cr3+ ions turning into chromium metal.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Mg(s) + Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 Mg2+(aq) + Cr3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)\n\nThis equation shows magnesium reacting with chromium(III) nitrate, but both magnesium and chromium remain in their original oxidation states. Magnesium is still Mg(s) on the left and Mg2+ on the right, which is correct, but chromium is Cr3+ on both sides. This doesn't show the reduction of chromium, so this can't be right.\n\nB. 3Mg(s) + 2Cr3+ \u2192 3Mg2+ + 2Cr(s)\n\nThis equation shows three magnesium atoms reacting with two Cr3+ ions to produce three Mg2+ ions and two chromium atoms. This makes sense because magnesium is being oxidized from 0 to +2, and chromium is being reduced from +3 to 0. The coefficients balance the electrons transferred: each magnesium loses 2 electrons, and each chromium gains 3 electrons, so the least common multiple is 6 electrons, requiring 3 magnesium atoms and 2 chromium ions.\n\nC. Mg(s) + Cr3+ \u2192 Mg2+ + Cr(s)\n\nThis equation shows one magnesium atom reacting with one Cr3+ ion to produce one Mg2+ ion and one chromium atom. The problem here is that the electrons transferred aren't balanced. Magnesium loses 2 electrons, and chromium gains 3 electrons. These need to be balanced for the reaction to occur, which is why option B has coefficients to balance the electrons.\n\nD. 3Mg(s) + 2Cr(NO3)3(aq) \u2192 3Mg2+(aq) + 2Cr(s) + NO3-(aq)\n\nThis equation is similar to option B but includes the nitrate ions. However, in a net ionic equation, spectator ions like nitrate should be omitted because they don't participate in the actual reaction. So, including NO3- in the net ionic equation isn't correct.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems to be the correct net ionic equation because it shows the balanced transfer of electrons between magnesium and chromium ions without including spectator ions.\n\nWait a minute, but option D also shows the same reaction but includes nitrate ions. Why is that wrong?\n\nWell, in net ionic equations, we only include the species that are directly involved in the chemical reaction. Spectator ions, like nitrate in this case, are present in the solution but do not participate in the reaction. Therefore, they should not be included in the net ionic equation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't show the reduction of chromium.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it doesn't balance the electrons transferred.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it includes spectator ions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nMagnesium is being oxidized from 0 to +2:\n\nMg(s) \u2192 Mg2+ + 2e-\n\nChromium is being reduced from +3 to 0:\n\nCr3+ + 3e- \u2192 Cr(s)\n\nTo balance the electrons, we need to equalize the number of electrons lost and gained. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. So, we need:\n\n3 Mg(s) \u2192 3 Mg2+ + 6 e-\n\n2 Cr3+ + 6 e- \u2192 2 Cr(s)\n\nCombining these, we get:\n\n3 Mg(s) + 2 Cr3+ \u2192 3 Mg2+ + 2 Cr(s)\n\nWhich matches option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
