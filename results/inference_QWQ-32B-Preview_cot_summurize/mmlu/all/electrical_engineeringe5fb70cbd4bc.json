Set, Reset, Halt\n\nHmm, I need to think about what a three-state buffer is and what states it can have.\n\nFirst off, I know that in digital electronics, buffers are used to strengthen signals or to provide isolation between different parts of a circuit. A regular buffer has two states: high (1) and low (0).\n\nBut a three-state buffer, as the name suggests, has an additional state beyond just high and low. This extra state is usually called \"high impedance\" or \"float.\" In this state, the buffer neither drives the output high nor low; instead, it essentially removes itself from the circuit, allowing other devices to control the output.\n\nSo, considering that, option A says \"1, 0, float.\" That makes sense because it includes the two standard digital states plus the high impedance state.\n\nOption B says \"High, Low, Float.\" This seems similar to option A, but instead of using \"1\" and \"0,\" it uses \"High\" and \"Low,\" which are synonymous in digital logic. So, this also seems correct.\n\nOption C says \"Both A and B.\" If both A and B are correct, then maybe C is the answer.\n\nOption D says \"Set, Reset, Halt.\" I'm not familiar with these terms in the context of buffer states. \"Set\" and \"Reset\" are often used in flip-flops to denote their stable states, but for a buffer, I don't think \"Halt\" is a standard state.\n\nGiven that, I think C is the correct answer because both A and B are essentially describing the same states, just with different terminology. \"1\" and \"High\" are the same, as are \"0\" and \"Low,\" and \"float\" is the high impedance state.\n\nBut let me double-check. In digital electronics, \"1\" and \"High\" are interchangeable, as are \"0\" and \"Low.\" So, options A and B are just using different terms for the same concepts. Therefore, \"Both A and B\" would be the correct choice.\n\nI don't think D is correct because \"Set\" and \"Reset\" don't directly correspond to buffer states, and \"Halt\" isn't a standard state for buffers.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
