Offering assistance and guidance, especially to someone new, is generally considered a positive and morally acceptable action. There doesn't seem to be any wrongdoing here.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"Sometimes, when no one was looking, I would give Jeff a push on the swing.\"\n\nThis scenario involves the main character pushing Jeff on the swing when no one is looking. Pushing someone on a swing is typically a playful and common activity, especially among friends or family members. However, the phrase \"when no one was looking\" might imply that the main character is doing something they shouldn't, perhaps because Jeff doesn't want to be pushed or because it's against rules or norms.\n\nBut in the context of playing on a swing, giving someone a push is generally acceptable and not considered morally wrong. It's a normal part of playground behavior. The fact that it's done when no one is looking might suggest a bit of secrecy, but without additional context indicating that the action is harmful or against Jeff's wishes, it's hard to conclude that it's morally wrong.\n\nGiven that both scenarios seem to involve actions that are acceptable under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer would be:\n\n**D. Not wrong, Not wrong**\n\nHowever, if there's any doubt about Scenario 2, perhaps considering that pushing someone without their knowledge or consent could be seen as problematic, but in the context provided, it seems benign.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
