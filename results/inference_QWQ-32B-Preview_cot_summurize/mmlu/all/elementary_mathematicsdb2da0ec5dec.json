                    "text": "So I have this problem here: estimate 711 plus 497, and I need to figure out between which numbers the sum lies. The options are:\n\nA. 50 and 400\n\nB. 450 and 700\n\nC. 750 and 1,000\n\nD. 1,050 and 1,300\n\nAlright, first thing I notice is that 711 and 497 are both pretty big numbers, so adding them up should give me something even bigger. Let me think about how to estimate this quickly without doing exact calculations, because this seems like it's testing my estimation skills.\n\nSo, 711 is close to 700, and 497 is close to 500. If I add 700 and 500, that's 1,200. But wait, 711 is 11 more than 700, and 497 is 3 less than 500. So, the actual sum should be 1,200 plus 11 minus 3, which is 1,208. But this is an estimation, so maybe I don't need to be that precise.\n\nLooking at the options, 1,208 would fall into option D, which is between 1,050 and 1,300. But let me double-check if my estimation is accurate enough.\n\nAnother way to estimate is to round each number to the nearest hundred. 711 rounds to 700, and 497 rounds to 500, so again, 700 + 500 = 1,200.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the actual addition: 711 + 497.\n\nLet's add them directly:\n\n711\n\n+497\n\n---\n\nLet's add the units: 1 + 7 = 8\n\nThen the tens: 10 (from 1 in 711) + 90 (from 9 in 497) = 100, so that's 0 and carry over 1\n\nThen the hundreds: 700 + 400 = 1,100, plus the carried over 100 makes 1,200\n\nSo, total is 1,208.\n\nOkay, so my estimation was pretty close. Now, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 50 and 400 - way too low\n\nB. 450 and 700 - still too low\n\nC. 750 and 1,000 - 1,208 is above 1,000\n\nD. 1,050 and 1,300 - yes, 1,208 falls within this range\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if there's any other way to look at this. Maybe if I consider the lower and upper bounds of each number.\n\n711 could be between 700 and 720, and 497 is between 490 and 500.\n\nAdding the lowest possible: 700 + 490 = 1,190\n\nAdding the highest possible: 720 + 500 = 1,220\n\nSo, the sum should be between 1,190 and 1,220, which still falls within option D.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider rounding to the nearest ten:\n\n711 rounds to 710\n\n497 rounds to 500\n\n710 + 500 = 1,210\n\nAgain, close to 1,208.\n\nSo, no matter how I estimate it, it seems like the sum is around 1,208, which is definitely within the range of 1,050 to 1,300.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
