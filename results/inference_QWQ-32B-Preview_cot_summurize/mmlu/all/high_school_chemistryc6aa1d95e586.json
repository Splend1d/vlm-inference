                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about half-lives. I need to figure out what's left of an isotope after three half-lives have passed. The options are a bit confusing because they mix percentages of what's left and what has decayed. I'll have to be careful.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a half-life is. The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the isotope to decay. So, after one half-life, half of the original amount is left. After two half-lives, half of that remaining half decays, and so on.\n\nLet's say I start with 100% of the isotope. After one half-life, it's 50%. After two half-lives, it's 25%. After three half-lives, it should be 12.5%. So, that means 12.5% of the isotope is left after three half-lives.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 25% of the isotope is left.\n\nB. 25% of the isotope decayed.\n\nC. 12.5% of the isotope is left.\n\nD. 12.5% of the isotope decayed.\n\nOption C seems to match what I just calculated. But I should double-check because the other options are tempting.\n\nWait a minute, option D says 12.5% decayed. If 12.5% is left, then 87.5% has decayed, right? Because 100% - 12.5% = 87.5%. So, option D is not correct.\n\nOption A says 25% is left, but that's after two half-lives, not three. So, that's incorrect.\n\nOption B says 25% decayed. If 25% has decayed, that would mean 75% is left, which doesn't match any of the stages of half-lives I can think of.\n\nSo, it seems like option C is the correct one: 12.5% of the isotope is left after three half-lives.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about this step by step.\n\nStart: 100%\n\nAfter 1st half-life: 50% left.\n\nAfter 2nd half-life: 50% of 50% = 25% left.\n\nAfter 3rd half-life: 50% of 25% = 12.5% left.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but the question says \"three half-lives after an isotope is prepared.\" Is there any trick here about when the timing starts or anything? I don't think so. It seems straightforward.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is C. 12.5% of the isotope is left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
