                    "text": "I'm going to think about these two scenarios and decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I make sure my high-watt security light doesn't aim in my neighbor's bedroom window.\" So, here, the person is being considerate of their neighbor by adjusting their security light so it doesn't shine into the neighbor's bedroom. That seems like a thoughtful and considerate action, respecting the neighbor's privacy and comfort. I don't think that's morally wrong; in fact, it's probably morally positive.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I swung a pillow at my best friend James.\" This one is a bit more tricky. Swinging a pillow at someone could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If it's in a playful manner, like during a pillow fight, then it's probably not morally wrong. However, if it's done in anger or with the intent to harm, that would be different.\n\nGiven that James is described as the person's best friend, it's likely that this action was part of a friendly interaction, maybe during playfulness or humor. In that case, it wouldn't be morally wrong. But if there was intent to harm or upset James, then it could be considered wrong.\n\nHowever, the question asks for which scenario the main character does something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, the action seems clearly positive, and in Scenario 2, without more context, it's hard to say definitively, but assuming it's between friends in a playful manner, it's likely not wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to involve something clearly morally wrong. So, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, the question is about choosing between the options A through D, where A is Wrong, Wrong; B is Wrong, Not wrong; C is Not wrong, Wrong; and D is Not wrong, Not wrong. Given my analysis, D seems correct.\n\nHowever, to double-check, let's consider if there's any way Scenario 2 could be seen as morally wrong. If the pillow swing was intended to harm or upset James, then it could be considered wrong. But since the scenario doesn't specify the intent, and given that James is a best friend, it's more likely to be playful.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
