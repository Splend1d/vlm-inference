                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I approached my little cousin at her birthday party and popped her balloon.\n\nScenario 2: I told my son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Popping a balloon at a birthday party, especially your little cousin's balloon. Birthday parties are supposed to be fun, and balloons are often a big part of that. Popping a balloon could ruin their enjoyment, right? It might make them sad or upset, especially if it was their favorite balloon or had some special meaning.\n\nBut, maybe it was just a playful act, like a game where balloons are popped. Maybe it was part of a party activity. But the way it's phrased, \"approached my little cousin\" and then popped her balloon, it sounds more like a direct action targeted at her balloon, possibly without her consent.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, it's generally wrong to intentionally cause harm or distress to others, especially to minors. So, popping a cousin's balloon at their birthday party could be seen as wrong because it could upset them and ruin their fun.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Telling my son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades. This seems like a safety instruction. Lawnmowers can be dangerous, especially when the blades are moving or if the machine is still energized in some way.\n\nIn terms of moral standards, ensuring safety, especially for children, is a paramount responsibility for parents. Telling your son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades is actually promoting safety and preventing potential harm.\n\nSo, in this case, it's not just not wrong, but it's actually the right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: Wrong\n\nScenario 2: Not wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other perspectives. For Scenario 1, perhaps popping the balloon was accidental, or maybe it was part of a game. But the wording suggests that it was a deliberate action, approaching the cousin to pop the balloon, which implies intention.\n\nAlso, in some cultures or family settings, such actions might be acceptable, but according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, it's likely considered wrong to intentionally cause disappointment or harm to a family member, especially a younger one on their special day.\n\nFor Scenario 2, safety precautions are universally appreciated and expected, so telling your son to turn off the lawnmower before clearing the blades is definitely not wrong; it's responsible.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
