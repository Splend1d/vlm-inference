                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about work-related accidents. It's asking which statement is true about persons who have work-related accidents compared to accident-free workers. The options are:\n\nA. They feel more dissatisfied with their work.\n\nB. They are less likely to have had job promotions.\n\nC. They have had more recent life stress.\n\nD. They are, on average, less intelligent.\n\nI need to think carefully about this because some of these options might seem plausible at first glance, but maybe they're not entirely accurate.\n\nStarting with option A: Do workers who have accidents feel more dissatisfied with their work? Well, it's possible that dissatisfaction could lead to carelessness, which in turn could cause accidents. But maybe not all workers who have accidents are dissatisfied. Some accidents might just be mistakes or due to other factors. So, I'm not sure about this one.\n\nOption B: Are they less likely to have had job promotions? Hmm, maybe. If someone is less experienced or less skilled, they might be more prone to accidents and also less likely to get promotions. But again, this isn't necessarily always the case. Some accidents can happen to anyone, regardless of their position or experience.\n\nOption C: Have they had more recent life stress? Stress can certainly affect a worker's performance and attention, which could lead to accidents. So, this seems like a plausible option. When people are stressed, they might not be as focused on their work, increasing the risk of accidents.\n\nOption D: Are they, on average, less intelligent? This seems like a questionable statement. Intelligence isn't directly related to the likelihood of having a work-related accident. Accidents can happen to anyone, regardless of intelligence level. Maybe less intelligent workers might make more mistakes, but intelligence isn't the only factor determining accident-proneness. Factors like training, experience, and attention also play significant roles.\n\nConsidering all these options, option C seems the most reasonable. Stress can impair a worker's ability to concentrate and make sound decisions, which could lead to accidents. Also, there's research that suggests a link between stress and accident rates in the workplace.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options could also be true to some extent. For example, dissatisfaction with work (option A) could lead to accidents if it causes employees to be less careful or less engaged in their work. Similarly, lack of promotions (option B) might indicate lower skills or less experience, which could correlate with a higher accident rate. However, these relationships aren't as direct as the one between stress and accidents.\n\nOption D, about intelligence, seems like the least likely option. Intelligence doesn't necessarily correlate with accident-proneness, as accidents can be caused by a variety of factors, many of which are unrelated to intelligence.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: persons who have work-related accidents tend to have had more recent life stress than accident-free workers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
