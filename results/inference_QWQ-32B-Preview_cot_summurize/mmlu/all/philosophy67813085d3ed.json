                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about Gauthier's response to the claim that deliberative justification is incomplete. So, I need to recall what Gauthier says about this.\n\nFirst off, what is deliberative justification? It's a concept in moral and political philosophy that refers to the process of justifying norms or rules through rational deliberation among individuals. It's about reaching agreements based on mutual advantage or some other rational basis.\n\nNow, someone is claiming that this deliberative justification is incomplete. Maybe they think it doesn't consider all aspects or perhaps it's not sufficient on its own. Gauthier is responding to this claim, and I need to figure out which option best captures his response.\n\nOption A says that Gauthier expands the definition of deliberative justification. That could mean he includes more elements or broadens what counts as deliberative justification to address the incompleteness.\n\nOption B is that Gauthier argues that deliberative justification, by definition, takes account of all relevant considerations. So, according to him, it's already complete, and the claim of incompleteness is misplaced.\n\nOption C is that Gauthier claims that deliberative justification works. This is somewhat similar to option B, but it's more about effectiveness rather than comprehensiveness.\n\nOption D is that Gauthier argues that all theories of justification are equally incomplete. This seems like a different approach, suggesting that the problem isn't unique to deliberative justification.\n\nI need to think about which of these best represents Gauthier's view.\n\nI remember that Gauthier is known for his work on contractualism and justifying moral constraints through rational agreement. In his book \"Morals by Agreement,\" he discusses how rational individuals would agree to certain moral rules for mutual benefit.\n\nIf someone is saying that deliberative justification is incomplete, Gauthier might respond by either defending it as complete (option B), suggesting it works despite incompleteness (option C), expanding its definition to make it complete (option A), or taking a more general stance that all justification theories are incomplete (option D).\n\nGiven what I know about Gauthier's philosophy, he is likely to defend deliberative justification strongly. So, options B or C seem plausible.\n\nOption B says he argues that deliberative justification, by definition, takes account of all relevant considerations. This sounds like he's claiming that the process is comprehensive and nothing is left out that should be considered.\n\nOption C says he claims that deliberative justification works. This is a bit more vague. It could mean that even if it's not perfect, it's effective or satisfactory for practical purposes.\n\nI think Gauthier would probably go for something like option B, asserting that deliberative justification is, by its nature, thorough and comprehensive. He might argue that the process of deliberation inherently involves considering all relevant factors because rational agents would bring up and consider any pertinent points during the deliberation.\n\nAlternatively, he might take option A and expand the definition to include more elements, thereby addressing whatever is\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a missing in the original conception of deliberative justification.\n\nOption D seems less likely because it's a more relativistic stance, suggesting that no theory of justification is complete, which might not align with Gauthier's attempt to provide a robust justification for moral rules.\n\nBetween options A and B, I'm leaning towards B. Gauthier seems more likely to assert that deliberative justification already encompasses all necessary considerations rather than expanding its definition.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the context in which this claim is made. If the criticism is that deliberative justification doesn't account for certain emotions or intuitions, Gauthier might argue that, by definition, it considers all rational relevant considerations, even if it doesn't incorporate every possible human feeling.\n\nAlternatively, he might expand the definition to include emotional considerations, thus making it more complete. But that seems more in line with option A.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps Gauthier would argue that deliberative justification is complete insofar as it considers all rational relevant considerations, even if it doesn't capture every aspect of human experience. So, he might accept some level of incompleteness if it's outside the realm of rational deliberation.\n\nBut that might not directly correspond to any of the options.\n\nLooking back, option B says \"deliberative justification by definition takes account of all relevant considerations.\" This seems close to what I just said, but it doesn't specify that it's all rational relevant considerations. Maybe \"relevant\" is meant to imply \"rational.\"\n\nOption A suggests expanding the definition, which might be a response to the claim of incompleteness by incorporating more elements into deliberative justification.\n\nOption C, claiming that it works, might be a practical response, acknowledging incompleteness but downplaying its significance.\n\nOption D is a more general claim about all theories of justification being incomplete, which might be a way to deflect the criticism by saying that deliberative justification isn't uniquely incomplete.\n\nConsidering Gauthier's philosophical approach, I think he would most likely take option B: arguing that deliberative justification, by its definition, already takes into account all relevant considerations. He would likely defend the process as comprehensive and adequate for justifying moral rules.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
