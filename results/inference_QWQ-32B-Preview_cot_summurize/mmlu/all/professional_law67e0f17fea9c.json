                    "text": "I've got this legal scenario to consider. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a mother who has an 11-year-old daughter. They live in a house that's owned by both the mother and her husband in joint tenancy. The mother and husband are legally separated, and she's filed for divorce. That's important because it might affect their rights in the property.\n\nOne night, the mother goes out to dinner and leaves her daughter at home, locking her own bedroom door before leaving. The daughter finds a spare key to the mother's bedroom and lets herself in. While rummaging through the mother's dresser, she finds a bag containing white powder, which she suspects might be drugs.\n\nConcerned, the daughter calls her father for advice. Her father tells her to call the police, which she does. The police come to the house, and the daughter allows them in, leading them to her mother's bedroom where she gives them the bag. The police take the bag to the station for testing, and it turns out to be cocaine. The mother is then arrested for illegal possession of a controlled dangerous substance.\n\nNow, the mother's attorney has filed a motion to prevent the cocaine from being admitted into evidence. We need to decide whether this motion should be granted or denied, and choose the best reason among the options provided.\n\nLet's consider the key issues here:\n\n1. **Authority to consent to the police entry and seizure:**\n\n   - Who has the authority to allow the police into the home and to seize the evidence?\n\n   - The mother and father own the house in joint tenancy, and the mother is legally separated but hasn't finalized the divorce yet.\n\n   - The daughter is 11 years old and is living with her mother.\n\n2. **Apparent authority:**\n\n   - Does the daughter have the apparent authority to consent to the police entry and seizure?\n\n   - Is there such a thing as \"apparent authority\" for a minor in this context?\n\n3. **Control over the premises:**\n\n   - Does the daughter have equal control over the premises, given that she lives there with her mother?\n\n   - Does the fact that the mother locked her bedroom door affect the daughter's authority to allow entry into that specific room?\n\n4. **Legal principles:**\n\n   - Generally, in criminal procedure, evidence obtained through a search and seizure must comply with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n   - One exception to the warrant requirement is when there is valid consent to search.\n\n   - The consent must be given by someone who has authority over the premises or property being searched.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Denied, because the daughter, and husband, as co-owner, had the authority to allow the police inside the home and make the seizure.\n\n- This option suggests that both the daughter and the husband had authority to consent.\n\n- However, the husband is only a co-owner; he's not necessarily living there, and they are legally separated.\n\n- The daughter is a minor, which might affect her authority to consent.\n\nB. Denied, because the daughter lived with her mother and had equal control over the premises.\n\n- This option implies that because the daughter lives with her mother, she has equal control and thus can consent.\n\n- But is this true for a 11-year-old? Does she have equal control over the entire home, including her mother's locked bedroom?\n\nC. Granted, because the daughter, as a minor, did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.\n\n- This option argues that minors don't have the authority to consent to police entry.\n\n- There might be exceptions, but generally, minors may not have the capacity to consent to searches.\n\nD. Granted, because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n\n- This option is similar to C but specifies the mother's bedroom, which was locked.\n\n- It suggests that even if the daughter had some authority over the home, she didn't have authority over her mother's locked bedroom.\n\nNow, delving deeper into the law:\n\n- In general, a person who possesses common authority over premises or effects may validly consent to a search of those premises.\n\n- Common authority depends on mutually shared control over the premises.\n\n- In United States v. Matlock, the Supreme Court held that consent to search by a third party who has common authority over the premises is valid.\n\n- However, in Illinois v. Rodriguez, the Court held that police may rely on a reasonable but mistaken belief that a person authorized to give consent actually had authority.\n\n- Regarding minors, the law is a bit nuanced.\n\n- In some cases, courts have held that a minor may have common authority over a residence, especially if they live there and have access to the areas being searched.\n\n- However, the age and maturity of the minor may be factors in determining their authority to consent.\n\n- In this case, the daughter is only 11 years old, which is quite young.\n\n- It's unlikely that an 11-year-old would have the authority to consent to a police search of her mother's bedroom, especially since the mother had locked the door.\n\n- The fact that the daughter found a spare key and entered the bedroom doesn't necessarily confer authority to consent to a police search.\n\n- Moreover, the mother had taken steps to secure her bedroom by locking the door, indicating that she intended to keep it private.\n\n- The daughter's action in entering the bedroom with a spare key might be seen as a violation of her mother's privacy, but that doesn't automatically grant her authority to consent to a police search.\n\nConsidering these points, options C and D seem more plausible because they recognize that the daughter, being a minor, may not have the authority to consent to the police entry and seizure.\n\nOption A is problematic because it attributes authority to both the daughter and the husband.\n\n- While the husband is a co-owner, the fact that they are legally separated may affect his authority to consent.\n\n- Moreover, the daughter is a minor, which complicates the issue.\n\nOption B suggests that the daughter had equal control over the premises because she lives there with her mother.\n\n- But again, her age is a significant factor. An 11-year-old likely does not have equal control over the entire home, particularly her mother's locked bedroom.\n\nOption C focuses on the daughter's status as a minor and her lack of apparent authority to permit the police to enter the home.\n\n- This seems reasonable, as minors generally do not have the legal capacity to consent to searches in the same way that adults do.\n\nOption D is similar but specifies the mother's bedroom, emphasizing that the daughter didn't have authority over that particular room.\n\n- Given that the mother locked her bedroom door, it's reasonable to infer that she did not want anyone else to enter without her permission.\n\n- Therefore, the daughter likely did not have authority to allow the police to enter that room.\n\nBetween options C and D, option D seems more precise because it takes into account the specific room in question and the mother's efforts to keep it private.\n\nHowever, option C also has merit because it highlights the daughter's age and the general lack of authority minors have to consent to police entries.\n\nBut considering that the search occurred in the mother's locked bedroom, and that the daughter may not have had authority over that specific area, option D might be the better choice.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the mother locked her bedroom door suggests that she did not share authority over that space with her daughter.\n\nTherefore, the motion to suppress the evidence should be granted because the daughter did not have apparent authority to permit the police to enter her mother's bedroom.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
