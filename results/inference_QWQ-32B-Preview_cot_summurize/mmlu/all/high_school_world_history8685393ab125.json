Internal troubles threatened to have a fatal effect on the further progress of this obstinate war. The destinies of Russia, the honor of her heroic Army, the happiness of the people, and the whole future of our beloved country demand that the war should be conducted at all costs to a victorious end.\nThe cruel enemy is making his last efforts and the moment is near when our valiant Army, in concert with our glorious Allies, will finally overthrow the enemy. In these decisive days in the life of Russia we have thought that we owed to our people the close union and organization of all its forces for the realization of a rapid victory; for which reason, in agreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that it is for the good of the country that we should abdicate the Crown of the Russian State and lay down the Supreme Power.\"\nTsar Nicholas II, Abdication, March 15, 1917\nSource 2:\n\"History will not forgive revolutionaries for procrastinating when they could be victorious today (and they certainly will be victorious today), while they risk losing much tomorrow, in fact, the risk losing everything.\nIf we seize power today, we seize it not in opposition to the Soviets but on their behalf. The seizure of power is the business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear after the seizure\u2026.\nIt would be an infinite crime on the part of the revolutionaries were they to let the chance slip, knowing that the salvation of the revolution, the offer of peace, the salvation of Petrograd, salvation from famine, the transfer of the land to the peasants depend upon them.\nThe government is tottering. It must be given the death-blow at all costs.\"\nVladimir Illyich Lenin, Call to Power, October 24, 1917\nWhat was the principal philosophical underpinning of Lenin's call to power in Source 2?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I need to figure out what the main philosophical idea behind Lenin's call to power is, based on the quote from October 24, 1917. The options are capitalism, mercantilism, fascism, or Marxism. Let's look at each one and see which one fits best with what Lenin is saying.\n\nFirst, capitalism is an economic system where private individuals or businesses own and operate the means of production and distribution of goods and services for profit. But Lenin was known for being against capitalism; he wanted to overthrow it. So, it's unlikely that capitalism is the underpinning of his call to power.\n\nNext, mercantilism is an economic theory that a nation's power depends on its wealth, especially its supply of gold and silver, and that the government should play a protective role in ensuring that the nation's balance of trade is positive. Again, this seems more related to economic policies rather than the revolutionary ideology that Lenin was promoting. So, probably not mercantilism.\n\nFascism is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which became prominent in early 20th-century Europe. Lenin was on the left politically, and fascism is on the far right, so that doesn't seem to fit either.\n\nThat leaves Marxism. Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Lenin was a Marxist and founded the Bolshevik party, which was a Marxist revolutionary party. So, it makes sense that Marxism would be the philosophical underpinning of his call to power.\n\nLooking back at the quote, Lenin is talking about seizing power, offering peace, solving famine, and transferring land to the peasants. These are all ideas that align with Marxist principles, which aim to overthrow the existing capitalist order and establish a socialist society where the means of production are owned collectively.\n\nMoreover, Lenin is urging revolutionaries not to procrastinate and to take action because the opportunity is ripe. This sense of urgency and the belief in the necessity of revolution to bring about societal change are central to Marxist thought.\n\nTherefore, the principal philosophical underpinning of Lenin's call to power in Source 2 is Marxism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
