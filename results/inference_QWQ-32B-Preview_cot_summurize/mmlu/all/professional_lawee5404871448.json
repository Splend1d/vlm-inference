The prosecution put the witness on the stand at trial to tell what he observed. The defendant's counsel impeached his testimony by bringing up prior inconsistent statements and accusing him of changing his story for trial. The prosecution then attempted to rehabilitate his credibility by referencing prior consistent statements. Prior consistent statements are not generally admissible because they are said to be repetitive, cumulative and to unfairly bolster the witness's credibility. Will the court likely allow the prosecution to rehabilitate the witness using prior consistent statements under these facts?\n\nA. No, because the witness cannot be rehabilitated once a successful impeachment has occurred.\nB. No, because it would tend to confuse the jury with too much conflicting evidence.\nC. Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\nD. Yes, because all repetitive prior statements are important to show the consistency of the witness' testimony.\n"

Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\n\nHere's why: When a witness's credibility is attacked during cross-examination, like in this case where the defense is impeaching the witness with prior inconsistent statements, the prosecution can try to rehabilitate the witness's credibility. One way to do this is by introducing prior consistent statements that support the witness's current testimony.\n\nNow, you might think that prior consistent statements are generally not admissible because they are repetitive or cumulative, and they might unfairly bolster the witness's credibility. That's true in many situations. However, there's an exception to this rule when the witness's credibility has been attacked.\n\nIn such cases, prior consistent statements can be admitted to rebut the impeachment. The idea is that if the witness has made consistent statements before the motive to fabricate arose, it suggests that the current testimony is reliable.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the witness's credibility has been attacked by the defense using prior inconsistent statements, the prosecution can attempt to rehabilitate the witness by introducing prior consistent statements. This is allowed to show that the witness has, in fact, stuck to the same story over time, despite the inconsistencies brought up by the defense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not true that a witness cannot be rehabilitated once impeached. In fact, rehabilitation is a common practice in such situations.\n\nOption B might seem plausible, but in reality, introducing prior consistent statements in this context is a standard procedure and shouldn't necessarily confuse the jury more than it already is. Juries are expected to weigh the evidence and consider the consistency of the witness's statements over time.\n\nOption D is too broad. It's not that all repetitive prior statements are important; rather, it's that prior consistent statements can be important when used to rebut an impeachment based on inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C: Yes, because it is being used to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility was attacked.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
