                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about parametric equations and arc lengths. The curve is given by these equations:\n\n\\[x = e^{t} (t - 1)\\]\\[y = e^{t} (t + 1)\\]\n\nAnd I need to find the arc length from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = \\ln 2\\). The options are \\(\\pi/2\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(2 + \\pi\\), and \\(2\\pi\\).\n\nFirst, I recall that the formula for the arc length of a parametric curve from \\(t = a\\) to \\(t = b\\) is:\n\n\\[L = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{dy}{dt} \\right)^2} dt\\]\n\nSo, I need to find \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\) and \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) for the given parametric equations.\n\nStarting with \\(x = e^{t} (t - 1)\\), let's compute \\(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\):\n\nUsing the product rule, \\(\\frac{d}{dt}[u(t)v(t)] = u'(t)v(t) + u(t)v'(t)\\), where \\(u(t) = e^{t}\\) and \\(v(t) = t - 1\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = e^{t}(t - 1) + e^{t}(1) = e^{t}(t - 1 + 1) = e^{t} t\\]\n\nSimilarly, for \\(y = e^{t} (t + 1)\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^{t}(t + 1) + e^{t}(1) = e^{t}(t + 1 + 1) = e^{t}(t + 2)\\]\n\nNow, plug these into the arc length formula:\n\n\\[L = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} \\sqrt{(e^{t} t)^2 + (e^{t} (t + 2))^2} dt\\]\n\nLet's simplify the expression under the square root:\n\n\\[(e^{t} t)^2 + (e^{t} (t + 2))^2 = e^{2t} t^2 + e^{2t} (t + 2)^2 = e^{2t} (t^2 + (t + 2)^2)\\]\n\nExpanding \\((t + 2)^2\\):\n\n\\[(t + 2)^2 = t^2 + 4t + 4\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[t^2 + (t^2 + 4t + 4) = 2t^2 + 4t + 4 = 2(t^2 + 2t + 2)\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[L = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} \\sqrt{e^{2t} \\cdot 2(t^2 + 2t + 2)} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{2(t^2 + 2t + 2)} dt\\]\n\nThis looks a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can find a way to simplify the expression under the square root or find a substitution that makes the integral easier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the difference or sum of x and y to eliminate the parameter t.\n\nLet me try adding x and y:\n\n\\[x + y = e^{t} (t - 1) + e^{t} (t + 1) = e^{t}(2t)\\]\\[x + y = 2t e^{t}\\]\n\nAnd subtracting x from y:\n\n\\[y - x = e^{t} (t + 1) - e^{t} (t - 1) = e^{t}(2)\\]\\[y - x = 2e^{t}\\]\n\nFrom \\(y - x = 2e^{t}\\), I can solve for \\(e^{t}\\):\n\n\\[e^{t} = \\frac{y - x}{2}\\]\n\nAnd from \\(x + y = 2t e^{t}\\), substituting \\(e^{t}\\):\n\n\\[x + y = 2t \\left( \\frac{y - x}{2} \\right) = t(y - x)\\]\\[t = \\frac{x + y}{y - x}\\]\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe it's better to stick with the parametric equations and the arc length formula.\n\nLet me try to simplify the integral again:\n\n\\[L = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{2(t^2 + 2t + 2)} dt\\]\n\nI can factor out the constant \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{t^2 + 2t + 2} dt\\]\n\nNow, let's look at the expression inside the square root: \\(t^2 + 2t + 2\\). Can I complete the square here?\n\n\\[t^2 + 2t + 2 = (t + 1)^2 + 1\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1} dt\\]\n\nThis still looks tricky. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it further.\n\nLet me set \\(u = t + 1\\), so when \\(t = 0\\), \\(u = 1\\), and when \\(t = \\ln 2\\), \\(u = 1 + \\ln 2\\).\n\nAlso, \\(du = dt\\), and \\(e^{t} = e^{u - 1} = e^{u}/e\\).\n\nSubstituting these in:\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{1}^{1 + \\ln 2} \\frac{e^{u}}{e} \\sqrt{u^2 + 1} du = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{e} \\int_{1}^{1 + \\ln 2} e^{u} \\sqrt{u^2 + 1} du\\]\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to help much. Maybe another substitution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider integration by parts.\n\nLet me consider the integral:\n\n\\[\\int e^{t} \\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1} dt\\]\n\nI can set:\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1}, \\quad dw = e^{t} dt\\]\\[dv = \\frac{(t + 1)}{\\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1}} dt, \\quad w = e^{t}\\]\n\nThen, by integration by parts:\n\n\\[\\int v dw = vw - \\int w dv\\]\\[\\int \\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1} e^{t} dt = e^{t} \\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1} - \\int e^{t} \\frac{(t + 1)}{\\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1}} dt\\]\n\nNow, the remaining integral is:\n\n\\[\\int e^{t} \\frac{(t + 1)}{\\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1}} dt\\]\n\nThis still looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I can make a hyperbolic substitution since there's a \\(\\sqrt{u^2 + 1}\\) term, which resembles the identity \\(\\cosh^2 z - \\sinh^2 z = 1\\).\n\nLet me set \\(u = \\sinh z\\), so \\(du = \\cosh z dz\\), and \\(\\sqrt{u^2 + 1} = \\sqrt{\\sinh^2 z + 1} = \\cosh z\\).\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\\int e^{u} \\sqrt{u^2 + 1} du = \\int e^{\\sinh z} \\cosh z \\cdot \\cosh z dz = \\int e^{\\sinh z} \\cosh^2 z dz\\]\n\nThis seems even more complicated. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Perhaps there's a way to relate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directly without parameterizing by \\(t\\), but given the options are in terms of \\(\\pi\\), maybe there's a geometric interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look for symmetry or some property of the curve that can help me find the arc length without directly computing the integral.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the arc length in terms of a known integral or a special function, but I don't think that's necessary for this problem.\n\nWait, maybe I can approximate the integral numerically and see which option it matches closest, but since this is a multiple-choice question, I should aim for an exact answer.\n\nLet me try to see if the integrand simplifies for the given limits.\n\nFrom \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = \\ln 2\\), let's evaluate the integrand at these points.\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\):\n\n\\[e^{0} \\sqrt{2(0 + 0 + 2)} = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{4} = 2\\]\n\nAt \\(t = \\ln 2\\):\n\n\\[e^{\\ln 2} \\sqrt{2((\\ln 2)^2 + 2 \\ln 2 + 2)} = 2 \\sqrt{2((\\ln 2)^2 + 2 \\ln 2 + 2)}\\]\n\nThis doesn't immediately help me see the value of the integral.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me recall that for parametric equations, sometimes converting to Cartesian coordinates can simplify the arc length calculation, but in this case, the parametric equations are exponential functions, which might not lead to a simpler Cartesian form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate this integral to the arc length of a circle or some other known curve, given that the options involve \\(\\pi\\).\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the expression under the square root as part of a circle's equation.\n\nLet me look back at the expression:\n\n\\[\\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1}\\]\n\nThis resembles the distance from the point \\((-1, 0)\\) to the point \\((t, 1)\\) in the plane.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution for \\(t\\) to simplify the integral.\n\nLet me set \\(t = \\ln u\\), so when \\(t = 0\\), \\(u = 1\\), and when \\(t = \\ln 2\\), \\(u = 2\\). Also, \\(dt = \\frac{1}{u} du\\).\n\nThen, \\(e^{t} = u\\), and the integral becomes:\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{1}^{2} u \\sqrt{(\\ln u)^2 + 2 \\ln u + 2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{u} du = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{1}^{2} \\sqrt{(\\ln u)^2 + 2 \\ln u + 2} du\\]\n\nThis seems similar to the previous form and doesn't offer an obvious path forward.\n\nMaybe I need to accept that direct integration is the way to go, even if it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in my earlier steps that I can correct.\n\nLet me double-check the derivative calculations.\n\nGiven \\(x = e^{t} (t - 1)\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dx}{dt} = e^{t}(t - 1) + e^{t}(1) = e^{t} t\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor \\(y = e^{t} (t + 1)\\):\n\n\\[\\frac{dy}{dt} = e^{t}(t + 1) + e^{t}(1) = e^{t}(t + 2)\\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nNow, the arc length formula:\n\n\\[L = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} \\sqrt{(e^{t} t)^2 + (e^{t} (t + 2))^2} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{t^2 + (t + 2)^2} dt\\]\n\nWait a second, in my earlier steps, I had:\n\n\\[L = \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{2(t^2 + 2t + 2)} dt\\]\n\nBut actually, \\(t^2 + (t + 2)^2 = t^2 + t^2 + 4t + 4 = 2t^2 + 4t + 4\\), which is indeed \\(2(t^2 + 2t + 2)\\). So that seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I can factor the expression under the square root differently.\n\nLet me try completing the square for \\(t^2 + 2t + 2\\):\n\n\\[t^2 + 2t + 2 = (t + 1)^2 + 1\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{(t + 1)^2 + 1} dt\\]\n\nThis seems as simplified as it can get. Maybe I need to proceed with this integral as is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution \\(s = t + 1\\), so when \\(t = 0\\), \\(s = 1\\), and when \\(t = \\ln 2\\), \\(s = 1 + \\ln 2\\). Also, \\(ds = dt\\).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{1}^{1 + \\ln 2} e^{s - 1} \\sqrt{s^2 + 1} ds = \\sqrt{2} e^{-1} \\int_{1}^{1 + \\ln 2} e^{s} \\sqrt{s^2 + 1} ds\\]\n\nThis seems similar to before and doesn't offer much simplification.\n\nMaybe I need to consider numerical methods or approximate the integral, but since this is an exam problem, there must be an exact solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trigonometric substitution that can be applied here.\n\nGiven \\(\\sqrt{s^2 + 1}\\), I can set \\(s = \\tan \\theta\\), so \\(ds = \\sec^2 \\theta d\\theta\\), and \\(\\sqrt{s^2 + 1} = \\sec \\theta\\).\n\nApplying this substitution:\n\n\\[L = \\sqrt{2} e^{-1} \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} e^{\\tan \\theta} \\sec \\theta \\cdot \\sec^2 \\theta d\\theta = \\sqrt{2} e^{-1} \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} e^{\\tan \\theta} \\sec^3 \\theta d\\theta\\]\n\nThis seems even more complicated. Maybe this isn't the right path.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I've tried several substitutions and methods to simplify the integral, but I haven't found a way to compute it easily.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the arc length corresponds to a known geometric shape or that there's a symmetry I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I can check the options provided. The options are \\(\\pi/2\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(2 + \\pi\\), and \\(2\\pi\\). Since the integral involves an exponential function and a square root of a quadratic in t, it's possible that the result involves \\(\\pi\\), perhaps through an inverse trigonometric function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral can be related to the integral definition of \\(\\pi\\), such as the integral of \\(\\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\), but I don't see an immediate connection here.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider a different approach altogether, such as using polar coordinates or some other coordinate system, but given the parametric equations are in terms of t, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to relate the arc length to the area under a curve or some other integral that I can compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can expand the integrand in a series and integrate term by term, but that seems too time-consuming for this problem.\n\nGiven that time is limited in an exam, maybe I should consider making an intelligent guess based on the options provided.\n\nLooking at the interval from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = \\ln 2\\), which is approximately 0 to 0.693, and considering the exponential growth of \\(e^{t}\\), the arc length might not be too large.\n\nOption A is \\(\\pi/2 \\approx 1.57\\), option B is \\(\\pi \\approx 3.14\\), option C is \\(2 + \\pi \\approx 5.14\\), and option D is \\(2\\pi \\approx 6.28\\).\n\nGiven the relatively small interval, \\(2 + \\pi\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) seem too large. Between \\(\\pi/2\\) and \\(\\pi\\), perhaps \\(\\pi\\) is more plausible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can estimate the integral numerically.\n\nLet me approximate the integral \\(L = \\sqrt{2} \\int_{0}^{\\ln 2} e^{t} \\sqrt{t^2 + 2t + 2} dt\\) using simple numerical methods, like the trapezoidal rule.\n\nFirst, find the width of the interval:\n\n\\(\\Delta t = \\ln 2 - 0 = \\ln 2 \\approx 0.693\\)\n\nLet's use two intervals for simplicity:\n\n\\(t_0 = 0\\), \\(t_1 = \\ln 2 / 2 \\approx 0.3465\\), \\(t_2 = \\ln 2 \\approx 0.693\\)\n\nCompute the integrand at these points:\n\nAt \\(t = 0\\):\n\n\\(e^{0} \\sqrt{0 + 0 + 2} = 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\nAt \\(t = \\ln 2 / 2\\):\n\n\\(e^{\\ln 2 / 2} = \\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n\\(\\sqrt{(\\ln 2 / 2)^2 + 2(\\ln 2 / 2) + 2} = \\sqrt{(\\ln 2 / 2)^2 + \\ln 2 + 2}\\)\n\nApproximate \\(\\ln"
