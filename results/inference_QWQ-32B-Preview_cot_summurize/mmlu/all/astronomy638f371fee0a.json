                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out why the cores of terrestrial planets are mostly made of metal. There are four options here, and I need to pick the most accurate one.\n\nOption A says that the entire planets are made mostly of metal. But I know that Earth, for example, has a metal core, but the mantle and crust are made of rock and minerals, not metal. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption B mentions that metals condensed first in the solar nebula and rocks accreted around them. Hmm, in the early solar system, lighter elements like gases and ices would have condensed first, followed by rocks and then metals, right? Wait, no, I think I have that backward. Actually, in the solar nebula, heavier elements like metals would have condensed closer to the sun, while lighter elements like gases and ices would have condensed further out. So, maybe metals did condense first in the inner solar system where terrestrial planets form. Then, rocks accreted around them as the planets grew. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that metals sank to the center during a time when the interiors were molten throughout. I recall that in the early history of planets, they were much hotter, and their interiors were likely molten. So, if metals are denser than rocks, they would sink towards the center as the planet cooled, while the less dense rocks would float to the top. This process is called differentiation, where a planet separates into layers based on density. That makes sense.\n\nOption D suggests that radioactivity created metals in the core from the decay of uranium. I know that radioactivity does produce heat in a planet's interior, but I don't think it creates metals from decay. Uranium decay leads to the formation of other elements, but I don't think that's directly related to the core being metallic.\n\nSo, between options B and C, both seem reasonable, but maybe they're different aspects of the same process. Option B focuses on the initial condensation and accretion in the solar nebula, while option C discusses what happens after the planet has formed and its interior is molten.\n\nPerhaps the most direct answer is C, because it explains why metals are at the core: they sank due to their higher density when the planet was molten. Option B might be more about the initial composition of the planetesimals that came together to form the planet, but the actual segregation into core and mantle happens later due to melting and differentiation.\n\nLet me check my notes. Oh, yes, in class we learned about planetary differentiation. When a planet is molten, heavier elements like iron and nickel sink to the center to form the core, while lighter elements like silicates rise to form the mantle and crust.\n\nSo, based on that, option C seems to be the correct answer. The metals sank to the center when the planet's interior was molten throughout.\n\nBut wait, option B is also partly correct because in the solar nebula, metals did condense closer to the sun, and that's where terrestrial planets formed. So, the initial composition of the planetesimals was rich in metals and rocks, with metals condensing first.\n\nMaybe both are correct, but in different stages of planetary formation. But since the question is specifically about why the cores contain mostly metal, I think the key process is the sinking of metals to the center when the planet was molten.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
