The total benefit equals the total cost of eating cookies.\n\nB. The marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the next cookie.\n\nC. The marginal cost of eating cookies is maximized.\n\nD. The marginal benefit of eating cookies is minimized.\n\nSo, I need to think about when a rational consumer should stop eating cookies. I remember from economics that rational decisions are made at the margin, meaning decisions are based on the additional benefits and costs of one more unit.\n\nOption A says that the total benefit equals the total cost. That sounds similar to breaking even, but I'm not sure if that's when a consumer should stop eating cookies. Maybe they should stop when they've gotten as much benefit as they've paid for, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption B says that the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the next cookie. This sounds familiar. In economics, the principle is that you should consume up to the point where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost. So, you keep eating cookies as long as the benefit from the next cookie is at least equal to the cost of that cookie. So, maybe this is the right answer.\n\nOption C says that the marginal cost of eating cookies is maximized. That sounds wrong because if the cost of eating another cookie is at its highest, that wouldn't be a good time to stop. I think you want to stop before the cost gets too high.\n\nOption D says that the marginal benefit of eating cookies is minimized. Minimized could mean that the benefit from the next cookie is very low. Maybe that's related, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about it again. If I'm eating cookies, each additional cookie might give me less pleasure than the one before (diminishing marginal benefit). At the same time, maybe there's a cost, like calories or sugar, which could have increasing marginal cost.\n\nSo, I should keep eating cookies as long as the extra pleasure (marginal benefit) is greater than or equal to the extra cost (marginal cost). Once the marginal benefit drops below the marginal cost, I should stop.\n\nTherefore, the rational point to stop eating cookies is when the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the next cookie. That matches option B.\n\nOption A, about total benefit equaling total cost, might be relevant in some contexts, but in marginal analysis, it's the marginal benefits and costs that matter.\n\nOption C, maximizing marginal cost, doesn't make sense because you wouldn't want to maximize costs.\n\nOption D, minimizing marginal benefit, would mean that the next cookie gives almost no additional pleasure, which might seem like a stopping point, but actually, you should stop when marginal benefit equals marginal cost, not necessarily when marginal benefit is minimized.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of the next cookie.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
