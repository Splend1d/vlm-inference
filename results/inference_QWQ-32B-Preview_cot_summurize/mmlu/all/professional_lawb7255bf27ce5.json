                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a property owner, her friend, a cousin, and a developer, with a lease, an assignment, a condemnation, and a rent dispute. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a property owner who owns a three-story house and a 21-acre tract in fee simple. She leases this property to her friend for 10 years, with a monthly rental of $300 and a covenant to pay taxes during the lease term. The lease also has a provision that the friend cannot assign or sublease the premises.\n\nThe friend lives there for two years and then assigns his leasehold interest to his cousin, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. The assignment says the cousin will pay the owner $300 monthly but is silent on taxes. The owner doesn't object to this assignment.\n\nThen, the owner sells her property interest to a developer during the cousin's tenancy. Meanwhile, the State Highway Authority starts condemnation proceedings to take two acres of the tract for highway construction.\n\nAs a result, the cousin tells the developer that his rent should be reduced proportionally due to the loss of land, but the developer refuses. So, the cousin sues to have his rent apportioned pro tanto.\n\nNow, the question is: who should win the judgment\u2014the developer or the cousin? And there are four options:\n\nA. The developer, but the cousin can terminate the lease.\n\nB. The developer, because the cousin is bound by the original leasehold contract.\n\nC. The cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.\n\nD. The cousin, because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, there's the issue of the assignment. The original lease forbids assignments, but the friend assigned it to the cousin anyway, and the owner didn't object. The cousin was unaware of the prohibition, which might affect whether the assignment is enforceable or not.\n\nIn general, if a lessee assigns their leasehold interest in violation of a no-assignment clause, the landlord can terminate the lease or hold the original tenant liable. However, since the owner didn't object and accepted payments from the cousin, it seems like they accepted the assignment. So, the assignment might be valid despite the prohibition.\n\nNext, when the owner sold the property to the developer, the lease should have been transferred as well, since leases are property interests that run with the land. So, the developer now owns the reversionary interest and is the new landlord.\n\nNow, the State Highway Authority is condemning two acres of the 21-acre tract. Condemnation is a form of eminent domain, where the government takes private property for public use, with compensation.\n\nThe cousin argues that his rent should be reduced proportionally because part of the leased property is being taken. The developer refuses.\n\nSo, the question is whether the condemnation reduces the value of the leasehold interest and thus justifies a reduction in rent.\n\nIn general, when part of the leased property is taken by eminent domain, the leasehold interest is diminished, and the rent might be apportioned accordingly. This is based on the principle that the tenant should only pay rent for the portion of the property they can use.\n\nHowever, lease terms can override this general principle. If the lease has a clause addressing condemnation or changes in property, that would control.\n\nLooking back at the original lease, there's no mention of condemnation or changes in property. So, we might have to look at default rules.\n\nAlso, the assignment to the cousin doesn't address taxes, but since the original lease required the friend to pay taxes, and the assignment says the cousin will pay $300 monthly, perhaps the tax payment obligation carries over.\n\nBut the main issue is the rent apportionment due to condemnation.\n\nOption A says judgment should be for the developer, but the cousin can terminate the lease. This suggests that the cousin has the right to terminate the lease due to the condemnation, but since he's choosing to sue for rent reduction instead, the developer wins this particular suit.\n\nOption B says judgment should be for the developer because the cousin is bound by the original leasehold contract. This implies that despite the condemnation, the cousin must continue to pay the full rent as per the original terms.\n\nOption C says judgment should be for the cousin because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto. \"Pro tanto\" means \"in proportion.\" So, this option suggests that the rent should be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the property.\n\nOption D says judgment should be for the cousin because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent. This seems similar to option C but specifies that it's due to eminent domain.\n\nTo decide, I need to consider whether the lease terms or legal principles dictate the outcome.\n\nFirst, the original lease required the friend to pay $300 monthly and taxes. The assignment to the cousin only mentions paying $300 monthly, silent on taxes. However, since the owner accepted this assignment without objection, perhaps the tax payment obligation is still in place.\n\nBut more importantly, the lease doesn't address condemnation or reduction in property. In such cases, law generally allows for apportionment of rent when part of the leased property is taken.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, there are statutes that address what happens to a lease when part of the leased property is condemned. These statutes often provide that the lease continues, but the rent is apportioned based on the remaining usable property.\n\nFor example, if two acres out of 21 are taken, that's approximately 9.5% of the land. So, the rent might be reduced proportionally.\n\nHowever, if the lease specifically addresses condemnation or changes in property, those terms would control.\n\nHere, since there's no such clause in the lease, we might look to statutory provisions or common law principles.\n\nAdditionally, the assignment to the cousin doesn't affect this, as the assignment doesn't modify the original lease terms beyond the payment obligation.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems that the cousin has a valid argument that his leasehold interest has been diminished by the condemnation, and thus his rent should be reduced proportionally.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem plausible.\n\nOption C states that judgment should be for the cousin because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto. This aligns with the principle of apportioning rent based on the reduction in property.\n\nOption D says judgment should be for the cousin because eminent domain operates as an apportionment of rent. This is similar to C but specifies that it's due to eminent domain.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is a better answer because it refers to the value of the leasehold interest being reduced, which is a more direct reason for apportioning rent.\n\nOption D might be a bit too broad, as eminent domain is the process by which the property is taken, but the apportionment is based on the reduction in value of the leasehold.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option C: the cousin, because the value of his leasehold interest was reduced pro tanto.\n\nThis means that the rent should be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the property's size or value due to the condemnation.\n\nSo, the judgment should be for the cousin on that basis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
