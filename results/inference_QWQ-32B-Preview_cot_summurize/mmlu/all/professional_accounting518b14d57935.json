                    "text": "So I've got this problem about Lake Trust, which is a simple trust, and it's reporting some income and expenses for the year. I need to figure out its distributable net income (DNI). The options are A) $9,500, B) $8,250, C) $5,000, and D) $3,250.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what distributable net income is for a trust. From what I recall, DNI is essentially the income that's available for distribution to the beneficiaries. It includes certain types of income and may be reduced by certain deductions.\n\nLooking at the items provided:\n\n- Dividend income: $2,500\n\n- Taxable interest income: $2,000\n\n- Capital gains (allocable to corpus): $5,000\n\n- Accounting fees (allocable to income): ($500)\n\n- Trustee fees (allocable to income): ($750)\n\nI need to add up the income items and subtract the expenses that are allocable to income.\n\nFirst, let's add the income items:\n\nDividend income: $2,500\n\nTaxable interest income: $2,000\n\nCapital gains: $5,000\n\nTotal income: $2,500 + $2,000 + $5,000 = $9,500\n\nNow, subtract the expenses allocable to income:\n\nAccounting fees: ($500)\n\nTrustee fees: ($750)\n\nTotal expenses: $500 + $750 = $1,250\n\nSo, DNI would be total income minus total expenses: $9,500 - $1,250 = $8,250\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that capital gains allocable to corpus might not be included in DNI. Let me check that.\n\nIn trusts, capital gains are generally allocable to corpus, which means they're not included in DNI. So, maybe I shouldn't have included the $5,000 capital gains in the total income.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nDividend income: $2,500\n\nTaxable interest income: $2,000\n\nTotal income: $2,500 + $2,000 = $4,500\n\nNow, subtract expenses:\n\nAccounting fees: ($500)\n\nTrustee fees: ($750)\n\nTotal expenses: $500 + $750 = $1,250\n\nSo, DNI: $4,500 - $1,250 = $3,250\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nBut earlier, when I included capital gains, I got $8,250, which is option B. Now I'm confused.\n\nLet me look up the rules for DNI in trusts.\n\nAccording to the tax code, distributable net income is generally the sum of the trust's taxable income from sources that are includible in DNI, minus any deductions allocable to DNI.\n\nDividends and interest are typically included in DNI, while capital gains allocable to corpus are not.\n\nSo, in this case, the $5,000 capital gains should not be included in DNI.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is:\n\nIncome: $2,500 (dividends) + $2,000 (interest) = $4,500\n\nExpenses: $500 (accounting fees) + $750 (trustee fees) = $1,250\n\nDNI: $4,500 - $1,250 = $3,250\n\nSo, the answer should be D) $3,250.\n\nBut let me double-check why option B is $8,250, which would include the capital gains.\n\nMaybe there's a scenario where capital gains are included in DNI, but I think that's only if they're allocable to income, not to corpus.\n\nIn this problem, it specifically says \"capital gains (allocable to corpus)\", so they should not be included in DNI.\n\nTherefore, I think $3,250 is the correct DNI.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other item that might affect DNI.\n\nThe problem only lists the items mentioned, so I think the calculation is straightforward.\n\nIncome from dividends and interest: $2,500 + $2,000 = $4,500\n\nLess expenses allocable to income: $500 + $750 = $1,250\n\nDNI: $4,500 - $1,250 = $3,250\n\nSo, the answer should be D) $3,250.\n\nBut why is there an option for $8,250, which includes capital gains? Maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some jurisdictions or under certain trust documents, capital gains can be allocated to income, but based on standard U.S. tax rules, capital gains are typically allocable to corpus.\n\nTherefore, I stick with $3,250 as the correct DNI.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
