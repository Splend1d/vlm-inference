                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem about the uncle and the best friend who inherited a property together. It seems a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the homeowner died in 1985 and left his estate to his uncle and his best friend as tenants in common, sharing alike. So, they both own equal parts of the property. The uncle lived in the same state as the estate, but in a different part, while the best friend lived in a northern state.\n\nAfter the funeral, the uncle went back to his own place, and the best friend decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox, paid taxes and maintenance, rented out a small house on the property to a teacher, and grew fruits that he sold at a stand on Fridays. The uncle knew about this but didn't care much and never asked for any rent or compensation.\n\nNow, in January 2010, there are disputes between them about their rights to the estate, and the uncle is suing for a portion of the proceeds from the fruit stand and the rent from the teacher. The best friend is contesting this apportionment.\n\nThe state recognizes common law types of cotenancies and follows majority rules on rents and profits, with no specific legislation on this subject.\n\nI need to decide who should be judged in favor, given the options.\n\nLet me recall what I know about tenants in common. Tenants in common each own undivided shares of the property, and they can have unequal shares, but in this case, it's equal since it's \"share and share alike.\"\n\nOne important principle is that each cotenant is entitled to an accounting for profits and expenses related to the property. So, if one cotenant is in possession and generating income from the property, they should account to the other cotenant for their share of that income.\n\nIn this scenario, the best friend is the one in possession, paying taxes and maintenance, and generating income from renting the small house and selling fruits.\n\nOption A says that as a cotenant in possession, the best friend retains all the profits from his crops and the rents paid by the teacher. But according to the general rule, shouldn't he account to the uncle for his share of these incomes?\n\nOption B says that the best friend retains the profits from his crops, but the uncle is entitled to a share of the rent paid by the teacher. Hmm, why would there be a difference between the crops and the rent?\n\nOption C says that the uncle is entitled to a share of both the rent and the crop profits. That seems more aligned with the general principle that each cotenant is entitled to their proportionate share of income generated from the property.\n\nOption D says that the uncle is entitled to no share of any monies because his lack of contact with the best friend is deemed a waiver. I'm not sure about this. Waiver usually requires some intent to relinquish a right, and here, the uncle just didn't ask for anything; he was aware but didn't care much.\n\nGiven that, I think option C makes the most sense. Both the rent from the teacher and the profits from the fruit stand are income generated from the property, and since they are tenants in common with equal shares, each should be entitled to half of these incomes.\n\nWait a minute, but the best friend is the one who is occupying the property, paying all the expenses, and doing all the work. Shouldn't he get to keep more? Or at least be compensated for his efforts?\n\nWell, in cotenancy law, the cotenant in possession is required to account to the other cotenant for income generated from the property, after deducting any expenses properly incurred for the maintenance and improvement of the property.\n\nSo, in this case, the best friend has been paying taxes and maintenance expenses, which are proper charges that can be deducted from the income.\n\nTherefore, when calculating the income, he should be able to subtract these expenses before dividing the net income with the uncle.\n\nBut the question is about whether the uncle is entitled to a share of the monies, and the best friend is contesting that.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the uncle hasn't asked for anything for all these years, but now is suing for a portion of the proceeds, I think the best friend should still have to account to the uncle for his share of the net income.\n\nHowever, the uncle might also be liable for his share of any expenses.\n\nBut since the best friend has been paying all the expenses himself, perhaps he can seek contribution from the uncle for his share of the expenses, or set off those expenses against the income.\n\nBut in this particular lawsuit, the uncle is seeking a portion of the monies received from the fruit stand and the rent.\n\nSo, if the best friend contests this, arguing that he should keep all the income because he's the one who has been maintaining the property and generating the income, how would the court rule?\n\nI think the court would likely rule that as tenants in common, both are entitled to their proportionate share of the income generated from the property, after accounting for expenses.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct: the uncle is entitled to a share of both the rent and the crop profits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it allows the best friend to retain all the income, which isn't in line with cotenancy principles.\n\nOption B distinguishes between the crops and the rent, but I don't see a legal basis for treating them differently in this context. Both are forms of income generated from the property.\n\nOption D suggests that the uncle's lack of contact is a waiver, but waiver typically requires some intent to relinquish a right, and here, the uncle just didn't ask for anything for a long time. It's possible that the uncle could argue estoppel or laches, but that's not directly addressed in the options.\n\nMoreover, the problem states that this is the first time there are disputes, and the uncle is bringing the action now. So, it doesn't seem like the uncle has waived his rights.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. The uncle is entitled to a share of both the rent and the crop profits.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
