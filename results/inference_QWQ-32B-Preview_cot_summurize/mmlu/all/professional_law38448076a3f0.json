The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. A businessman was driving his car east on Figueroa Street and did not see the traffic light. He entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A woman, in violation of statute, was proceeding south on Wilshire Street, and she entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the businessman's car. The businessman suffered damages in the amount of $5,000. The woman, on the other hand, suffered damages in the amount of $1,000. The businessman brought suit against the woman to recover his damages. The woman denied liability and filed a counterclaim against the businessman for her damages. Both drivers were negligent with 30 percent of the negligence attributable to the woman and 70 percent of the negligence attributable to the businessman. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties. \" Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?\n\nA. The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.\nB. The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.\nC. The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.\nD.

                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It seems a bit complicated at first, but if I break it down, I can figure it out.\n\nSo, we have an intersection where Wilshire Street and Figueroa Street meet at right angles. Wilshire is a one-way street for northbound traffic, meaning cars can only go north on it. Figueroa, I assume, has different directions, but specifically, the businessman was driving east on Figueroa.\n\nThere are traffic lights controlling the intersection. The businessman was driving east on Figueroa and didn't see the traffic light. He entered the intersection when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic on Wilshire.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman was proceeding south on Wilshire, which is against the one-way designation since it's for northbound traffic only. She entered the intersection without looking for cross traffic and hit the businessman's car.\n\nBoth drivers were negligent: the woman is attributed 30% negligence, and the businessman 70% negligence.\n\nThere's also a statute in the jurisdiction that says: \"A failure to exercise ordinary care, which contributes to personal injury or property damage, shall not bar recovery of damages by the injured party, but damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured. There shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties.\"\n\nSo, the businessman sues the woman for his $5,000 damages, and the woman countersues for her $1,000 damages.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the appropriate judgment based on the given options.\n\nFirst, let's understand the statute. It seems to follow a comparative negligence approach, where even if the injured party is negligent to some extent, they can still recover damages, but those damages are reduced by the percentage of their own negligence.\n\nSpecifically, it says \"damages shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person injured.\" So, for the businessman, his recoverable damages would be reduced by his own negligence.\n\nSimilarly, for the woman, her recoverable damages would be reduced by her own negligence.\n\nAlso, it says \"there shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties.\" That means their claims are separate; they don't offset each other's claims.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate each party's recoverable damages.\n\nStarting with the businessman:\n\nHe has $5,000 in damages, but he is 70% negligent. So, his recoverable damages would be reduced by 70%.\n\nFirst, find 70% of $5,000:\n\n0.70 * $5,000 = $3,500\n\nSo, his damages are reduced by $3,500.\n\nTherefore, the amount he can recover is:\n\n$5,000 - $3,500 = $1,500\n\nNow, for the woman:\n\nShe has $1,000 in damages, and she is 30% negligent.\n\nSo, her damages are reduced by 30%.\n\n0.30 * $1,000 = $300\n\nTherefore, the amount she can recover is:\n\n$1,000 - $300 = $700\n\nSo, the businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The businessman recovers $5,000 from the woman, and the woman recovers $1,000 from the businessman.\n\nB. The businessman recovers $3,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $300 from the businessman.\n\nC. The businessman recovers $1,500 from the woman, and the woman recovers $700 from the businessman.\n\nD. The businessman recovers $800 from the woman, and the woman recovers nothing from the businessman.\n\nBased on my calculations, option C seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIs there any reason why the set-off provision would change this?\n\nThe statute says \"there shall be no set-off of damages between the respective parties.\" That means we don't combine their claims; they are separate.\n\nSo, the businessman can recover his reduced damages, and the woman can recover her reduced damages, separately.\n\nTherefore, option C appears to be the correct judgment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
