Baseline assessment\n\nB. Portfolio assessment\n\nC. Short-answer unit assessment\n\nD. Teacher-created assessment\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these assessments entails.\n\nA. Baseline assessment: This is usually given at the beginning of a course or program to determine a student's starting point or prior knowledge. It helps teachers understand what students already know and what they need to learn. But since it's given at the start, it might not be the best for evaluating development over the entire year.\n\nB. Portfolio assessment: This involves collecting samples of a student's work over time. It can include drafts, final projects, reflections, and other artifacts that demonstrate growth and learning. Portfolios are great for showing progress because they provide a body of work that can be reviewed and compared over time.\n\nC. Short-answer unit assessment: These are typically quizzes or tests with short-answer questions that assess understanding of specific units or topics. They can be useful for checking comprehension of particular concepts but might not give a comprehensive view of a student's overall development in drafting skills.\n\nD. Teacher-created assessment: This is an assessment designed by the teacher to evaluate specific skills or knowledge. It could take various forms, such as tests, projects, or presentations. The effectiveness depends on how well the assessment is aligned with the learning objectives and how it's used to measure progress.\n\nNow, considering the goal is to evaluate the development of drafting skills throughout the school year, I need an assessment method that can capture progress over time.\n\nOption A, baseline assessment, is more about starting points and may not show growth over the year.\n\nOption C, short-answer unit assessment, is good for specific knowledge but might not capture the developmental aspect of drafting skills, which are likely more practical and skill-based.\n\nOption D, teacher-created assessment, could be effective if it's designed to measure progress over time, but it's a broad category and could include various types of assessments.\n\nOption B, portfolio assessment, seems to align best with the goal because it allows for the collection of multiple pieces of work over the course of the year, showing not just the end product but also the process and development of skills.\n\nMoreover, portfolios can include self-reflections, which can provide insight into the student's understanding of their own learning and growth.\n\nTherefore, I think portfolio assessment is the most effective way to evaluate the development of a student's drafting skills throughout the school year.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
