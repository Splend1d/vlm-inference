That sounds like violence happening in a work environment.\n\nLet me look at the other options to make sure.\n\nB. Organizational misdeeds. I'm not sure exactly what that means, but it sounds like something the whole organization is doing wrong, maybe like corruption or illegal activities. Leslie seems to be acting on her own, so maybe that's not it.\n\nC. Megadamage. I don't know what that is. Maybe it's about causing massive damage, but I think that's more related to natural disasters or big accidents, not someone shooting people.\n\nD. Crisis management. That's when a company handles a difficult situation, like a PR crisis or an emergency. Leslie's actions might lead to a crisis for the company, but her behavior itself isn't crisis management; that's what the company does in response.\n\nSo, I think A. workplace violence is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
