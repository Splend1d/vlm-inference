                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. Ms. Gutierrez has a gym class with 32 students, and each student needs a piece of rope that's 5 feet 8 inches long. We need to find out the total length of rope she needs to order for the whole class.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to handle the measurements. The rope length is given in feet and inches, which can be a bit tricky because we have to remember that 1 foot equals 12 inches. So, 5 feet 8 inches is the same as 5 feet plus 8 inches.\n\nOne way to approach this is to convert the entire length into inches, multiply by the number of students, and then convert back to feet and inches. Let's try that.\n\nFirst, convert 5 feet 8 inches to inches:\n\n5 feet = 5 \u00d7 12 inches = 60 inches\n\nPlus 8 inches = 60 + 8 = 68 inches\n\nSo, each student gets 68 inches of rope.\n\nNow, for 32 students:\n\n32 \u00d7 68 inches\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n32 \u00d7 68:\n\nFirst, 30 \u00d7 68 = 2040\n\nThen, 2 \u00d7 68 = 136\n\nTotal = 2040 + 136 = 2176 inches\n\nNow, convert 2176 inches back to feet and inches.\n\nSince 1 foot = 12 inches, we divide 2176 by 12.\n\n2176 \u00f7 12 = ?\n\nLet's see:\n\n12 \u00d7 180 = 2160\n\n2176 - 2160 = 16 inches\n\nSo, 180 feet and 16 inches.\n\nBut wait, 16 inches is more than a foot, since 12 inches make a foot. So, we can convert those extra 16 inches into 1 foot 4 inches.\n\nTherefore, total length is 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 106 feet 8 inches\n\nB. 154 feet 8 inches\n\nC. 160 feet 8 inches\n\nD. 181 feet 4 inches\n\nSo, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem, like multiplying feet and inches separately and then combining them.\n\nLet's try that method to verify.\n\nFirst, multiply the feet:\n\n32 students \u00d7 5 feet = 160 feet\n\nThen, multiply the inches:\n\n32 students \u00d7 8 inches = 256 inches\n\nNow, convert the 256 inches to feet and inches.\n\n256 \u00f7 12 = ?\n\n12 \u00d7 21 = 252\n\n256 - 252 = 4 inches\n\nSo, 21 feet and 4 inches from the inches multiplication.\n\nNow, add this to the feet from earlier:\n\n160 feet + 21 feet = 181 feet, and 4 inches.\n\nSo, again, we get 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that the rope lengths could overlap or that some rope is wasted? The problem doesn't mention any extra length needed for tying knots or anything like that, so we can assume that each student gets exactly 5 feet 8 inches of rope.\n\nAlso, the class has 32 students, and we're to find the total rope needed for all of them.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to convert the length per student to feet with decimals.\n\n5 feet 8 inches is the same as 5 + 8/12 feet, since there are 12 inches in a foot.\n\n8/12 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667 feet\n\nSo, 5.6667 feet per student\n\nThen, for 32 students: 32 \u00d7 5.6667 \u2248 181.3344 feet\n\nWhich is approximately 181 feet 4 inches, since 0.3344 \u00d7 12 \u2248 4 inches\n\nAgain, this confirms our previous calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 181 feet 4 inches.\n\nIt seems that options A, B, and C are incorrect in this context.\n\nOption A, 106 feet 8 inches, is significantly less than what's needed.\n\nOption B, 154 feet 8 inches, is also insufficient.\n\nOption C, 160 feet 8 inches, is closer but still short of the required length.\n\nOnly option D matches our calculations.\n\nTo summarize, by converting the rope length to inches, multiplying by the number of students, and then converting back to feet and inches, we arrived at 181 feet 4 inches as the total rope needed. Alternatively, multiplying feet and inches separately and then combining them also gave the same result. Additionally, using decimal feet per student and multiplying by the number of students confirmed this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
