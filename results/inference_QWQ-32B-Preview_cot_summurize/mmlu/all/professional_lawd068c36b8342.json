                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have an investor who owns a four-story office building in downtown that's old and needs renovation. To finance the improvements, he borrows $125,000 from his friend. As security for this loan, he executes a promissory note for $125,000, payable in one year, and secures it with a mortgage on the building. The mortgage is dated January 1 and recorded on January 2.\n\nThen, on February 1, the investor executes a deed absolute, naming his friend as the grantee. Now, this deed is absolute in form, but it was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt. To make judicial foreclosure unnecessary and to eliminate the right to redeem, the investor delivers this deed to his nephew in escrow, with instructions to deliver the deed to the friend if the investor fails to pay the promissory note at maturity.\n\nFast forward to January 1 of the following year, the investor fails to pay the note when it comes due, so the nephew, following the escrow instructions, delivers the deed to the friend, who promptly records it. Two weeks later, the investor tenders the $125,000 indebtedness to the friend, but the friend refuses to accept it. The investor then brings an action to set aside and cancel the deed absolute and to permit the redemption of the building from the friend. In response, the friend counterclaims to quiet title, arguing that the deed absolute was intended as an outright conveyance upon default.\n\nWe need to determine who should prevail in this situation.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key documents and their purposes:\n\n1. **Promissory Note**: A promise to pay back the borrowed money with specified terms.\n\n2. **Mortgage**: Security for the promissory note, giving the friend an interest in the property until the debt is paid.\n\n3. **Deed Absolute**: On its face, it seems like an outright transfer of title to the friend, but in this case, it was intended as additional security.\n\n4. **Escrow Instructions**: The deed is held by the nephew and to be delivered to the friend only if the investor defaults on the promissory note.\n\nNow, the crux of the matter is whether the deed absolute should be treated as an outright conveyance or as additional security.\n\n**Option A**: The investor should prevail only if he can establish that the mortgage takes precedence over the deed absolute because it was executed earlier in time.\n\nThis option suggests that the order of execution and recording determines the priority. Generally, in real estate law, recording statutes determine priority based on the order of recording. Here, the mortgage was recorded on January 2, and the deed absolute was executed on February 1 and recorded later by the friend.\n\nHowever, the deed absolute, being an absolute conveyance, might cloud the title, and its recording could potentially supersede the mortgage, depending on the jurisdiction's recording statutes.\n\n**Option B**: The investor should prevail because the deed absolute did not extinguish his right of redemption.\n\nThis option implies that even though the deed absolute was delivered and recorded, the investor still retains a right of redemption. In typical mortgage transactions, there is a right of redemption unless specifically waived or lost through a foreclosure process.\n\n**Option C**: The friend should prevail because the deed absolute effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished the redemption interest sought to be retained by the investor.\n\nThis option argues that since the deed absolute was delivered and recorded, it operated as an outright transfer of title, extinguishing any redemption rights the investor may have had.\n\n**Option D**: The friend should prevail because the investor is estopped to deny the effect of the deed absolute in conjunction with the escrow arrangement.\n\nThis option invokes the doctrine of estoppel, suggesting that the investor cannot deny the effect of the deed absolute because of his own actions and the escrow arrangement.\n\nTo decide, we need to consider the intent behind the deed absolute and how it was intended to function.\n\nGiven that the deed absolute was intended only as additional security and not as an outright conveyance, one might argue that it should be treated as such. However, the form of the deed is absolute, which typically transfers title without conditions.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a deed absolute delivered as additional security can be treated as a mortgage or a deed of trust, provided certain conditions are met, such as the intent to secure debt and not to convey title absolutely.\n\nHere, the investor delivered the deed to his nephew in escrow, with instructions to deliver it to the friend only upon default. This suggests that the deed was intended as security and not as an immediate conveyance.\n\nWhen the investor defaulted, the nephew delivered the deed to the friend, who recorded it. At this point, the deed becomes effective, and title passes to the friend.\n\nHowever, the investor tenders the payment two weeks later, seeking to redeem the property. The friend refuses.\n\nIn this scenario, the question is whether the investor has a right to redeem after the deed has been delivered and recorded.\n\nIf the deed absolute is treated as an outright conveyance, then the investor's right to redeem may be extinguished, and the friend should prevail.\n\nAlternatively, if the deed absolute is considered as security only, similar to a mortgage, then the investor may have a right to redeem within a certain period.\n\nGiven that the deed was intended as additional security and was held in escrow, it's arguable that it functioned more like a deed of trust or a mortgage, allowing for redemption rights.\n\nHowever, the form of the deed is absolute, which typically extinguishes redemption rights upon delivery and recording.\n\nMoreover, the investor's actions, including placing the deed in escrow with instructions to deliver upon default, might estop him from denying that the deed operates as an absolute conveyance.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems that the friend should prevail because the deed absolute, once delivered and recorded upon default, effectuated an outright conveyance that extinguished any redemption rights the investor may have had.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
