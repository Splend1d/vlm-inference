                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a spring-block oscillator. There's a block of mass m attached to a spring with spring constant k, and it's oscillating with some amplitude A. Then, the student puts another small block of mass m on top of the original block, and I need to figure out when the small block is most likely to slide off and what condition prevents it from sliding off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the forces at play here. The spring is oscillating, so there's a restoring force from the spring that causes the block to accelerate back towards the equilibrium position. This acceleration will affect the small block on top, and if the friction between the two blocks isn't strong enough, the small block could slide off.\n\nSo, the key here is to look at the acceleration of the original block and see when it's maximum because that's when the frictional force needed to keep the small block in place would be the greatest.\n\nThe equation for the acceleration of the block in simple harmonic motion is:\n\na = - (k/m) * x\n\nwhere x is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nWait, actually, the mass of the oscillating system is now m + m = 2m, since there are two blocks of mass m attached together.\n\nSo, the acceleration should be:\n\na = - (k/(2m)) * x\n\nThe maximum acceleration occurs when the displacement x is maximum, which is at the amplitude A. So, the maximum acceleration is:\n\na_max = (k/(2m)) * A\n\nNow, for the small block on top, the frictional force between it and the original block must be enough to provide this acceleration without sliding off.\n\nThe maximum static frictional force is given by:\n\nf_max = \u03bc_s * N\n\nwhere \u03bc_s is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force.\n\nThe normal force N is equal to the weight of the small block, which is m * g.\n\nSo, f_max = \u03bc_s * m * g\n\nThis frictional force needs to be at least equal to the mass of the small block times the maximum acceleration of the system:\n\nf_max >= m * a_max\n\nPlugging in the expressions:\n\n\u03bc_s * m * g >= m * (k/(2m)) * A\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03bc_s * g >= (k/(2m)) * A\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bc_s >= (k * A)/(2m * g)\n\nHmm, but looking back at the options, they have (M + m) in the denominator, but in this case, both blocks are of mass m, so M + m = 2m.\n\nWait, in the problem, the original block has mass m, and the small block placed on top also has mass m. So, together, their mass is 2m.\n\nBut in the options, it's written as (M + m), which I think is to generalize that the original block has mass M and the small block has mass m, but in this specific case, both are m.\n\nAssuming that, let's generalize it to M and m.\n\nSo, the oscillating system has mass M + m, and the acceleration is:\n\na = - (k/(M + m)) * x\n\nMaximum acceleration:\n\na_max = (k/(M + m)) * A\n\nFrictional force required:\n\nf >= m * a_max = m * (k/(M + m)) * A\n\nMaximum frictional force:\n\nf_max = \u03bc_s * m * g\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bc_s * m * g >= m * (k/(M + m)) * A\n\nSimplify:\n\n\u03bc_s >= (k * A)/(g * (M + m))\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Small block most likely to slide off at maximum displacement, and won't slide off if \u03bc_s > kA/[(M + m)g]\n\nB. At equilibrium position, won't slide off if \u03bc_s > kA/[(M + m)g]\n\nC. At maximum displacement, won't slide off if \u03bc_s > (M + m)g/(kA)\n\nD. At equilibrium position, won't slide off if \u03bc_s > (M + m)g/(kA)\n\nSo, according to my calculation, option A seems correct.\n\nBut wait, is the small block most likely to slide off at maximum displacement or at equilibrium position?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe acceleration is maximum at maximum displacement, which is when x = A or x = -A.\n\nAt equilibrium position, x = 0, the acceleration is zero.\n\nSo, the frictional force required is maximum at maximum displacement because that's where the acceleration is maximum.\n\nTherefore, the small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement, and to prevent sliding, \u03bc_s needs to be greater than kA/[(M + m)g].\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the small block is at equilibrium position, the acceleration is zero, so no force is needed to keep it in place, so it's less likely to slide off there.\n\nAt maximum displacement, maximum acceleration, maximum required friction, so most likely to slide off there.\n\nHence, option A is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
