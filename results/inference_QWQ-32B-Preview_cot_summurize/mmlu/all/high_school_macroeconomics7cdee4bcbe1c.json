Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst off, what's a command economy? I remember that in a command economy, the government has a lot of control over the economy. It's like the opposite of a market economy where the market and prices decide things.\n\nSo, the question is asking about how a command economy handles the fundamental economic questions. What are those questions again? I think they are: what to produce, how to produce it, and for whom to produce it. Yeah, those are the big three in economics.\n\nOption A says that in a command economy, the market dictates the answers to these questions. But wait, isn't that more like a market economy? In a command economy, the government makes these decisions, right? So, I don't think A is correct.\n\nOption B mentions that competition helps answer these questions. Again, that sounds more like a market economy where competition plays a key role. In a command economy, competition is usually not the driving force. So, probably not B.\n\nOption C says that state and local governments respond to these questions. Hmm, this is getting closer. In a command economy, it's the government that makes decisions, but does that mean it's specifically state and local governments?\n\nWell, in some command economies, it might be more centralized, with the central government making decisions, rather than state or local governments. So, I'm not entirely sure about this one.\n\nOption D states that the central government dictates the answers to these fundamental economic questions. That sounds very much like a command economy to me. The central government plans and decides what goods and services to produce, how to produce them, and who gets them.\n\nComparing options C and D, D seems more accurate because it specifies the central government, which aligns better with the concept of a command economy. In some cases, state and local governments might have some say, but overall, it's the central authority that's in charge.\n\nLet me think about this again. In a command economy, the government makes decisions about production, allocation of resources, and distribution. It's a planned economy where the government directs economic activities.\n\nSo, if I had to choose, I would go with D. The central government dictates the answers to the fundamental economic questions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where state and local governments might have more say. Maybe in some command economies, there's more decentralization, but generally, the term \"command economy\" implies a high degree of central control.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
