In the film, Robert De Niro's character, Travis Bickle, delivers a memorable monologue to his mirror, which includes that line. It's a classic scene that many people recognize. So, I would go with option B, Taxi Driver.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about the other options. Ghostbusters has some iconic lines like \"I ain't going back there again,\" but I don't recall \"You talkin' to me?\" being from that movie.\n\nJoker, the 2019 film starring Joaquin Phoenix, has its own memorable monologues, but again, that specific phrase doesn't ring a bell in that context.\n\nGroundhog Day with Bill Murray has lots of dialogue, but I don't think that particular phrase is from that film.\n\nSo, based on my memory, I'm sticking with Taxi Driver.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
