                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking about. It's about the rotation of a solid disk, and we have to determine which statement among the options is true. So, I need to recall some basics about rotational motion.\n\nFirst off, when a solid disk rotates, every point on the disk moves in a circular path around the axis of rotation. The axis is like the center point, and everything else moves in circles around it.\n\nOption A says: \"The velocity is the same on every point on the disk.\" Hmm, is that accurate? Well, velocity has both magnitude and direction. In rotational motion, the direction of velocity is tangent to the circular path at each point. So, the direction changes depending on where you are on the disk. Moreover, the magnitude of the velocity also changes with the distance from the axis. Points farther from the axis have to travel a larger circumference in the same time, so they have higher linear velocities. Therefore, velocity isn't the same on every point; both its magnitude and direction vary. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"The part closer to the axis has a longer period.\" The period is the time it takes for one complete rotation. Does the period change with the distance from the axis? In a solid disk rotating about a fixed axis, the period is the same for all points on the disk. That's because all parts of the disk complete one full rotation in the same time. So, the period doesn't depend on the distance from the axis. Therefore, option B is not correct.\n\nOption C: \"The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.\" As I just thought about in option B, yes, this makes sense. Regardless of how far a point is from the axis, it takes the same time to complete one rotation. So, this seems to be true.\n\nOption D: \"The part closer to the axis has a shorter period.\" But wait, this contradicts what I just thought about. If the period is the same everywhere on the disk, then the part closer to the axis doesn't have a shorter period; it's the same as everywhere else.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about this again. Let me consider the definition of period in rotational motion. The period is the time for one complete rotation. For a solid disk rotating about a fixed axis, all points on the disk complete one rotation in the same time, regardless of their distance from the axis. So, the period is constant for all points on the disk.\n\nBut let's think about angular velocity and linear velocity. Angular velocity (\u03c9) is the same for all points on the disk, measured in radians per second. Linear velocity (v), however, is given by v = r\u03c9, where r is the distance from the axis. So, linear velocity increases with distance from the axis.\n\nPeriod (T) is related to angular velocity by T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9. Since \u03c9 is the same for all points, T is also the same for all points.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA. Velocity is the same on every point on the disk. - This is false because both the magnitude and direction of velocity vary.\n\nB. The part closer to the axis has a longer period. - This is false because the period is the same everywhere on the disk.\n\nC. The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk. - This seems true based on the relationship T = 2\u03c0/\u03c9, and \u03c9 is constant for all points.\n\nD. The part closer to the axis has a shorter period. - This is false for the same reason as option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider if there's any exception or special case where this might not hold. For a solid disk rotating about a fixed axis, the period is indeed the same for all points. Even at the axis, where the linear velocity is zero, the period is still the same. So, yes, C is the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
