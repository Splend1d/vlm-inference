                    "text": "So Ms. Carter has 30 students in her classroom, and she wants to arrange them into 5 equal groups. We need to find out which expression represents how to find the number of students in each group. The options are:\n\nA. 30 + 5\n\nB. 30 \u00f7 5\n\nC. 30 - 5\n\nD. 30 \u00d7 5\n\nHmm, let's think about this. She has 30 students and she wants to divide them into 5 equal groups. So, we need to split 30 students into 5 groups where each group has the same number of students.\n\nAdding 5 to 30 would just give us 35, which doesn't make sense in this context because we're not increasing the number of students; we're just dividing them into groups.\n\nSubtracting 5 from 30 gives us 25, which also doesn't help us find out how many students are in each group.\n\nMultiplying 30 by 5 gives us 150, which is way more than the number of students we have.\n\nSo, none of those seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, dividing 30 by 5 might make sense. If we have 30 students and we divide them into 5 equal groups, each group should have 30 divided by 5 students.\n\nLet me do the math: 30 divided by 5 equals 6. So, each group would have 6 students.\n\nThat seems logical. Let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nIf we add 5 to 30, that's just increasing the total number of students, which isn't what we're trying to do.\n\nIf we subtract 5 from 30, that would be removing 5 students, but again, that doesn't help us divide the students into groups.\n\nMultiplying 30 by 5 would be like having 5 sets of 30 students, which is not the case here.\n\nSo, really, the only operation that makes sense in this scenario is division. We need to divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find out how many students are in each group.\n\nTherefore, the expression that represents this situation is 30 divided by 5, which is option B.\n\nLet me just double-check. If we have 30 students and we divide them into 5 equal groups, each group should have 6 students. So, 30 \u00f7 5 = 6.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 30 \u00f7 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
