                    "text": "So I've got this problem about planets X, Y, and Z orbiting the sun with different periods: 360, 450, and 540 days, respectively. The question is asking for the minimum number of days before all three planets return to the same positions relative to the sun again. The options are 360, 5400, 900, and 1200 days.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. The planets are initially lined up in a straight line with the sun, and I need to find out after how many days they'll all be in the exact same positions again.\n\nI think this has to do with finding some kind of common multiple of their orbital periods. Maybe the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods would give me the answer, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me recall what LCM is. The LCM of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them without any remainder.\n\nSo, if I find the LCM of 360, 450, and 540, that might give me the number of days after which all three planets have completed whole numbers of orbits and are back in the same positions.\n\nBut wait, I should make sure that this makes sense in the context of the problem. The planets are moving at different speeds because their periods are different. So, their positions repeat in cycles that are multiples of their individual periods. The smallest time when all these cycles align should indeed be the LCM of their periods.\n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of angular velocity or something like that, but I think for this problem, LCM is the straightforward method.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the LCM of 360, 450, and 540.\n\nFirst, I should factor each number into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with 360:\n\n360 \u00f7 2 = 180\n\n180 \u00f7 2 = 90\n\n90 \u00f7 2 = 45\n\n45 \u00f7 3 = 15\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, 360 = 2^3 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5^1\n\nNext, 450:\n\n450 \u00f7 2 = 225\n\n225 \u00f7 3 = 75\n\n75 \u00f7 3 = 25\n\n25 \u00f7 5 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, 450 = 2^1 \u00d7 3^2 \u00d7 5^2\n\nNow, 540:\n\n540 \u00f7 2 = 270\n\n270 \u00f7 2 = 135\n\n135 \u00f7 3 = 45\n\n45 \u00f7 3 = 15\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n5 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nSo, 540 = 2^2 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 5^1\n\nTo find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations.\n\nFor prime number 2, the highest power is 2^3 (from 360).\n\nFor prime number 3, the highest power is 3^3 (from 540).\n\nFor prime number 5, the highest power is 5^2 (from 450).\n\nSo, LCM = 2^3 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 5^2\n\nNow, calculating that:\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n5^2 = 25\n\nNow, 8 \u00d7 27 = 216\n\n216 \u00d7 25 = 5400\n\nSo, the LCM is 5400 days.\n\nLooking back at the options, 5400 is one of the choices. But let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIs there a possibility that a smaller number of days could satisfy the condition?\n\nWell, if I consider that 5400 days is the smallest number that is a multiple of 360, 450, and 540, then yes, it should be the smallest such number.\n\nLet me verify by checking if 5400 is divisible by each of the periods:\n\n5400 \u00f7 360 = 15\n\n5400 \u00f7 450 = 12\n\n5400 \u00f7 540 = 10\n\nAll of these are integers, so yes, 5400 is a common multiple.\n\nIs there a smaller common multiple? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I take 900 days, which is another option.\n\n900 \u00f7 360 = 2.5 (not an integer)\n\nSo, after 900 days, planet X would not have completed a whole number of orbits. Therefore, 900 days is not a valid option.\n\nSimilarly, 360 days:\n\n360 \u00f7 360 = 1\n\n360 \u00f7 450 = 0.8 (not an integer)\n\n360 \u00f7 540 = 0.666... (not an integer)\n\nSo, 360 days is not a common multiple.\n\n1200 days:\n\n1200 \u00f7 360 = 3.333... (not an integer)\n\n1200 \u00f7 450 = 2.666... (not an integer)\n\n1200 \u00f7 540 = 2.222... (not an integer)\n\nSo, 1200 days is also not a common multiple.\n\nTherefore, the only valid option among the choices is 5400 days.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"the minimum positive number of days.\" Is there a possibility that the answer is not among the options?\n\nLooking back, the options are 360, 5400, 900, and 1200 days. Since 5400 is one of the options and it matches the LCM calculation, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a different way to interpret the problem. Maybe the planets aligning means something else, like being in the same relative positions in their orbits, not necessarily having completed whole numbers of orbits.\n\nBut in orbital mechanics, for the planets to be in the same positions relative to the sun again, they need to have completed integer numbers of orbits since their initial alignment.\n\nTherefore, I believe the LCM approach is correct, and the answer should be 5400 days.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5400} \\]"
