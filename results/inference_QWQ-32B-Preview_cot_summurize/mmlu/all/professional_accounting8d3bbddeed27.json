The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(A, M)}{\\text{Var}(M)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(\\text{Cov}(A, M)\\) is the covariance between Stock A and the market index.\n\n- \\(\\text{Var}(M)\\) is the variance of the market index.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(\\text{Cov}(A, M) = 88\\)\n\n- Standard deviation of Stock A = 19%\n\n- Standard deviation of the market index = 14%\n\nFirst, we need to find the variance of the market index. Variance is the square of the standard deviation.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(M) = (\\text{standard deviation of market})^2 = (14\\%)^2 = 0.14^2 = 0.0196\n\\]\n\nNow, plug the covariance and the variance into the beta formula:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{88}{0.0196}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. The covariance is given as 88, but standard deviations are given in percentages (19% and 14%). There might be a units issue here. Covariance is typically measured in the units of the two variables multiplied together. If the returns are in percentages, then the covariance should be in squared percentages.\n\nLet's assume that the covariance is 88 (in percentage points squared), and the standard deviations are 19% and 14%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the covariance is 0.88, if the returns are in decimals.\n\nI need to clarify the units.\n\nLet's consider that the standard deviations are 19% and 14%, which are 0.19 and 0.14 in decimal form.\n\nIf the covariance is 88, that seems unusually high compared to the variances.\n\nLet's calculate the variance of Stock A and the market:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(A) = (0.19)^2 = 0.0361\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(M) = (0.14)^2 = 0.0196\n\\]\n\nNow, the covariance is given as 88, which seems inconsistent because covariance should be in the same units as the variances, which are squared percentages or squared decimals.\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nLet's assume that the covariance is 0.88 (which is 88 in percentage points squared).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{0.88}{0.0196} \\approx 44.89\n\\]\n\nThat seems too high, as betas are usually around 0 to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the covariance is 0.088.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{0.088}{0.0196} \\approx 4.49\n\\]\n\nStill high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the covariance is 0.0088.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{0.0088}{0.0196} \\approx 0.4489\n\\]\n\nThat's closer to the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.24\n\nB. 0.35\n\nC. 0.245\n\nD. 0.45\n\n0.4489 is approximately 0.45, which is option D.\n\nBut to confirm, let's check the calculation again.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cov}(A, M) = 88 \\quad \\text{(units unclear)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard deviation of A} = 19\\% = 0.19\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Standard deviation of M} = 14\\% = 0.14\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Var}(M) = (0.14)^2 = 0.0196\n\\]\n\nIf covariance is 0.088, then:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{0.088}{0.0196} \\approx 4.49\n\\]\n\nThat's too high.\n\nIf covariance is 0.0088:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{0.0088}{0.0196} \\approx 0.4489 \\approx 0.45\n\\]\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the covariance is given in percentage points, so 88% or 0.88.\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{0.88}{0.0196} \\approx 44.89\n\\]\n\nThat's not reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe covariance is 0.88%.\n\nBut 0.88% is 0.0088, which gives beta = 0.45.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the beta of Stock A is approximately 0.45.\n\nSo, the answer is D. 0.45.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
