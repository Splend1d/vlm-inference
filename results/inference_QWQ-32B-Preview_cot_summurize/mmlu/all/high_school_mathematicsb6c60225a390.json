The options are (A) (x - 5)/3, (B) (x + 5)/3, (C) (x + 5)/6, and (D) (x - 5)/6.\n\nFirst, I need to find h(x). Since h(x) = f(g(x)), I'll plug g(x) into f(x).\n\nSo, f(g(x)) = f(2x - 3) = 3*(2x - 3) + 4 = 6x - 9 + 4 = 6x - 5.\n\nWait, no. 3*(2x - 3) is 6x - 9, and then adding 4 makes it 6x - 5. So h(x) = 6x - 5.\n\nNow, I need to find the inverse of h(x) = 6x - 5.\n\nTo find the inverse, I'll set h(x) = y, so y = 6x - 5.\n\nThen, solve for x in terms of y.\n\ny = 6x - 5\n\nAdd 5 to both sides: y + 5 = 6x\n\nDivide both sides by 6: (y + 5)/6 = x\n\nSo, the inverse function is x = (y + 5)/6.\n\nBut in function notation, it's h^{-1}(x) = (x + 5)/6.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option (C).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nStart with h(x) = 6x - 5.\n\nTo find inverse:\n\nSet y = 6x - 5.\n\nAdd 5 to both sides: y + 5 = 6x\n\nDivide by 6: (y + 5)/6 = x\n\nSo, h^{-1}(x) = (x + 5)/6\n\nYes, that's option (C).\n\nBut the other options are similar, so maybe there's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should verify by composing h with its inverse and seeing if I get x.\n\nSo, h(h^{-1}(x)) should equal x.\n\nLet's check with h^{-1}(x) = (x + 5)/6\n\nh(h^{-1}(x)) = h((x + 5)/6) = 6*((x + 5)/6) - 5 = (6(x + 5)/6) - 5 = (x + 5) - 5 = x\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose option (B), (x + 5)/3\n\nh(h^{-1}(x)) = h((x + 5)/3) = 6*((x + 5)/3) - 5 = 2(x + 5) - 5 = 2x + 10 - 5 = 2x + 5, which is not equal to x.\n\nSo, that's not the inverse.\n\nOption (A) is (x - 5)/3\n\nh(h^{-1}(x)) = h((x - 5)/3) = 6*((x - 5)/3) - 5 = 2(x - 5) - 5 = 2x - 10 - 5 = 2x - 15, not x.\n\nOption (D) is (x - 5)/6\n\nh(h^{-1}(x)) = h((x - 5)/6) = 6*((x - 5)/6) - 5 = (x - 5) - 5 = x - 10, not x.\n\nSo, only option (C) gives us x when composed with h.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (C): (x + 5)/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{x + 5}{6}} \\]"
