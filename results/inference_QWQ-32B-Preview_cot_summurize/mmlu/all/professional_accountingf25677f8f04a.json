                    "text": "To determine which of Swift's operating segments require separate disclosure in its December 31, year 2 financial statements, we need to apply the criteria for segment reporting as per the applicable accounting standards, such as those outlined in ASC 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" in the United States.\n\nAccording to ASC 280, a segment is required to be reported separately if it meets any of the following quantitative thresholds:\n\n1. Its reported revenue is 10% or more of the combined revenue of all segments.\n\n2. Its reported profit or loss is 10% or more of the greater, in absolute value, of (a) the combined reported profit of all segments that did not report a loss or (b) the combined reported loss of all segments that reported a loss.\n\n3. Its assets are 10% or more of the combined assets of all segments.\n\nAdditionally, if a segment does not meet any of these thresholds but management believes that disclosure of that segment is necessary to make the financial statements not misleading, it may still be disclosed.\n\nGiven the data provided:\n\n- Segment A: Revenue $42,000; Profit $12,000; Assets $470,000\n\n- Segment B: Revenue $121,000; Profit $65,000; Assets $800,000\n\n- Segment C: Revenue $14,000; Loss $(3,000); Assets $80,000\n\n- Total: Revenue $177,000; Profit $74,000; Assets $1,350,000\n\nLet's evaluate each segment against the thresholds:\n\n**1. Revenue Threshold (10% of total revenue):**\n\n10% of total revenue = 0.10 * $177,000 = $17,700\n\n- Segment A: $42,000 > $17,700 \u2192 Meets threshold\n\n- Segment B: $121,000 > $17,700 \u2192 Meets threshold\n\n- Segment C: $14,000 < $17,700 \u2192 Does not meet threshold\n\n**2. Profit or Loss Threshold (10% of greater of combined profit or combined loss):**\n\nFirst, identify combined profit and combined loss:\n\n- Combined profit: Segment A ($12,000) + Segment B ($65,000) = $77,000\n\n- Combined loss: Segment C ($3,000)\n\nGreater of combined profit or combined loss in absolute value: $77,000\n\n10% of $77,000 = $7,700\n\n- Segment A: $12,000 > $7,700 \u2192 Meets threshold\n\n- Segment B: $65,000 > $7,700 \u2192 Meets threshold\n\n- Segment C: $(3,000) < $7,700 \u2192 Does not meet threshold\n\n**3. Assets Threshold (10% of total assets):**\n\n10% of total assets = 0.10 * $1,350,000 = $135,000\n\n- Segment A: $470,000 > $135,000 \u2192 Meets threshold\n\n- Segment B: $800,000 > $135,000 \u2192 Meets threshold\n\n- Segment C: $80,000 < $135,000 \u2192 Does not meet threshold\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n- Segment A meets all three thresholds.\n\n- Segment B meets all three thresholds.\n\n- Segment C does not meet any of the thresholds.\n\nTherefore, only segments A and B are required to be separately disclosed in Swift's December 31, year 2 financial statements.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if the sum of the amounts not reported for segment C is material, or if management believes that disclosure of segment C is necessary to prevent the financial statements from being misleading, then segment C might also be disclosed. But based strictly on the quantitative thresholds provided, segments A and B meet the criteria for separate disclosure.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A and B only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
