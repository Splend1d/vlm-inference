                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out which option wasn't a deciding factor in the development of Mesopotamian civilization. So, I need to think about what actually drove the development of that civilization and see which of these options doesn't fit.\n\nFirst, I know that Mesopotamia was located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and it's often called the cradle of civilization. So, water and agriculture must have been really important. Irrigation was key for growing crops in that area because it could be quite arid otherwise. So, option D says \"the use of irrigation to produce enough food.\" That sounds like a big deciding factor to me. Without irrigation, they probably wouldn't have been able to support a large population.\n\nNow, option C mentions \"the need to develop a complex social system that would allow the construction of canals.\" Canals are part of irrigation systems, so that makes sense too. A complex social system would be necessary to organize labor and manage resources effectively. So, that seems like another important factor.\n\nOption B talks about \"the need to construct monumental works, such as step-pyramids and temples.\" I know that Mesopotamians built ziggurats, which are like step pyramids, and they had many temples. These were important for religious purposes and also for social and political reasons. So, constructing these monuments probably was a deciding factor in their civilization's development.\n\nNow, option A says \"the need to concentrate population away from arable lands near rivers.\" Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. If Mesopotamia had fertile lands near rivers, why would they want to move away from there? Rivers provided water for irrigation, transportation, and other necessities. It doesn't make much sense that they would choose to concentrate their population away from these valuable resources.\n\nIn fact, I recall that Mesopotamian cities were built near rivers, specifically along the Tigris and Euphrates. The fertile land around these rivers, especially the floodplains, were crucial for agriculture. So, concentrating population away from these areas would have been detrimental to their survival and development.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the one that was NOT a deciding factor in the development of Mesopotamian civilization. In fact, it seems like the opposite was true: they needed to concentrate population near arable lands near rivers to support their civilization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
