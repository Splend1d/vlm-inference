                    "text": "So I have this bond question here, and I need to find out the holding period return if I buy the bond at year 0 and sell it at the end of year 3. The bond has a five-year maturity, pays 8% coupons, and has a face value of $100. I bought it at 104.1 in year 0 and plan to sell it at 82 at the end of year 3. The hint says to accumulate all coupons and assumes that coupons are not reinvested. I need to find the holding period return on this investment. The options are 24%, 23%, -21%, or 2%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what holding period return (HPR) is. HPR is the total return earned from an investment over the period it is held. It includes both income (like coupons) and capital gains or losses.\n\nSo, in this case, I bought the bond for 104.1, received coupons for three years, and then sold it for 82. I need to calculate the total return from these cash flows.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Investment:**\n   - I bought the bond at 104.1.\n\n2. **Coupons Received:**\n   - The bond pays 8% coupons annually.\n   - So, each year, I receive 8% of the face value, which is 8% of 100 = 8 dollars.\n   - I hold the bond for three years, so I receive three coupons: 8, 8, and 8 dollars.\n\n3. **Sale of the Bond:**\n   - At the end of year 3, I sell the bond for 82.\n\nNow, to calculate the holding period return, I need to find the total return from these cash flows and then express it as a percentage of the initial investment.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cash inflows:\n\n- Coupons: 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 dollars\n- Sale proceeds: 82 dollars\n\nTotal cash inflows = 24 + 82 = 106 dollars\n\nInitial investment = 104.1 dollars\n\nSo, the total return = total cash inflows - initial investment = 106 - 104.1 = 1.9 dollars\n\nNow, holding period return (HPR) = (total return / initial investment) * 100%\n\nHPR = (1.9 / 104.1) * 100% \u2248 1.83% (rounded to two decimal places)\n\nWait a minute, but the options are 24%, 23%, -21%, or 2%. My calculation gives approximately 1.83%, which is close to 2%, but I should check if I've missed something.\n\nThe hint says to accumulate all coupons and assumes that coupons are not reinvested. Maybe I need to consider the time value of money for the coupons, but since coupons are not reinvested, perhaps they are to be treated as received at the end of the holding period.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf coupons are not reinvested, then each coupon is received at the end of each year and held separately. So, at the end of year 3, I have:\n\n- The first coupon received at the end of year 1 has been held for 2 years.\n- The second coupon received at the end of year 2 has been held for 1 year.\n- The third coupon received at the end of year 3 has been held for 0 years.\n\nBut since they are not reinvested, perhaps their value remains the same, and I just add them up at the end of year 3.\n\nSo, total cash inflows at the end of year 3:\n\n- First coupon: 8 dollars (held for 2 years, no reinvestment, so still 8 dollars)\n- Second coupon: 8 dollars (held for 1 year, no reinvestment, still 8 dollars)\n- Third coupon: 8 dollars (just received, so 8 dollars)\n- Sale proceeds: 82 dollars\n\nTotal = 8 + 8 + 8 + 82 = 106 dollars\n\nInitial investment: 104.1 dollars\n\nHPR = (106 - 104.1) / 104.1 * 100% = 1.9 / 104.1 * 100% \u2248 1.83%\n\nBut the closest option is 2%, so maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but the options also include 23% and 24%, which are much higher. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) for the cash flows.\n\nCash flows:\n\n- Year 0: -104.1 (initial investment)\n- Year 1: +8 (coupon)\n- Year 2: +8 (coupon)\n- Year 3: +8 (coupon) + 82 (sale proceeds) = 90 dollars\n\nSo, the cash flows are:\n\nCF0 = -104.1\n\nCF1 = 8\n\nCF2 = 8\n\nCF3 = 90\n\nNow, I need to find the rate of return (HPR) that satisfies:\n\n-104.1 + 8/(1+r)^1 + 8/(1+r)^2 + 90/(1+r)^3 = 0\n\nThis is the equation to solve for r.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated to solve manually, but perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options provided.\n\nLet's test option D, 2%.\n\nIf r = 2% or 0.02,\n\nThen,\n\n-104.1 + 8/(1.02)^1 + 8/(1.02)^2 + 90/(1.02)^3\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8 / 1.02 \u2248 7.843\n\n8 / 1.0404 \u2248 7.69\n\n90 / 1.061208 \u2248 84.79\n\nTotal: -104.1 + 7.843 + 7.69 + 84.79 \u2248 -104.1 + 100.323 \u2248 -3.777, which is not zero.\n\nSo, 2% is not the correct rate.\n\nLet's try option C, -21%.\n\nIf r = -21% or -0.21,\n\nThen,\n\n-104.1 + 8/(0.79)^1 + 8/(0.79)^2 + 90/(0.79)^3\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8 / 0.79 \u2248 10.127\n\n8 / 0.6241 \u2248 12.818\n\n90 / 0.493039 \u2248 182.54\n\nTotal: -104.1 + 10.127 + 12.818 + 182.54 \u2248 -104.1 + 205.485 \u2248 101.385, which is not zero.\n\nSo, -21% is not correct.\n\nLet's try option B, 23%.\n\nIf r = 23% or 0.23,\n\nThen,\n\n-104.1 + 8/(1.23)^1 + 8/(1.23)^2 + 90/(1.23)^3\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8 / 1.23 \u2248 6.504\n\n8 / 1.5129 \u2248 5.29\n\n90 / 1.860867 \u2248 48.36\n\nTotal: -104.1 + 6.504 + 5.29 + 48.36 \u2248 -104.1 + 60.154 \u2248 -43.946, which is not zero.\n\nNot correct.\n\nLet's try option A, 24%.\n\nIf r = 24% or 0.24,\n\nThen,\n\n-104.1 + 8/(1.24)^1 + 8/(1.24)^2 + 90/(1.24)^3\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8 / 1.24 \u2248 6.452\n\n8 / 1.5376 \u2248 5.198\n\n90 / 1.906624 \u2248 47.21\n\nTotal: -104.1 + 6.452 + 5.198 + 47.21 \u2248 -104.1 + 58.86 \u2248 -45.24, which is not zero.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to be working. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nLet me consider the simple HPR formula again.\n\nTotal cash inflows: 24 (coupons) + 82 (sale) = 106\n\nInitial investment: 104.1\n\nHPR = (106 - 104.1) / 104.1 = 1.9 / 104.1 \u2248 1.83%\n\nBut that's not among the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the time value of money for the coupons, even if they are not reinvested.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the total percentage return over the holding period, considering the capital loss and the coupons received.\n\nLet me calculate the total return in dollars: 106 - 104.1 = 1.9 dollars\n\nSo, a return of 1.9 dollars on an investment of 104.1 dollars is approximately 1.83%, which rounds to 2%.\n\nGiven that 2% is one of the options, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the bond's price.\n\nWait, the bond is bought at 104.1, which is above par, and sold at 82, which is below par. So, there's a capital loss.\n\nBut the coupons provide some income to offset that loss.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, the total return is indeed 1.9 dollars, which is a positive return, leading to approximately 2%.\n\nMaybe the other options are distractors, and 2% is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the total percentage return without considering the time value of money, just the total dollar return over the initial investment.\n\nIn that case, again, it's 1.9 / 104.1 \u2248 1.83%, which is closest to 2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect the total return in percentage terms over the holding period, considering the loss and the coupons.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me calculate the total return differently.\n\nTotal return = (coupons received + sale price - initial investment) / initial investment\n\nCoupons received: 8 * 3 = 24\n\nSale price: 82\n\nInitial investment: 104.1\n\nTotal return = (24 + 82 - 104.1) / 104.1 = (106 - 104.1) / 104.1 = 1.9 / 104.1 \u2248 1.83%\n\nAgain, approximately 2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the annualized HPR.\n\nTo find the annualized HPR, I can use the formula:\n\n(1 + HPR)^(1/n) - 1, where n is the holding period in years.\n\nBut in this case, HPR is approximately 1.83%, and n is 3 years.\n\nSo, annualized HPR = (1 + 0.0183)^(1/3) - 1 \u2248 (1.0183)^0.333 - 1 \u2248 1.0061 - 1 = 0.0061 or 0.61%, which is even smaller and not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps they want the total HPR over the three years, not the annualized return.\n\nIn that case, 1.83% over three years would be approximately 1.83% per year, but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expect the total return without considering the initial investment.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the total cash inflows.\n\nPurchase price: 104.1\n\nCoupons received: 8 * 3 = 24\n\nSale price: 82\n\nTotal cash inflows: 24 + 82 = 106\n\nTotal return: 106 - 104.1 = 1.9\n\nHPR: 1.9 / 104.1 \u2248 1.83%\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bond has semi-annual coupons, but the question says \"paying 8% coupons annually,\" so it's annual coupons.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the face value is different, but it's given as $100.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sale price is different, but it's given as 82.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the accrued interest, but the question seems to indicate that coupons are paid annually and I'm selling at the end of year 3, so no accrued interest should be due.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bond's price includes accrued interest, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the bond's yield to maturity, but that doesn't seem relevant for the holding period return.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the holding period return is calculated differently in finance.\n\nLet me look up the formula for holding period return.\n\nHPR = (income + capital gain) / initial investment\n\nIn this case:\n\nIncome = coupons received = 24\n\nCapital gain = sale price - purchase price = 82 - 104.1 = -22.1\n\nTotal HPR = (24 - 22.1) / 104.1 = 1.9 / 104.1 \u2248 1.83%\n\nAgain, approximately 2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they consider the capital gain as sale price - face value, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nNo, capital gain should be sale price - purchase price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect the total return to include the return of principal, but that's already considered in the sale price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 2%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the total percentage return differently.\n\nLet me try calculating it as:\n\n(total cash inflows / initial investment) - 1\n\nTotal cash inflows = 106\n\nInitial investment = 104.1\n\nSo, 106 / 104.1 - 1 \u2248 1.0183 - 1 = 0.0183 or 1.83%, which is still approximately 2%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect the holding period return to be calculated using the market price at the time of sale.\n\nBut I don't see how that would change the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the bond's price.\n\nWait, the bond is bought at 104.1, which is above par, indicating that the yield to maturity is less than the coupon rate.\n\nBut for the holding period return, that shouldn't matter, as we're only holding it for three years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the yield based on the bond's cash flows.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the internal rate of return (IRR) for the cash flows.\n\nCash flows:\n\nYear 0: -104.1\n\nYear 1: +8\n\nYear 2: +8\n\nYear 3: +8 + 82 = 90\n\nSo, I need to find r such that:\n\n-104.1 + 8/(1+r) + 8/(1+r)^2 + 90/(1+r)^3 = 0\n\nThis is a financial calculator problem or requires solving for r iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use trial and error with the given options.\n\nLet's try option A, 24%.\n\n-104.1 + 8/1.24 + 8/1.24^2 + 90/1.24^3 = -104.1 + 6.4516 + 5.2029 + 47.209 \u2248 -104.1 + 58.8635 \u2248 -45.2365, which is not zero.\n\nOption B, 23%.\n\n-104.1 + 8/1.23 + 8/1.23^2 + 90/1.23^3 = -104.1 + 6.504 + 5.2886 + 48.365 \u2248 -104.1 + 60.1576 \u2248 -43.9424, which is not zero.\n\nOption C, -21%.\n\n-104.1 + 8/0.79 + 8/0.79^2 + 90/0.79^3 = -104.1 + 10.1266 + 12.8177 + 182.543 \u2248 -104.1 + 205.4873 \u2248 101.3873, which is not zero.\n\nOption D, 2%.\n\n-104.1 + 8/1.02 + 8/1.02^2 + 90/1.02^3 = -104.1 + 7.8431 + 7.6893 + 84.788 \u2248 -104.1 + 99.3204 \u2248 -4.7796, which is not zero.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to be correct based on this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the holding period return is calculated differently in this context.\n\nLet me consider the total dollar return over the initial investment.\n\nTotal dollar return = total cash inflows - initial investment = 106 - 104."
