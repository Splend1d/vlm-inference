The question is: \"According to Sandel, eugenics and genetic enhancement can be seen to be wrong from a secular perspective because they would produce unwelcome changes in... A. humility. B. responsibility. C. solidarity. D. all of the above.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Sandel's arguments are regarding eugenics and genetic enhancement. Michael Sandel is a philosopher who has written about the ethics of biotechnology and genetic engineering. In his works, particularly in \"The Case Against Perfection,\" he raises several concerns about the moral implications of genetic enhancement.\n\nOne of his main points is that genetic enhancement could undermine certain moral values and social goods. He argues that allowing parents to select traits for their children could lead to a society where certain traits are valued over others, potentially leading to inequality and a loss of humility about the giftedness of life.\n\nSandel also discusses the concept of responsibility. He suggests that genetic enhancement might lead to a sense of entitlement or a belief that one's achievements are solely due to their enhanced abilities, rather than hard work and effort. This could diminish the value we place on personal responsibility and the recognition that our talents and abilities are not entirely our own doing.\n\nAdditionally, Sandel talks about solidarity. He worries that genetic enhancement could create divisions within society, where those who can afford enhancements have advantages over those who cannot, leading to a split between the enhanced and the non-enhanced. This could erode social cohesion and the sense of shared humanity.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that Sandel is concerned about changes in humility, responsibility, and solidarity as a result of eugenics and genetic enhancement. Therefore, the answer that includes all of these options, which is D. all of the above, would be the most comprehensive choice.\n\nHowever, to make sure, I should check if Sandel specifically mentions all three of these values in his discussions on genetic enhancement. I recall that he does talk about humility in the context of appreciating the unchosen aspects of life, and responsibility in terms of how genetic enhancement might affect our sense of agency and credit for our achievements. Solidarity is also a theme, as he worries about the social fractures that could result from genetic enhancements.\n\nTherefore, it appears that D. all of the above is the correct answer, as Sandel's concerns encompass changes in humility, responsibility, and solidarity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
