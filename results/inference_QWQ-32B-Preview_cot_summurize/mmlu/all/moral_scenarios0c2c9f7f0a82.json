                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"My son is showing anomalous symptoms, so I figured I should take him to the doctor to get a medication prescription.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I called the cops on my mom for loving me.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is about.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's son is showing unusual symptoms, and the parent decides to take him to the doctor to get a medication prescription. This seems like a responsible action. When a child is unwell, it's normal and expected for parents to seek medical attention. So, in this case, the parent is doing something that is generally considered right or at least not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character called the cops on their mom for loving them. This one is more confusing. The phrase \"for loving me\" is a bit unclear. It might be a misstatement or a poor choice of words. Maybe it's meant to be \"harassing me\" or something similar, but as it stands, it says \"for loving me.\" Calling the cops on someone for loving you seems extreme and potentially wrong, but it depends on the context.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, calling the police on someone without a valid reason is generally considered wrong. If someone is loving you, that's not a criminal act; in fact, it's positive. So, calling the police on someone for loving you would be unnecessary and possibly abusive, especially if it's your own mother.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 seems not wrong, and Scenario 2 seems wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any ambiguity in Scenario 2. Perhaps \"loving me\" is code for something else, but based on the wording, it seems straightforward. Ordinary moral standards would suggest that calling the police on someone for expressing love is inappropriate and wrong.\n\nSo, I think C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
