                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on with these flower colors. Let's see. There are two true breeding lines: one with dark blue flowers and another with bright white flowers. When they're crossed, the F1 offspring have light blue flowers. Then, when these F1 plants are selfed, the F2 generation shows a 1:2:1 ratio of dark blue to light blue to white flowers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these ratios are telling me. In genetics, Mendel's laws often give us ratios like 3:1 for a single gene with two alleles, or 9:3:3:1 for two genes with independent assortment. But here, we have a 1:2:1 ratio, which seems simpler, maybe involving one gene with three alleles or something else.\n\nWait, but Mendel's first law is about segregation, where alleles separate during gamete formation, and second law is about independent assortment of different genes. This seems like it might be related to just one gene, given the ratio.\n\nLet me consider the F1 generation having light blue flowers, which is intermediate between dark blue and white. That sounds like incomplete dominance, where neither allele is completely dominant over the other. So, if dark blue is one allele and white is another, their combination could give light blue.\n\nBut then, in the F2 generation, if we self the F1 plants, we'd expect a certain ratio. Let's think about it.\n\nIf we denote the dark blue allele as D and the white allele as W, and incomplete dominance means that heterozygotes (DW) have an intermediate phenotype, which is light blue.\n\nSo, F1 are all DW, light blue.\n\nWhen they self, each plant produces gametes with either D or W, 50% each.\n\nSo, the possible offspring are:\n\n- DD: dark blue\n\n- DW: light blue\n\n- WW: white\n\nIn a 1:2:1 ratio, which matches what was observed.\n\nSo, this seems consistent with incomplete dominance.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is epistasis, which is when one gene affects the expression of another gene. That seems unrelated to this situation, where we have one gene with two alleles showing incomplete dominance.\n\nOption C is codominance, which is different from incomplete dominance. In codominance, both alleles are expressed equally in the heterozygote. For example, in blood types, AB type shows both A and B antigens. Here, light blue isn't a combination of dark blue and white; it's intermediate, so incomplete dominance seems more appropriate.\n\nOption D is inbreeding depression, which is a reduction in fitness due to breeding between closely related individuals. That doesn't seem relevant to the flower color phenotypes here.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is B, incomplete dominance.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Is there any other way this could be explained?\n\nSuppose there are two genes involved, and they interact in some way to produce the colors. But the ratio is 1:2:1, which is suggestive of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is some sort of gene action where the expression of color is quantitative, depending on the number of \"dark\" alleles present.\n\nBut really, the simplest explanation is one gene with two alleles showing incomplete dominance, leading to the observed phenotypes and ratio.\n\nSo, I think B. incomplete dominance is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
