                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a law bookstore that signed a written contract to buy 100 copies of a casebook at $10 each from a publisher. Then, three days later, before the books were delivered, the publisher calls the bookstore owner and says there was a calculation error and the price should be $11 per book, not $10. The publisher says they won't deliver the books unless the owner agrees to pay $11 per book. The owner reluctantly agrees.\n\nThe question is asking about the enforceability of the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book. There are four options:\n\nA. Enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.\n\nB. Enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nC. Unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nD. Unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. There's an existing written contract for 100 books at $10 each. Then, the publisher claims there was a calculation error and wants to increase the price to $11 per book, threatening not to deliver otherwise. The owner agrees to pay $11 per book.\n\nI need to think about whether this agreement to pay $11 is enforceable or not.\n\nOption A says it's enforceable because it wasn't supported by any new consideration. Hmm, that sounds a bit counterintuitive. In contract law, generally, a new promise needs consideration to be enforceable. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties. If there's no new consideration, the promise might not be enforceable. So, if the owner agrees to pay $11 without receiving anything extra in return, it might lack consideration. But option A says it's enforceable despite lacking new consideration. That seems odd.\n\nOption B mentions promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel is a doctrine that allows enforcement of a promise even without consideration, if the promisee relied on the promise to their detriment. But in this case, the publisher is the one making a new promise (or demanding a new term), and the owner is agreeing to it. It's not clear if promissory estoppel applies here.\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable because it violates the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, especially contracts that can't be performed within one year or involve the transfer of interest in land. Here, the original contract is in writing, but the modification to the price might need to satisfy the statute of frauds as well.\n\nOption D says it's unenforceable because the error was the publisher's computational error. This suggests that since the error was the publisher's mistake, they shouldn't be allowed to enforce the higher price.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles involved.\n\nFirst, the original contract is in writing for the sale of 100 books at $10 each.\n\nThen, the publisher wants to modify the contract to increase the price to $11 per book due to a calculation error.\n\nIn contract law, modifications to existing contracts generally need consideration to be enforceable. Consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties.\n\nIn this case, if the owner agrees to pay $11 per book without getting anything extra in return, it might lack consideration.\n\nHowever, there's a doctrine called \"pre-existing duty rule,\" which states that if one party agrees to do something they're already obligated to do under the existing contract, without getting anything extra in return, there's no consideration for a new promise.\n\nHere, the publisher is already obligated to deliver the books for $10 each. If they demand $11 instead, and the owner agrees to pay $11 without getting anything extra, it might be argued that the owner isn't getting any additional value for the extra $1 per book.\n\nBut, there's also the concept that a modification doesn't need additional consideration if it's made to correct a mutual mistake or a unilateral mistake of the other party (the publisher, in this case).\n\nIn this scenario, the publisher claims there was a calculation error, implying that the original price of $10 was a mistake and $11 is the correct price.\n\nUnder contract law, if a mistake affects a material term of the contract, like price, and both parties were mistaken, the contract might be voidable or subject to reformation.\n\nHowever, here, it seems only the publisher made a computational error, not necessarily a mutual mistake.\n\nIn cases where only one party is mistaken, the contract is generally enforceable as written, unless the other party knew or had reason to know of the mistake.\n\nIn this case, the bookstore owner didn't know about the publisher's computational error initially, but then the publisher informs them of the error and requests the price increase.\n\nNow, the owner reluctantly agrees to pay $11 per book.\n\nIs this agreement enforceable?\n\nOne perspective is that since the original contract was in writing, and the modification to increase the price is being made orally (over the phone), it might not satisfy the statute of frauds, which typically requires modifications of certain contracts to be in writing.\n\nThe statute of frauds generally applies to contracts that, by their terms, cannot be performed within one year, involve the transfer of interest in land, or involve the sale of goods above a certain value, among other things.\n\nIn this case, the sale of 100 books at $11 each would likely be governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), specifically Article 2, which deals with the sale of goods.\n\nUnder the UCC, a written contract for the sale of goods above a certain value (typically $500) must be in writing to be enforceable.\n\nHere, the original contract was in writing for $10 per book, totaling $1,000, which is above the threshold.\n\nIf the parties agree to modify the contract to increase the price to $11 per book, totaling $1,100, the modification would also need to be in writing under the statute of frauds, unless it falls under an exception.\n\nOne exception is if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in court that the modification was made.\n\nAnother exception is if the modification is supported by additional consideration.\n\nBut in this case, it's not clear that there's additional consideration for the price increase.\n\nAlternatively, under UCC \u00a7 2-209, dealing with modifications and replacements of contracts, it provides that a modification can be enforceable even without new consideration if it's made in good faith and the other party assents.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, the modification is being made due to the publisher's computational error, which might affect the good faith aspect.\n\nMoreover, the owner is reluctantly agreeing, which might not constitute voluntary assent.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A says the agreement is enforceable because it was not supported by any new consideration. This seems contradictory because lack of consideration typically makes a modification unenforceable, not enforceable.\n\nOption B suggests it's enforceable under promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel can sometimes be used to enforce a promise without consideration if the promisee relied on the promise to their detriment. However, in this case, it's not clear that the owner relied on the publisher's request for a price increase to their detriment. Promissory estoppel might not apply here.\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable because it violates the statute of frauds. Given that the modification is not in writing, and the original contract is for goods above $500, this could be a valid reason for the modification being unenforceable.\n\nOption D says it's unenforceable because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error. This suggests that since the error was the publisher's mistake, they shouldn't be allowed to enforce the higher price. This has some intuitive appeal, but legally, it's not entirely clear-cut.\n\nConsidering the principles of contract law and the UCC, I think option C is the most accurate.\n\nThe modification to increase the price to $11 per book was not made in writing, and thus likely violates the statute of frauds, making it unenforceable.\n\nThe fact that the publisher made a computational error doesn't necessarily make the modification enforceable; instead, it might be seen as a reason why the modification shouldn't be enforced.\n\nTherefore, the owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is unenforceable because it violates the statute of frauds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
