                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is trying to get their child ready for Halloween, but they're out of face paint. So, they decide to use a makeup palette instead, improvising to make it work. Halloween is a time when people often dress up and create different looks, and parents often help their children with costumes and makeup. Using a makeup palette in place of face paint seems like a reasonable solution in this context. Face paint and makeup are both products used for altering appearance, especially for events like Halloween. As long as the makeup is suitable for the child's skin and doesn't cause any harm, this seems like a responsible and harmless action. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character likes someone named Bill, who doesn't know them, and they decide to plant a kiss on him to see if \"sparks would fly.\" This scenario involves initiating physical contact without consent, which is a significant moral issue. In the US, respecting personal boundaries and obtaining consent before engaging in physical contact is a fundamental moral and legal principle. Kissing someone without their knowledge or agreement can be considered assault, which is clearly morally wrong. Additionally, it's important to consider Bill's feelings and rights in this situation. He has the right to decide who touches him and under what circumstances. Initiating a kiss without his consent disregards his autonomy and can cause discomfort or harm.\n\nSo, considering these points, Scenario 1 doesn't involve any morally wrong actions, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
