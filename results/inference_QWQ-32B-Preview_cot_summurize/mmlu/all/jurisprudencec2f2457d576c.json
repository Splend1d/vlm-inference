                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out the main difference between Hobbes and Locke's positions, and I've got these four options. Let's see.\n\nOption A says they have different attitudes towards the role of courts in maintaining order. Hmm, both Hobbes and Locke talk about the role of government and courts, but I think their differences run deeper than just the courts' role.\n\nOption B says they disagree about the role of law in society. That seems pretty broad. Both believe in the importance of law, but maybe they have different ideas about where law comes from or what its purpose is.\n\nOption C mentions opposing views on the nature of contractual obligations. Now, both Hobbes and Locke are social contract theorists, so they both believe in some form of contractual obligations. But perhaps they differ on what those obligations entail or how the contract is formed.\n\nOption D says they differ in their account of life before the social contract. That sounds interesting. I recall that Hobbes had a pretty bleak view of life before society, describing it as \"nasty, brutish, and short,\" while Locke thought it was more manageable.\n\nLet me think about this. The social contract is central to both philosophers' thoughts, so perhaps their differences in how they view the state of nature, which is life before the social contract, is key.\n\nHobbes believed that in the state of nature, life was competitive and dangerous, leading people to desire a strong central authority to impose order. Locke, on the other hand, thought that in the state of nature, people could live peacefully based on natural law, but they still agreed to form governments to protect their rights more effectively.\n\nSo, their views on the state of nature influence their ideas about why and how people enter into social contracts. Hobbes wants a sovereign with extensive powers to prevent chaos, while Locke favors a government with limited powers that protects individual rights.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to capture this principal difference\u2014that they have different accounts of life before the social contract, which leads to different conclusions about the kind of government that should be established.\n\nOptions A and B seem too narrow, focusing on specific aspects like courts or law, without capturing the broader difference in their philosophies. Option C might be partially true, but I think the root of their differences lies more in their views of the state of nature.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
