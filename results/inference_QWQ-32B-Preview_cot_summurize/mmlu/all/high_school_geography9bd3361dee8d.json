It says \"the construction of freeways leads to all but which of the following results?\" and then gives options A through D. So, I need to identify which one of these is not a result of building freeways.\n\nOption A is \"Urban sprawl.\" I know that freeways can contribute to urban sprawl because they make it easier for people to commute longer distances, so they might choose to live farther out from the city center. That seems like a likely result.\n\nOption B is \"Traffic increase.\" Building freeways can initially reduce traffic by providing more capacity, but often, induced demand comes into play, meaning that more people choose to drive because it's easier, which can lead to increased traffic in the long run. So, traffic increase is also a possible result.\n\nOption C is \"Traffic congestion.\" This seems contradictory to building freeways, which are supposed to alleviate congestion. However, as I thought about traffic increase, induced demand might lead back to congestion over time. So, perhaps this is also a result.\n\nOption D is \"Decreased dependency on cars.\" Hmm, this seems opposite to what I would expect. If you build more freeways, people might rely more on their cars rather than less. So, decreased dependency on cars doesn't seem like a likely result of building freeways.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe in some cases, improved public transportation could be developed alongside freeways, which might reduce car dependency. Is that possible? Maybe, but generally, building freeways is more about accommodating cars than promoting alternative modes of transportation.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is asking for \"all but which of the following results?\" meaning that three of these are results of building freeways, and one is not. From my analysis, A, B, and C seem like likely results, while D seems unlikely.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is D, decreased dependency on cars, because building freeways typically leads to increased car use and dependency, not decreased.\n\nBut I should double-check. Is there any scenario where building a freeway could decrease dependency on cars? Maybe if it leads to better public transportation options, but that's not directly related to the freeway itself.\n\nOverall, it seems that building freeways leads to urban sprawl, increased traffic, and potentially traffic congestion again due to induced demand, but it doesn't lead to decreased dependency on cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
