                    "text": "Let's see, I have this question about Teotihuac\u00e1n and I need to compare it to the urban centers of the Indus Valley. The options are:\n\nA. equipped with sophisticated plumbing and cooling systems.\n\nB. subject to constant outbreaks of plague and disease.\n\nC. surrounded by an enormous agricultural hinterland.\n\nD. planned and built on a grid pattern.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about both Teotihuac\u00e1n and the Indus Valley cities.\n\nTeotihuac\u00e1n was a massive pre-Columbian city in Mesoamerica, located in what is now the State of Mexico, near modern-day Mexico City. It's known for its pyramids, like the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, and its grid-like street layout.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization was located in the northwestern regions of South Asia, primarily in modern-day Pakistan and parts of India. Cities like Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were prominent, known for their grid-based city planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and brick buildings.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\nOption A: Sophisticated plumbing and cooling systems.\n\nI know that the Indus Valley cities had remarkable drainage systems, with narrow channels running along the streets, and even some buildings had private baths and toilets connected to the sewage system. As for cooling systems, I'm not sure if they had specific cooling technologies, but their urban planning might have included features to manage heat.\n\nFor Teotihuac\u00e1n, I recall that they had a system of tunnels and caves underneath the city, but I don't know if those were for plumbing or cooling. Maybe they served different purposes, like ritual spaces or storage.\n\nOption B: Subject to constant outbreaks of plague and disease.\n\nThis seems unlikely for both civilizations if they had proper urban planning and sanitation. The Indus Valley cities, with their drainage systems, were designed to minimize health hazards. Teotihuac\u00e1n also seemed to be well-planned, but I don't have specific information about disease outbreaks in either city.\n\nOption C: Surrounded by an enormous agricultural hinterland.\n\nBoth civilizations would have needed extensive agricultural support to sustain their large populations. The Indus Valley had fertile lands due to the rivers, and Teotihuac\u00e1n likely relied on the surrounding valleys for agriculture. So, this could be a common feature.\n\nOption D: Planned and built on a grid pattern.\n\nThis seems to be a key similarity. Both Teotihuac\u00e1n and the Indus Valley cities are famous for their grid-based city planning. In Teotihuac\u00e1n, the streets were laid out in a grid, with the Avenue of the Dead as the main axis. Similarly, cities like Mohenjo-Daro had a grid layout with blocks of buildings.\n\nGiven that, option D seems like the most accurate comparison between Teotihuac\u00e1n and the urban centers of the Indus Valley.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\n- Option A: While both had some plumbing features, Teotihuac\u00e1n might not have been as advanced in this area as the Indus Valley cities.\n\n- Option B: There's no specific evidence I know of for constant disease outbreaks in either city.\n\n- Option C: Both likely had agricultural hinterlands, but the question seems to be about the urban centers themselves.\n\n- Option D: Grid pattern planning is a prominent feature of both.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Planned and built on a grid pattern.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
