                    "text": "Let's see... Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson have both recorded duets with which former Beatle? Hmm, options are Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.\n\nFirst, I know that Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney have worked together on some songs. In fact, they co-wrote \"Say Say Say,\" which was a duet between them. That was a big hit back in 1983. So, Paul McCartney is a strong candidate here.\n\nNow, about Stevie Wonder. I think he has also worked with Paul McCartney. I recall that they did a duet called \"Ebony and Ivory\" in 1982, which was another huge success. So, both Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder have recorded duets with Paul McCartney.\n\nLet me double-check the other options just to be sure. John Lennon, of course, was another Beatle, but I don't recall him recording duets with either Stevie Wonder or Michael Jackson. Lennon passed away in 1980, and while he did collaborate with some artists, I don't think he worked with them on duets.\n\nGeorge Harrison is another ex-Beatle. He did collaborate with various artists, but I don't remember any duets with Michael Jackson or Stevie Wonder. Although, George Harrison organized the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, which featured many musicians, but that's not a duet recording.\n\nRingo Starr, the fourth Beatle, has also collaborated with several artists. I know he worked with Dave Grohl on \"Hit Me Again\" and other songs, but I don't think he recorded duets with Michael Jackson or Stevie Wonder.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that Paul McCartney is the former Beatle who recorded duets with both Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
