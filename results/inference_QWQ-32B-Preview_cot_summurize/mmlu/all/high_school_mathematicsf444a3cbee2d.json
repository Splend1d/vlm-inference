                    "text": "So, Mrs. Busywork gave the class a task to multiply 10 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) five times as a punishment. That sounds a bit tough, but I guess it's meant to teach them about exponents and fractions. John noticed that there might be a smarter way to do this by multiplying 10 by a single fraction and still getting the same result as doing it five times. He's onto something here.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means to multiply 10 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) five times. Basically, it's like applying the multiplication of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) repeatedly for five steps. So, starting with 10:\n\n1. First multiplication: \\(10 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}\\)\n\n2. Second multiplication: \\(\\frac{10}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{9}\\)\n\n3. Third multiplication: \\(\\frac{10}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{27}\\)\n\n4. Fourth multiplication: \\(\\frac{10}{27} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{81}\\)\n\n5. Fifth multiplication: \\(\\frac{10}{81} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{243}\\)\n\nSo, after five multiplications by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), the result is \\(\\frac{10}{243}\\).\n\nNow, John wants to find a single fraction that, when multiplied by 10, gives the same result as doing those five multiplications. Let's call this single fraction \\(x\\). So, we have:\n\n\\[10 \\times x = \\frac{10}{243}\\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 10:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{\\frac{10}{243}}{10} = \\frac{10}{243} \\times \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{1}{243}\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. So, the single fraction is \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\). But let's double-check this because sometimes these things can be tricky.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to realize that multiplying by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) five times is the same as multiplying by \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5\\). Because exponents represent repeated multiplication of the same number.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{3^5} = \\frac{1}{243}\\)\n\nTherefore, multiplying 10 by \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\) should give the same result as multiplying it by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) five times.\n\nLet's test this:\n\n\\[10 \\times \\frac{1}{243} = \\frac{10}{243}\\]\n\nAnd earlier, we saw that multiplying 10 by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) five times also gives \\(\\frac{10}{243}\\). So, yes, it checks out.\n\nTherefore, the single fraction John is looking for is \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{1}{27}\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{1}{68}\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\)\n\nThe correct answer is D. \\(\\frac{1}{243}\\).\n\nI think John has found a more efficient way to complete his punishment, assuming Mrs. Busywork allows such insights. It's always good to look for patterns and shortcuts in math, as it can save a lot of time and effort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
