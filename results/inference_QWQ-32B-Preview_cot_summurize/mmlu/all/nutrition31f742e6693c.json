                    "text": "I'm trying to understand how agricultural research can help reduce hunger and poverty. There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is the most accurate.\n\nOption A says that transnational private-sector firms are the main source of research oriented towards poor farmers and consumers. Hmm, I know that big companies often invest in research, but are they really focusing on the needs of poor farmers? I feel like their main goal is to make a profit, so maybe they're more focused on commercial farming.\n\nOption B states that agricultural research mainly benefits commercial farmers in developed countries. Well, that might be true to some extent, but I think research can have broader impacts. For example, developing new crop varieties that are resistant to diseases or adaptable to climate change could benefit farmers everywhere, not just in developed countries.\n\nOption C says that research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; therefore, public investment is needed to support it. This makes sense to me. Poor farmers often can't afford to invest in expensive technologies or research, so it's up to the public sector to fill that gap. Public goods are those that benefit society as a whole, and reducing hunger and poverty certainly falls into that category.\n\nOption D suggests that pro-poor research should only focus on organic farming. While organic farming has its benefits, like being more environmentally sustainable, it might not be the only solution for poor farmers. Some poor farmers might not have the resources to switch to organic farming, or maybe organic methods aren't suitable for their specific conditions. So, I think this option is too narrow.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most accurate. Agricultural research that targets the needs of poor farmers and consumers is important for reducing hunger and poverty, and since it's a public good with little profit potential, public investment is crucial to support it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
