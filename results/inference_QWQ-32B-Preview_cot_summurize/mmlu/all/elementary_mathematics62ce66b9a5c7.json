                    "text": "Let's look at the distance between Miriam's and Debbie's houses, which is 444.44 meters. We need to figure out which statement about the digits is true. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down the number and identify the place value of each digit:\n\n444.44\n\n- The first 4 from the left is in the hundreds place.\n- The second 4 is in the tens place.\n- The third 4 is in the ones place.\n- The fourth 4 is in the tenths place.\n- The fifth 4 is in the hundredths place.\n\nNow, let's recall the value of each place:\n\n- Hundreds place: 100\n- Tens place: 10\n- Ones place: 1\n- Tenths place: 1/10 or 0.1\n- Hundredths place: 1/100 or 0.01\n\nSo, the values of each 4 are:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 * 100 = 400\n- Tens place: 4 * 10 = 40\n- Ones place: 4 * 1 = 4\n- Tenths place: 4 * 0.1 = 0.4\n- Hundredths place: 4 * 0.01 = 0.04\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement one by one.\n\n**Option A: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the tens place.**\n\n- Value of 4 in tenths place: 0.4\n- Value of 4 in tens place: 40\n- Is 0.4 equal to 1/10 of 40?\n\nCalculate 1/10 of 40: 40 / 10 = 4\n\nBut 0.4 is not equal to 4. So, this statement is false.\n\n**Option B: The value of the 4 in the hundredths place is 1/10 the value of the 4 in the ones place.**\n\n- Value of 4 in hundredths place: 0.04\n- Value of 4 in ones place: 4\n- Is 0.04 equal to 1/10 of 4?\n\nCalculate 1/10 of 4: 4 / 10 = 0.4\n\nBut 0.04 is not equal to 0.4. So, this statement is false.\n\n**Option C: The value of the 4 in the hundreds place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the ones place.**\n\n- Value of 4 in hundreds place: 400\n- Value of 4 in ones place: 4\n- Is 400 equal to 10 times 4?\n\nCalculate 10 times 4: 10 * 4 = 40\n\nBut 400 is not equal to 40. So, this statement is false.\n\n**Option D: The value of the 4 in the tenths place is 10 times greater than the value of the 4 in the hundredths place.**\n\n- Value of 4 in tenths place: 0.4\n- Value of 4 in hundredths place: 0.04\n- Is 0.4 equal to 10 times 0.04?\n\nCalculate 10 times 0.04: 10 * 0.04 = 0.4\n\nYes, 0.4 is equal to 0.4. So, this statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
