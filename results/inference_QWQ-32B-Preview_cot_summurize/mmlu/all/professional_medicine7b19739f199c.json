                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 37-year-old guy who's been experiencing low back pain for three days. It started after he worked in his yard, and it's nonradiating, meaning it's not shooting down his legs or anything like that. He hasn't noticed any changes in his bowel or bladder function, which is good. He had a similar episode three years ago that went away on its own, which suggests maybe it's something recurrent.\n\nVital signs are all normal, which is reassuring. During the exam, the doctor found that he has bilateral paravertebral muscle spasms. That means the muscles alongside his spine are tight and maybe sore. His range of motion is limited because of pain, but the straight-leg raise test is negative. That test is often used to check for nerve compression in the spine, and since it's negative, that suggests maybe no nerve involvement at this point.\n\nSo, besides giving him some pain meds, which is option A, bed rest, B, regular activity, C, X-rays of the spine, or D, an MRI of the spine.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what's causing his back pain. Since it started after yard work, maybe he strained his back muscles or overdid it with lifting something heavy. The fact that it's bilateral muscle spasm suggests maybe he overused those muscles.\n\nHe's 37, and he had a similar episode three years ago that resolved on its own. So, maybe it's just acute musculoskeletal pain, which often resolves with time and conservative management.\n\nOption A is bed rest. Traditionally, people used to recommend bed rest for back pain, but nowadays, the thinking has changed. Prolonged bed rest can actually make back pain worse because it leads to deconditioning of the muscles and might not help the underlying issue. So, bed rest is generally not recommended for acute low back pain.\n\nOption B is regular activity. This seems more in line with current recommendations. Encouraging the patient to stay active within the limits of his pain can help maintain mobility and prevent deconditioning. It might even help resolve the muscle spasms faster.\n\nOption C is X-rays of the spine. X-rays can show bony structures, but for acute back pain without any red flags like trauma, neurological symptoms, or fever, X-rays aren't usually the first line. They might not show soft tissue injuries like muscle strains or herniated discs.\n\nOption D is an MRI of the spine. MRIs are very detailed and can show discs, nerves, and other soft tissues. But they're expensive and usually reserved for when there are red flags or if the pain persists despite initial treatment.\n\nIn this case, the patient doesn't have any red flags like bowel or bladder incontinence, severe trauma, or weight loss. His vital signs are normal. So, maybe we don't need to jump straight to imaging.\n\nGiven that, I think the most appropriate next step after analgesia would be option B, regular activity. Encourage him to stay active, maybe recommend some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and see if the pain resolves on its own, as it did before.\n\nMaybe also suggest some heat or ice therapy, depending on what he finds more comfortable. Perhaps some gentle stretching or physical therapy if the pain persists.\n\nBut for now, since it's only been three days and he has no concerning symptoms, regular activity seems like the way to go.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB. Regular activity"
