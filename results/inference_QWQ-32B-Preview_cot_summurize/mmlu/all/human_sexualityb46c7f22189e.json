                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question. So, a pimp is someone related to prostitution, right? Let me think about each option.\n\nOption A says, \"a male companion-master of a prostitute.\" Hmm, that sounds like the pimp is in control of the prostitute. I've heard that pimps often manage prostitutes and take a cut of their earnings. So, maybe A is correct.\n\nOption B says, \"a gigolo who works with a street walker.\" Wait, a gigolo is a male escort who provides companionship and sexual favors to women, usually for money. A street walker is a prostitute who solicits clients on the street. So, a gigolo might work with a street walker, but is that what a pimp is? I don't think so. Pimps are more about managing prostitutes, not necessarily working directly with them as gigolos do.\n\nOption C says, \"an experienced male prostitute.\" Well, a male prostitute is someone who sells sexual favors, but a pimp is different. A pimp isn't the one providing the services; they manage the prostitutes who do. So, C doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says, \"an escort to a female prostitute.\" An escort is someone who accompanies someone else, maybe to social events. But in the context of prostitution, an escort might have a different meaning. However, again, a pimp is more about managing prostitutes rather than just escorting them.\n\nConsidering all these, Option A seems the most accurate. A pimp is like a male companion-master of a prostitute, in the sense that they have control over the prostitute and manage their activities. So, I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
