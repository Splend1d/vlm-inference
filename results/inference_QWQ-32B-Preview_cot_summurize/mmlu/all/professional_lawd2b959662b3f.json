                    "text": "So here's this scenario: A buyer purchases a new home from a builder-seller, pays the full price, and moves in. But then they start having drainage and flooding issues, especially since the house is on a flood-prone slope. The city even cites them for not following code regulations. The buyer asks the seller to fix all the problems at their expense, but the seller says no. So, the buyer sues, saying the seller breached warranties on the house. The question is, will the court hold the seller liable for any warranties in favor of the buyer?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, the buyer had an obligation to make a full inspection and discover any defects prior to paying the full price and taking occupancy.\n\nB. No, the law regarding a building purchase is based on the premise \"Let the buyer beware.\"\n\nC. Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\nD. Yes, the seller has strict liability to the buyer for any defects that arise within one year of the sale.\n\nFirst, options A and B seem similar; they both suggest that the buyer should have inspected the property and are responsible for any defects they didn't find. \"Caveat emptor\" is the principle that \"let the buyer beware,\" meaning the buyer is responsible for checking the quality and suitability of the item before purchasing.\n\nOn the other hand, options C and D suggest that the seller does have warranties or liabilities for defects in the home.\n\nIn general, when it comes to new homes, there are implied warranties that the home is built in a workmanlike manner and conforms to specifications. These warranties are typically part of the sales contract and can also be mandated by state laws.\n\nIn this case, since it's a newly built home, it's likely that there are warranties from the builder-seller regarding the quality of construction. Drainage and flooding issues, especially on a slope, could be signs of poor construction or design flaws.\n\nThe fact that the city issued citations for not following code regulations suggests that there are indeed defects or violations in the construction that the seller may be responsible for.\n\nOption A suggests that the buyer should have inspected and found these defects before taking occupancy. However, some issues might not be apparent during a pre-purchase inspection, especially if they only become evident after certain conditions, like heavy rain, occur.\n\nOption C aligns with the idea that builder-sellers have warranties for new constructions, ensuring that the home is built properly.\n\nOption D mentions strict liability for defects within one year of sale, which could be plausible, but the time frame might vary depending on local laws.\n\nGiven that it's a newly built home and there are specific issues related to construction and code compliance, it seems likely that the seller has warranties to uphold.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, there are specific laws protecting buyers of new homes, requiring builders to stand behind their work for a certain period.\n\nTherefore, between options C and D, C seems more directly related to the quality of construction.\n\nOption D's mention of strict liability within one year might be too broad, as not all defects would necessarily be covered strictly within that period, and the liability might extend beyond one year for certain structural issues.\n\nAdditionally, the buyer asked the seller to repair all defects at their expense, and the seller refused. This refusal could be a breach of warranty if the seller did indeed make warranties about the home's construction.\n\nIn conclusion, it's probable that the court would hold the seller liable for warranties in favor of the buyer, especially regarding the proper construction of the home.\n\nSo, the answer is likely C: Yes, every builder-seller warrants that a newly constructed home is built in a good and workmanlike manner.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
