Smiling at someone is generally considered a polite and friendly gesture. It's a common social behavior that doesn't typically cause harm or offense. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I undressed, showered, toweled myself dry, dressed, and walked out my door and down the middle of Main Street.\"\n\nThis scenario describes the main character performing a series of actions that lead to walking down the middle of Main Street after getting dressed. Walking down the middle of a street is generally not advisable because it can be dangerous for the person and disruptive to traffic. However, the morally questionable part here might be the potential for nudity or impropriety if the dressing process isn't completed properly before stepping outside.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the character undressed, showered, toweled off, and then dressed before walking out the door. Assuming they are fully clothed when they step outside, walking down the middle of the street is more of a safety issue rather than a moral one. However, in some places, it might be considered disorderly conduct or a public nuisance, which could have legal implications.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the character is fully clothed and simply choosing to walk in the middle of the street without causing harm or obstruction, it might not be morally wrong. But if it's causing danger to themselves or others, it could be seen as irresponsible.\n\nGiven that, I would say that Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is also not wrong, assuming no harm is caused.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
