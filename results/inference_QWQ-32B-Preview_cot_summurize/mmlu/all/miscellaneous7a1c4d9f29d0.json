                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which option best exemplifies the principles of xeriscaping. I'm a bit fuzzy on what xeriscaping actually is, so I think I need to start there.\n\nFrom what I remember, xeriscaping is a landscaping method that reduces or eliminates the need for supplemental water from irrigation. It's really about creating a landscape that's suitable for dry climates and conserves water. So, it makes sense that it would focus on using plants that don't require a lot of water and designing the landscape in a way that minimizes water waste.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Installing an in-ground sprinkler system that operates on a timer. Hmm, that seems convenient, but isn't a sprinkler system still using water to irrigate the landscape? Wouldn't that go against the principle of reducing water use in xeriscaping?\n\nOption B: Lowering the cutting height on the lawn mower to reduce the surface area in contact with the cutting blade. I'm not sure how this relates to water conservation. Maybe if you cut the grass shorter, it needs less water? But I think that's not accurate. In fact, taller grass can actually help retain moisture in the soil by providing more shade and reducing evaporation. So, lowering the cutting height might actually increase water loss.\n\nOption C: Increasing the use of fertilizer on the turfgrass to promote growth. Fertilizers can stimulate growth, but they also often require more water for the plants to absorb the nutrients properly. Plus, over-fertilizing can lead to nutrient runoff and other environmental issues. It doesn't seem like this aligns with xeriscaping principles, which aim for sustainability and water conservation.\n\nOption D: Replacing nonnative ornamentals with native shrubs that do not require irrigation. This sounds promising. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, so they typically require less water and maintenance once established. By replacing nonnative plants that may need regular watering with native shrubs that can thrive on natural rainfall, the homeowner is reducing the landscape's water needs significantly.\n\nComparing all these options, option D seems to best embody the principles of xeriscaping. It's about choosing plants that are suitable for the existing climate and don't require additional irrigation, which is in line with the goal of conserving water.\n\nI think I'll go with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
