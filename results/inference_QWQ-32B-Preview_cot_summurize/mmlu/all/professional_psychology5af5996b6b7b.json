                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which theory best explains why raising the minimum age for buying alcohol from 18 to 21 might actually increase underage drinking among college students. The options are the inoculation model, cognitive dissonance theory, psychological reactance theory, and the deindividuation model. I need to understand each one and see which one makes the most sense in this context.\n\nFirst, the inoculation model. I think this has something to do with making people more resistant to changing their beliefs by exposing them to weak arguments against their position. Like, if you tell someone your\u89c2\u70b9 and then show them weak counterarguments, they become more\u56fa\u6267 in their belief. But I'm not sure how that relates to alcohol laws and underage drinking.\n\nNext, cognitive dissonance theory. This is about the mental discomfort you feel when you hold two conflicting beliefs or behaviors. For example, if someone believes that drinking is bad but they still do it, they might feel uncomfortable. To reduce that discomfort, they might change their behavior or justify it in some way. Maybe if the law makes it harder to buy alcohol, some students feel a dissonance between their desire to drink and the law's restriction, so they rationalize drinking more to resolve that conflict.\n\nThen there's psychological reactance theory. This theory suggests that when people feel their freedoms are threatened, they react by wanting to retain those freedoms even more. So, if you tell someone they can't do something, they might be more determined to do it. In the case of raising the drinking age, it might be seen as an infringement on their autonomy, especially if they're 18 and considered adults in other aspects. So, they might drink more to assert their independence.\n\nLastly, the deindividuation model. This is about how people lose self-awareness and self-restraint when they're in a group or anonymous situations. For example, in large parties or online, people might engage in behaviors they wouldn't normally do. Maybe in a college setting, with large gatherings and peer pressure, students might drink more because they feel less accountable for their actions.\n\nNow, considering the options, I need to see which one best predicts that raising the drinking age would increase underage drinking.\n\nLet's look at inoculation model again. It's about strengthening beliefs against counterarguments, but I don't see a direct link to laws affecting drinking behavior.\n\nCognitive dissonance could play a role, where the conflict between wanting to drink and the law's restriction leads to justifying drinking more. That makes some sense.\n\nPsychological reactance seems particularly relevant here. If students feel that their ability to make choices about drinking is being taken away, they might rebel by drinking more to assert their autonomy.\n\nDeindividuation might explain why people drink more in group settings, but it doesn't directly relate to the effect of changing the legal drinking age.\n\nComparing cognitive dissonance and psychological reactance, I think reactance is a better fit. The key here is that a law is being imposed that restricts their behavior, and reactance theory specifically deals with how people react to perceived threats to their freedoms.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. psychological reactance theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
