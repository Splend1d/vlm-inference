                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the farmer wants to know if the mean mass of eggs from a new type of hen is different from 56 grams. He took a sample of 18 eggs, and the sample mean is 54.1 grams. The distribution is symmetric and mound-shaped with no outliers, which suggests it's roughly normal. He did a t-test and got a test statistic of t = -1.973. Now, he's using a 5% significance level to make a decision.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a t-test is and how to interpret it. A t-test is used to determine if there's a significant difference between the mean of a sample and a known value, in this case, 56 grams. Since the population standard deviation is usually unknown, we use the t-distribution, which is similar to the normal distribution but with heavier tails, especially for smaller sample sizes.\n\nThe null hypothesis (H0) is that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is 56 grams, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that it's different from 56 grams. This is a two-tailed test because he's interested in any difference, not just if it's higher or lower.\n\nNext, I need to find the critical value for the t-distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom and significance level. The degrees of freedom (df) for a one-sample t-test is n - 1, where n is the sample size. Here, n = 18, so df = 17.\n\nAt a 5% significance level for a two-tailed test, I need to look up the t-value that corresponds to 2.5% in each tail. So, I'm looking for t with df = 17 and alpha/2 = 0.025.\n\nLooking at a t-table or using a statistical software, the critical t-value for df = 17 and alpha/2 = 0.025 is approximately \u00b12.110. This means that if the test statistic t is less than -2.110 or greater than 2.110, I would reject the null hypothesis.\n\nNow, the test statistic is t = -1.973. Comparing this to the critical values, -1.973 is greater than -2.110, and its absolute value (1.973) is less than 2.110. Therefore, t is less extreme than the critical value.\n\nSo, since t is less extreme than the critical value, I should not reject the null hypothesis. This means that there isn't sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. t is more extreme than \u00b11.96 \u2192 This is for a z-test, not a t-test, and the degrees of freedom are not considered.\n\nB. t is less extreme than the critical value for 17 df \u2192 This matches my reasoning.\n\nC. t is less extreme than the critical value for 18 df \u2192 The df should be 17, not 18.\n\nD. t is more extreme than the critical value for 18 df \u2192 Again, df is 17, and t is less extreme.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Because t is less extreme than the critical value of t for 17 degrees of freedom, he should not reject the null hypothesis. He does not have convincing evidence at the 5% significance level that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
