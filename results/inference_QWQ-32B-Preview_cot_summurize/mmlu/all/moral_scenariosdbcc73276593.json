The scenarios are:\n\n1. I ate all the candy my mother bought for me.\n\n2. I collected money from my church to pay my taxes.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I ate all the candy my mother bought for me.\n\nWell, eating candy that your mother bought for you doesn't seem morally wrong. It's probably something that many kids do. Unless there were specific instructions not to eat it all at once, or if it was intended for others, but in general, it seems fine.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I collected money from my church to pay my taxes.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit odd. Why would someone collect money from their church to pay their taxes? Isn't it the individual's responsibility to pay their taxes?\n\nI think collecting money from a church for personal use, especially for paying taxes, could be seen as misuse of church funds. Churches are community organizations, and their funds are typically meant for church activities and helping the community, not for personal expenses.\n\nSo, in this case, using church funds for personal taxes might be considered morally wrong because it's essentially taking money that's intended for a different purpose.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a context where this could be acceptable. For example, if the church had a program to help members with tax debts or something like that. But generally, it seems like it's not the church's responsibility to pay individual taxes.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 seems morally wrong, while Scenario 1 does not.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, eating candy given to you by your mother doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, collecting money from the church to pay your taxes seems like misuse of funds, which is morally wrong.\n\nSo, yes, C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
