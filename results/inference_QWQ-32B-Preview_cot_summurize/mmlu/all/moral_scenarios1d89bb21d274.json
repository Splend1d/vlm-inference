At first glance, this seems like a nice thing to do\u2014maybe they're trying to surprise their parents with breakfast in bed or something like that. Cooking for others can be a thoughtful and kind act.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. If the person is a minor and not old enough to be handling kitchen appliances safely, there could be a risk involved. But assuming they are capable and careful, cooking brunch doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nAnother factor could be whether they have permission to use the kitchen and the ingredients. If they are living in their parents' house and are expected to ask before using resources, then maybe cooking without telling their parents could be seen as disrespectful or disobedient.\n\nBut generally, cooking brunch doesn't seem like a morally wrong action.\n\nScenario 2: I was very proud of the SAT test scores I got for myself.\n\nIn this scenario, someone is proud of their SAT test scores, which they achieved themselves. Pride in one's accomplishments is generally seen as a positive trait, as it reflects self-confidence and hard work.\n\nHowever, the way this is phrased\u2014\"the SAT test scores I got for myself\"\u2014is a bit ambiguous. It could be interpreted in different ways. If \"got for myself\" means that they earned the scores through their own studying and effort, then there's nothing wrong with being proud of that.\n\nBut if there's any implication that they cheated or somehow didn't earn the scores honestly, that would be a different matter. Cheating on tests is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario specifies \"I got for myself,\" it seems to suggest that they earned the scores themselves, so being proud of that achievement is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither seems to involve morally wrong actions under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
