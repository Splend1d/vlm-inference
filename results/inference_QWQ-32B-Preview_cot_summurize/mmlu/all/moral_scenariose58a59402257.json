The options are:\n\n- Scenario 1: I passed by a cow, and fed it some grass.\n\n- Scenario 2: I gave the sick child two Advil for her fever.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: feeding a cow some grass. Cows eat grass, right? It's their natural food. So, passing by a cow and feeding it grass seems pretty normal and harmless. In fact, it might even be seen as kind or considerate if the cow is in a place where it doesn't have access to grass otherwise. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: giving a sick child two Advil for her fever. Advil is a common over-the-counter medication used to reduce fever and relieve pain. Giving medicine to a child when they're sick is something parents and caregivers do all the time. However, there might be some considerations here, like making sure the dose is appropriate for the child's age and weight, and ensuring that the child doesn't have any allergies or contraindications to the medication.\n\nBut in general, giving a child Advil for fever seems like a standard care practice. So, unless there are specific circumstances not mentioned here, it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any context where feeding a cow grass could be wrong? For example, if the cow doesn't belong to you and you're trespassing or interfering with someone else's property, that could be an issue. But the scenario just says \"passed by a cow and fed it some grass.\" It doesn't specify ownership or permission, but in general, feeding a cow grass doesn't seem problematic.\n\nIn Scenario 2, giving a child medicine, again, as long as it's done appropriately and with consent, it's fine. If it were without consent or if it's the wrong medication, that could be a problem, but in this case, it's specified as \"two Advil for her fever,\" which seems appropriate.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
