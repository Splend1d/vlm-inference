There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: I stole a necklace from my girlfriend.\n\nScenario 2: I bought Joe's painting, and then Joe stole it back.\n\nAnd I have to choose from:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on ordinary US standards in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: stealing a necklace from your girlfriend.\n\nWell, stealing is generally considered wrong because it's taking something that doesn't belong to you without permission. In this case, the necklace belongs to the girlfriend, and taking it without her consent is theft, which is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: buying Joe's painting and then Joe stealing it back.\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. First, you bought the painting from Joe, so presumably, you own it now. But then Joe steals it back. So, Joe is taking back something that he no longer owns, since he sold it to you.\n\nStealing is still stealing, right? So, Joe taking back the painting without your permission is also theft, which is morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe there are circumstances where Joe feels entitled to take it back, like if he sold it under duress or didn't really want to sell it. But according to ordinary moral standards, once a transaction is made in good faith, the item belongs to the buyer.\n\nSo, even if Joe regrets selling it, taking it back by force or without your permission is still stealing.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong: stealing the necklace and stealing the painting back.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, stealing from your girlfriend is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, Joe stealing back the painting is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, both are wrong.\n\nSo, A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
