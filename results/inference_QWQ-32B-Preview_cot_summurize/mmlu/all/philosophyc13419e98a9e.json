                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about types of arguments. It says that if you assume a set of statements is true, and from them you can deduce something false or absurd, then the original set must be false. This is called what?\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about a method of reasoning where you start by assuming something, and if that leads to a contradiction or an absurdity, then the assumption must be wrong. That sounds familiar.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. modus tollens\n\nB. modus ponens\n\nC. hypothetical syllogism\n\nD. reductio ad absurdum\n\nI think \"reductio ad absurdum\" is the one. I've heard of that term before. It means reducing something to absurdity, right? So, if assuming something leads to an absurd conclusion, then the assumption is flawed.\n\nLet me double-check what the other terms mean to be sure.\n\nModus tollens: That's a form of argument where if a conditional statement is true, and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false. Like, if P implies Q, and not Q, then not P.\n\nModus ponens: This is another form of argument where if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true.\n\nHypothetical syllogism: That's when you have two conditional statements, and you link them together. Like, if P implies Q, and Q implies R, then P implies R.\n\nSo, none of these seem to match the description in the question as directly as \"reductio ad absurdum\" does.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's think about what the question is saying again. It's about assuming a set of statements is true, and from them deducing something false, which means the original set is false.\n\nThat sounds a lot like proof by contradiction, which is another name for reductio ad absurdum. In proof by contradiction, you assume the opposite of what you want to prove, and if that leads to a contradiction, then the original statement must be true.\n\nHmm, but in this case, it's a bit different because it's saying that the original set of statements is false if they lead to an absurdity. So, it's similar but not exactly the same as proof by contradiction.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up the exact definition of reductio ad absurdum to make sure.\n\nOkay, looking it up in my logic notes, reductio ad absurdum is a method of proving a proposition by assuming its negation and deriving a contradiction. So, it's used to prove that the original proposition is true by showing that assuming it's false leads to a contradiction.\n\nBut in this question, it's about assuming a set of statements is true and deriving a false statement from them, thus the set is false. It seems like a similar principle but applied differently.\n\nMaybe it's better to think of it as: if assuming a set of statements leads to a false conclusion, then the set itself must be inconsistent or false.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is that it's a form of indirect proof. You assume the opposite of what you want to prove and show that it leads to an absurdity, thus the original must be true.\n\nBut in this case, it's about the set of statements being assumed true and leading to a false conclusion, so the set is false.\n\nI think \"reductio ad absurdum\" is still the best answer here.\n\nLet me see if any of the other options could fit.\n\nModus tollens: As I recall, it's a form of deductive reasoning where you have an implication, and you negate the consequent to negate the antecedent. It doesn't seem to fit the scenario described in the question.\n\nModus ponens: This is affirming the antecedent in an implication to affirm the consequent. Again, not related to the scenario.\n\nHypothetical syllogism: This is about chaining implications together. Doesn't seem to match.\n\nSo, by process of elimination as well as understanding the concept, I think D. reductio ad absurdum is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, I'll consider if there's any other logical term that might apply here.\n\nMaybe \"inconsistency\" or something like that, but the question is specifically about the kind of argument being used, not just the state of the set of statements.\n\nAlso, \"abduction\" is another type of reasoning, but that's about forming hypotheses, which isn't relevant here.\n\nSo, I think \"reductio ad absurdum\" is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
