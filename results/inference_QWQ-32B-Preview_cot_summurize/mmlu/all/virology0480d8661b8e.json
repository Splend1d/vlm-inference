                    "text": "So I've got this question here about HIV-1, which is a really important retrovirus. The question is asking which statement among the options is true. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Infecting only gay people.\" Hmm, I know that HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, and it's true that in some populations, like men who have sex with men, the rates might be higher. But does that mean it only infects gay people? Absolutely not. HIV can infect anyone regardless of their sexual orientation. It can be transmitted through heterosexual contact, sharing needles, from mother to child during birth, and other ways. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Infecting only males.\" Again, this is not accurate. HIV affects both males and females. In many parts of the world, women also constitute a significant proportion of people living with HIV. So, this is also false.\n\nOption C says: \"Infecting every country in the world.\" Now, this sounds plausible. HIV is a global pandemic, and it's present in virtually every country. Even in countries with lower prevalence, there are still cases reported. So, this seems like a correct statement.\n\nOption D says: \"Infecting only females.\" Similar to option B, this is incorrect because HIV infects both males and females.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the correct answer should be option C: \"Infecting every country in the world.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
