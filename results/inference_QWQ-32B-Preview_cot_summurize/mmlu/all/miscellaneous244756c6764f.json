So, the answer would be B. royal flush.\n\nTo provide some context, let's briefly go through the ranking of poker hands:\n\n1. **Royal Flush**: This is the highest-ranking hand, consisting of the ten, jack, queen, king, and ace all of the same suit.\n\n2. **Straight Flush**: Five cards in sequence, all of the same suit, but not including a royal flush.\n\n3. **Four of a Kind**: Four cards of the same rank.\n\n4. **Full House**: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank.\n\n5. **Flush**: Five cards all of the same suit, but not in sequence.\n\n6. **Straight**: Five cards in sequence, but not all of the same suit.\n\n7. **Three of a Kind**: Three cards of the same rank.\n\n8. **Two Pair**: Two different pairs.\n\n9. **One Pair**: One pair of matching ranks.\n\n10. **High Card**: If no other combinations are present, the highest card determines the winner.\n\nSo, in the options provided:\n\nA. Straight Flush: Higher than full house and four of a kind but lower than a royal flush.\n\nB. Royal Flush: The highest possible hand.\n\nC. Full House: Lower than straight flush and four of a kind.\n\nD. Four of a Kind: Lower than straight flush and royal flush.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. royal flush.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
