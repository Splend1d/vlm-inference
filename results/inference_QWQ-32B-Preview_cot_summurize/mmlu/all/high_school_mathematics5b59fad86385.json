                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a point in space (x, y, z) is randomly selected within the bounds -1 \u2264 x \u2264 1, -1 \u2264 y \u2264 1, and -1 \u2264 z \u2264 1. I need to find the probability that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1. The options are fractions of \u03c0, like \u03c0/24, \u03c0/12, \u03c0/6, and \u03c0/3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The point is chosen randomly within a certain region, and I need to find the probability that it lies within a specific subset of that region. The region is defined by the inequalities for x, y, and z, which describe a cube. Specifically, it's a cube centered at the origin with side length 2, since each side runs from -1 to 1.\n\nThe condition x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1 describes a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin. So, I need to find the probability that a randomly selected point within the cube also lies inside the sphere.\n\nProbability is generally defined as the ratio of the favorable area (or volume, in this case) to the total area (or volume). So, the probability P should be the volume of the sphere intersecting the cube divided by the volume of the cube.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of the cube. The side length is 2, so the volume is 2^3 = 8.\n\nNext, I need to find the volume of the sphere within these bounds. The sphere has radius 1, so its total volume is (4/3)\u03c0(1)^3 = 4\u03c0/3. However, since the cube extends from -1 to 1 in all directions, the entire sphere is contained within the cube. Therefore, the volume of the sphere inside the cube is just the volume of the sphere, which is 4\u03c0/3.\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? Let me visualize this. The cube goes from -1 to 1 in x, y, and z, which means it's a cube of side length 2. The sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin will fit entirely within this cube because the sphere's surface touches the cube's faces at x=\u00b11, y=\u00b11, and z=\u00b11.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the sphere is indeed 4\u03c0/3, and the volume of the cube is 8. So, the probability P that a randomly selected point in the cube is also inside the sphere is P = (4\u03c0/3)/8 = (4\u03c0/3) * (1/8) = \u03c0/6.\n\nLooking back at the options, \u03c0/6 is one of them. So, is that the answer?\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I've missed something. Is there any part of the sphere that lies outside the cube? No, since the sphere's radius is 1 and the cube extends from -1 to 1 in all directions, the sphere is entirely contained within the cube.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about a hemisphere or something else, but no, it's a full sphere.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio of the volumes. The volume of the sphere is 4\u03c0/3, and the volume of the cube is 8. So, P = (4\u03c0/3)/8 = \u03c0/6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the volume of the sphere being \u03c0d\u00b3/6, where d is the diameter. Since the diameter is 2, \u03c0(2)^3/6 = 8\u03c0/6 = 4\u03c0/3, which matches what I had earlier.\n\nSo, I think \u03c0/6 is the correct probability.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be incorrect. \u03c0/24 is too small; that would be like (4\u03c0/3)/32, which doesn't make sense in this context. \u03c0/12 would be (4\u03c0/3)/16, which also doesn't match. \u03c0/3 would be (4\u03c0/3)/4, which is too large because the cube's volume is 8, not 4.\n\nTherefore, \u03c0/6 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem. For example, using integration to find the volume of the sphere within the cube.\n\nThe equation of the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1. To find the volume, I can integrate over the region where this inequality holds within the cube.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, this would be a triple integral:\n\n\u222b\u222b\u222b dz dy dx, where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u2264 1, and -1 \u2264 x,y,z \u2264 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to the volume of the sphere, which we already know is 4\u03c0/3.\n\nAlternatively, I could use spherical coordinates, but since the sphere is centered at the origin and fits perfectly within the cube, it's unnecessary.\n\nSo, again, I end up with the same volume, 4\u03c0/3.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed \u03c0/6.\n\nI think I've confirmed this sufficiently. The answer should be \u03c0/6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{6}} \\]"
