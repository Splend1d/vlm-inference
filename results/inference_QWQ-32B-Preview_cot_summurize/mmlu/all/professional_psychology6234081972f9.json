                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about tonic-clonic seizures and where they most frequently occur in terms of epilepsy types. The options are simple partial, complex partial, grand mal, and perit mal. First off, I need to make sure I understand what tonic-clonic seizures are.\n\nTonic-clonic seizures are a type of generalized seizure that involves two phases: the tonic phase, where the muscles stiffen, and the clonic phase, where there are rhythmic muscle contractions. They used to be called grand mal seizures, so that might be a clue.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Simple partial - These are seizures that affect only a part of the brain, and the person remains aware during the seizure. They don't typically involve the whole body like tonic-clonic seizures do.\n\nB. Complex partial - These also affect a part of the brain, but the person loses awareness during the seizure. Again, these are focal seizures and not generalized like tonic-clonic seizures.\n\nC. Grand mal - This is an older term for tonic-clonic seizures. It's a generalized seizure that affects the entire brain.\n\nD. Perit mal - I'm not familiar with this term. It might be a typo or misnomer. Perhaps it's meant to be \"petit mal,\" which is an older term for absence seizures, but that doesn't fit here.\n\nGiven that tonic-clonic seizures are generalized seizures affecting the entire brain, they wouldn't typically be associated with partial seizures, which are focal. So options A and B seem incorrect.\n\nOption C, grand mal, is the older term for tonic-clonic seizures, so that seems like the correct answer.\n\nBut I should double-check. If perit mal is supposed to be petit mal, which are absence seizures, those are different from tonic-clonic seizures. Absence seizures involve a brief loss of consciousness without the tonic-clonic movements.\n\nSo, to confirm:\n\n- Tonic-clonic seizures are generalized seizures.\n\n- Simple partial and complex partial seizures are focal seizures.\n\n- Grand mal is another term for tonic-clonic seizures.\n\n- Perit mal seems like a mistake; perhaps it's meant to be petit mal, which are absence seizures.\n\nTherefore, the most frequent occurrence of tonic-clonic seizures would be in what is also known as grand mal epilepsy.\n\nI think the answer is C. Grand mal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
