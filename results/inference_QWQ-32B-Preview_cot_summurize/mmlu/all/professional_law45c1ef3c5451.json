                    "text": "This question is about whether a federal agency has to pay a state tax on the sales of lottery tickets. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a federal statute that set up a national lottery and created an agency to run it. This agency has outlets all over the country, including in one particular state. Now, this state has a tax on the gross receipts from all gaming operations within the state. The state wants to tax the agency's sales of lottery tickets in that state. The question is, does the agency have to pay this tax?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because a federal agency may not pay any monies to a state without explicit federal statutory authorization to do so.\n\nB. No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nC. Yes, because it is a generally applicable tax that does not discriminate against the agency.\n\nD. Yes, because the federal government is not exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities.\n\nOkay, so options A and B say no, the agency doesn't have to pay the tax, while C and D say yes, it does.\n\nLet's consider option A first. It says that a federal agency can't pay money to a state unless there's a specific federal law saying it's okay. Is there such a law here? The question mentions that there's a federal statute that established the national lottery and created the agency. But it doesn't say anything about authorizing payments to states for taxes. So, maybe option A is correct because there's no explicit authorization to pay this tax.\n\nOption B says that states can't impose taxes directly on the federal government or its agencies. That sounds familiar; I think there's a principle in law that the federal government is immune from state taxation. But is that always the case? Maybe not, especially if the agency is engaged in commercial activities.\n\nOption C argues that the tax is generally applicable and doesn't discriminate against the agency. So, if it's applied equally to all similar entities, perhaps the agency has to pay it.\n\nOption D says that the federal government isn't exempt from state taxation on its commercial activities. This seems to suggest that since the agency is selling lottery tickets, which is a commercial activity, it should be subject to the state tax.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these makes the most sense.\n\nFirst, the principle of federal immunity from state taxation is important. Generally, states cannot tax the federal government or its agencies because of the Supremacy Clause and principles of intergovernmental immunity. However, there are exceptions, particularly when the federal government is engaged in commercial activities.\n\nIn this case, the agency is selling lottery tickets, which seems like a commercial activity. So, maybe the state can tax it.\n\nBut option A mentions that there needs to be explicit federal statutory authorization for the agency to pay state taxes. Is that required? I'm not sure. Maybe there is a general rule that federal agencies don't pay state taxes unless Congress says otherwise.\n\nOption B is straightforward: states can't tax federal agencies. But again, is there an exception for commercial activities?\n\nOption C says that since the tax is generally applicable and doesn't discriminate, the agency has to pay it. But if there's a general rule against state taxation of federal agencies, does that override the general applicability?\n\nOption D specifically mentions that the federal government isn't exempt from state taxation on commercial activities. That seems plausible, but I need to think about whether that's actually the case.\n\nLet me consider some case law or legal principles that might apply here.\n\nI recall that in the case of Florida Dept. of Revenue v. United States, the Supreme Court held that states cannot impose taxes on the federal government or its agencies, even if the tax is generally applicable to similar private entities. The Court found that such taxes interfere with federal interests and are invalid.\n\nAnother case, Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, also supported the idea that states cannot tax the federal government's operations, even if the tax is generally applicable.\n\nHowever, there are cases where the federal government has consented to state taxation of its activities. For example, in some instances, Congress has authorized the imposition of certain taxes on federal retirees' pensions.\n\nIn this scenario, there's a federal statute establishing the national lottery and creating the agency, but it doesn't mention anything about paying state taxes. So, perhaps there's no consent here.\n\nMoreover, the agency is performing a federal function\u2014administering a national lottery. Even though it's a commercial activity, it's still a federal function.\n\nOn the other hand, if the agency is engaging in commercial activities that compete with private enterprises within the state, perhaps the state has an interest in taxing those activities to level the playing field.\n\nBut based on the case law I recall, states generally cannot tax federal activities, even if they are commercial in nature.\n\nAdditionally, the Tenth Amendment and principles of federalism suggest that states cannot tax the federal government without its consent.\n\nGiven that, options A and B seem more plausible than C and D.\n\nBetween A and B, option B directly states that states may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or its agencies.\n\nOption A adds the condition that payment requires explicit federal statutory authorization, but perhaps that's not necessary if there's a general prohibition against state taxation of federal agencies.\n\nHowever, in practice, sometimes federal agencies do pay certain state taxes, but only if Congress has authorized it.\n\nIn this case, since there's no mention of such authorization in the federal statute, it seems that the agency is not required to pay the state tax.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B: No, because a state may not impose a tax directly on the federal government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the agency is engaging in commercial activities, could the state tax it?\n\nEven in such cases, the general rule seems to be that states cannot tax federal activities without federal consent.\n\nMoreover, allowing states to tax federal activities could interfere with federal interests and potentially undermine the effectiveness of federal programs.\n\nTherefore, despite the commercial nature of the activity, it appears that the state cannot impose a tax on the federal agency's sales of lottery tickets.\n\nHence, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
