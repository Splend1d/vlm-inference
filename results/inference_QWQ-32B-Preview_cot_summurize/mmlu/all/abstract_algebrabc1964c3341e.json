A factor group, or quotient group, of a group G by a normal subgroup N is the set of cosets of N in G, denoted G/N, with a group operation defined on it.\n\nNow, the question is whether G/N is non-Abelian if G is non-Abelian.\n\nI know that if G is Abelian, then G/N is also Abelian, because the operation in G/N is inherited from G. But what if G is non-Abelian?\n\nI think there might be cases where G is non-Abelian, but G/N is Abelian. Let me think of an example.\n\nConsider the group of quaternions, Q8, which is non-Abelian. If I take N to be the center of Q8, which is {1, -1}, then Q8/N has order 4 and is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, which is Abelian. So, here, G is non-Abelian, but G/N is Abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nThis is a common misconception in group theory. Just because K is normal in H and H is normal in G, it doesn't necessarily mean that K is normal in G.\n\nTo check this, I need to recall the definition of a normal subgroup. A subgroup N of G is normal if for every g in G, gNg\u207b\u00b9 = N.\n\nSo, if K is normal in H, then for every h in H, hKh\u207b\u00b9 = K.\n\nAnd if H is normal in G, then for every g in G, gHg\u207b\u00b9 = H.\n\nBut does this imply that for every g in G, gKg\u207b\u00b9 = K?\n\nNot necessarily. Let me think of a counterexample.\n\nConsider G = S4, the symmetric group on 4 elements.\n\nLet H = A4, the alternating group on 4 elements, which is normal in G.\n\nLet K = Z2 \u00d7 Z2, the Klein four-group, which is normal in A4.\n\nHowever, K is not normal in S4. For example, conjugating an element of K by a transposition in S4 that's not in A4 will take it outside of K.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, both statements are false, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
