                    "text": "So I've got this question here about noroviruses and their typical effects on people. The options are:\n\nA. Diarrhea\n\nB. Rash\n\nC. Projectile vomiting and diarrhea\n\nD. Disease of the central nervous system\n\nHmm, noroviruses\u2014 I think I've heard about them before. They're often called \"stomach flu,\" but I know that's not actually flu since flu is influenza, which affects the respiratory system. So noroviruses must cause some kind of gastrointestinal issues.\n\nLet me think about this. When people talk about noroviruses, they often mention outbreaks on cruise ships or in nursing homes. I remember reading about how contagious they are and how they can spread really quickly in enclosed places.\n\nSo, what symptoms are typically associated with norovirus infections? I think the main ones are vomiting and diarrhea. Sometimes, people also have stomach pain, fever, or body aches, but vomiting and diarrhea are the primary symptoms.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Diarrhea \u2013 that's definitely a symptom.\n\nB. Rash \u2013 I don't think noroviruses typically cause rash. That sounds more like a symptom of other viral infections, maybe like measles or something.\n\nC. Projectile vomiting and diarrhea \u2013 okay, this sounds more specific. Projectile vomiting sounds really severe, and I do recall that norovirus can cause pretty forceful vomiting.\n\nD. Disease of the central nervous system \u2013 that doesn't sound right for noroviruses. They're gastrointestinal pathogens, so they should affect the stomach and intestines, not the brain or spinal cord.\n\nSo, between options A and C, both mention diarrhea, but C also includes projectile vomiting, which seems more severe. I think C might be a better answer because it specifies the type of vomiting that noroviruses are known for.\n\nBut wait, is projectile vomiting a characteristic feature of norovirus infection? I remember hearing about it, but maybe it's just a severe case. Maybe not everyone experiences projectile vomiting; maybe it's more common in children.\n\nLet me consider option A, diarrhea alone. While diarrhea is a symptom, option C seems more comprehensive because noroviruses often cause both vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nOption B, rash, doesn't seem relevant here. And option D, disease of the central nervous system, doesn't fit with what I know about noroviruses.\n\nSo, perhaps the best answer is C, projectile vomiting and diarrhea, because it captures the severity and the dual nature of the symptoms caused by noroviruses.\n\nBut maybe I'm overthinking this. Maybe the question is trying to see if I know that noroviruses primarily cause diarrhea, and vomiting is also common, but not necessarily projectile vomiting.\n\nWait, maybe \"projectile vomiting\" is a bit too specific and dramatic. Maybe the question is testing whether I know that noroviruses cause gastrointestinal issues, and diarrhea is one of them.\n\nOn the other hand, projectile vomiting sounds more like something associated with babies or food poisoning, but noroviruses are a type of foodborne illness, so maybe it does apply.\n\nLet me try to recall any specific information I might have read about norovirus symptoms. I think in medical texts, they describe norovirus infections as causing acute gastroenteritis, which includes vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nProjectile vomiting is a term often used to describe severe vomiting, where the ejected material is expelled forcefully. It's commonly associated with conditions like gastroenteritis, especially in children.\n\nSo, in the context of norovirus infection, which causes gastroenteritis, it's likely that the vomiting can be quite forceful, possibly even projectile.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most accurate description of the typical symptoms caused by noroviruses.\n\nOption A, diarrhea, is only half of the picture. Option B, rash, is irrelevant, and option D, disease of the central nervous system, is incorrect.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Projectile vomiting and diarrhea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
