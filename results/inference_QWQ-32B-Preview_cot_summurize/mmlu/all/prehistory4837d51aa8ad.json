I think the correct answer is D. khipu, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me double-check what each of these terms means.\n\nFirst, cuneiform is a writing system developed by the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia. It's a system of wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets. So, that's not related to the Inca.\n\nNext, rachis sounds unfamiliar to me in this context. I know that in biology, rachis refers to the central axis of a structure, like the backbone of a leaf or the central part of a feather. Maybe it's a misspelling or perhaps it refers to something else in this question.\n\nThen, mit'a seems familiar. I think mit'a was a system of labor taxation in the Inca Empire, where people had to contribute labor to the state for public works, agriculture, or other tasks. So, that's not a record-keeping system.\n\nFinally, khipu. I recall that khipu is a system used by the Inca to record information using knotted strings. They would have different colored strings, and the knots and their positions could represent numbers or other data. It's often considered a kind of mnemonic device to help remember information, especially since the Inca didn't have a written language like ours.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems that D. khipu is the correct answer. The other options don't match the description of a series of knotted strings used for record-keeping by the Inca.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
