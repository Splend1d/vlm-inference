                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to figure out if a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. The propositions are:\n\n1. ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P)\n\n2. ~O \u2283 Q\n\n3. N \u00b7 ~Q\n\nAnd I have to choose from these options:\n\nA. Inconsistent\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false\n\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false\n\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what \"consistent\" means in this context. In logic, a set of propositions is consistent if there's at least one row in the truth table where all propositions are true simultaneously. So, my goal is to find if there's any combination of truth values for N, O, P, and Q that makes all three propositions true at the same time.\n\nNow, instead of constructing a full truth table, which would have 16 rows since there are four variables, I'm supposed to use indirect truth tables. I think this means I'll assume that all three propositions are true and see if that leads to a consistent assignment of truth values to the variables.\n\nLet's start by assuming that all three propositions are true:\n\n1. ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) is true\n\n2. ~O \u2283 Q is true\n\n3. N \u00b7 ~Q is true\n\nFrom the third proposition, N \u00b7 ~Q, for this to be true, both N must be true and Q must be false. So, N = T and Q = F.\n\nNow, plugging these into the first proposition: ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P)\n\nSince N is true, ~N is false. So, false \u2261 (O \u00b7 P). For the equivalence to hold, (O \u00b7 P) must also be false. Because false \u2261 false is true, and false \u2261 true is false.\n\nSo, O \u00b7 P is false. That means at least one of O or P is false.\n\nNow, looking at the second proposition: ~O \u2283 Q\n\nWe know Q is false, and N is true. Wait, N is true, so ~O \u2283 Q must be true.\n\nLet's recall that in implications, ~O \u2283 Q is false only if ~O is true and Q is false. So, to make it true, either ~O is false (which means O is true), or Q is true. But Q is false, so ~O must be false, meaning O is true.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. So, O must be true to make ~O \u2283 Q true when Q is false.\n\nBut earlier, from the first proposition, O \u00b7 P is false, and now O is true. That means P must be false, because if O is true and P is false, then O \u00b7 P is false.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nN = T\n\nO = T\n\nP = F\n\nQ = F\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy all three propositions.\n\nFirst proposition: ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P)\n\n~N = ~T = F\n\nO \u00b7 P = T \u00b7 F = F\n\nF \u2261 F is T, so the first proposition holds.\n\nSecond proposition: ~O \u2283 Q\n\n~O = ~T = F\n\nF \u2283 F is T (since an implication is false only if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false), so the second proposition holds.\n\nThird proposition: N \u00b7 ~Q\n\nN = T, ~Q = ~F = T\n\nT \u00b7 T = T, so the third proposition holds.\n\nGreat, all three propositions are true under this assignment:\n\nN = T, O = T, P = F, Q = F\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nB. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false\n\nC. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false\n\nD. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false\n\nWait, option C says N and O are true, and P and Q are false, which matches exactly what I have: N = T, O = T, P = F, Q = F.\n\nOption B says N, O, and P are true and Q is false, but P is false in my assignment, so that doesn't match.\n\nOption D says N and P are true and O and Q are false, but P is false in my assignment, so that doesn't match either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if there are any other consistent valuations.\n\nSuppose there's another way to assign truth values that makes all three propositions true.\n\nFrom the third proposition, N and ~Q must both be true, so N = T and Q = F.\n\nFrom the second proposition, ~O \u2283 Q, and Q = F, so ~O must be F, meaning O = T.\n\nNow, from the first proposition, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P), with N = T, O = T, ~N = F, so F \u2261 (T \u00b7 P).\n\nFor F \u2261 (T \u00b7 P), (T \u00b7 P) must be F, because F \u2261 F is T and F \u2261 T is F.\n\nSo, T \u00b7 P = F implies P = F.\n\nThus, the only consistent valuation is N = T, O = T, P = F, Q = F.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false}} \\]"
