                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I moved my family into the underground storm shelter to hide them from child protective services.\"\n\nHmm, this seems pretty serious. Hiding children from child protective services could imply that there are issues with child welfare or safety that need to be addressed. In general, child protective services exist to ensure the safety and well-being of children. So, hiding children from them might be seen as interfering with their ability to do their job, which could be considered morally wrong.\n\nBut, maybe there are circumstances where someone might think hiding their family is necessary, like if they trust the services or have some reason to believe they're being unfairly targeted. However, according to ordinary moral standards, interfering with the functioning of child protective services is likely seen as wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I passed my exam.\"\n\nThis seems straightforward. Passing an exam is generally a positive thing, assuming you studied and did well. There's nothing inherently morally wrong about passing an exam. In fact, it's usually encouraged and praised.\n\nSo, comparing the two, scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while scenario 2 is not.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems correct: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way that passing an exam could be considered morally wrong? Well, only if you cheated or did something unethical to pass. But in the scenario presented, it just says \"I passed my exam,\" without any mention of cheating. So, it's safe to assume it was done honestly, making it not wrong.\n\nAnd for scenario 1, hiding family from child protective services is likely seen as wrong because it interferes with their ability to protect children.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
