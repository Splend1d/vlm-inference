                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Hourdequin's argument against consequentialist calculation. The options are a bit confusing, and I'm not entirely sure what he's getting at. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, consequentialism is an ethical theory that suggests the best action is the one that maximizes positive outcomes or minimizes negative ones. So, consequentialist calculation would involve assessing different actions based on their potential results.\n\nNow, Hourdequin seems to be pointing out a flaw in this approach. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. It fails to reconcile prima facie duties.\n\nPrima facie duties are those that appear to be binding at first glance, but they might conflict with other duties in certain situations. Consequentialism might indeed struggle with this because it focuses on outcomes rather than adhering to specific duties. However, I'm not entirely sure if this is the main point Hourdequin is making.\n\nB. It can run counter to a person's being able to integrate her commitments at various levels.\n\nThis seems a bit abstract. I think it's suggesting that consequentialism might not allow people to harmonize their different commitments, perhaps from personal, professional, or moral standpoints. Maybe consequentialist calculations could lead to choices that undermine one's overall sense of integrity or coherence in their commitments.\n\nC. It can run counter to the idea that persons are atomistic and individually rational actors.\n\nThis option is interesting. Consequentialism often considers the greater good or the overall consequences for all affected parties. If persons are viewed as atomistic and individually rational, meaning they act independently and rationally in their own self-interest, then consequentialist calculations might conflict with this view by requiring actions that don't align with individual rationality or self-interest for the sake of broader benefits.\n\nD. It fails to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to one another.\n\nThis seems to be touching on the idea that people are social beings, and their identities and actions are shaped by their relationships and connections with others. Consequentialism might not adequately account for these relational aspects when calculating the best outcomes.\n\nConsidering these options, I think the key is to identify which flaw Hourdequin specifically argues against in consequentialist calculation.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Consequentialism is often critiqued for ignoring the means by which outcomes are achieved, focusing solely on the ends. It can also lead to sacrificing individual interests for the greater good, which might be problematic.\n\nOption B mentions integrating commitments at various levels. This could relate to how consequentialism might require actions that conflict with one's personal or professional codes, making it hard to maintain coherence in one's identity and commitments.\n\nOption C talks about persons being atomistic and individually rational actors. Consequentialism might indeed clash with this view because it sometimes demands actions that are not in an individual's self-interest but are better for the group as a whole.\n\nOption D suggests that consequentialism fails to recognize the relational nature of persons. This could mean that it doesn't account for the importance of relationships and social connections in moral decision-making.\n\nBetween these, I'm leaning towards option B or C.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the context in which Hourdequin is making this argument. Is there a specific text or discussion where this is presented? Without that, it's a bit challenging to pinpoint exactly what he's arguing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the nature of consequentialist calculation itself. Consequentialism involves forecasting outcomes and choosing the action that leads to the best results. This can be problematic because it's often difficult to predict all the consequences of an action accurately.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to align with any of the options provided.\n\nOption A mentions failing to reconcile prima facie duties. While this is a critique of consequentialism, it might not be the specific flaw Hourdequin is highlighting.\n\nOption B talks about integrating commitments at various levels. This could be related to the idea that consequentialism might force individuals into situations where their personal and professional commitments clash, making it hard for them to maintain integrity across different aspects of their life.\n\nOption C mentions that consequentialism can run counter to the idea of atomistic and individually rational actors. This seems to suggest that consequentialism might require actions that are not in line with what individual rationality would dictate, perhaps for the greater good.\n\nOption D suggests that consequentialism fails to recognize the relational nature of persons. This could mean that it doesn't account for the importance of relationships and social bonds in moral decision-making.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to consider which of these flaws is most central to critiques of consequentialism.\n\nFailing to reconcile prima facie duties is a well-known critique, but it's more related to deontological ethics.\n\nThe idea of integrating commitments at various levels seems more nuanced and might be related to the coherence of an individual's moral identity.\n\nThe atomistic view of persons is critiqued in communitarian ethics, which emphasizes the social nature of persons.\n\nRecognizing persons in relation to one another is important in relational ethics and some forms of care ethics.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Hourdequin is arguing that consequentialist calculation can lead to decisions that undermine the relational aspects of human life, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, he might be arguing that consequentialism doesn't account for the way persons have multiple levels of commitments that need to be integrated, which is option B.\n\nI think option D is more directly related to the relational nature of persons, which is a significant critique of consequentialism. Consequentialism often treats individuals as discrete units whose welfare is aggregated, without sufficiently considering the relationships between them.\n\nFor example, in some situations, preserving a relationship might have greater moral value than the immediate consequences of an action, even if the action leads to better outcomes for individual welfare.\n\nTherefore, Hourdequin might be arguing that consequentialist calculation fails to recognize the importance of relationships in moral decision-making.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. It fails to recognize that persons are best understood in relation to one another.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
