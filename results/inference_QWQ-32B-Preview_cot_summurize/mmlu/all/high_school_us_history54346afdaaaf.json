                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about the Port Huron Statement from 1962, and it's asking about the context in which the organization that published it grew throughout the rest of the 1960s. The statement talks about being kids during a time when the U.S. was wealthy and strong, with the atom bomb, and ideas about freedom and equality. But as they grew up, they faced issues like racial bigotry in the South and the threat of the Cold War and nuclear weapons.\n\nSo, the organization that published this statement is likely related to student activism or social change movements of the 1960s. The Port Huron Statement is actually a founding document of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), which was a major student activist group during that time.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the context of the organization's growth through the rest of the 1960s. So, I need to think about what was happening in the U.S. during that decade that would have influenced student activism.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Rapid industrialization, urban growth and congestion, and corporate consolidation.\n\nWell, industrialization was certainly happening, but by the 1960s, the U.S. was already an industrialized nation. Urban growth and congestion were issues, but I'm not sure if these were the primary drivers of student activism. Corporate consolidation might be relevant, but it doesn't seem to directly connect to the issues mentioned in the Port Huron Statement.\n\nB. The baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.\n\nAh, the baby boom. That's when there was a huge increase in births after World War II, leading to a large youth population in the 1960s. This demographic surge probably contributed to the size and energy of the student movement. Economic growth suggests that there was prosperity, which might have given some students the luxury to focus on social issues rather than economic survival. Rapid expansion of higher education would mean more students in colleges and universities, providing a larger base for activism.\n\nThis option seems promising because it connects to the population of potential activists and the environment in which they were educated.\n\nC. Economic polarization, supply-side economic policies, and the disappearance of the middle class.\n\nEconomic polarization could be a factor, but supply-side economic policies weren't really a thing yet in the 1960s. Supply-side economics became more prominent in the 1980s with Reaganomics. Also, the middle class wasn't disappearing in the 1960s; in fact, it was expanding due to economic growth. So, this option doesn't seem accurate for the time period.\n\nD. The proliferation of personal computer technologies, the rise of Christian fundamentalism, and an increase in student apathy.\n\nPersonal computers weren't really a thing in the 1960s; they came later, in the 1970s and 1980s. Christian fundamentalism was rising, but it wasn't as prominent in the 1960s as it became in later decades. Additionally, the Port Huron Statement suggests activism, not apathy, so an increase in student apathy wouldn't align with the growth of an activist organization.\n\nGiven these considerations, option B seems to make the most sense. The baby boom led to a large number of young people, economic growth provided a certain level of prosperity, and the expansion of higher education meant more students were exposed to ideas and had the opportunity to organize.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The baby boom, economic growth, and a rapid expansion of higher education.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
