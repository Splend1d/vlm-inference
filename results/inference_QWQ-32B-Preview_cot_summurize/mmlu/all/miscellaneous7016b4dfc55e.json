                    "text": "Let's see. I know that during World War II, there were two main alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. The Allies included countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and others. The Axis powers were primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan. So, looking at the options here:\n\nA. Germany - Yeah, Germany was definitely part of the Axis.\n\nB. Italy - Italy was also an Axis power, led by Mussolini.\n\nC. Spain - Now, Spain during World War II was under Franco's rule, and I think Spain remained neutral or had a non-belligerent status. I'm not sure if they were part of the Axis.\n\nD. Japan - Japan was certainly an Axis power.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Spain might not have been a member of the Axis alliance. But I should double-check that.\n\nI recall that Franco's Spain was sympathetic to the Axis powers, but officially, Spain didn't join the war. There was some limited military cooperation with Germany, but Spain didn't become a full-fledged member of the Axis. In fact, Spain received some aid from the Axis powers in exchange for certain concessions, but never formally joined the alliance.\n\nMoreover, after the war, Spain was isolated by many countries because of its ties to the Axis, but it was never considered a full member of the Axis powers.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, Spain was not a member of the Axis alliance during World War II.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
