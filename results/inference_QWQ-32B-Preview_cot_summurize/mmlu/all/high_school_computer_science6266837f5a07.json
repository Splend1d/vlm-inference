For example, 7 / 2 equals 3.5.\n\nOption C, %, is the modulus operator which returns the remainder of the division. For example, 7 % 2 equals 1.\n\nOption D, |, is the bitwise OR operator, which is used for bitwise operations and not for division.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. //.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
