                    "text": "All of the options A through D describe advantages of stratified random sampling over simple random sampling, but the question is asking for which one is NOT an advantage. Let's examine each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"When done correctly, a stratified random sample is less biased than a simple random sample.\" Stratified random sampling can reduce bias if the strata are homogeneous and the sample is proportionally represented. However, if the strata are not chosen appropriately, it could potentially introduce bias. But generally, when done correctly, it is less biased. So, this seems like an advantage.\n\nOption B states: \"When done correctly, a stratified random sampling process has less variability from sample to sample than a simple random sample.\" This is true because stratification can reduce sampling error by ensuring that all subgroups are represented. So, this is also an advantage.\n\nOption C says: \"When done correctly, a stratified random sample can provide, with a smaller sample size, an estimate that is just as reliable as that of a simple random sample with a larger sample size.\" This is another advantage of stratified sampling, as it can increase efficiency.\n\nOption D states: \"A stratified random sample provides information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.\" While it's true that stratified sampling provides information about each stratum, a simple random sample can also be used to estimate parameters for subgroups, albeit with larger variances. However, it's not entirely accurate to say that a simple random sample does not provide this information; it's just less efficient.\n\nGiven that, option D might be the one that is not strictly an advantage, because while stratified sampling is better for estimating subgroup parameters, it's not that simple random sampling cannot provide such estimates at all. It's just less precise.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
