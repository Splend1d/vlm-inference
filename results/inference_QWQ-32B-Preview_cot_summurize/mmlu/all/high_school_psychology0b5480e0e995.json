I know he proposed eight stages, each with its own crisis that people need to resolve to move forward in their development. The question is about young adults, so I need to think about which stage corresponds to young adulthood.\n\nLet me list out the stages to get a better understanding:\n\n1. Trust vs. Mistrust (infancy)\n\n2. Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (toddlerhood)\n\n3. Initiative vs. Guilt (preschool)\n\n4. Industry vs. Inferiority (school age)\n\n5. Identity vs. Role Confusion (adolescence)\n\n6. Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)\n\n7. Generativity vs. Stagnation (middle adulthood)\n\n8. Ego Integrity vs. Despair (old age)\n\nOkay, so from this list, stage 6 is Intimacy vs. Isolation, which is associated with young adulthood. So, according to Erikson, the developmental crisis for young adults is about forming intimate relationships or risking feelings of isolation.\n\nBut let me double-check because the question provides options, and I need to make sure I select the correct one.\n\nOption A is \"intimacy vs. isolation,\" which matches what I just recalled.\n\nOption B is \"identity vs. role confusion,\" which is actually the crisis for adolescence, according to Erikson.\n\nOption C is \"autonomy vs. shame and guilt,\" which is for toddlers.\n\nOption D is \"industry vs. inferiority,\" which is for school-age children.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct answer should be A, intimacy vs. isolation.\n\nBut to ensure I understand this fully, let me think about what Erikson meant by intimacy vs. isolation. In this stage, young adults are focusing on forming close, loving relationships with others. If they succeed, they achieve intimacy and feel connected to others. If they don't, they may feel isolated and have difficulty forming these bonds.\n\nComparatively, identity vs. role confusion is more about figuring out one's sense of self and place in the world, which is crucial during adolescence.\n\nAutonomy vs. shame and doubt is about developing independence and self-control in early childhood.\n\nIndustry vs. inferiority is about mastering skills and feeling competent during the school years.\n\nSo, indeed, for young adults, intimacy vs. isolation is the key crisis according to Erikson's theory.\n\nI think I've got this one figured out. The answer is A. Intimacy vs. Isolation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
