                    "text": "Let's see. So, in balanced bridge circuits, if you swap the positions of the detector and the source, the bridge remains balanced. I need to figure out which theorem explains this phenomenon. The options are Reciprocity theorem, Thevenin's theorem, Norton's theorem, and Compensation theorem.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a balanced bridge is. In a wheatstone bridge, for example, when the ratios of the resistances in the two branches are equal, the bridge is balanced, and there's no current through the detector (usually a galvanometer). If I swap the positions of the source and the detector, I need to see why the bridge remains balanced.\n\nLet's consider the Reciprocity theorem. I think it has something to do with the interchangeability of source and load in a network. Reciprocity theorem states that in an electric network, the ratio of response to excitation is the same even if their positions are interchanged, provided that the network is linear and reciprocal. A reciprocal network is one in which the transfer function from one port to another is the same in both directions.\n\nSo, in the context of a balanced bridge, if I interchange the source and the detector, and the bridge remains balanced, it suggests that the network is reciprocal. This seems to align with the Reciprocity theorem.\n\nNow, let's consider Thevenin's theorem. Thevenin's theorem allows us to simplify a network into a single voltage source and a series resistance seen from the load terminals. It's useful for analyzing circuits, but I don't see directly how it explains the interchangeability of source and detector in a balanced bridge.\n\nSimilarly, Norton's theorem is the dual of Thevenin's theorem, where the network is simplified into a current source in parallel with a resistance. Again, while it's useful for circuit analysis, it doesn't directly explain the reciprocal behavior in this scenario.\n\nFinally, the Compensation theorem is about replacing a component in a circuit with its reciprocal component to maintain the same current or voltage in a particular branch. This seems a bit different from the scenario described.\n\nGiven this, I think the Reciprocity theorem is the most appropriate choice here. It directly deals with the interchangeability of source and load in a linear reciprocal network, which seems to be the case in a balanced bridge.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I can look at a simple example. Consider a wheatstone bridge with resistors R1, R2, R3, R4, a voltage source, and a detector. When R1/R2 = R3/R4, the bridge is balanced, and no current flows through the detector. If I swap the positions of the source and the detector, the bridge should still be balanced, meaning no current flows through the new detector position. This behavior is consistent with the Reciprocity theorem.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the bridge as a network and apply the Reciprocity theorem, swapping the source and detector should not affect the balance because the network is reciprocal.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A. Reciprocity theorem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
