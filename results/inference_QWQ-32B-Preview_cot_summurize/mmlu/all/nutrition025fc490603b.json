                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about protein synthesis, and I need to pick the correct statement from the options given. Let me read them one by one and think about each one.\n\nOption A says: \"All the information in DNA codes for proteins.\" Hmm, I know that DNA carries genetic information, and a lot of that information is used to make proteins. But I also remember that there's something called non-coding DNA, which doesn't directly code for proteins. So, maybe not all DNA information is for proteins. Maybe A isn't completely accurate.\n\nOption B says: \"The mRNA formed by transcription of a region of DNA only contains information for the protein to be synthesised.\" Okay, transcription is when DNA is copied into mRNA, and that mRNA then goes on to be translated into protein. But I think that mRNA has more than just the coding information. There are parts like the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that aren't translated into protein but have other functions, like regulating translation efficiency. So, maybe B isn't entirely correct because the mRNA contains more information than just the protein-coding sequence.\n\nOption C says: \"Both strands of DNA are transcribed to form mRNA.\" Now, DNA is double-stranded, but only one strand is typically transcribed into mRNA for a given gene. That's because DNA has a coding strand and a template strand; the template strand is used to make the mRNA. So, not both strands are transcribed; usually, it's just one. There might be some exceptions, but generally, only one strand is transcribed. So, C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"The RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA.\" This sounds plausible. After transcription, the initial RNA transcript often needs to be processed before it becomes mature mRNA. This can include splicing, where introns are removed and exons are joined together, and other modifications like capping at the 5' end and adding a poly-A tail at the 3' end. These modifications are important for the stability and translation efficiency of the mRNA. So, D seems like a correct statement.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any RNA that doesn't undergo splicing but still codes for protein? For example, some genes might not have introns, so their RNA wouldn't need splicing. But generally, many eukaryotic genes have introns, and their transcripts do undergo splicing. However, the statement says \"the RNA formed by transcription of DNA undergoes splicing and further modifications to form mRNA,\" which might not be universally true, but it is true for a large portion of eukaryotic genes.\n\nComparing all the options, D seems to be the most accurate statement among the given choices. A is incorrect because not all DNA codes for proteins. B is incorrect because mRNA contains more than just protein-coding information. C is incorrect because typically only one strand is transcribed. Therefore, D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
