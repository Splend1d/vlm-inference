                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. We have a series of events involving a woman, her daughter, and a mortgage company regarding a tract of land and a mortgage debt. I need to figure out who has a cause of action against the woman if she defaults on the mortgage debt.\n\nFirst, let's outline the events in order:\n\n1. **1993:** The woman mortgaged a tract of land to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest per annum.\n\n2. **1996:** The mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land.\n\n3. **2007:** The woman promised, in a signed writing delivered to her daughter, to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due.\n\n4. **2008:** The woman delivered to her daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage.\n\nNow, the question is, if the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, who has a cause of action against her: only the daughter, only the mortgage company, both, or neither?\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n**Understanding the Mortgage:**\n\n- In 1993, the woman mortgaged her land to the mortgage company to secure a $25,000 note.\n\n- The mortgage was recorded in 1996 by the mortgage company.\n\nRecording the mortgage is important because it provides public notice of the mortgage company's interest in the property. This recording likely establishes the mortgage company's priority over subsequent claims.\n\n**The Promise to Daughter (2007):**\n\n- The woman promised, in a signed writing, to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due.\n\nThis seems like a promise to convey the property to the daughter and to pay off the mortgage. However, the timing is interesting because the mortgage was already recorded in 1996, and the promise was made in 2007.\n\n**Quitclaim Deed (2008):**\n\n- The woman delivered a quitclaim deed to her daughter, which made no reference to the mortgage.\n\nA quitclaim deed transfers any interest the woman has in the property to her daughter without warranties. However, since the mortgage was already recorded, the daughter would take the property subject to that mortgage.\n\n**Default on Mortgage Debt:**\n\n- If the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, who can sue her?\n\nLet's consider the parties involved:\n\n1. **Mortgage Company:**\n\n- The mortgage company holds a mortgage on the property secured by the land.\n\n- If the woman defaults on the mortgage debt, the mortgage company typically has the right to foreclose on the property and/or sue the woman for the debt.\n\n- Therefore, the mortgage company likely has a cause of action against the woman for defaulting on the mortgage debt.\n\n2. **Daughter:**\n\n- The daughter received a quitclaim deed from the woman in 2008.\n\n- The deed made no reference to the mortgage, but since the mortgage was recorded in 1996, the daughter would take the property subject to the existing mortgage.\n\n- The woman promised in 2007 to convey the property and pay the mortgage debt when it came due.\n\n- If the woman defaults on the mortgage, the daughter might argue that the woman breached her promise to pay the mortgage debt, which was a condition of conveying the property.\n\n- However, since the deed was already delivered in 2008, and it's a quitclaim deed, the daughter may argue that the woman is liable for not fulfilling her promise to pay the mortgage.\n\nBut, did the woman actually promise to pay the mortgage after conveying the property? The promise in 2007 was to convey the property and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. The deed was delivered in 2008.\n\nIt's a bit unclear when the mortgage debt was supposed to come due. The original note was due on December 31, 1993, but it's possible that the debt was renewed or extended.\n\nAssuming the mortgage debt is still outstanding and the woman is supposed to pay it, then if she defaults, the mortgage company can certainly take action.\n\nAs for the daughter, if the woman promised to pay the mortgage debt when it came due, and she defaults, the daughter might have a claim against the woman for breaching that promise.\n\nHowever, the daughter already received the quitclaim deed, which transferred the woman's interest in the property to her, subject to the mortgage.\n\nSo, the daughter may argue that the woman is liable for not paying the mortgage, which is encumbering the property that was conveyed to the daughter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the daughter could argue that the woman is liable for any damages resulting from the default on the mortgage.\n\nBut, generally, once the property is conveyed via quitclaim deed, the daughter would be responsible for any encumbrances on the property, unless there was a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nGiven the information provided, it seems that both the mortgage company and the daughter might have causes of action against the woman for defaulting on the mortgage debt.\n\nThe mortgage company because it is the lender entitled to enforce the mortgage terms, and the daughter because the woman may have breached her promise to pay the mortgage debt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably:\n\nC. Both the daughter and the mortgage company have causes of action against the woman.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any reasons why this might not be the case.\n\n**Possible Considerations:**\n\n- **Statute of Limitations:** Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be time limits for bringing certain claims. The events span from 1993 to 2008, so some claims might be barred by statutes of limitations.\n\n- **Recording Laws:** Since the jurisdiction uses grantor-grantee indices, recording the mortgage in 1996 likely perfected the mortgage company's interest in the property.\n\n- **Nature of Quitclaim Deed:** A quitclaim deed generally transfers only the grantor's interest without warranties. So, the daughter takes the property subject to existing encumbrances like the mortgage.\n\n- **Promissory Estoppel or Contractual Obligation:** The signed promise in 2007 might create a binding obligation for the woman to pay the mortgage debt. If she fails to do so, the daughter could sue for breach of that promise.\n\nGiven these considerations, it still seems that both parties could have causes of action against the woman.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely C.\n\n**Final Answer: C**"
