Dalton's Law states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas in the mixture. The partial pressure of each gas is proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the number of moles of each gas present in the container.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of moles of nitrogen (N\u2082):**\n\n   The molar mass of nitrogen (N\u2082) is approximately 28.0 g/mol.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of N\u2082} = \\frac{28.0 \\, \\text{g}}{28.0 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the number of moles of argon (Ar):**\n\n   The molar mass of argon (Ar) is approximately 40.0 g/mol.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of Ar} = \\frac{40.0 \\, \\text{g}}{40.0 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the number of moles of water vapor (H\u2082O):**\n\n   The molar mass of water (H\u2082O) is approximately 18.0 g/mol.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of H\u2082O} = \\frac{36.0 \\, \\text{g}}{18.0 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 2.0 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\nNext, we find the total number of moles of gas in the container by summing the moles of each gas:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total moles} = 1.0 \\, \\text{mol (N\u2082)} + 1.0 \\, \\text{mol (Ar)} + 2.0 \\, \\text{mol (H\u2082O)} = 4.0 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can determine the mole fraction of nitrogen in the mixture. The mole fraction (X) of a gas is the number of moles of that gas divided by the total number of moles of gas in the mixture.\n\n\\[\nX_{\\text{N\u2082}} = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{mol}}{4.0 \\, \\text{mol}} = 0.25\n   \\]\n\nAccording to Dalton's Law, the partial pressure of nitrogen is equal to its mole fraction multiplied by the total pressure of the gas mixture.\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{N\u2082}} = X_{\\text{N\u2082}} \\times P_{\\text{total}} = 0.25 \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} = 0.50 \\, \\text{atm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the partial pressure of nitrogen is 0.50 atm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
