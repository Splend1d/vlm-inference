                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation where a husband and wife gave part of their family farm to their niece, but they kept a special condition: if the niece ever mortgages or encumbers the property during their lifetimes, the property automatically goes back to them. Then, the husband dies, and the niece mortgages the property. Now, the question is, can the surviving wife enforce this reverter clause to get the property back?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a reverter is. A reverter is a future interest that automatically returns the property to the original owner if certain conditions are not met. In this case, the condition is that the property shouldn't be mortgaged or encumbered during the lifetimes of the grantors.\n\nOption A says no, because it's an unreasonable restraint on alienation. Restraint on alienation is when there's a restriction on the owner's ability to transfer or encumber their property. Generally, such restraints are disfavored in law because they interfere with the freedom to dispose of one's property as they see fit.\n\nOption B says no, an automatic reverter is unenforceable. That seems similar to A, suggesting that reverters aren't allowed or are unenforceable for some reason.\n\nOption C says yes, because the grantors and grantee were blood relatives. Maybe there's some exception for family members where such restrictions are allowed.\n\nOption D says yes, because it's a reasonable restraint on alienation. This suggests that while restraints on alienation are generally disfavored, this particular one is reasonable and therefore enforceable.\n\nLet me think about this. The grantors are the husband and wife, and the grantee is their niece. They're blood relatives, which might make a difference. The consideration was below market value, but that might not directly affect the enforceability of the reverter.\n\nThe reverter is triggered if the property is mortgaged or encumbered during the lifetimes of the grantors. The husband has died, but the wife is still alive. So, since it's during the lifetime of the surviving grantor, maybe the reverter can be enforced.\n\nBut is this a reasonable restraint on alienation? Mortgaging property is a common way for owners to use their equity to borrow money, perhaps for improvements or other purposes. Restricting that might be seen as an unreasonable restraint because it limits the niece's ability to use her property as she sees fit.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the grantors had a valid reason to impose this condition, like wanting to preserve the property for the family or prevent it from being lost due to debt.\n\nI recall that reverters are similar to conditions subsequent. If a condition subsequent is violated, the original owner can reclaim the property. But there are rules about what kinds of conditions are enforceable.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, reverters are allowed if they serve a legitimate purpose and aren't overly restrictive. Here, since it's between family members, maybe the court would be more lenient.\n\nAlso, considering that only the wife is still alive, I need to think about whether the reverter can be enforced by just one of the original grantors. The language says \"within the lifetime of either Grantor,\" so even if one is deceased, as long as the other is still alive, the condition applies.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA. No, this is an unreasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nB. No, an automatic reverter is unenforceable.\n\nC. Yes, the provision can be enforced because the grantors and the grantee were blood relatives in pari delicto.\n\nWait, \"in pari delicto\" means \"equally at fault.\" I'm not sure why that would be relevant here. Maybe it's a typo or misstatement.\n\nD. Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the key here is whether the reverter is a reasonable restraint on alienation. If it unduly restricts the niece's ability to use her property, it might not be enforceable.\n\nIn this case, the restriction is only during the lifetimes of the grantors. So, it's not a perpetual restriction; it's limited in time. Once both grantors are deceased, the restriction no longer applies.\n\nAlso, since it's a family transfer, maybe the law is more accommodating of such restrictions.\n\nI tend to think that option D is correct: yes, the provision is enforceable because it's a reasonable restraint on alienation, given that it's limited in time and between family members.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about \"in pari delicto\" in option C. That seems out of place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe option A is correct, and it's an unreasonable restraint on alienation, but I'm leaning towards D.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the legal principles more carefully.\n\nIn property law, restraints on alienation are generally disfavored, but conditions subsequent are allowed. A reverter is akin to a condition subsequent, where the original owner gets the property back if a certain condition is not met.\n\nIn this case, the condition is that the property not be mortgaged or encumbered during the lifetimes of the grantors.\n\nIs this a valid condition? Well, mortgaging property is a common practice, and restricting that might be seen as overly burdensome.\n\nHowever, in family transfers, courts might be more willing to enforce such conditions, especially if there's a family relationship and the consideration was less than market value.\n\nMoreover, since the grantors retained a reverter interest, perhaps they should be allowed to enforce it as per their original agreement.\n\nBut I also need to consider the language of the provision: \"within the lifetime of either Grantor.\" Since one grantor has died, but the other is still alive, the condition seems to continue as long as at least one grantor is alive.\n\nSo, if the niece mortgaged the property while the wife was still alive, then the condition has been triggered, and the reverter should take effect.\n\nTherefore, the wife should be able to enforce the reverter and get the property back.\n\nBut is this a reasonable restraint on alienation? Maybe it is, because it's a limited-time restriction and within a family context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an unreasonable restraint because it interferes with the niece's right to mortgage her property.\n\nI need to think about the policy behind it. On one hand, freedom to alienate property is important. On the other hand, family members might have legitimate reasons to impose such restrictions.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that it depends on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances.\n\nGiven the options, I think D is the best answer: yes, the provision is enforceable because it's generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation.\n\nOption C mentions \"in pari delicto,\" which doesn't seem directly relevant here, so I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Yes, the provision is enforceable because it is generally considered to be a reasonable restraint on alienation."
