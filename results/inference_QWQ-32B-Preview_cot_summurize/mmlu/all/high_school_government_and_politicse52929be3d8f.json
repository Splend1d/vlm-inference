I remember that it was the first governing document of the United States after independence, but it was pretty weak compared to the Constitution that came later.\n\nOption A is \"negotiate treaties.\" I think the national government could do that under the Articles. They needed to be able to deal with other countries, right? So, that might be correct.\n\nOption B is \"collect taxes.\" Hmm, I recall that one of the big problems with the Articles was that the national government couldn't collect taxes directly. States were supposed to contribute money, but they often didn't, which led to financial problems. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C is \"establish a federal judiciary.\" Under the Articles, there was no real national court system. I think all judicial power remained with the states. So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption D is \"enforce its laws.\" Again, the national government under the Articles had very limited power to enforce laws. They didn't have an executive branch or a judiciary to enforce laws, and they relied on the states to carry out national laws, which often didn't happen.\n\nLet me double-check. The Articles of Confederation established a very loose confederation of independent states, with a weak central government. The national government could declare war and make peace, coin money, and negotiate with foreign governments and Indian tribes. But it couldn't collect taxes, enforce laws, or establish a national judiciary.\n\nSo, among the options given, only A. negotiate treaties seems to be something the national government could do under the Articles of Confederation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
