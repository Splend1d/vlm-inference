In the poem, these words are inscribed above the gates of Hell. So, the correct answer should be C. The Divine Comedy.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure. \"Paradise Lost\" is by John Milton, and it's about the fall of man. \"The Wizard of Oz\" is a novel by L. Frank Baum, and \"Beowulf\" is an Old English epic poem. None of these seem likely to have that specific quote.\n\nYes, definitely C. The Divine Comedy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
