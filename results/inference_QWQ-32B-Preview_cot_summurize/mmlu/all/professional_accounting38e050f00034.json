                    "text": "According to Treasury Circular 230, which governs the conduct of practitioners before the Internal Revenue Service, including certified public accountants (CPAs), there are specific requirements when an error is discovered in a tax return that has already been filed.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Document the error in the workpapers.\n\nDocumenting errors in workpapers is important for maintaining accurate records and for quality control purposes. However, this is more of an internal procedure and may not directly address the requirements under Treasury Circular 230 regarding client communication and correction of errors.\n\nB. Prepare an amended return within 30 days of the discovery of the error.\n\nTreasury Circular 230 does outline the need to correct errors, but it does not specify a exact time frame like 30 days for preparing an amended return. The Circular emphasizes the importance of taking appropriate steps to correct any known errors, but the timing can depend on various factors, including the nature of the error and the tax code's provisions regarding amended returns.\n\nC. Promptly advise the client of the error.\n\nThis seems aligned with the principles of Treasury Circular 230, which emphasizes the importance of honesty and diligence in dealing with clients and the IRS. Informing the client promptly about any discovered errors is crucial for maintaining transparency and allowing the client to take necessary actions, such as filing an amended return.\n\nD. Promptly resign from the engagement and cooperate with the successor accountant.\n\nResigning from the engagement is not necessarily required upon discovering an error. In fact, resigning might not be the most appropriate immediate action, as the CPA may still have responsibilities to correct the error and advise the client accordingly. Cooperating with a successor accountant could be important if the CPA does resign, but it's not the primary action to be taken upon discovering an error.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate action according to Treasury Circular 230 is to promptly advise the client of the error. This allows the client to be informed and to take any necessary steps, such as filing an amended return, and it maintains the integrity of the professional relationship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
