                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a soft drink dispenser that can be set to deliver a fixed number of ounces, and we're dealing with a normal distribution where the standard deviation is 0.3 ounces. We need to find the mean setting such that a 12-ounce cup overflows less than 1% of the time.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for the cup to overflow. If the cup is 12 ounces, and the dispenser delivers more than 12 ounces, that's when it overflows. So, we want the probability of delivering more than 12 ounces to be less than 1%, or P(X > 12) < 0.01.\n\nSince the delivery is normally distributed, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to find the mean that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe normal distribution is defined by its mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3). Here, \u03c3 = 0.3 ounces, and we need to find \u03bc such that P(X > 12) < 0.01.\n\nTo work with standard normal tables, it's often easier to standardize the variable. The standardized variable is Z = (X - \u03bc)/\u03c3.\n\nSo, P(X > 12) = P(Z > (12 - \u03bc)/0.3)\n\nWe want this probability to be less than 0.01. Looking at standard normal tables, we find that P(Z > 2.326) \u2248 0.01. This means that (12 - \u03bc)/0.3 should be equal to 2.326 to have P(X > 12) = 0.01. To make it less than 0.01, (12 - \u03bc)/0.3 should be greater than 2.326.\n\nWait a minute, let's think carefully here. If (12 - \u03bc)/0.3 = 2.326, then P(X > 12) = 0.01. To have P(X > 12) < 0.01, we need (12 - \u03bc)/0.3 > 2.326.\n\nBut let's solve for \u03bc in the equation (12 - \u03bc)/0.3 = 2.326.\n\n12 - \u03bc = 2.326 * 0.3\n\n12 - \u03bc = 0.6978\n\n\u03bc = 12 - 0.6978\n\n\u03bc \u2248 11.3022 ounces\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because if the mean is less than 12 ounces, the probability of overflowing should be less than 50%, but we need it to be less than 1%.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the direction here. Let's try another approach.\n\nWe have X ~ N(\u03bc, 0.3^2)\n\nWe want P(X > 12) < 0.01\n\nWhich is equivalent to P(X \u2264 12) > 0.99\n\nSo, we need the 99th percentile of the distribution to be at most 12 ounces.\n\nIn terms of Z-scores, P(Z \u2264 (12 - \u03bc)/0.3) > 0.99\n\nFrom standard normal tables, P(Z \u2264 2.326) \u2248 0.99\n\nTherefore, (12 - \u03bc)/0.3 \u2265 2.326\n\nSolving for \u03bc:\n\n12 - \u03bc \u2265 2.326 * 0.3\n\n12 - \u03bc \u2265 0.6978\n\n-\u03bc \u2265 0.6978 - 12\n\n-\u03bc \u2265 -11.3022\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1 (and reversing the inequality):\n\n\u03bc \u2264 11.3022 ounces\n\nSo, the mean should be set to no more than approximately 11.3022 ounces to ensure that the probability of overflowing is less than 1%.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces\n\nB. 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces\n\nC. 12 - 2.576(0.3) ounces\n\nD. 12 + 2.326(0.3) ounces\n\nOption B is 12 - 2.326(0.3), which is approximately 12 - 0.6978 = 11.3022 ounces, which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but in our earlier step, we had \u03bc \u2264 11.3022, and option B is exactly 11.3022. But the question says \"less than 1% of the time,\" so perhaps we need a slightly higher mean to make sure P(X > 12) is strictly less than 0.01.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 12 - 2.576(0.3), which is approximately 12 - 0.7728 = 11.2272 ounces. This would make P(X > 12) even smaller, but option B already satisfies the condition.\n\nI think option B is the correct choice because it sets the mean such that P(X > 12) = 0.01, and since the question allows for less than 1%, option B is precise, and C would be more stringent.\n\nOption A is 12 - 0.99(0.3) = 12 - 0.297 = 11.703 ounces, which would result in a higher probability of overflow.\n\nOption D is 12 + 2.326(0.3) = 12 + 0.6978 = 12.6978 ounces, which would certainly lead to overflow more than 1% of the time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option B: 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
