                    "text": "All of these options are related to cyber-security in some way, but one of them is not directly part of the technical discourse on cyber-security. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Business networks: These are networks used by businesses to connect their computers and devices. They are certainly a part of cyber-security because protecting business networks from threats is a major concern.\n\nB. Computer experts: These are professionals who have expertise in computers and technology. In the context of cyber-security, computer experts are crucial as they help design, implement, and maintain security measures.\n\nC. Anti-virus industry: This industry specializes in creating software to protect computers and networks from viruses and other malware. It is directly related to cyber-security.\n\nD. Computer networks: These are interconnected systems of computers that can exchange data and resources. Cyber-security is essential to protect these networks from unauthorized access and attacks.\n\nConsidering these explanations, all options are related to cyber-security. However, the question is asking for the concept that does NOT form part of the technical discourse on cyber-security. Perhaps the answer lies in the way these terms are used in the field.\n\nLet's think differently. Maybe the question is trying to distinguish between technical and non-technical aspects. Among these options, \"business networks\" could be considered more of a business concept, while the others are more technically focused.\n\nAlternatively, \"computer experts\" might be seen as the people who work in cyber-security rather than a technical concept itself. However, their expertise is fundamentally technical.\n\n\"Anti-virus industry\" is a technical field focused on protecting against malware, so it's clearly part of the technical discourse.\n\n\"Computer networks\" are a core technical component of cyber-security.\n\nPerhaps the answer is \"computer experts\" because they are the practitioners rather than a technical concept. But that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the distinction between networks and anti-virus measures. But both are integral to cyber-security.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the question is trying to identify which one is not exclusively related to cyber-security.\n\n\"Business networks\" could exist without necessarily involving cyber-security, although in practice, they do require security measures.\n\n\"Computer experts\" could be experts in areas unrelated to security, such as software development or hardware engineering.\n\n\"Anti-virus industry\" is solely focused on security.\n\n\"Computer networks\" inherently require security measures.\n\nSo, \"computer experts\" and \"business networks\" have broader contexts beyond just cyber-security.\n\nBetween these two, \"computer experts\" might be the better answer because their expertise could be in any area of computing, not necessarily security.\n\nHowever, I'm still not entirely confident.\n\nLet's consider another angle. Maybe the question is referring to the entities involved in cyber-security rather than specific technical concepts.\n\n- Business networks: entities that need security.\n\n- Computer experts: people who can provide security solutions.\n\n- Anti-virus industry: providers of security solutions.\n\n- Computer networks: the technical infrastructure that needs protection.\n\nIn this case, \"computer experts\" are the human resources, whereas the others are either entities or technical systems.\n\nPerhaps the question is aiming to highlight that \"computer experts\" are people, not a technical concept.\n\nIf that's the case, then \"computer experts\" would be the answer.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding of what constitutes a technical discourse in cyber-security.\n\nTechnical discourse would involve discussions about technologies, systems, and practices used to secure computing environments.\n\n\"Business networks\" refer to the networks used by businesses, which are technical systems that need security.\n\n\"Computer experts\" refer to the people who work with these systems.\n\n\"Anti-virus industry\" refers to the sector that produces security software.\n\n\"Computer networks\" are the technical infrastructure that requires security measures.\n\nIf we consider which one is not a technical component but rather a category of people, \"computer experts\" would fit that description.\n\nTherefore, \"computer experts\" might be the answer because they are not a technical concept themselves but rather the individuals who possess knowledge of technical concepts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"business networks\" are considered more of a managerial or organizational concept rather than a purely technical one.\n\nBut in the context of cyber-security, business networks are very much a technical concern.\n\nI think the most plausible answer is B. Computer experts, because they are the people who work in the field, not a technical concept themselves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
