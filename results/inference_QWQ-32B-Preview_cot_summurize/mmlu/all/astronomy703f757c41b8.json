                    "text": "So I've got this question about Mars. It says that Mars has an atmospheric pressure of 600 pascals, the acceleration due to gravity is roughly 4 m/s\u00b2, and the surface area is about 145,000,000 square kilometers. I need to find the approximate mass of the Martian atmosphere, and there are four options: A. 2.2\u00d710^11 kg, B. 2.2\u00d710^14 kg, C. 2.2\u00d710^20 kg, and D. 2.2\u00d710^16 kg.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall the relationship between pressure, force, and area. I remember that pressure is defined as force per unit area, so P = F/A. If I rearrange that, then F = P * A. So, if I can find the force exerted by the atmosphere on the surface of Mars, I can relate that to the mass of the atmosphere using the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nSo, the force exerted by the atmosphere would be the weight of the atmosphere, which is mass times gravity, right? So, F = m * g. Therefore, m = F / g.\n\nI have P = 600 Pa, and A = 145,000,000 km\u00b2. But wait, Pa is N/m\u00b2, and the area is given in km\u00b2, so I need to convert km\u00b2 to m\u00b2.\n\n1 km = 1000 m, so 1 km\u00b2 = (1000 m)^2 = 1,000,000 m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, A = 145,000,000 km\u00b2 * 1,000,000 m\u00b2/km\u00b2 = 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2.\n\nNow, P = 600 N/m\u00b2, so F = P * A = 600 N/m\u00b2 * 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2 = 8.7 \u00d7 10^16 N.\n\nNow, F = m * g, so m = F / g = 8.7 \u00d7 10^16 N / 4 m/s\u00b2 = 2.175 \u00d7 10^16 kg.\n\nThat's approximately 2.2 \u00d7 10^16 kg, which corresponds to option D.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, converting area:\n\n145,000,000 km\u00b2 * 1,000,000 m\u00b2/km\u00b2 = 145,000,000 \u00d7 10^6 m\u00b2 = 145 \u00d7 10^12 m\u00b2 = 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, F = P * A = 600 N/m\u00b2 * 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2 = 870 \u00d7 10^12 N = 8.7 \u00d7 10^14 N? Wait, no, 600 * 1.45 = 870, and 10^14 m\u00b2, so 870 \u00d7 10^12 N = 8.7 \u00d7 10^14 N.\n\nWait, I must have miscounted the zeros. Let's recalculate:\n\nP = 600 N/m\u00b2\n\nA = 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2\n\nF = P * A = 600 * 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 = 870 \u00d7 10^12 N = 8.7 \u00d7 10^14 N.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, m = F / g = 8.7 \u00d7 10^14 N / 4 m/s\u00b2 = 2.175 \u00d7 10^14 kg, which is approximately 2.2 \u00d7 10^14 kg.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option B, not D.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. 2.2\u00d710^11 kg\n\nB. 2.2\u00d710^14 kg\n\nC. 2.2\u00d710^20 kg\n\nD. 2.2\u00d710^16 kg\n\nSo, according to my calculation, it should be B. 2.2\u00d710^14 kg.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was D, but that was a miscalculation. No, now I see that it's 2.175 \u00d7 10^14 kg, which is closest to B.\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I had 2.175 \u00d7 10^16 kg, which was incorrect because I miscounted the exponent in the force calculation.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nP = 600 Pa\n\nA = 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 m\u00b2\n\nF = P * A = 600 * 1.45 \u00d7 10^14 = 870 \u00d7 10^12 N = 8.7 \u00d7 10^14 N\n\ng = 4 m/s\u00b2\n\nm = F / g = 8.7 \u00d7 10^14 N / 4 m/s\u00b2 = 2.175 \u00d7 10^14 kg \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 10^14 kg\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 2.2\u00d710^14 kg.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any reason why the mass of the atmosphere would be different? For example, is there atmospheric pressure variation on Mars that I should account for? Or is the surface area approximation sufficient?\n\nGiven that the question provides approximate values, using the average pressure and total surface area should give a reasonable estimate.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the pressure is due to the weight of the atmosphere, which is correct according to the basic definition of pressure.\n\nSo, I believe B. 2.2\u00d710^14 kg is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 2.2 \\times 10^{14} \\ \\text{kg}} \\]"
