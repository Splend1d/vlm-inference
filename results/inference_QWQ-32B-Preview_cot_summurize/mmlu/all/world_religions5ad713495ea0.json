Vishnu is one of the principal deities in Hinduism and is part of the Trimurti, along with Brahma and Shiva, representing the aspects of preservation and protection in the cosmos.\n\nRama is the protagonist of the epic Ramayana and is revered for his idealistic virtues and moral righteousness. Krishna, on the other hand, is a central character in the epic Mahabharata and is known for his wisdom, statesmanship, and divine interventions, most famously through the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nBoth Rama and Krishna are worshipped across various sects of Hinduism, and their stories and teachings form an integral part of Hindu philosophy, ethics, and culture."
