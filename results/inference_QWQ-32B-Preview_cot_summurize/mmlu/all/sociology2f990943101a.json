                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option is consistent with current research on gender roles and the workplace. Let's look at each one:\n\nOption A says that in about a quarter of households with children, men stay home with the children while their wives work. I've heard that the number of stay-at-home dads is increasing, but is it really up to 25%? I doubt it. According to recent statistics, it's more like around 10% or less. So, probably not accurate.\n\nOption B claims that most women believe there's equal opportunity between men and women in career choice, advancement, and income. Hmm, that seems optimistic. We know that gender inequality persists in many workplaces. Studies show that women often face barriers in career advancement and earn less than men for comparable work. So, it's unlikely that most women think opportunities are equal.\n\nOption C states that most men believe women should be homemakers because men earn more money. That seems pretty outdated. While there might be some men who hold that view, I don't think it represents the majority. Societal attitudes have shifted, and more men support gender equality in the workplace and at home. So, this probably isn't correct.\n\nOption D says that most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives. This seems plausible. Even when both partners work, women often still\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5bb6\u52a1\u548c childcare responsibilities. Studies have shown that men's participation in household chores has increased over time, but gender disparities persist. So, this might be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A seems inconsistent with data I've seen. Option B contradicts known gender inequalities. Option C appears too general and outdated. Option D aligns with research on gendered division of labor in the home.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
