A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:\"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. \"Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen.

As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal question. So, there's a permanent resident alien who wants to be a state trooper, but the state has a law saying only U.S. citizens can be state troopers. The alien has been living in the U.S. for two years but needs to live here for five years to become a citizen. He can't take the exam because he's not a citizen, and he's challenging the law in court.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking whether the court will likely declare the statute constitutional or unconstitutional, and why. The options are:\n\nA. Constitutional, because it's within the state's power to regulate health, safety, and welfare.\n\nB. Constitutional, because citizenship is related to the needs of the police job.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, because it violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, because it violates the Due Process Clause.\n\nSo, I need to think about the constitutionality of a law that requires state troopers to be U.S. citizens.\n\nLet me start by considering the state's perspective. The state thinks that only U.S. citizens should be state troopers because they are important officials involved in executing public policy. The Attorney General even supported this view, saying that these positions should only be held by citizens.\n\nNow, from the alien's perspective, he's a permanent resident, he's living in the U.S., paying taxes, maybe even serving in other capacities, but he can't be a state trooper because he's not a citizen yet. He's challenging the law, saying it's unconstitutional.\n\nI need to think about which constitutional provision this might be violating. The most likely candidate is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. So, if the state is treating citizens and non-citizens differently, that could be a problem under Equal Protection.\n\nBut, states are allowed to make distinctions sometimes; they just need to have a good reason. So, I need to consider whether requiring state troopers to be citizens is a reasonable requirement or if it's discriminatory.\n\nOption A says it's constitutional because it's within the state's police power to regulate health, safety, and welfare. That makes sense because law enforcement is definitely about maintaining public safety. So, maybe the state has a legitimate interest in ensuring that only citizens are in these positions of authority.\n\nOption B says it's constitutional because citizenship is related to the needs of the police function. This seems similar to Option A. It suggests that being a citizen is somehow necessary or at least helpful for performing the duties of a state trooper.\n\nOption C says it's unconstitutional because it violates Equal Protection. This would mean that the law is treating citizens and non-citizens differently in a way that's not justified.\n\nOption D says it's unconstitutional because it violates Due Process. Due Process is about how laws are applied, whether they are fair and reasonable. But in this case, it seems more about discrimination based on citizenship, which is more about Equal Protection.\n\nSo, between A, B, C, and D, I think the decision will likely be either A or C. B seems similar to A, and D doesn't seem directly applicable here.\n\nLet me consider some case law or legal principles that might apply here.\n\nI recall that there are different levels of scrutiny when it comes to Equal Protection cases. If a law discriminates based on race or ethnicity, it's subject to strict scrutiny, meaning the state has to show a really compelling reason for the discrimination. But here, the discrimination is based on citizenship, which might be different.\n\nFor citizenship-based distinctions, the standard is usually rational basis review, which means the law just needs to be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. That's a pretty low bar, and states usually win under this standard.\n\nBut, there might be some intermediate scrutiny if the classification affects a quasi-suspect class. Non-citizens might be considered a quasi-suspect class in some contexts, which would require the state to show that the law is substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nI need to think about whether non-citizens are a quasi-suspect class. I think in some cases, they are, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up, but since this is a hypothetical, I'll have to make do with what I know.\n\nAssuming that non-citizens are a quasi-suspect class, then the state would need to show that the citizenship requirement is substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nNow, what is the government's interest here? They say that state troopers are important officials who participate directly in executing public policy, so only citizens should hold these positions.\n\nIs that a valid interest? Well, ensuring loyalty and trust in law enforcement could be important for the state. Citizens are presumed to have a higher level of commitment to the country and its values, perhaps.\n\nBut, does that mean that non-citizens can't be trusted or are less qualified? Not necessarily. Many permanent residents are here legally, plan to become citizens, and are law-abiding individuals. Maybe they can be just as trustworthy as citizens.\n\nAlso, there might be qualified non-citizens who are barred from these positions solely based on their citizenship status, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the state has the right to set qualifications for its employees, especially for positions of public trust and authority.\n\nSo, it's a balancing act. The state has an interest in maintaining public safety and trust in its law enforcement, but at the same time, it can't discriminate without a good reason.\n\nGiven that, I think the court would likely uphold the statute under rational basis review, saying that there is a rational relationship between requiring citizenship and the needs of the police function.\n\nAlternatively, if the court applies intermediate scrutiny, it would examine whether the citizenship requirement is substantially related to an important government interest. If the state can show that having citizens in these positions is important for maintaining public trust and loyalty, the court might still uphold the law.\n\nTherefore, options A and B seem plausible.\n\nOption C suggests that the statute violates Equal Protection. For this to be the case, the court would have to find that the citizenship requirement is not sufficiently related to the state's interests, or that it's impermissibly discriminatory.\n\nGiven that citizenship requirements for certain jobs are common, especially in law enforcement and other positions involving national security, I think it's less likely that the court would find a violation of Equal Protection.\n\nOption D, due process, seems less relevant here, as the issue is more about classification and discrimination rather than the procedures used to apply the law.\n\nTherefore, I think the court will most likely declare the statute constitutional, either because it's within the state's police power or because citizenship is rationally related to the police function.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A or B. Since A mentions the state's plenary power to regulate health, safety, and welfare, and B mentions the rational relationship to the police function, both could be correct, but A seems a bit broader.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is A, as it encompasses the state's general authority to regulate in this area, and the citizenship requirement is a part of that regulation.\n\nBut, to be thorough, I should consider if there are any Supreme Court cases that address similar issues.\n\nI recall that in Sugarman v. Dougall, the Supreme Court held that a New York statute requiring that only citizens could hold permanent civil service positions violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Court applied rational basis review and found that the state had not demonstrated a sufficient justification for the citizenship requirement.\n\nHowever, that was in 1973, and it involved civil service positions, not law enforcement. So, it might not be directly applicable here.\n\nIn other cases, like Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, also from 1976, the Court struck down a federal statute that required citizenship for certain civil service positions, again under Equal Protection.\n\nBut again, these cases involved general civil service positions, not law enforcement. Law enforcement positions might be treated differently due to the sensitive nature of the job.\n\nIn fact, in Foley v. Connelie, from 1987, the Supreme Court upheld a New York statute that required firefighters to be citizens. The Court found that the state had a compelling interest in ensuring the loyalty and trustworthiness of firefighters.\n\nSimilarly, in Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court upheld a citizenship requirement for certain executive appointments, emphasizing the importance of loyalty in high-ranking positions.\n\nGiven these cases, it seems that citizenship requirements for certain positions, especially those involving national security or public trust, are more likely to be upheld.\n\nTherefore, in the context of state troopers, who are law enforcement officers with broad police authority, the citizenship requirement is likely to be upheld as constitutional.\n\nSo, the court will most likely choose option A or B.\n\nBetween A and B, I think A is a better answer because it refers to the state's plenary power to regulate health, safety, and welfare, which is a fundamental aspect of state sovereignty. Law enforcement is clearly within this realm.\n\nOption B, while correct in that citizenship bears a rational relationship to the police function, is perhaps too narrow. The state's authority isn't just about rational relationships; it's about the state's inherent power to protect its citizens and maintain order.\n\nTherefore, I think the most likely outcome is that the court will declare the statute constitutional based on the state's plenary power to regulate health, safety, and welfare.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
