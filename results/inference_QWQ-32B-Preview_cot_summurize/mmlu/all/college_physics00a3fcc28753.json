According to special relativity, when an object is moving relative to an observer, its length in the direction of motion is contracted. The formula for length contraction is:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the length measured by the observer,\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the proper length (the length in the object's rest frame),\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of the object relative to the observer,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, the proper length \\( L_0 \\) is 1.00 m, and the observed length \\( L \\) is 0.80 m. We need to find the speed \\( v \\) at which the observer must be moving relative to the rod to measure this contracted length.\n\nLet's plug in the known values into the length contraction formula:\n\n\\[ 0.80 = 1.00 \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nFirst, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 1.00:\n\n\\[ 0.80 = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nNext, we'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[ (0.80)^2 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\n\\[ 0.64 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.64 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.36 \\]\n\nTo find \\( v \\), we take the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{0.36} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = 0.60 \\]\n\nTherefore, the speed \\( v \\) is:\n\n\\[ v = 0.60c \\]\n\nSo, the observer must move at 0.60 times the speed of light relative to the rod to measure its length as 0.80 m.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.50c\nB. 0.60c\nC. 0.70c\nD. 0.80c\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.60c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
