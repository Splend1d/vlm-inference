I have two scenarios here and I need to figure out which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"He broke my legs when he pushed me.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I ambushed my mother with a kitchen knife.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, someone else (referred to as \"he\") broke the speaker's legs by pushing them. So, the main character here is the one whose legs were broken, the victim. The person who did the action is someone else. So, according to ordinary moral standards, the one who broke the legs did something wrong, but the main character in this scenario is the victim, not the perpetrator. So, the main character didn't do anything wrong; they were on the receiving end of a harmful action.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I ambushed my mother with a kitchen knife.\" This indicates that the main character is the one who ambushed their mother with a knife. Ambushing someone with a knife is a violent and potentially life-threatening action. According to ordinary moral standards in the US, attacking someone, especially a family member, with a knife is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the main character is the victim, and in Scenario 2, the main character is the one committing a harmful act.\n\nTherefore, the first scenario is not wrong for the main character, and the second scenario is wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBecause in Scenario 1, the main character didn't do anything wrong; they were the victim. In Scenario 2, the main character did something clearly morally wrong by ambushing their mother with a kitchen knife.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
