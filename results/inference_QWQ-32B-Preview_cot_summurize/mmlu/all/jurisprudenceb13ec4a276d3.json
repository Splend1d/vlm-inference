                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question. It's about identifying which school of jurisprudence views law as a tool for achieving sociological goals. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Historical - I think this school looks at the evolution of law over time, considering its history and how it has developed through tradition and past decisions. It doesn't seem directly focused on advancing sociological goals.\n\nB. Analytical - This one might be about analyzing the structure and language of law, perhaps focusing on legal rules and their application. Again, it doesn't immediately suggest a focus on sociological objectives.\n\nC. Command - I believe this refers to the idea that law is essentially a command from a sovereign authority. It's more about the source of law rather than its role in achieving social goals.\n\nD. Sociological - This seems promising. If there's a school that focuses on law's relationship with society and its role in advancing social goals, it would likely be called the Sociological School.\n\nGiven these brief considerations, I think the answer is D. Sociological. But I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nLet me recall what I know about the Sociological School of jurisprudence. It emphasizes the connection between law and society, suggesting that law should be understood in the context of social facts and should aim to serve social interests and goals. This aligns with the statement in the question.\n\nOn the other hand, the Historical School, as I recall, focuses on the evolutionary aspect of law, looking at how legal principles have developed over time through customs, traditions, and precedents. It's more about the past and less about current social goals.\n\nThe Analytical School, also known as the Pure Theory of Law, is concerned with the logical analysis of legal concepts and the structure of legal systems. It aims to clarify legal language and thought but doesn't necessarily focus on law's role in achieving social objectives.\n\nThe Command School, associated with legal positivism, defines law as a set of commands issued by a sovereign and backed by sanctions. This view is more about the authoritative nature of law rather than its function in advancing social goals.\n\nTherefore, among these options, the Sociological School is the one that asserts law is a means to achieve and advance certain sociological goals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
