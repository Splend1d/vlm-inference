On the woman's first day at work, she noticed a sign in the kitchen area that read:\"IMPORTANT NOTICE TO ALL EMPLOYEESEmployees are not permitted to smoke during working hours. Any employee who is found to be in violation of this policy will be fined $50 for the first offense; $100 for the second offense; and fired for the third violation. \"The woman, who was a smoker, read the notice, but did not object or make any comment regarding the restaurant's nonsmoking policy. For six months, the woman worked at the restaurant and never smoked during business hours. One afternoon, the woman was working when an armed robber stormed into the restaurant. He pointed a pistol at the woman and demanded all the money from the cash register. Frightened and panic stricken, the woman handed over the money and then collapsed. Moments later, she regained consciousness and then smoked a cigarette while she regained her composure. Thereafter, the woman resumed her duties for the rest of the day. The next week, however, when the woman received her pay check, she noticed that the restaurant had deducted $50 from her check. A note was attached indicating that the woman was being fined for smoking during business hours. Although the woman protested, the restaurant refused to make any waiver and stood by its policy. In an action by the woman against the restaurant to recover the $50, which of the following is the best argument in the woman's favor?\n\nA. The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.\nB. The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.\nC. The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.\nD. The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which argument is best for the woman in this situation. So, she was hired as a cashier under an at-will employment contract, which generally means either party can end the employment at any time without cause. But there's this nonsmoking policy with fines and termination for repeated offenses.\n\nFirst, she saw the sign on her first day, didn't object, and worked for six months without smoking during work hours. Then, one day, an armed robber came in, she handed over the money, collapsed, and when she came to, she smoked a cigarette to compose herself. After that, she went back to work for the rest of the day. The next week, she found $50 deducted from her paycheck for smoking during work hours, and the restaurant stood by its policy.\n\nShe's suing to get the $50 back. So, I need to look at the options and see which one is the strongest argument in her favor.\n\nOption A says: \"The restaurant's nonsmoking policy concerned a collateral matter that was not incorporated within the terms of their employment contract.\"\n\nHmm, at-will employment can still have terms and conditions, even if the employment itself can be terminated at any time. The nonsmoking policy seems like a condition of employment that she agreed to by not objecting and continuing to work. So, maybe this isn't the strongest argument.\n\nOption B: \"The restaurant impliedly waived the nonsmoking provision by permitting the woman to continue working for the rest of the day.\"\n\nWaiver typically requires some indication that the party is giving up their right to enforce a rule. Here, the restaurant let her continue working after she smoked, but they still deducted the fine later. So, maybe they didn't waive the policy; they just chose not to fire her immediately. This might not be the best argument.\n\nOption C: \"The nonsmoking provision constituted a constructive condition subsequent that was excused because of temporary impracticability.\"\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. A condition subsequent is something that, if it occurs, affects the parties' rights under the contract. Impracticability might relate to impossibility or difficulty in performing the condition due to some event. In this case, the armed robbery could be considered an extraordinary event that made it impracticable for her to avoid smoking at that moment. So, this could be a plausible argument.\n\nOption D: \"The nonsmoking provision concerning disciplinary action is unenforceable, because it attempts to impose a penalty instead of reasonably liquidating the damages, if any, sustained by the restaurant.\"\n\nThis argument suggests that the fine is punitive rather than compensatory. In contract law, liquidated damages are pre-agreed sums to compensate for potential damages, whereas penalties are unenforceable if they're meant to punish rather than compensate. Here, the fine seems more like a penalty for breaking the rule rather than compensating for any specific damage the restaurant incurred from her smoking once.\n\nConsidering these options, I think option D is the strongest argument for the woman. The nonsmoking policy imposes fines that seem punitive, and there might not be any actual damages the restaurant suffered from her smoking one cigarette after a traumatic event. So, arguing that the fine is unenforceable because it's a penalty could be her best bet.\n\nBut let's think about option C again. The armed robbery was an extraordinary event that caused her to smoke as a way to cope with the trauma. Maybe the court could find that the condition was excused due to impracticability because of the exceptional circumstances. This could also be a strong argument.\n\nComparing C and D, I think D is more directly applicable because it challenges the enforceability of the fine itself, whereas C requires showing that the condition was excused due to impracticability. While both could work, D might be more straightforward.\n\nSo, I'll go with option D as the best argument in the woman's favor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
