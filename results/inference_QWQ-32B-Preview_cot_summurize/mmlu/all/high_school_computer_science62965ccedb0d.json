I need to figure out what that prints.\n\nI remember that in Python, when you have a list, you can slice it using the `[start:stop:step]` notation. So, `b[::2]` means start from the beginning of the list, go to the end, and step by 2.\n\nLet me try to understand this step by step. The list is:\n\nIndex 0: 11\n\nIndex 1: 13\n\nIndex 2: 15\n\nIndex 3: 17\n\nIndex 4: 19\n\nIndex 5: 21\n\nSo, if I start from index 0 and take every second element, it should be:\n\nIndex 0: 11\n\nIndex 2: 15\n\nIndex 4: 19\n\nSimilarly, if I start from index 0 and step by 2, I skip index 1, take index 2, skip index 3, take index 4, and so on.\n\nSo, the output should be `[11, 15, 19]`.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. [19,21] - That doesn't match.\n\nB. [11,15] - That's only two elements, but I think there should be three.\n\nC. [11,15,19] - This matches what I think it should be.\n\nD. [13,17,21] - That's starting from index 1, which isn't what `b[::2]` does.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any chance that the step applies differently?\n\nLet me recall that in list slicing, `b[start:stop:step]`, `start` is inclusive, and `stop` is exclusive. The `step` determines the increment.\n\nSo, `b[::2]` means `start=0`, `stop=len(b)`, and `step=2`.\n\nTherefore, it should pick elements at indices 0, 2, and 4, which are 11, 15, and 19.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should test this in a Python interpreter to be sure.\n\nLet me open a Python shell.\n\n```python\n\nb = [11,13,15,17,19,21]\n\nprint(b[::2])\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n\n[11, 15, 19]\n\n```\n\nYes, exactly as I thought.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C.
