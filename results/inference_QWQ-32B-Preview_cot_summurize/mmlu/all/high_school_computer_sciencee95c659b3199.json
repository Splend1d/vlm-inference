Translating a program written in an abstract, high-level language into a program with the same behavior expressed in machine code\n\nExplanation:\nThe primary role of a compiler in the process of developing executable software is to translate human-readable source code, written in a high-level programming language, into machine code that can be directly executed by a computer's hardware. This translation process involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The end result is an executable file that performs the behaviors specified in the original source code but in a form that the computer can understand and execute efficiently.\n\nOption A, managing specification files, is not primarily the role of a compiler. Specification files are often managed by version control systems or build tools.\n\nOption B, running and testing the executable, is typically the responsibility of a separate testing framework or the programmer themselves, not the compiler.\n\nOption C, tracking older versions of the software, is usually handled by version control systems like Git, SVN, etc., not by the compiler.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it accurately describes the core function of a compiler in software development."
