                    "text": "So I've got this question here about abortion and morality, and it's asking which theory approaches the morality of abortion by considering how much overall intrinsic value is likely to be brought about by abortion. The options are virtue ethics, consequentialist theory, Kantian ethics, and natural law theory. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"intrinsic value\" means. In philosophy, intrinsic value refers to the inherent worth of something, meaning its value in and of itself, not just as a means to an end. So, if a theory considers the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion, it's looking at the moral rightness or wrongness based on the inherent worth of the actions and their outcomes.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Virtue ethics: This theory focuses on the character of the moral agent rather than on the consequences of specific actions or adherence to rules. It's about cultivating good character traits and virtues. So, in the context of abortion, a virtue ethicist might consider whether choosing to have an abortion aligns with virtues like compassion, wisdom, or responsibility. But it's not primarily concerned with the overall intrinsic value of the outcome itself. So, maybe not the best fit here.\n\nB. Consequentialist theory: This is a type of moral theory that assesses the rightness of actions based on their consequences. The most well-known consequentialist theory is utilitarianism, which aims to maximize overall happiness or utility. In this framework, the morality of abortion would be judged by whether it leads to the greatest overall intrinsic value, perhaps in terms of happiness, well-being, or other positive outcomes. This seems pretty relevant to the question.\n\nC. Kantian ethics: Immanuel Kant's moral theory is deontological, meaning it's based on duties and rules rather than consequences. Kant is famous for his categorical imperative, which includes treating people always as ends in themselves, never merely as means to an end. In the context of abortion, a Kantian might consider whether abortion respects the dignity and autonomy of the individuals involved. However, it's not primarily concerned with the overall intrinsic value of the outcome but rather with adherence to moral laws and respect for persons.\n\nD. Natural law theory: This theory is based on the idea that moral law is derived from the natural order and the purposes inherent in human nature. In the context of abortion, natural law theorists might argue that abortion is immoral because it goes against the natural purpose of human life. It's more about what is natural and aligned with human essence rather than assessing the intrinsic value of the outcomes.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems like consequentialist theory is the one that directly considers the overall intrinsic value brought about by abortion, as it evaluates moral actions based on their outcomes and the value those outcomes possess.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about how each theory would approach abortion.\n\n- Virtue ethics would look at the character of the person making the decision and whether their choice aligns with virtuous qualities.\n\n- Consequentialist theory would look at the overall consequences and whether abortion leads to a net increase in intrinsic value, perhaps by considering the well-being of the mother, the potential child, and others involved.\n\n- Kantian ethics would focus on whether abortion treats all individuals involved as ends in themselves, respecting their dignity and autonomy.\n\n- Natural law theory would consider whether abortion aligns with the natural purposes and ends inherent in human life.\n\nSo, indeed, consequentialist theory seems to be the one that specifically evaluates morality based on the overall intrinsic value of the outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. consequentialist theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
