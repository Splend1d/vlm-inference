It's like when you vote or write to your representative, you feel that your voice matters and can influence decisions.\n\nOption A seems more about how political parties might counterbalance corporate influence, which is related but not exactly about individual efficacy.\n\nOption C talks about the system of checks and balances making government efficient and productive, which is about the structure of government, not about individuals' beliefs in their own power.\n\nOption D is about politicians' duty to inform constituents about democracy, which is important, but again, it's not directly about individuals feeling effective in their participation.\n\nSo, I think B is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
