                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we have a widow who owns an apartment building, and a student who signed a three-year lease for an apartment in that building. The lease was for three years, paying $800 monthly for the third-floor apartment. Now, the three-year term is over, but the student is still paying rent, and the widow is still accepting it.\n\nThe question is, if the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, before accepting the next rent check, what would be the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, assuming it's true?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The leasehold contract was void ab initio.\n\nB. The widow had not given the student requisite notice for terminating a periodic tenancy.\n\nC. The widow had not given the student requisite notice for terminating a term of years.\n\nD. The terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.\n\nFirst, let's understand what happened here. The original lease was for three years, and that term has expired. After the expiration, the student continued to pay rent, and the widow continued to accept it. This suggests that a new tenancy arrangement has been established.\n\nIn lease law, when a fixed-term lease expires, and both parties continue to act as if the lease is still in effect (by paying rent and accepting it), this can create a periodic tenancy, often month-to-month, depending on the payment frequency.\n\nNow, if the widow wants to evict the student at the end of the original lease term, she would need to follow the proper procedures for terminating a periodic tenancy, which usually involves giving the tenant proper notice.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Void ab initio means \"void from the beginning.\" If the lease was void ab initio, it would mean that it was never valid to begin with. However, the problem states that there was a signed writing for a three-year lease, which suggests that the lease was valid. So, this doesn't seem like the strongest argument.\n\nB. This option refers to terminating a periodic tenancy. Since the original lease has expired, and the student is paying rent on a monthly basis, it's likely that a month-to-month tenancy has been created. In this case, the widow would need to give the student the requisite notice to terminate this periodic tenancy before evicting them.\n\nC. Terminating a term of years typically refers to the end of a fixed-term lease. In this case, the three-year term has expired, so this option doesn't seem directly applicable.\n\nD. The terms of the leasehold contract being binding on both parties refers to the original three-year lease. However, since that term has expired, the binding terms likely no longer apply, unless there's some provision for automatic renewal, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems to be the strongest argument. The student could argue that even though the original lease has expired, they are now in a periodic tenancy (likely month-to-month), and the widow needs to provide the appropriate notice to terminate this tenancy before evicting the student.\n\nAdditionally, if the widow had accepted the next rent check after the original term expired, it might imply that she is agreeing to a new tenancy arrangement, possibly another fixed term or continuing the periodic tenancy. But since the problem states that the widow had not yet accepted the next rent check at the time she chose to evict, that hasn't happened yet.\n\nTherefore, the student's strongest argument would be that the widow hasn't provided the requisite notice for terminating the periodic tenancy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
