It was launched in 1954 and made its first submerged transit under the North Pole on August 3, 1958. The Nautilus revolutionized submarine technology by providing virtually unlimited range and endurance, as it didn't need to surface for air or refuel like conventional submarines.\n\nOption B, Neptune, is not a submarine but a Roman god of the sea and also the name of a NASA space mission. Option C, Nordenfelt III, was an early submarine designed by Thorsten Nordenfelt in the late 19th century, but it was not nuclear-powered. Option D, Nicholas, does not refer to any known historical submarine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Nautilus."
