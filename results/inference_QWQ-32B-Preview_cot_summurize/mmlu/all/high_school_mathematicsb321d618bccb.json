                    "text": "So I have this problem about amoebas splitting every day, and I need to figure out how many there are after one week. Let's see.\n\nStarting with one amoeba, and each day every amoeba splits into two. So, it's like doubling the number each day.\n\nLet me try to map this out day by day.\n\nDay 0: 1 amoeba (the initial one)\n\nDay 1: that one splits into 2\n\nDay 2: each of those 2 splits into 2, so 4\n\nDay 3: each of those 4 splits into 2, so 8\n\nDay 4: each of those 8 splits into 2, so 16\n\nDay 5: each of those 16 splits into 2, so 32\n\nDay 6: each of those 32 splits into 2, so 64\n\nDay 7: each of those 64 splits into 2, so 128\n\nWait, but that seems off. Because if I double each day, starting from 1, then after 7 days, it should be 2^7, which is 128. But let's check the options.\n\nA. 256 B. 1024 C. 64 D. 128\n\nSo, 128 is an option. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. The problem says \"after one week,\" which is 7 days, and starting from day 0.\n\nLet me think differently. If it splits every day, including the first day.\n\nDay 0: 1 amoeba\n\nDay 1: splits into 2\n\nDay 2: each of those 2 splits into 2, so 4\n\nDay 3: each of those 4 splits into 2, so 8\n\nDay 4: each of those 8 splits into 2, so 16\n\nDay 5: each of those 16 splits into 2, so 32\n\nDay 6: each of those 32 splits into 2, so 64\n\nDay 7: each of those 64 splits into 2, so 128\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, after 7 days, there should be 128 amoebas.\n\nBut wait, maybe the splitting happens at the end of each day, so including day 0 as the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes these problems can be tricky with the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of exponential growth. Each day, the number of amoebas doubles.\n\nSo, starting with 1 amoeba, after n days, the number is 2^n.\n\nBut, 2^7 is 128, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 128 is option D, and 256 is option A.\n\nWait, 2^8 is 256, but that would be after 8 days, which is more than one week.\n\nWait, is one week 7 days or 8 days?\n\nWell, a week has 7 days, so n = 7.\n\nTherefore, 2^7 = 128.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider whether the initial day is included.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nDay 0: 1 amoeba\n\nDay 1: splits into 2\n\nDay 2: splits again, 4\n\nDay 3: splits again, 8\n\nDay 4: splits again, 16\n\nDay 5: splits again, 32\n\nDay 6: splits again, 64\n\nDay 7: splits again, 128\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they consider day 1 as the first splitting day, which would make it 2^6 = 64, but that doesn't match the wording.\n\nThe problem says \"after one week,\" which is 7 days, and starting from day 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"after one week\" means at the end of day 7.\n\nIn that case, starting with 1 amoeba on day 0, after 7 days of splitting, it should be 2^7 = 128.\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should consider that on day n, the amoebas split into two, so at the end of day n, the number doubles.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAt the start of day 0: 1 amoeba\n\nEnd of day 0: splits into 2\n\nEnd of day 1: each splits into 2, so 4\n\nEnd of day 2: each splits into 2, so 8\n\nEnd of day 3: each splits into 2, so 16\n\nEnd of day 4: each splits into 2, so 32\n\nEnd of day 5: each splits into 2, so 64\n\nEnd of day 6: each splits into 2, so 128\n\nEnd of day 7: each splits into 2, so 256\n\nWait a minute, now I have 256 at the end of day 7.\n\nSo, if \"after one week\" means after 7 days, then it would be 256.\n\nBut earlier, I had 128 at the end of day 7.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the timing of the splitting.\n\nDoes the amoeba split at the end of each day, or at the beginning?\n\nIf it splits at the end of each day, then:\n\nStart of day 0: 1 amoeba\n\nEnd of day 0: splits into 2\n\nStart of day 1: 2 amoebas\n\nEnd of day 1: each splits into 2, so 4\n\n...\n\nEnd of day 6: 128\n\nEnd of day 7: 256\n\nSo, after one week (end of day 7), there would be 256 amoebas.\n\nBut 256 is option A.\n\nHowever, perhaps \"after one week\" means at the end of day 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first splitting happens on day 1.\n\nWait, the problem says \"on that same day it splits into two amoebas. The next day, each new amoeba splits into two new amoebas, and so on, so that each day every living amoeba splits into two new amoebas.\"\n\nSo, day 0: 1 amoeba\n\nDay 1: splits into 2\n\nDay 2: each splits into 2, so 4\n\n...\n\nDay 7: splits into 128\n\nWait, but according to this, at the end of day 7, it's 128.\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, it's 256.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to define it differently.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n- At the start of day 0, there is 1 amoeba.\n\n- At the end of day 0, it splits into 2.\n\n- At the end of day 1, each of those 2 splits into 2, making 4.\n\n- At the end of day 2, each of those 4 splits into 2, making 8.\n\n...\n\n- At the end of day 6, each of 64 splits into 2, making 128.\n\n- At the end of day 7, each of those 128 splits into 2, making 256.\n\nSo, at the end of day 7, there are 256 amoebas.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 256.\n\nBut perhaps the problem considers \"after one week\" as the end of day 6, since day 0 is the first day.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as a week has 7 days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are considering day 0 as part of the first day.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the number of amoebas at the start of each day.\n\nStart of day 0: 1 amoeba\n\nEnd of day 0: splits into 2\n\nStart of day 1: 2 amoebas\n\nEnd of day 1: each splits into 2, so 4\n\nStart of day 2: 4 amoebas\n\n...\n\nEnd of day 6: 128\n\nStart of day 7: 128 amoebas\n\nEnd of day 7: each splits into 2, so 256\n\nTherefore, at the end of day 7, there are 256 amoebas.\n\nSo, the answer should be 256.\n\nBut the options include 128 and 256, so perhaps I need to check which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the amoeba splits at the beginning of each day.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\nStart of day 0: 1 amoeba splits into 2\n\nEnd of day 0: 2 amoebas\n\nStart of day 1: 2 amoebas split into 4\n\nEnd of day 1: 4 amoebas\n\n...\n\nStart of day 6: 64 split into 128\n\nEnd of day 6: 128\n\nStart of day 7: 128 split into 256\n\nEnd of day 7: 256\n\nAgain, 256 at the end of day 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"after one week\" means at the start of day 7, before splitting.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the splitting happens continuously, but the problem specifies daily splitting.\n\nI think the safest approach is to consider that at the end of each day, the amoebas split into two.\n\nTherefore, after 7 days, starting with 1 amoeba, the number is 2^7 = 128.\n\nBut according to my previous calculation, it's 256.\n\nWait, 2^7 is 128, but in the sequence:\n\nDay 0: 1 \u2192 2\n\nDay 1: 2 \u2192 4\n\nDay 2: 4 \u2192 8\n\nDay 3: 8 \u2192 16\n\nDay 4: 16 \u2192 32\n\nDay 5: 32 \u2192 64\n\nDay 6: 64 \u2192 128\n\nDay 7: 128 \u2192 256\n\nSo, at the end of day 7, it's 256.\n\nBut 2^7 should be 128.\n\nWait, 2^8 is 256.\n\nWait, 2^0 = 1\n\n2^1 = 2\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n2^4 = 16\n\n2^5 = 32\n\n2^6 = 64\n\n2^7 = 128\n\n2^8 = 256\n\nSo, after 7 days, it should be 128.\n\nBut according to the sequence above, it's 256 at the end of day 7.\n\nI must have miscounted.\n\nWait, let's re-examine.\n\nIf day 0 starts with 1 amoeba, and at the end of day 0, it splits into 2.\n\nThen, at the end of day 1, each of those 2 splits into 2, making 4.\n\nAt the end of day 2, each of those 4 splits into 2, making 8.\n\nAt the end of day 3, each of those 8 splits into 2, making 16.\n\nAt the end of day 4, each of those 16 splits into 2, making 32.\n\nAt the end of day 5, each of those 32 splits into 2, making 64.\n\nAt the end of day 6, each of those 64 splits into 2, making 128.\n\nAt the end of day 7, each of those 128 splits into 2, making 256.\n\nTherefore, at the end of day 7, there are 256 amoebas.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 256.\n\nBut perhaps the problem considers \"after one week\" as the end of day 6.\n\nIn that case, it would be 128.\n\nBut traditionally, a week has 7 days.\n\nThis is likely the point of confusion.\n\nTo resolve this, I need to clarify what \"after one week\" means in this context.\n\nIf \"after one week\" means at the end of day 7, then it's 256.\n\nIf it means at the end of day 6, then it's 128.\n\nGiven that a week has 7 days, it's more likely to be at the end of day 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 256.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 256 is option A, and 128 is option D.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A. 256.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the amoeba splits at the beginning of each day.\n\nIf that's the case:\n\nStart of day 0: 1 amoeba splits into 2\n\nEnd of day 0: 2 amoebas\n\nStart of day 1: 2 amoebas split into 4\n\nEnd of day 1: 4 amoebas\n\n...\n\nStart of day 6: 64 split into 128\n\nEnd of day 6: 128\n\nStart of day 7: 128 split into 256\n\nEnd of day 7: 256\n\nAgain, 256 at the end of day 7.\n\nAlternatively, if \"after one week\" means before the splitting on day 7 occurs, then it would be 128.\n\nBut the problem says \"after one week,\" which probably means at the end of day 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 256.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 256.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{256} \\]"
