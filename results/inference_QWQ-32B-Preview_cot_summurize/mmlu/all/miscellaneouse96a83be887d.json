                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following parts of the Sun is easily visible only during a total solar eclipse? A. Core B. Photosphere C. Sunspots D. Corona.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which part of the Sun can only be seen easily during a total solar eclipse.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a total solar eclipse is. I know that it's when the Moon completely covers the Sun's disk, blocking its light. So, during this time, the Sun's bright surface is obscured, and maybe some other parts become visible that aren't normally seen.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Core - The Sun's core is its innermost part, where nuclear reactions occur. It's deeply buried beneath the Sun's surface, and we can't see it directly at all, even during an eclipse. So, probably not this one.\n\nB. Photosphere - I think the photosphere is the visible surface of the Sun. That's what we see normally, right? So, during an eclipse, when the Moon covers the Sun, the photosphere should be covered as well. Therefore, it shouldn't be easily visible during an eclipse.\n\nC. Sunspots - These are darker areas on the photosphere, caused by magnetic activity. Since the photosphere is covered during a total eclipse, I'm not sure about sunspots. Maybe they're not visible then.\n\nD. Corona - I've heard about the Sun's corona; it's the outer atmosphere of the Sun, extending millions of kilometers into space. I think it's very faint, and normally overwhelmed by the brightness of the Sun's surface, so it's hard to see unless the Sun's disk is blocked.\n\nWait a minute, during a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the Sun's disk, which includes the photosphere. This should make the corona visible around the Moon's edge, since it's brighter than the background sky.\n\nLet me double-check. The corona is always there, but it's too faint to see next to the bright photosphere. When the photosphere is blocked by the Moon, the corona becomes visible.\n\nSo, during a total solar eclipse, the corona is easily visible, whereas at other times, special instruments called coronagraphs are used to block the Sun's disk and observe the corona.\n\nWhat about sunspots? Sunspots are on the photosphere, which is covered during the eclipse. So, they wouldn't be visible during an eclipse.\n\nWait, maybe sunspots could be seen if they're near the edge of the Sun when it's partially eclipsed, but I think during a total eclipse, when the entire photosphere is covered, sunspots wouldn't be visible.\n\nThe photosphere itself is covered by the Moon during a total eclipse, so it's not visible then.\n\nThe core is never visible, as it's deep inside the Sun.\n\nSo, that leaves the corona as the part of the Sun that is easily visible only during a total solar eclipse.\n\nI think the answer is D. Corona.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
