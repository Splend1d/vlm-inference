Statement 1 says, \"ImageNet has images of various resolutions.\" And Statement 2 says, \"Caltech-101 has more images than ImageNet.\" I need to figure out if each of these is true or false and then choose the correct option from A to D.\n\nFirst, ImageNet. I know that ImageNet is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. It has a huge number of images, and they are organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, which groups images into thousands of categories.\n\nNow, about resolutions. I think ImageNet includes images of different sizes because they come from various sources. People submit images, and there isn't a strict rule on the resolution. So, it's likely that ImageNet has images in various resolutions. That makes Statement 1 probably true.\n\nNext, Caltech-101. This is another dataset, but it's smaller compared to ImageNet. Caltech-101 is a dataset containing 101 categories with about 40 to 800 images per category, totaling around 9,000 images. ImageNet, on the other hand, has over a million images. So, comparing the number of images, ImageNet has way more images than Caltech-101. That means Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false. Looking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice should be C. True, False.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering the sizes of these datasets.\n\nImageNet is indeed very large, with millions of images, while Caltech-101 is much smaller, with just a few thousand images. So, yes, ImageNet has more images than Caltech-101, which means Statement 2 is false.\n\nAnd regarding ImageNet having images of various resolutions, that makes sense because the images are collected from the internet and aren't uniformly resized unless specified by the dataset creators. But I think in the original ImageNet dataset, images retain their original resolutions.\n\nSo, I believe C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
