                    "text": " Let's see what Shapiro is saying here. He claims that surveys backed by longitudinal studies confirm something about illegal drug use. We have four options, and I need to figure out which one is being supported by these studies.\n\nOption A says that excessive use of illegal drugs is the norm. Hmm, that seems pretty severe. Is that what the studies are showing? I doubt it, but maybe.\n\nOption B says moderate and/or controlled use of illegal drugs is the norm. This seems more plausible. Maybe most people who use illegal drugs do so in a controlled manner.\n\nOption C says that an individual's illegal drug use inevitably diminishes over time. So, people who use illegal drugs tend to use less as time goes on. That could be possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D says that those who begin using illegal drugs typically do not stop until they become addicted. That sounds like a pretty strong statement. Is that what the studies show?\n\nI need to think about this carefully. Longitudinal studies track the same subjects over a period of time, so they can provide insights into how drug use patterns change over time.\n\nLet me consider option A first: excessive use is the norm. If surveys and longitudinal studies confirm this, it would mean that most people who use illegal drugs use them excessively. But from what I know, drug use varies widely among individuals, and excessive use might be a minority.\n\nOption B suggests that moderate or controlled use is normal. This seems more in line with what I've heard. Many people can use drugs recreationally without developing addiction or experiencing negative consequences.\n\nOption C says that drug use inevitably diminishes over time. Inevitably is a strong word. While it's possible that as people age, they use less drugs, saying it's inevitable might not be accurate for everyone.\n\nOption D claims that once people start using illegal drugs, they don't stop until they're addicted. That sounds like a sweeping generalization. Not everyone who tries drugs becomes addicted.\n\nI think the key here is understanding what \"the norm\" means. It refers to the most common pattern or behavior.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most plausible. Moderate and controlled use being the norm would mean that most people who use illegal drugs do so in a way that doesn't lead to excessive use or addiction.\n\nOption A, about excessive use being normal, doesn't align with my understanding of drug use patterns. Most drug users don't fall into the category of excessive or problematic use.\n\nOption C suggests a universal trend of diminishing use over time, which might not be the case for everyone. Some people may continue using at the same level, or even increase their use.\n\nOption D promotes a deterministic view that starting drug use leads inevitably to addiction, which isn't supported by evidence. Many people use drugs occasionally without developing addiction.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option B is the correct answer: moderate and/or controlled use of illegal drugs is the norm, as confirmed by surveys and longitudinal studies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
