                    "text": "Let's see. The economy is in a deep recession, and I need to figure out which statement about monetary policy is accurate. Okay, first things first, I need to remember what monetary policy is and how it affects the economy.\n\nMonetary policy is controlled by the central bank, and it involves changing the money supply or interest rates to influence economic conditions. In a recession, the economy is sluggish, with high unemployment and low production. So, the goal of monetary policy in this situation would typically be to stimulate the economy and get it growing again.\n\nOption A says that expansionary policy would only worsen the recession. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Expansionary monetary policy is supposed to boost economic activity by making money cheaper and more available. So, it should help during a recession, not make it worse. Maybe in some specific circumstances, but generally, it's meant to stimulate the economy.\n\nOption B says that expansionary policy greatly increases aggregate demand if investment is sensitive to changes in the interest rate. That makes sense. Expansionary monetary policy lowers interest rates, which should make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. If investment is sensitive to interest rates, then lower rates should encourage more investment, which would increase aggregate demand. So, this seems like a plausible statement.\n\nOption C suggests that contractionary policy is the appropriate stimulus for investment and consumption. Wait, contractionary policy tightens money supply and raises interest rates, which should discourage borrowing and spending. That seems counterintuitive during a recession when you want to encourage spending and investment. So, this doesn't sound right.\n\nOption D says that if the demand for money is perfectly elastic, expansionary monetary policy might be quite effective. Let's think about this. If the demand for money is perfectly elastic, that means that people are willing to hold any amount of money at a certain interest rate, and any increase in money supply beyond that point won't affect the interest rate. So, in that case, expansionary monetary policy might not be very effective because it wouldn't change the interest rate, and therefore wouldn't stimulate investment or consumption. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems like option B is the most accurate statement. Expansionary policy would likely increase aggregate demand if investment is sensitive to interest rates, which is what you want during a recession.\n\nBut let me double-check. In a deep recession, might there be limitations to monetary policy? For example, if interest rates are already very low, lowering them further might not have much effect. This is known as the liquidity trap. In such a situation, expansionary monetary policy might not be very effective. So, perhaps option D is trying to get at something similar, but it's worded differently.\n\nWait, option D mentions perfectly elastic demand for money, which is different from a liquidity trap, but it might have a similar effect in that changes in money supply don't affect interest rates. So, in that case, expansionary monetary policy wouldn't be effective. But the statement says that it \"might be quite effective,\" which contradicts what I just thought. So, maybe option D is incorrect.\n\nOption A seems clearly wrong because expansionary policy is typically used to stimulate the economy during a recession.\n\nOption C is suggesting using contractionary policy to stimulate investment and consumption, which contradicts the basic principles of monetary policy.\n\nSo, again, option B seems to be the best choice. However, I should consider whether investment is indeed sensitive to interest rates. If investment is not very sensitive to interest rates, then lowering interest rates might not have a big impact on investment and aggregate demand. But the statement says \"if investment is sensitive to changes in the interest rate,\" so it's conditional, and in that case, expansionary policy should be effective.\n\nMaybe I should think about real-world examples. During the 2008 financial crisis, many central banks around the world implemented expansionary monetary policy, lowering interest rates and engaging in quantitative easing, to stimulate their economies. In most cases, this helped to prevent a deeper recession and eventually led to economic recovery. So, in practice, expansionary monetary policy seems to be effective during recessions, assuming that investment is responsive to interest rate changes.\n\nBut, as I thought earlier, if interest rates are already very low, there might be limits to how much further monetary policy can stimulate the economy. In such cases, other measures, like fiscal policy, might be needed. However, the question is about monetary policy specifically, so perhaps that's beyond the scope here.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that option B is the accurate statement about monetary policy in a deep recession. Expansionary policy can greatly increase aggregate demand if investment is sensitive to interest rate changes, which is a reasonable assumption in many economic scenarios.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
