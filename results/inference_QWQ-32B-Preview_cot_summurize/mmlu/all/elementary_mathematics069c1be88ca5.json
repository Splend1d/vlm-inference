                    "text": "So Ron has a garden with 42 plants, and each row has 7 plants. I need to find out how many rows there are in his garden. There are a few expressions given, and I have to choose which one correctly calculates the number of rows.\n\nLet me think about this. If each row has 7 plants, and there are 42 plants in total, I should be able to find the number of rows by seeing how many times 7 fits into 42. That sounds like division to me.\n\nSo, 42 divided by 7 should give me the number of rows. Looking at the options, A is 42 \u00f7 7, which matches what I'm thinking.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is 42 \u2013 7, which is subtraction. That would just give me 35, which doesn't make sense in this context. Subtracting the number of plants per row from the total number of plants wouldn't give me the number of rows.\n\nOption C is 42 + 7, which is addition. That would give me 49, which again doesn't help in finding the number of rows.\n\nOption D is 42 \u00d7 7, which is multiplication. That would give me 294, which is way more than the total number of plants and doesn't make sense for this problem.\n\nSo, clearly, division is the correct operation here.\n\nTo confirm, if I do 42 \u00f7 7, that's 6. So, if there are 7 plants per row, and 6 rows, that totals 42 plants, which matches the information given.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of multiplication. If I let r be the number of rows, then 7 times r equals 42. So, 7r = 42. To find r, I would divide both sides by 7, which again gives me r = 42 \u00f7 7, or r = 6.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, division is the way to go here.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is A. 42 \u00f7 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
