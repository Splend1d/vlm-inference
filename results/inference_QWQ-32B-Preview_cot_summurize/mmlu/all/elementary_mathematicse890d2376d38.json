                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that the temperature dropped by 11\u00b0F between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M., and it was 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M. We need to find out what the temperature was at 6 P.M.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a temperature drop means. If the temperature drops, it means it gets lower. So, if it was higher at 6 P.M. and then decreased by 11\u00b0F by 10 P.M., reaching 84\u00b0F, we can set up an equation to find the original temperature at 6 P.M.\n\nLet's denote the temperature at 6 P.M. as \\( t \\).\n\nNow, since the temperature dropped by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M., we can express this relationship with the following equation:\n\n\\[ t - 11 = 84 \\]\n\nThis makes sense because if you start with \\( t \\) and subtract 11, you get 84.\n\nNow, to find \\( t \\), we need to solve for \\( t \\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ t - 11 = 84 \\]\n\nTo isolate \\( t \\), we can add 11 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ t - 11 + 11 = 84 + 11 \\]\n\n\\[ t = 95 \\]\n\nSo, the temperature at 6 P.M. was 95\u00b0F.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. \\( 84 - 11 = t \\); 73\u00b0F\n\nB. \\( t - 84 = 11 \\); 95\u00b0F\n\nC. \\( 84 - t = 11 \\); 73\u00b0F\n\nD. \\( t - 11 = 84 \\); 95\u00b0F\n\nOur equation matches option D: \\( t - 11 = 84 \\); 95\u00b0F.\n\nLet's double-check the other options to ensure we've chosen correctly.\n\nOption A: \\( 84 - 11 = t \\); 73\u00b0F\n\nThis would mean that the temperature at 6 P.M. was 73\u00b0F, and it increased by 11\u00b0F to reach 84\u00b0F at 10 P.M. But the problem says the temperature dropped, not rose, so this doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B: \\( t - 84 = 11 \\); 95\u00b0F\n\nThis equation suggests that the difference between the temperature at 6 P.M. and 10 P.M. is 11\u00b0F, which is correct, but it's arranged differently from our equation. If we solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t - 84 = 11 \\]\n\n\\[ t = 11 + 84 \\]\n\n\\[ t = 95 \\]\n\nThis also gives 95\u00b0F, which matches our earlier calculation. However, our initial equation was \\( t - 11 = 84 \\), which is equivalent to \\( t - 84 = 11 \\). Both equations are correct and lead to the same answer.\n\nOption C: \\( 84 - t = 11 \\); 73\u00b0F\n\nThis equation suggests that the difference between 10 P.M. temperature and 6 P.M. temperature is 11\u00b0F. But since the temperature dropped, \\( t \\) should be higher than 84\u00b0F, not lower. If we solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 84 - t = 11 \\]\n\n\\[ -t = 11 - 84 \\]\n\n\\[ -t = -73 \\]\n\n\\[ t = 73 \\]\n\nThis would imply the temperature at 6 P.M. was 73\u00b0F, which contradicts our earlier finding that it was 95\u00b0F. So this option is incorrect.\n\nOption D: \\( t - 11 = 84 \\); 95\u00b0F\n\nThis matches our initial equation and solution.\n\nGiven that both options B and D lead to the correct temperature of 95\u00b0F, but our initial equation matched option D, we can conclude that D is the correct choice.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, both options B and D are algebraically equivalent, just arranged differently. Solving either leads to \\( t = 95 \\).\n\nBut since the problem asks to \"write and solve an equation,\" and our initial approach led us to \\( t - 11 = 84 \\), which is option D, we can confidently go with D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. \\( t - 11 = 84 \\); 95\u00b0F.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
