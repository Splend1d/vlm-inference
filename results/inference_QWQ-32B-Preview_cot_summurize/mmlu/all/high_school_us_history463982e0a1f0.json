                    "text": "So I've got this poem by Phillis Wheatley, and I need to figure out which influence is most directly revealed in it. The options are the First Great Awakening, John Locke's natural rights theory, British ideas about social hierarchy, or eighteenth-century scientific racism. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the poem. It's called \"On Being Brought from Africa to America.\" So, it's about being brought from Africa to America, probably referring to the slave trade. Wheatley was an African American poet, and she was born in Africa and brought to America as a slave, but she was educated and became a prominent poet.\n\nThe poem says, \"\u2018Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too; Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.\" So, she's saying that being brought to America was an act of mercy because it introduced her to Christianity and the knowledge of God and a Savior, which she didn't have before.\n\nThen it says, \"Some view our sable race with scornful eye, \"Their colour is a diabolic die.\" Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.\" So, some people look down on black people, considering their color evil, maybe related to Satan or something. But Wheatley is reminding Christians that even though black people are seen as inferior, they can be refined and join the company of angels, meaning they can be saved and reach heaven.\n\nSo, the poem is arguing that African people can be saved and are equal in the eyes of God, despite what some people think about their race.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA. The First Great Awakening: This was a religious revival in the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. It emphasized personal religion and the importance of individual faith, often outside the established churches. It led to increased evangelical activity and a focus on converting others to Christianity.\n\nGiven that Wheatley is talking about being brought to America as an act of mercy that introduced her to Christianity and salvation, this seems relevant. The Great Awakening emphasized the importance of personal salvation and the universality of salvation, meaning that anyone could be saved, regardless of their background.\n\nB. John Locke's natural rights theory: John Locke was a philosopher who argued for natural rights, like life, liberty, and property. His ideas influenced the American Revolution and the concept of inalienable rights.\n\nWhile Wheatley was certainly aware of the injustices of slavery, and her poem can be seen as hinting at the idea that all people, including Africans, have the right to freedom and salvation, the poem doesn't directly address political rights or slavery per se. It's more focused on the spiritual equality of all people.\n\nC. British ideas about social hierarchy: Britain had a rigid social structure, with clear distinctions between different classes. However, Wheatley's poem seems to challenge the idea that race determines one's worth or ability to be saved, which might go against the hierarchical views that some people had about race.\n\nD. Eighteenth-century scientific racism: This refers to the pseudoscientific ideas that tried to justify racial hierarchies and the inferiority of certain races based on supposed scientific evidence. Wheatley's poem directly contradicts this by arguing that African people can be saved and are equal in the eyes of God.\n\nGiven all this, I think the First Great Awakening is the most direct influence on Wheatley's ideas in this poem. The emphasis on personal salvation, the universality of salvation, and the importance of Christianity in bringing people to God aligns well with the themes in the poem.\n\nAlso, Wheatley was Christian and her poetry often had religious themes, which is consistent with the influence of the Great Awakening.\n\nSo, I would go with option A, the First Great Awakening.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
