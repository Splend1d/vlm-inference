                    "text": "So I've got this problem about Lissajous patterns on an oscilloscope. It says that there are 5 horizontal tangencies and 2 vertical tangencies, and the frequency of the horizontal input is 100 Hz. I need to find the frequency of the vertical input among the given options: A. 500 Hz, B. 250 Hz, C. 400 Hz, D. 625 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Lissajous figures are and how they relate to the frequencies of the inputs. Lissajous figures are patterns formed on an oscilloscope when two sinusoidal signals are applied to the horizontal and vertical deflection plates. The shape of the pattern depends on the frequency ratio of the two inputs and their phase difference.\n\nIn this case, we're given the number of horizontal and vertical tangencies, which I think relate to the number of times the curve touches or is tangent to the horizontal and vertical axes. I remember that in Lissajous figures, the number of loops or tangencies can be related to the ratio of the frequencies.\n\nLet me look up a bit about Lissajous figures and tangencies. From what I recall, the number of horizontal tangencies is related to the number of times the vertical velocity is zero, and the number of vertical tangencies is related to the number of times the horizontal velocity is zero.\n\nMore specifically, for a Lissajous figure generated by frequencies \\(f_x\\) and \\(f_y\\) with a phase difference, the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to twice the number of vertical loops, and the number of vertical tangencies is equal to twice the number of horizontal loops.\n\nWait, I might be confusing some points here. Let me try to find a more precise relationship.\n\nI found that in Lissajous figures, the number of tangent points can be related to the frequency ratio. Specifically, the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to twice the number of vertical loops per period, and similarly, the number of vertical tangencies is equal to twice the number of horizontal loops per period.\n\nGiven that, if there are 5 horizontal tangencies, that might correspond to 5/2 vertical loops, but that doesn't make sense because loops should be integers. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I've read that for Lissajous figures, the ratio of the frequencies \\(f_x\\) and \\(f_y\\) is equal to the ratio of the number of peaks in the y-direction to the number of peaks in the x-direction.\n\nBut in this problem, we're given tangencies, not necessarily peaks. Maybe there's a relationship between tangencies and the frequency ratio.\n\nLet me consider the general equation for Lissajous figures:\n\n\\(x = A \\sin(f_x t + \\phi)\\)\n\n\\(y = B \\sin(f_y t)\\)\n\nThe tangencies occur where the derivative of y with respect to x is zero for horizontal tangencies, and where the derivative of x with respect to y is zero for vertical tangencies.\n\nSo, for horizontal tangencies, \\(dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = 0\\), which implies \\(dy/dt = 0\\).\n\nSimilarly, for vertical tangencies, \\(dx/dt = 0\\).\n\nSo, the number of horizontal tangencies should be related to the number of times \\(dy/dt = 0\\) in a period, and similarly for vertical tangencies with \\(dx/dt = 0\\).\n\nGiven that \\(y = B \\sin(f_y t)\\), then \\(dy/dt = B f_y \\cos(f_y t)\\), which is zero when \\(\\cos(f_y t) = 0\\), i.e., at \\(f_y t = \\pi/2 + n\\pi\\), where n is an integer.\n\nSimilarly, \\(dx/dt = A f_x \\cos(f_x t + \\phi)\\), which is zero when \\(\\cos(f_x t + \\phi) = 0\\), i.e., at \\(f_x t + \\phi = \\pi/2 + n\\pi\\).\n\nNow, in one period of the Lissajous figure, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the two inputs, the number of times \\(dy/dt = 0\\) should be equal to the number of times \\(f_y t = \\pi/2 + n\\pi\\) within that time frame.\n\nThe period of the horizontal input is \\(T_x = 1/f_x = 1/100\\) seconds.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the frequency of the vertical input as \\(f_y\\), which we need to find.\n\nThe period of the vertical input is \\(T_y = 1/f_y\\).\n\nThe time it takes for both signals to repeat their pattern is the LCM of \\(T_x\\) and \\(T_y\\), which is \\(T = \\text{LCM}(T_x, T_y)\\).\n\nBut since \\(T_x = 1/100\\) and \\(T_y = 1/f_y\\), the LCM in terms of frequency is \\(T = 1/\\text{GCD}(f_x, f_y)\\), where GCD is the greatest common divisor.\n\nWait, actually, the LCM of two periods \\(T_x\\) and \\(T_y\\) is \\(T = \\text{LCM}(T_x, T_y) = (T_x T_y)/\\text{GCD}(T_x, T_y)\\), but this might not be the most straightforward way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern repeats every time both \\(f_x t\\) and \\(f_y t\\) have integer multiples of their periods.\n\nSo, the time for one complete pattern is \\(T = \\text{LCM}(T_x, T_y)\\), which is the smallest t such that \\(f_x t\\) and \\(f_y t\\) are both integers.\n\nThis is equivalent to \\(t = n T_x = m T_y\\), where n and m are integers.\n\nThus, \\(n/f_x = m/f_y\\), so \\(f_y / f_x = m/n\\), meaning the frequency ratio is rational for a closed Lissajous figure.\n\nGiven that, let\u2019s denote \\(f_y / f_x = m/n\\), where m and n are integers with no common factors.\n\nGiven \\(f_x = 100\\) Hz, \\(f_y = (m/n) \\times 100\\) Hz.\n\nNow, the number of horizontal tangencies is given as 5, and vertical tangencies as 2.\n\nFrom earlier, horizontal tangencies correspond to the number of times \\(dy/dt = 0\\) in one period of the Lissajous figure, which is twice the number of vertical loops per period.\n\nSimilarly, vertical tangencies correspond to twice the number of horizontal loops per period.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times the derivative is zero.\n\nIn one period \\(T\\), the number of times \\(dy/dt = 0\\) is equal to the number of times \\(f_y t = \\pi/2 + n\\pi\\), which occurs \\(2 f_y T\\) times in the interval \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = T\\).\n\nSimilarly, the number of times \\(dx/dt = 0\\) is \\(2 f_x T\\) times in the same interval.\n\nBut since \\(T\\) is the time for the pattern to repeat, which is \\(T = \\text{LCM}(T_x, T_y)\\), and \\(T_x = 1/100\\), \\(T_y = 1/f_y\\), we have \\(T = \\text{LCM}(1/100, 1/f_y)\\).\n\nTo simplify, let's assume that \\(f_y / f_x = m/n\\), where m and n are integers with no common factors.\n\nThen, \\(f_y = (m/n) \\times 100\\) Hz.\n\nThe number of horizontal tangencies is equal to \\(2 m\\), and the number of vertical tangencies is equal to \\(2 n\\).\n\nWait, but in the problem, horizontal tangencies are 5 and vertical tangencies are 2.\n\nSo, if horizontal tangencies are \\(2 m = 5\\), that would imply \\(m = 5/2\\), which is not an integer, but m should be an integer.\n\nHmm, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of horizontal tangencies is \\(2 n\\) and vertical tangencies is \\(2 m\\), but then \\(2 n = 5\\) implies \\(n = 5/2\\), which again is not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that my assumption about the relationship between tangencies and m/n is incorrect.\n\nLet me look for another approach.\n\nI found a resource that states that for Lissajous figures, the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to twice the number of vertical loops, and the number of vertical tangencies is equal to twice the number of horizontal loops.\n\nIf the frequency ratio is \\(f_y / f_x = m/n\\), then the number of vertical loops is m and the number of horizontal loops is n.\n\nTherefore, the number of horizontal tangencies should be \\(2 m\\) and the number of vertical tangencies should be \\(2 n\\).\n\nGiven that, if horizontal tangencies are 5, then \\(2 m = 5\\), which would imply \\(m = 2.5\\), but m should be an integer.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the actual number of tangencies is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to m and vertical tangencies is equal to n.\n\nIf that's the case, then \\(m = 5\\) and \\(n = 2\\), so \\(f_y / f_x = 5/2\\), hence \\(f_y = (5/2) \\times 100 = 250\\) Hz.\n\nThat would correspond to option B.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that horizontal tangencies are \\(2 m\\), which seems conflicting.\n\nLet me check another source.\n\nI found another reference that says the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to the number of times the vertical velocity is zero in one period, which is \\(2 m\\), and the number of vertical tangencies is \\(2 n\\).\n\nGiven that, with horizontal tangencies being 5, \\(2 m = 5\\), which again gives \\(m = 2.5\\), not an integer.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the relationship is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of horizontal tangencies is m and vertical tangencies is n.\n\nIn that case, \\(m = 5\\) and \\(n = 2\\), so \\(f_y / f_x = 5/2\\), leading to \\(f_y = 250\\) Hz.\n\nBut I'm not sure about this.\n\nLet me consider the options given:\n\nA. 500 Hz\n\nB. 250 Hz\n\nC. 400 Hz\n\nD. 625 Hz\n\nIf I choose B. 250 Hz, then \\(f_y / f_x = 250 / 100 = 2.5 = 5/2\\), which would correspond to m=5 and n=2.\n\nAssuming that the number of horizontal tangencies is m and vertical tangencies is n, this seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose C. 400 Hz, then \\(f_y / f_x = 400 / 100 = 4 = 4/1\\), which would correspond to m=4 and n=1.\n\nBut the problem states 5 horizontal tangencies and 2 vertical tangencies, which doesn't match m=4 and n=1.\n\nSimilarly, A. 500 Hz gives \\(f_y / f_x = 500 / 100 = 5 = 5/1\\), which would correspond to m=5 and n=1, but n=1 doesn't match the vertical tangencies of 2.\n\nD. 625 Hz gives \\(f_y / f_x = 625 / 100 = 6.25 = 25/4\\), which would correspond to m=25 and n=4.\n\nBut again, n=4 doesn't match the vertical tangencies of 2.\n\nTherefore, only option B. 250 Hz seems to fit, assuming that m=5 and n=2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of horizontal tangencies is equal to m/gcd(m,n), and vertical tangencies is equal to n/gcd(m,n).\n\nIf m=5 and n=2, with gcd(m,n)=1, then horizontal tangencies would be 5 and vertical tangencies would be 2, which matches the problem.\n\nTherefore, \\(f_y / f_x = 5/2\\), so \\(f_y = 250\\) Hz.\n\nThus, the answer should be B. 250 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
