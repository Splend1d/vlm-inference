So, you're asking about which religion holds the position that abortion is murder, and the options are Orthodox Jews, Fundamentalist Protestants, Eastern Orthodox Christians, or all of the above. Let's see.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand that different religious traditions have various views on abortion. The stance on abortion can also vary within the same religion, depending on the specific denomination or individual beliefs. However, in general, many conservative or traditional branches of major religions tend to view abortion as morally wrong or even as murder.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Orthodox Jews: Orthodox Judaism generally views abortion as unacceptable, except in cases where the mother's life is at risk. They consider unborn life as sacred, and therefore, abortion is often seen as akin to murder. So, it seems that Orthodox Jews do hold the position that abortion is murder, except in certain life-threatening situations.\n\nB. Fundamentalist Protestants: Fundamentalist Protestant groups are typically very conservative and adhere strictly to traditional biblical teachings. They generally oppose abortion and view it as the taking of an innocent life, hence considering it murder. So, this group also seems to hold that position.\n\nC. Eastern Orthodox Christians: The Eastern Orthodox Church is known for its traditional views on moral issues. Regarding abortion, it is strongly opposed and considers it a sin, often equating it to murder. So, it's likely that Eastern Orthodox Christians also hold the position that abortion is murder.\n\nGiven that all three options\u2014Orthodox Jews, Fundamentalist Protestants, and Eastern Orthodox Christians\u2014generally hold the position that abortion is murder, the answer seems to be D. all of the above.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that within each of these religious groups, there may be some variation in beliefs and opinions on this issue. But overall, the mainstream or traditional positions in these religions tend to condemn abortion as murder.\n\nI hope this helps clarify your question.
