                    "text": "Correlational research is a type of non-experimental research method where the researcher measures two or more variables and assesses the statistical relationship between them without manipulating any variable. The primary goal is to determine if there is a relationship between these variables and, if so, the strength and direction of that relationship.\n\nLet's evaluate each option to understand how correlational research works:\n\n**Option A: Investigators randomly assign subjects to different groups and they receive different levels of a manipulated variable.**\n\nThis description actually aligns more with experimental research, particularly randomized controlled trials. In experimental research, researchers manipulate one variable (the independent variable) and measure its effect on another variable (the dependent variable), while controlling for other variables. Random assignment helps ensure that the groups are equivalent at the start of the experiment, allowing for causal inferences.\n\nIn correlational research, however, there is no random assignment or manipulation of variables. Researchers simply observe and measure variables as they naturally occur.\n\n**Option B: Involves the use of intact groups.**\n\nThis could refer to quasi-experimental designs where intact groups are used because random assignment is not possible. For example, comparing different classrooms or schools without assigning participants to groups randomly.\n\nCorrelational research also often involves intact groups since participants are not assigned to different conditions. However, the key aspect of correlational research is the assessment of the relationship between variables without manipulation, rather than the use of intact groups per se.\n\n**Option C: Does not have any internal validity; can\u2019t infer causal relationship.**\n\nThis statement is accurate for correlational research. Because variables are not manipulated, it is not possible to establish causality. Correlational research can only indicate that there is a relationship between variables, but it cannot determine which variable causes changes in the other.\n\nInternal validity refers to the extent to which a study establishes a causal relationship. Since correlational research does not manipulate variables, it generally lacks internal validity.\n\n**Option D: Assessing variables as a function of time.**\n\nThis might refer to longitudinal studies, where variables are measured at multiple points in time to observe changes and developments over time. Longitudinal studies can be correlational if variables are not manipulated.\n\nHowever, correlational research is not limited to studies that assess variables over time. Cross-sectional studies, which measure variables at one point in time, can also be correlational.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the options, the most accurate description of correlational research is provided in option C: \"does not have any internal validity; can\u2019t infer causal relationship.\" This captures the essence of correlational research, which explores relationships between variables without establishing causality due to the lack of manipulation and control over variables.\n\nOptions A and B describe aspects more aligned with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, respectively, while option D describes a type of design (longitudinal) that can be either experimental or correlational, but does not specifically define correlational research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
