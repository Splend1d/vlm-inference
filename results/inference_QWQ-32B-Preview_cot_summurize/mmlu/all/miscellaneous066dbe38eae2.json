Germany.\" Hmm, I remember that in some countries people drive on the left, and in others they drive on the right. I think England is one of those countries where they drive on the left. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that in the United States, we drive on the right side of the road. I think most European countries follow the right-hand drive rule, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's see, France, Italy, and Germany are all in Europe, and I think they all drive on the right side. But I'm not completely confident about that.\n\nI recall that England is different. I've heard that in England, they drive on the left side of the road. Maybe it's because they have a different driving tradition or something. I think some former British colonies also drive on the left, like Australia and Japan. Wait, Japan drives on the left, but I don't think Japan was a British colony. Maybe it's just a coincidence.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've ever seen any videos or movies where they show driving in England, and it seems like they're driving on the left side. Also, when I look at maps of England, the roads seem to be designed for left-hand traffic.\n\nComparing that to France, Italy, and Germany, I think they all have right-hand traffic. I don't have any specific memories of seeing people drive on the left in those countries.\n\nSo, based on that, I would guess that the answer is C. England.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm wrong about France, Italy, and Germany. Perhaps one of them drives on the left side. I don't want to assume.\n\nWait, I think all of continental Europe drives on the right side. England being an exception, along with Ireland and a few other places.\n\nAlso, I remember that when traveling from France to England, like crossing the English Channel, drivers have to switch sides. That might be because France has right-hand traffic and England has left-hand traffic.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then England is the country where they drive on the left side.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. England.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider each option quickly:\n\nA. France - I believe they drive on the right.\n\nB. Italy - Again, right-hand traffic, I think.\n\nC. England - Left-hand traffic, as I recall.\n\nD. Germany - Right-hand traffic.\n\nSo, only England among these options has left-hand traffic.\n\nI think that's pretty conclusive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
