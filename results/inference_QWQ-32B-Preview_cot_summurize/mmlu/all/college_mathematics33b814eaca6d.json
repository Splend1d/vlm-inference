                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here. There are 25 suitcases in total, and out of those, 5 are damaged. I need to find the probability that when I select 3 suitcases at random, exactly 2 of them are damaged. The options are a bit tricky, so I need to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, I should recall the formula for probability. Probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25. That sounds like a combination problem because the order doesn't matter when selecting the suitcases.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose 3 suitcases out of 25 is calculated using the combination formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the total number of items, and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. Plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25!}{3!(25 - 3)!} = \\frac{25!}{3! \\cdot 22!}\n\\]\n\nI can simplify this by canceling out the \\( 22! \\) in the numerator and the denominator:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22!}{3! \\times 22!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6} = \\frac{13800}{6} = 2300\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 2300 possible ways to choose any 3 suitcases from 25.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes, which is the number of ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases out of the 3 selected. Since there are 5 damaged suitcases and 20 undamaged ones, I need to select 2 damaged and 1 undamaged suitcase.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 damaged suitcases out of 5 is:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = \\frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 3!} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nAnd the number of ways to choose 1 undamaged suitcase out of 20 is:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 1) = \\frac{20!}{1!(20 - 1)!} = \\frac{20 \\times 19!}{1 \\times 19!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the total number of favorable outcomes, I multiply these two combinations together because these are independent events:\n\n\\[\n10 \\times 20 = 200\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 200 ways to choose exactly 2 damaged suitcases and 1 undamaged suitcase.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\nP(\\text{exactly 2 damaged}) = \\frac{200}{2300} = \\frac{20}{230} = \\frac{2}{23}\n\\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total combinations:\n\n\\[\nC(25, 3) = \\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23}{6} = 2300 \\quad \\text{seems correct.}\n\\]\n\nThen, combinations of 2 damaged:\n\n\\[\nC(5, 2) = 10 \\quad \\text{that's right.}\n\\]\n\nCombinations of 1 undamaged:\n\n\\[\nC(20, 1) = 20 \\quad \\text{correct.}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying them gives 200 favorable outcomes.\n\nSo, probability is \\( \\frac{200}{2300} \\), which simplifies to \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\( \\frac{2}{69} \\)\n\nB. \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\)\n\nC. \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\)\n\nD. \\( \\frac{12}{125} \\)\n\nOption C matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using permutations or another probability formula.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the hypergeometric distribution formula, which is used for sampling without replacement. The formula is:\n\n\\[\nP(k) = \\frac{C(K, k) \\times C(N - K, n - k)}{C(N, n)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( N \\) is the population size (25 suitcases),\n\n- \\( K \\) is the number of success states in the population (5 damaged),\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of draws (3 suitcases),\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of observed successes (2 damaged).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nP(2) = \\frac{C(5, 2) \\times C(20, 1)}{C(25, 3)} = \\frac{10 \\times 20}{2300} = \\frac{200}{2300} = \\frac{2}{23}\n\\]\n\nSame result. So, I'm confident that \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\) is the correct probability.\n\nMaybe I should also consider if order matters in this selection process. In this case, since we're dealing with selecting suitcases without regard to order, combinations are the appropriate choice. If order mattered, I'd have to use permutations, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the probability step by step, considering the probability of selecting a damaged suitcase on the first draw, then another damaged one on the second draw, and an undamaged one on the third draw, and considering all possible sequences that result in exactly 2 damaged suitcases.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst sequence: Damaged, Damaged, Undamaged.\n\nProbability:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{25} \\times \\frac{4}{24} \\times \\frac{20}{23}\n\\]\n\nSecond sequence: Damaged, Undamaged, Damaged.\n\nProbability:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{25} \\times \\frac{20}{24} \\times \\frac{4}{23}\n\\]\n\nThird sequence: Undamaged, Damaged, Damaged.\n\nProbability:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{25} \\times \\frac{5}{24} \\times \\frac{4}{23}\n\\]\n\nNow, I add these probabilities together to get the total probability of exactly 2 damaged suitcases.\n\nCalculating each:\n\nFirst sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{25} \\times \\frac{4}{24} \\times \\frac{20}{23} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{20}{23} = \\frac{1 \\times 1 \\times 20}{5 \\times 6 \\times 23} = \\frac{20}{690} = \\frac{2}{69}\n\\]\n\nSecond sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{25} \\times \\frac{20}{24} \\times \\frac{4}{23} = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{4}{23} = \\frac{1 \\times 5 \\times 4}{5 \\times 6 \\times 23} = \\frac{20}{690} = \\frac{2}{69}\n\\]\n\nThird sequence:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{20}{25} \\times \\frac{5}{24} \\times \\frac{4}{23} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{5}{24} \\times \\frac{4}{23} = \\frac{4 \\times 5 \\times 4}{5 \\times 24 \\times 23} = \\frac{80}{2760} = \\frac{2}{69}\n\\]\n\nAdding them up:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{69} + \\frac{2}{69} + \\frac{2}{69} = \\frac{6}{69} = \\frac{2}{23}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the same result as before. So, regardless of the approach, the probability comes out to be \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\).\n\nI think this confirms that option C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, is there a possibility that some suitcases are identical, or are there any constraints on the selection process that I haven't accounted for? The problem states that the suitcases are selected at random, and specifies the number of damaged ones, so I think the approach is correct.\n\nAlso, I should check if the fractions are simplified correctly. \\( \\frac{200}{2300} \\) does indeed simplify to \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\) by dividing both numerator and denominator by 100.\n\nSimilarly, in the step-by-step approach, \\( \\frac{6}{69} \\) simplifies to \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\) by dividing numerator and denominator by 3.\n\nEverything checks out. I don't see any errors in the calculations or the logic.\n\nTherefore, the probability that exactly 2 out of 3 selected suitcases are damaged is \\( \\frac{2}{23} \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{23}} \\]"
