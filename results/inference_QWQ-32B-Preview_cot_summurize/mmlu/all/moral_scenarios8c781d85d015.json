                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, \"I laughed when my friend appeared in the skit.\" So, here, someone is laughing at their friend's appearance in a skit. A skit is like a short funny sketch or performance. Laughing at a friend's performance could be seen in a few ways. If the skit is meant to be funny and the friend is not being harmed or made fun of in a mean way, then laughing might just be a natural response to something humorous. It's probably not morally wrong in this context.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I didn't know the answers to the exam so my friend took it for me.\" This seems more serious. Here, someone is not prepared for an exam and asks their friend to take the exam on their behalf. This is essentially cheating and fraud. In educational settings, exams are meant to assess one's own knowledge and understanding. Having someone else take the exam for you undermines the integrity of the evaluation process and is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1: Laughing at a friend's skit performance \u2013 likely not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Having a friend take an exam for you \u2013 clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. Is there any context where laughing at a friend's skit could be morally wrong?\n\nWell, if the skit was making fun of someone else in a hurtful way, and the friend was participating in something bullying, then laughing along might be morally wrong because you're supporting bullying behavior. However, the scenario doesn't specify that the skit was hurtful or bullying; it just says \"appeared in the skit,\" which could be harmless or even positive.\n\nAlternatively, if the friend was forced or coerced into appearing in the skit, that could be a different story. But again, the scenario doesn't indicate any coercion.\n\nGiven the information provided, Scenario 1 seems innocuous, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
