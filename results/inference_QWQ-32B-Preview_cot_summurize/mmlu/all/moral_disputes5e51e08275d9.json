                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking about the moral relevance of distinctions related to euthanasia and killing. The premise is that if the distinction between killing and letting die is morally relevant, then another distinction must also be morally relevant. The options are:\n\nA. killing/murder\n\nB. physician/patient\n\nC. active/passive euthanasia\n\nD. involuntary/nonvoluntary euthanasia\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's meant by \"killing\" and \"letting die.\" Killing typically involves taking direct action to cause someone's death, while letting die involves not doing something that could prevent death. So, killing is active, and letting die is passive.\n\nNow, the question is suggesting that if this active-passive distinction is morally significant, then another distinction must also be morally significant. I need to see which of the options aligns with this idea.\n\nOption A is killing/murder. Murder is a specific type of killing, usually unlawful and intentional. But the distinction here is between killing and murder, which seems different from the active-passive distinction. Murder is a type of killing, but it doesn't necessarily relate to whether the action is active or passive.\n\nOption B is physician/patient. This seems to be about the roles of the people involved in the situation. In euthanasia contexts, a physician may be involved in deciding or performing actions that lead to a patient's death. However, this doesn't directly relate to the active-passive distinction.\n\nOption C is active/passive euthanasia. Active euthanasia involves taking direct action to cause death, like administering a lethal dose of medication. Passive euthanasia involves omitting treatment that would sustain life, like not starting or stopping life support. This directly corresponds to the killing/letting die distinction.\n\nOption D is involuntary/nonvoluntary euthanasia. Involuntary euthanasia is when the person doesn't consent to the action, and nonvoluntary is when the person is unable to consent, like being in a coma. This distinction is about consent, which is different from the active-passive distinction.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that option C, active/passive euthanasia, is the distinction that aligns most closely with the killing/letting die distinction. Both involve the active versus passive nature of the actions taken regarding someone's life.\n\nTherefore, if the killing/letting die distinction is morally relevant, then the active/passive euthanasia distinction must also be morally relevant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
