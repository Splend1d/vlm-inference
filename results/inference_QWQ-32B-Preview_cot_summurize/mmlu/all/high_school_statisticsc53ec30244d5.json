Here, the selling price is in thousands of dollars, and the age is in years.\n\nFirst, the equation is in the form of y = a - bx, where y is the selling price, a is 15.9, b is 0.983, and x is the age.\n\nSo, the intercept (a) is 15.9, which means when the age is 0 (a new car), the selling price is 15.9 thousand dollars.\n\nWait, but the question says the selling price is in $1,000, so 15.9 thousand dollars is actually $15,900.\n\nBut option B says a new car costs on average $9,830, which doesn't match. So option B seems incorrect.\n\nNext, the coefficient of age is -0.983, which means for every additional year of age, the selling price decreases by 0.983 thousand dollars.\n\nSince the selling price is in thousands, 0.983 thousand dollars is $983.\n\nSo, for every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA says: \"For every year the car gets older, the selling price goes down by approximately 9.83 percent.\"\n\nWait, the equation shows a decrease of $983 per year, not a percentage decrease. So this seems incorrect because it's talking about a percentage decrease, whereas the equation shows a linear decrease in dollar amount.\n\nB is already dismissed.\n\nC says: \"For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.\"\n\nBut according to the equation, it's $983, not $1,590, so C is incorrect.\n\nD says: \"For every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $983.\"\n\nThis matches what we derived from the equation.\n\nSo, the correct conclusion is D.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nThe selling price for a new car (age=0) is 15.9 thousand dollars, which is $15,900.\n\nFor a 1-year-old car, it's 15.9 - 0.983 = 14.917 thousand dollars, which is $14,917.\n\nThe difference is $15,900 - $14,917 = $983, which matches option D.\n\nOption A is misleading because it talks about a percentage decrease, but the equation shows a linear decrease in dollar amount, not a percentage decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
