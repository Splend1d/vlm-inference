                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this scenario where a purchaser and a seller had an oral agreement for the sale of a house for $100,000. The purchaser gave the seller a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price. But before the seller signed the offer or deposited the check, they got a better offer for $120,000 from someone else. So, the seller called the purchaser and canceled the deal. Now, the purchaser is suing for specific performance, saying that the oral agreement plus the written offer and the check make an enforceable agreement.\n\nThe question is, will the purchaser likely prevail? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check for the down payment was evidence of consideration being paid.\n\nOption B says no, because the offer was not accepted\u2014prior to acceptance, the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\n\nOption C says yes, because the buyer and seller had a meeting of the minds evidenced by their oral understanding, the check, and the written offer.\n\nOption D says no, because specific performance doesn't apply in a residential real estate transaction.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic contract law principles. A contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration. In this case, there was an oral agreement, which seems like an offer, and the purchaser provided a written offer and a post-dated check for 5% of the price, which could be considered as part of the consideration.\n\nBut the seller didn't sign the written offer, which probably means they didn't accept it formally. Also, they didn't deposit the check, so maybe they hadn't accepted the consideration yet.\n\nThen, the seller received a better offer and decided to go with that instead, canceling the original agreement.\n\nNow, the purchaser is suing for specific performance, which is a legal remedy that forces the seller to honor the contract as agreed.\n\nSo, will the purchaser likely prevail?\n\nLet's look at each option.\n\nOption A says yes, because of the oral agreement and the check as evidence of consideration.\n\nBut in contract law, oral agreements can be enforceable, but there might be specific rules, especially for real estate transactions, which often require written contracts due to the Statute of Frauds.\n\nOption B says no, because the offer was not accepted before the seller sold to someone else.\n\nThis makes sense because, in contract law, until there's acceptance, the offer can be withdrawn by the seller.\n\nOption C says yes, because there was a meeting of the minds evidenced by the oral understanding, the check, and the written offer.\n\nMeeting of the minds is another way of saying there was an agreement. But again, was this agreement accepted by the seller?\n\nOption D says no, because specific performance doesn't apply in residential real estate transactions.\n\nBut I think specific performance can apply in real estate, especially when the property is unique, which most properties are considered to be.\n\nSo, considering these points, it seems like option B is the most accurate.\n\nThe offer was not accepted before the seller sold to someone else. In contract law, until acceptance, the seller is generally free to accept other offers.\n\nThe purchaser had made an offer and provided a post-dated check, but since the seller hadn't accepted or deposited the check, they might still have been free to withdraw from that agreement.\n\nTherefore, the purchaser is unlikely to prevail in their suit for specific performance.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n\nWait, but let's think about the post-dated check. Maybe that changes things.\n\nIf the purchaser gave a post-dated check for 5% of the price, that's $5,000. Was this check given as earnest money or as part of the consideration?\n\nIf the seller had taken and deposited the check, that might have been considered acceptance or at least part performance.\n\nBut in this case, the seller didn't deposit the check. So, perhaps they hadn't accepted the offer yet.\n\nAlso, the seller hadn't signed the written offer, which might have been the intended way to accept the offer.\n\nTherefore, since there was no acceptance, the contract was not formed, and the seller was free to accept another offer.\n\nHence, the purchaser is unlikely to prevail.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider option A again. It says yes, because there was an oral agreement and the check was evidence of consideration being paid.\n\nHowever, if the check wasn't deposited, was consideration actually paid? Maybe not.\n\nAnd regarding the oral agreement, real estate contracts often need to be in writing to be enforceable due to the Statute of Frauds.\n\nSo, even if there was an oral agreement, it might not be enforceable without a written contract.\n\nTherefore, option A is less likely to be correct.\n\nOption C mentions meeting of the minds, but again, without acceptance, there might not have been a meeting of the minds.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because specific performance can apply in residential real estate transactions, especially when the property is unique.\n\nSo, in conclusion, option B seems to be the most accurate: no, because the offer was not accepted\u2014prior to acceptance, the seller had the right to sell to anyone.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
