The land was located in a jurisdiction that has in force the following statute:Statute of Limitations \u0080\u0094\"an action to recover the possession of land shall be brought within twenty- one (21) years after the cause thereof accrued, but if a person who is entitled to bring such action at the time the cause accrued is within the age of minority (under 21) or of unsound mind, such action may be brought within ten (10) years after such disability is removed. \"This statute was enacted in the jurisdiction in 1930. The land in question had been owned by a rancher in 1960. On September 1, 1960, the rancher died intestate, leaving his nephew as his only heir. The nephew had been born on October 1, 1954. In addition, there is a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which the latter recorded on the same date. During his title search, the buyer learned that the administrator had never obtained any license to sell the land in question; and also he (the administrator) never formally received the approval of any court with respect to the administration of the rancher's estate. Moreover, the buyer ascertained that the seller entered into possession of the land in question on November 1, 1960. On the assumption that there are no additional facts, the buyer should be advised that the seller became or will become the owner of the land in question\n\nA. on November 1, 1960.\nB. on November 12, 1981.\nC. on October 1, 1985.\nD. when the nephew dies.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with a lot of dates and legal concepts, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a buyer who signed a contract to purchase a tract of land from a seller on May 1, 2006, with closing set for June 15, 2006. The jurisdiction has a statute of limitations for actions to recover possession of land, which is 21 years, but with exceptions for minors and those of unsound mind.\n\nThe land was owned by a rancher who died intestate on September 1, 1960, leaving his nephew as the only heir. The nephew was born on October 1, 1954, which means he was 5 years old when the rancher died.\n\nThere's a deed from the rancher's administrator to the seller dated November 1, 1960, which was recorded on the same date. The buyer found out that the administrator never obtained a license to sell the land and never received court approval for the administration of the estate. Additionally, the seller took possession of the land on November 1, 1960.\n\nWe need to determine when the seller became or will become the owner of the land, given these facts.\n\nLet's start by understanding the succession of ownership.\n\n1. **Rancher's Death and Intestate Succession:**\n\n   - The rancher died intestate on September 1, 1960, meaning he died without a will.\n\n   - His nephew is the only heir, who was 5 years old at the time.\n\n   - Since the rancher died intestate, his estate would be administered according to the jurisdiction's laws of intestate succession.\n\n2. **Administration of the Estate:**\n\n   - An administrator was appointed to handle the estate.\n\n   - The administrator issued a deed to the seller on November 1, 1960, which was recorded the same day.\n\n   - However, the administrator never obtained a license to sell the land and never received court approval for the administration.\n\n   - Despite these deficiencies, the seller took possession of the land on November 1, 1960.\n\n3. **Statute of Limitations:**\n\n   - The jurisdiction has a 21-year statute of limitations for actions to recover possession of land.\n\n   - If the person entitled to bring such an action is a minor (under 21) or of unsound mind, the action may be brought within 10 years after the disability is removed.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze when the seller became or will become the owner.\n\nFirst, the nephew was 5 years old when the rancher died, so he was a minor until October 1, 1975 (21 years later).\n\nHowever, the statute of limitations allows a minor to bring an action within 10 years after reaching the age of majority. So, the nephew could bring an action to recover the land until October 1, 1985 (10 years after turning 21).\n\nThis means that until October 1, 1985, the nephew had the right to challenge the seller's ownership based on the invalid administration of the estate.\n\nTherefore, the seller's ownership would be secure only after the statute of limitations expires, which in this case is October 1, 1985.\n\nBut let's check the options:\n\nA. November 1, 1960.\n\n   - This is when the deed was issued and the seller took possession, but given the deficiencies in the administration, the ownership was not yet secure.\n\nB. November 12, 1981.\n\n   - This date doesn't directly correspond to any event we've identified.\n\nC. October 1, 1985.\n\n   - This is 10 years after the nephew reached the age of majority, which is when his right to bring an action expires.\n\nD. When the nephew dies.\n\n   - The nephew's death wouldn't affect the statute of limitations in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. October 1, 1985, because that's when the nephew's right to bring an action to recover the land expires, making the seller's ownership secure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
