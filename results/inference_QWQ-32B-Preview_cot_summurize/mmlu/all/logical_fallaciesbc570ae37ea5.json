                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about a fallacy that involves deciding on a conclusion first and then only accepting evidence that supports it, or interpreting all evidence as supporting that conclusion. I need to identify which of the given options matches this description.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA. Ad ignorantium: I think this is also known as an appeal to ignorance. It's when someone claims something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. So, it's about using lack of evidence as evidence itself.\n\nB. A priori: This term is used in logic and epistemology to denote knowledge that is independent of experience. In the context of reasoning, a priori arguments are those that rely on pure reasoning rather than empirical evidence.\n\nC. Plurium interrogationum: I believe this is related to complex question fallacy, also known as loaded question, where a question presupposes an unproven claim.\n\nD. Extension: I'm not sure what this refers to in the context of fallacies. Maybe it's a typo or I'm missing something.\n\nNow, going back to the description in the question: determining the conclusion first and then accepting only evidence that supports it, or interpreting all evidence as support for that conclusion.\n\nThis sounds a lot like confirmation bias, but confirmation bias isn't listed here. Maybe it's related to one of these options.\n\nLet me think about ad ignorantium again. It's about using lack of evidence as evidence, which doesn't seem directly related to selecting or interpreting evidence to fit a preconceived conclusion.\n\nA priori reasoning is about using pure reasoning without relying on experience or evidence. So, if someone determines a conclusion a priori, they might dismiss evidence to the contrary, focusing only on what supports their pre-established view.\n\nThis seems closer to what the question is describing. They determine the conclusion through a priori reasoning and then only accept evidence that aligns with it.\n\nPlurium interrogationum, or the complex question fallacy, is about asking a question that contains an unwarranted assumption. It doesn't directly relate to selecting evidence to fit a conclusion.\n\nExtension doesn't seem relevant here unless it's part of a larger term I'm not familiar with.\n\nSo, between the options given, a priori seems to be the most fitting answer. It involves reaching a conclusion independently of evidence, which aligns with determining the conclusion first and then accepting only supporting evidence.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there a specific fallacy called \"a priori fallacy\"? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's not a fallacy name but a type of reasoning that can lead to a fallacy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by using terms that sound similar but are different.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is \"ad hoc\" or something similar, but that's not listed.\n\nAlternatively, \"begging the question,\" which is assuming the conclusion in the premise, but that's not among the options.\n\nGiven the options, I think B. a priori is the best answer, even if it's not a fallacy name per se, because it describes the process of reaching a conclusion independent of evidence and then potentially only accepting evidence that supports it.\n\nSo, I'll go with B. a priori.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
