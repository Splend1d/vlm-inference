                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about a Supreme Court ruling regarding older workers and job discrimination suits. The options are A. Discrimination, B. Age bias, C. Negative impact, and D. Intention. I need to figure out what older workers no longer need to prove to win such a suit.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the legal standards were before this ruling. Typically, in discrimination cases, plaintiffs have to show that the discrimination was intentional or that it had a disparate impact. Disparate impact means that even if there was no intent to discriminate, the policy or practice still had a negative effect on a protected group.\n\nGiven that, option D, intention, seems like something that might be relevant. If the court is changing the rules, maybe they're saying that older workers don't need to prove that the employer intended to discriminate against them to win a suit. That would make it easier for older workers to bring forward discrimination claims because they wouldn't have to prove malicious intent, which can be hard to demonstrate.\n\nOption C, negative impact, might be related to the concept of disparate impact. If the court is ruling that older workers don't need to prove negative impact, that would mean they don't have to show that the employer's policy or practice disproportionately affected them. Instead, they might just need to show that they were treated differently because of their age.\n\nOption B, age bias, seems similar to general discrimination, which is option A. Age bias is a specific type of discrimination based on age. If the court is saying that older workers don't need to prove age bias, that would be odd because age discrimination is what the suit is about. Similarly, option A, discrimination, is too broad because the entire suit is based on discrimination.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. The question is about what older workers no longer need to prove to win a job discrimination suit. So, perhaps the court has ruled that they don't need to prove one of these elements that were previously required.\n\nIf the court is making it easier for older workers to win discrimination suits, they might be eliminating one of the hurdles, like the need to prove intentional discrimination or disparate impact.\n\nGiven that, option D, intention, seems like a strong candidate. By removing the need to prove intention, older workers could win suits based on showing that age was a factor in the employment decision, regardless of the employer's intent.\n\nAlternatively, if the court is saying they don't need to prove negative impact, that could also make it easier to win suits, as they wouldn't have to demonstrate that the employer's actions had a disproportionate effect on older workers.\n\nBut between intention and negative impact, I think intention is more critical. Proving intent can be very difficult because it involves delving into the minds of the decision-makers. If the court is removing that requirement, it would be a significant change, making it easier for plaintiffs to succeed in age discrimination claims.\n\nMoreover, in many discrimination cases, including age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), plaintiffs often have to show either disparate treatment (intentional discrimination) or disparate impact ( policies that adversely affect a protected group). If the court is ruling that older workers don't need to prove intention, it might be allowing for a broader interpretation where the focus is on the effect of the employer's actions rather than the intent behind them.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Intention. The Supreme Court has ruled that older workers no longer need to prove intention to win a job discrimination suit, likely making it easier for them to pursue and win such claims.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
