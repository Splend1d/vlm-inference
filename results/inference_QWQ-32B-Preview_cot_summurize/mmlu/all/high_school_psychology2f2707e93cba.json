                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which part of Jared's body is responsible for the physical reactions he had when he saw shadows on his bedroom walls. His blood pressure went up, and he started breathing faster. I need to choose between the sensorimotor system, the somatic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system, and the pineal gland.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these options does.\n\nThe sensorimotor system is involved in processing sensory information and coordinating movements. So, if Jared saw shadows and maybe moved or reacted physically, this system would be part of that process. But the question is specifically about his blood pressure and breathing rate increasing, which seems more related to his body's internal responses rather than coordinating movement.\n\nNext, the somatic nervous system. I know that this system controls voluntary movements and also receives sensory information from the body. So, it's involved in conscious actions and perceptions. Again, while it might be involved in Jared seeing the shadows and perhaps deciding to move or look closer, it doesn't directly explain the increase in blood pressure and breathing rate.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system sounds familiar. I think it's part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing. The sympathetic nervous system is often associated with the \"fight or flight\" response, which is the body's reaction to stress or perceived threats. So, if Jared saw shadows and felt threatened or scared, his sympathetic nervous system would kick in, causing his blood pressure to rise and his breathing to speed up. That seems like a direct match for what's described.\n\nLastly, the pineal gland. I know that the pineal gland produces melatonin, which regulates sleep-wake cycles. While it's involved in controlling circadian rhythms, I don't see a direct connection to the immediate physical reactions described here, like increased blood pressure and breathing rate.\n\nComparing all these options, the sympathetic nervous system seems to be the most directly responsible for Jared's increased blood pressure and breathing rate in response to seeing shadows. The other systems have roles in sensory processing and movement, but the sympathetic nervous system is specifically involved in regulating internal organs and responding to stress.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. sympathetic nervous system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
