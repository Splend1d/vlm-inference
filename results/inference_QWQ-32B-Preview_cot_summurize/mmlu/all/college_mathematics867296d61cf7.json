And I'm supposed to find the limit of this sequence, assuming it converges. The options are 3, e, sqrt(5), and 0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a sequence to converge. If a sequence converges, it means that as n gets larger and larger, the terms x_n get closer and closer to some specific value, which we call the limit.\n\nSo, if the sequence converges to some limit L, then as n approaches infinity, x_n approaches L, and x_{n+1} also approaches L, because it's just the next term in the sequence.\n\nGiven that, I can set up the equation:\n\nL = sqrt(3 + 2L)\n\nBecause if x_n approaches L, then x_{n+1} also approaches L.\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for L.\n\nFirst, I'll square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nL\u00b2 = 3 + 2L\n\nNow, I'll rearrange the equation to set it to zero:\n\nL\u00b2 - 2L - 3 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, so I can solve for L using the quadratic formula:\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] / 2\n\nL = [2 \u00b1 4] / 2\n\nSo, L = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3\n\nOr L = (2 - 4)/2 = -2/2 = -1\n\nBut since x_n is defined as a square root, which is always non-negative, and x\u2081 = 1, which is positive, all subsequent terms will be positive. Therefore, the limit L must be positive, so L = 3.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense.\n\nLet me compute a few terms of the sequence to see if it's approaching 3.\n\nx\u2081 = 1\n\nx\u2082 = sqrt(3 + 2*1) = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236\n\nx\u2083 = sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5)) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 4.472) \u2248 sqrt(7.472) \u2248 2.733\n\nx\u2084 = sqrt(3 + 2*2.733) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.466) \u2248 sqrt(8.466) \u2248 2.910\n\nx\u2085 = sqrt(3 + 2*2.910) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.820) \u2248 sqrt(8.820) \u2248 2.970\n\nx\u2086 = sqrt(3 + 2*2.970) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.940) \u2248 sqrt(8.940) \u2248 2.989\n\nx\u2087 = sqrt(3 + 2*2.989) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.978) \u2248 sqrt(8.978) \u2248 2.996\n\nIt looks like the sequence is increasing and approaching 3, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut let's consider if there could be another limit. The quadratic gave us L = 3 and L = -1, but since negative limit doesn't make sense here, L = 3 is the only valid solution.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, which is the value of x\u2082, so it's one of the terms in the sequence but not the limit.\n\nOption B is e, which is approximately 2.718, which is close to x\u2083, but again, not the limit.\n\nOption D is 0, which is x\u2081, but clearly not the limit.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be A. 3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if the sequence actually converges to 3.\n\nSuppose L = 3.\n\nThen, check if L = sqrt(3 + 2L)\n\nPlug in L = 3:\n\n3 = sqrt(3 + 2*3) = sqrt(3 + 6) = sqrt(9) = 3\n\nIt holds true.\n\nAlso, let's check if L = sqrt(5):\n\nsqrt(5) \u2248 2.236\n\nDoes sqrt(5) = sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5))?\n\nLeft side: sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236\n\nRight side: sqrt(3 + 2*sqrt(5)) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 4.472) \u2248 sqrt(7.472) \u2248 2.733\n\nNot equal, so L = sqrt(5) is not a solution.\n\nSimilarly, L = e \u2248 2.718\n\nDoes 2.718 = sqrt(3 + 2*2.718) \u2248 sqrt(3 + 5.436) \u2248 sqrt(8.436) \u2248 2.904?\n\nNo, not equal.\n\nL = 0:\n\n0 = sqrt(3 + 2*0) = sqrt(3) \u2248 1.732\n\nNot equal.\n\nTherefore, only L = 3 satisfies the equation.\n\nHence, the answer is A. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
