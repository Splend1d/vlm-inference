To consent to the consignment year after year of hundreds of innocent victims to a cruel and untimely end, when the power exists of preventing it, is a predicament which no conscience can contemplate without horror. But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nWhich of the following resources would the author of the second passage have been most likely interested in obtaining from local natives?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's asking about which resource George Simpson, who was the Head of the Northern Department for the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826, would have been most interested in obtaining from local natives. The options are ivory, tobacco, silver, or furs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who George Simpson was and what the Hudson's Bay Company was involved in during that time period. The Hudson's Bay Company was a British trading company that was established in the 17th century and operated primarily in what is now Canada. They were major players in the North American fur trade.\n\nGiven that context, it seems likely that furs would be a primary interest for the Hudson's Bay Company. Furs were highly valued in Europe for clothing and other purposes, and the company made a significant profit from trading furs.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Ivory: While ivory was a valuable commodity, especially for things like piano keys, billiard balls, and decorative items, I don't recall the Hudson's Bay Company being particularly associated with ivory trading. Their focus was more on fur trading.\n\nB. Tobacco: Tobacco was certainly a valuable commodity, especially in North America and Europe, but again, my knowledge suggests that the Hudson's Bay Company was more focused on fur trading rather than tobacco.\n\nC. Silver: Silver was a precious metal used in coinage and other goods, but I don't think the Hudson's Bay Company was involved in mining or trading silver directly with local natives.\n\nD. Furs: As I mentioned earlier, furs were the main commodity traded by the Hudson's Bay Company. They established trading posts and engaged with indigenous peoples to acquire furs, which were then shipped back to Europe for sale.\n\nGiven this information, it seems clear that furs would be the most likely resource that George Simpson would have been interested in obtaining from local natives.\n\nHowever, to make sure, I should consider the time period and location. George Simpson was head of the Northern Department in 1826, which would have included areas like Rupert's Land, which is a vast territory in Canada. This area was rich in fur-bearing animals, making fur trading the primary economic activity of the company there.\n\nAdditionally, the quote from Simpson suggests that he believed in maintaining control over the natives through economic dependence, specifically by selling them foodstuffs and manufactured goods. This aligns with the fur trade model, where the company would provide goods to the indigenous traders in exchange for furs.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context and the specific role of the Hudson's Bay Company, the most likely answer is D. Furs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
