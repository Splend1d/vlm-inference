One study found a cheap and easy way to estimate the number of nesting sites of terns (a type of seabird) by monitoring the number of calls heard per minute. More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about correlating the number of calls heard per minute with the abundance of nests for these seabirds called terns. The study found that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites. And now, I need to figure out what the correlation coefficient is based on that information.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a correlation coefficient is. I know that it's a measure of how strongly two variables are related to each other. It's usually denoted by \"r,\" and it ranges from -1 to 1. A positive value means that as one variable increases, the other one also increases, and a negative value means that as one increases, the other decreases.\n\nIn this case, the study found that more calls happen when there are more birds, which makes sense. So, there's a positive relationship between the number of calls and the abundance of nests. That means the correlation coefficient should be positive.\n\nNow, the problem says that the number of calls explains 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests. I think that refers to the coefficient of determination, which is the square of the correlation coefficient. So, if r squared is 71%, then r should be the square root of 0.71.\n\nLet me calculate that. The square root of 0.71 is approximately 0.84. So, r should be about 0.84.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem has options that include -0.71 and -0.84 as well. But since we've established that the relationship is positive, the negative values don't make sense here. So, I can eliminate options A and C.\n\nNow, between options B and D, which are 0.71 and 0.84, I need to decide which one is correct. I recall that the coefficient of determination is r squared, which is 0.71 in this case. So, r would be the square root of 0.71, which is approximately 0.84.\n\nLet me double-check that. If r is 0.84, then r squared is about 0.7056, which is close to 0.71. So, that seems right.\n\nBut option B is 0.71, which is the r squared value, not the correlation coefficient. So, that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D, which is 0.84.\n\nWait, but I remember that sometimes people might refer to the correlation as 0.71 if that's the coefficient of determination, but in statistics, correlation coefficient is r, and r squared is the coefficient of determination.\n\nSo, to make sure, let's look back at the problem. It says, \"the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.\"\n\nExplaining variation is related to r squared, not r. So, if 71% of the variation is explained, that means r squared is 0.71, and r is the square root of that, which is about 0.84.\n\nTherefore, the correlation coefficient is +0.84.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where the correlation coefficient would be 0.71. If r were 0.71, then r squared would be about 0.5041, which is 50.41%. But the problem states 71% of the variation is explained, which is higher than that. So, 0.71 couldn't be the correlation coefficient in this case.\n\nSimilarly, negative values don't make sense here because the relationship is positive.\n\nHence, the answer is D: the correlation coefficient is 0.84.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
