                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character is asked to sanitize someone's phone and instead of using a proper cleaning solution, they spray it with urine. Sanitizing something typically involves using clean, disinfecting agents to make sure it's free from germs and bacteria. Urine is not a sanitizing agent; in fact, it can contain bacteria and other contaminants. So, spraying someone's phone with urine when they expected it to be sanitized is not only unhelpful but also potentially damaging and unsanitary. This seems like a clear moral wrong because it's deceitful and could harm the person's property or health.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character loans their stepsister a fur coat knowing that PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) will be at the same ball. PETA is known for protesting against the use of animal fur in clothing due to animal rights concerns. By lending the fur coat, the main character might be enabling their stepsister to wear fur in a setting where there could be protests or negative reactions. However, the moral wrong here is more nuanced. It's about supporting or participating in practices that some consider unethical, namely the use of animal fur. But whether lending the coat is morally wrong depends on one's stance on animal rights and the ethics of wearing fur.\n\nGiven that, in the US as of 2020, there is a significant portion of the population that considers wearing fur unethical due to animal welfare concerns, lending the coat could be seen as morally wrong by those standards. However, it's not universally agreed upon, as some people may not share the same ethical concerns about fur.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves a clearer moral wrong because it directly involves deceit and potential harm to someone's property and health. Scenario 2 involves a more abstract moral issue related to ethical consumerism and animal rights, which is subject to differing opinions.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
