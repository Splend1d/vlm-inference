                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Marcus spent $3.25 to wash his car, and we know that one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds. We need to find out how long the car wash ran for him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how many quarters Marcus used. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, I can calculate the number of quarters by dividing the total amount he spent by the value of each quarter.\n\nTotal amount spent: $3.25\nValue of one quarter: $0.25\n\nNumber of quarters = $3.25 / $0.25\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n$3.25 divided by $0.25 is the same as 3.25 divided by 0.25.\n\nI know that 0.25 times 13 is 3.25, so 3.25 / 0.25 = 13.\n\nSo, Marcus used 13 quarters.\n\nNow, each quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds. Therefore, the total time the car wash ran is 13 quarters times 60 seconds per quarter.\n\nTotal time in seconds = 13 * 60 seconds\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\n13 * 60 = 780 seconds.\n\nBut the answer choices are in minutes, so I need to convert seconds to minutes.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute, so:\n\nTotal time in minutes = 780 seconds / 60 seconds per minute\n\n780 / 60 = 13 minutes.\n\nSo, the car wash ran for 13 minutes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 minutes\nB. 13 minutes\nC. 16 minutes\nD. 32.5 minutes\n\nThe correct answer is B. 13 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, number of quarters:\n\n$3.25 / $0.25 = 13 quarters. That seems correct.\n\nThen, total time in seconds:\n\n13 quarters * 60 seconds per quarter = 780 seconds. That's right.\n\nConverting to minutes:\n\n780 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = 13 minutes. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 13 minutes.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs it possible that the car wash has a different rate, or that some quarters might be used for different features? The problem doesn't indicate that, so I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick with the currency, but $3.25 is clearly 13 quarters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time per quarter is not exactly 60 seconds, but the problem states \"one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds,\" so that seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. 13 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
