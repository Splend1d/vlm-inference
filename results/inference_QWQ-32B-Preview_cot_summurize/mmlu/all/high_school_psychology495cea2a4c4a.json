It is a significant milestone in female sexual development and typically occurs around the age of 12, although this can vary among individuals.\n\nOption A states \"12 in males only,\" which is incorrect because menarche is not a term applicable to males. Males do not experience menarche.\n\nOption B says \"12 in females only,\" which is correct. Menarche occurs in females typically around age 12, marking the beginning of their reproductive years.\n\nOption C, \"12 in both sexes,\" is incorrect because menarche is exclusive to females.\n\nOption D, \"12 in females and 14 in males,\" is also incorrect. While males do undergo puberty and develop secondary sexual characteristics, menarche is not a part of male development. The age of 14 in males might refer to other aspects of male puberty, such as the onset of spermarche, which is the first ejaculation, but this is not equivalent to menarche.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 12 in females only.\n\nIt's important to note that the age of menarche can vary based on genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors. Some females may experience menarche earlier or later than age 12. Additionally, understanding these developmental stages is crucial for providing appropriate health education and care for adolescents."
