Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nIn the short term, the events discussed in both passages led to which of the following outcomes?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got these two passages about the Indian Rebellion of 1857, specifically focusing on the Cawnpore massacres. The first one is from a British journalist, William Howard Russell, writing in 1860, and the second is from a historian, Rudrangshu Mukherjee, writing in 1990. The question is asking about the short-term outcomes of the events described in these passages.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these passages are saying.\n\nRussell's account seems to emphasize the shock and horror in Britain over the massacres, particularly because it was Indians turning on their British rulers, including women and children. He mentions that this was a servile war, a war of religion, race, and revenge. So, it was a revolt against British rule, motivated by various factors like religion, race, and a desire to overthrow foreign rule.\n\nMukherjee's account provides a different perspective. He talks about violence as a key aspect of British rule in India, where the British had a monopoly on violence as part of their autocratic rule. The rebellion shattered this monopoly by using violence against the British. Mukherjee also discusses how British rule was based on a hierarchy of races, with Britons seen as superior and Indians as inferior, almost like animals.\n\nSo, both passages are discussing the severity and significance of the rebellion, but from different angles: one from a contemporary British perspective and the other from a later historical analysis.\n\nNow, the question is about the short-term outcomes of these events. I need to think about what happened immediately after the rebellion.\n\nI recall that the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major turning point in British Indian history. Before the rebellion, British rule in India was administered by the British East India Company, which was a private trading company that had been granted administrative powers by the British Crown.\n\nAfter the rebellion, there was a significant shift in how Britain governed India. The British government decided to take direct control over India, ending the East India Company's rule. This was formalized with the Government of India Act in 1858, which established the British Raj, with the British monarch as Empress of India.\n\nSo, in the short term, the rebellion led to the defeat of the Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government, replacing the East India Company.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. The expulsion of the British East India Company and partial home rule for India.\n\nWait, the East India Company was expelled, but home rule for India? That doesn't sound right. Home rule would imply some degree of self-governance, which didn't happen immediately after 1857. Actually, British rule became more direct and centralized.\n\nB. British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company.\n\nNo, the East India Company was disbanded and replaced by direct rule from Britain. So, it wasn't about strengthening the Company.\n\nC. Indian military success and the attainment of full independence from British authority.\n\nThis isn't correct either. The rebellion was largely crushed by the British, and India remained under British rule for another 90 years or so.\n\nD. The defeat of Indian rebels and the imposition of direct rule by the British government.\n\nThis seems to align with what I recall. The rebellion was suppressed, and the British government took direct control of India.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Wasn't there some element of partial home rule or autonomy granted after 1857?\n\nI think after the rebellion, the British did try to implement some reforms to appease the Indian population and prevent further uprisings. For example, they introduced some Indians into lower ranks of administration, and there was a greater emphasis on preserving Indian traditions and religions, especially after Queen Victoria's proclamation in 1858, where she promised respect for native princes and their territories.\n\nHowever, this was not partial home rule. It was more about co-opting Indian elites and showing respect for Indian customs to maintain stability.\n\nSo, option A is incorrect because there was no partial home rule granted.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the East India Company was disbanded, not strengthened.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the rebellion was defeated, and India did not gain independence.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct answer.\n\nIt's important to note that while the British did make some concessions and reforms after 1857, the overall structure of rule was that of direct colonial control by the British government.\n\nAlso, considering the perspectives in the passages, Russell's horror and Mukherjee's analysis of the power dynamics, it makes sense that the British response would be to assert even stricter control to prevent such an uprising from happening again.\n\nSo, in the short term, the outcome was the defeat of the Indian rebels and the establishment of direct rule by the British government, marking the official beginning of the British Raj.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
