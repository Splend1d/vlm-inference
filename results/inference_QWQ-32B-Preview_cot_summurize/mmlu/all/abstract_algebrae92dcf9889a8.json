I need to determine whether each statement is true or false, given that K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group G.\n\n**Statement 1:** If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then K is free abelian.\n\nFirst, I know that a finitely generated free abelian group is isomorphic to Z^n for some integer n, where Z is the set of integers. So, G \u2245 Z^n.\n\nNow, subgroups of free abelian groups are also free abelian. This is a standard result in group theory. In fact, it's a consequence of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID), since Z is a PID.\n\nSo, any subgroup K of G, which is free abelian, should also be free abelian. And since K is nonzero, it has a positive rank.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If K is a nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group, then G / K is free abelian.\n\nOkay, now I need to consider the quotient group G / K and determine if it's free abelian.\n\nAgain, G \u2245 Z^n, and K is a subgroup of G, which we've established is also free abelian.\n\nThe quotient of a free abelian group by a subgroup is not necessarily free abelian. In fact, in this case, G / K is a finitely generated abelian group, but it may have torsion.\n\nFor example, consider G = Z (which is Z^1), and let K = 2Z, which is also free abelian. Then G / K = Z / 2Z, which is a cyclic group of order 2. This is not a free abelian group because it has finite order; free abelian groups have no torsion.\n\nSo, in this case, G / K is not free abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nSo the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
