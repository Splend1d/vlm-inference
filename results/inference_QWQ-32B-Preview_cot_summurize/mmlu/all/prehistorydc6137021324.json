Since chimpanzees and bonobos are our closest living relatives, studying them would help us understand more about human evolution and behavior.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nA. Paleoanthropology is the study of ancient humans and their ancestors through fossils and other physical evidence. While it's related to human evolution, it focuses on past species, not the living relatives.\n\nB. Archaeology is the study of human history and prehistory through the excavation of sites and the analysis of artifacts and other physical remains. Again, it's about human culture and history, but not specifically about our living relatives.\n\nD. Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure. While language is a key aspect of human behavior, it doesn't directly relate to studying our nearest living relatives.\n\nSo, yeah, primatology seems to be the most appropriate choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
