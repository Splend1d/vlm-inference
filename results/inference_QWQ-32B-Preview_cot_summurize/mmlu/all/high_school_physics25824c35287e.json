                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a see-saw with a girl and a boy sitting on opposite sides. The girl has a mass of m and the boy has a mass of 2m, and they're both sitting the same distance from the fulcrum, which is in the center. The see-saw tilts in favor of the boy, which makes sense because he's heavier. Now, I need to figure out which of the given options would NOT be a possible way to balance the see-saw.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: Move the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum.\n\nSo, if the boy moves closer to the fulcrum, his lever arm decreases. The torque, which is mass times gravity times the lever arm (\u03c4 = m * g * r), would decrease for the boy. Since his mass is 2m and he's moving to half the distance, his new torque would be 2m * g * (r/2) = m * g * r, which is the same as the girl's torque if she stays at her original distance r with mass m. So, this should balance the see-saw. Therefore, this is a possible method.\n\nOption B: Move the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum.\n\nIf the girl moves to double her original distance, her lever arm increases to 2r. Her torque would be m * g * 2r = 2m * g * r, which matches the boy's original torque of 2m * g * r. So, this should also balance the see-saw. This seems like another possible method.\n\nOption C: Allow a second girl of mass m to join the first.\n\nIf another girl of mass m joins the first girl, the total mass on the girl's side becomes 2m. With the same distance r, the torque would be 2m * g * r, matching the boy's torque. This should balance the see-saw as well.\n\nOption D: Move the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy.\n\nThis one seems a bit trickier. If the fulcrum moves to half its original distance from the boy, that means the boy's lever arm decreases, and the girl's lever arm increases.\n\nLet's assume the original distance from the fulcrum to each is r. If the fulcrum moves to half that distance from the boy, the boy's new lever arm is r/2, and the girl's new lever arm is now 1.5r (since the total length is 2r, and the fulcrum has moved closer to the boy).\n\nSo, the boy's torque is now 2m * g * (r/2) = m * g * r.\n\nThe girl's torque is m * g * 1.5r = 1.5m * g * r.\n\nComparing the two, the girl's torque is greater than the boy's, so the see-saw would tilt in favor of the girl now.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for which option would NOT be a possible method to balance the see-saw. So, if moving the fulcrum to half its original distance from the boy results in the girl's torque being greater, that means the see-saw is not balanced. Therefore, this would NOT be a possible method to balance the see-saw.\n\nBut let me double-check this calculation.\n\nOriginal distance from fulcrum to each: r.\n\nTotal length of the see-saw: 2r.\n\nIf the fulcrum moves to half its original distance from the boy, that means the fulcrum is now at a distance of r/2 from the boy and therefore 2r - r/2 = 1.5r from the girl.\n\nSo, boy's lever arm: r/2.\n\nGirl's lever arm: 1.5r.\n\nTorques:\n\nBoy: 2m * g * (r/2) = m * g * r.\n\nGirl: m * g * 1.5r = 1.5m * g * r.\n\nIndeed, the girl's torque is greater, so the see-saw wouldn't be balanced.\n\nTherefore, option D is the one that would NOT be a possible method to balance the see-saw.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that the other options do balance the see-saw.\n\nOption A: Boy moves to r/2.\n\nTorque boy: 2m * g * (r/2) = m * g * r.\n\nTorque girl: m * g * r.\n\nBalanced.\n\nOption B: Girl moves to 2r.\n\nTorque girl: m * g * 2r = 2m * g * r.\n\nTorque boy: 2m * g * r.\n\nBalanced.\n\nOption C: Add another girl of mass m.\n\nTotal mass on girl's side: 2m.\n\nTorque girl: 2m * g * r.\n\nTorque boy: 2m * g * r.\n\nBalanced.\n\nOption D: Move fulcrum to r/2 from boy.\n\nTorque boy: 2m * g * (r/2) = m * g * r.\n\nTorque girl: m * g * (1.5r) = 1.5m * g * r.\n\nNot balanced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
