                    "text": "I think the correct answer is C. The idea that the fall of one state to communism would inexorably lead to the fall of its neighbors. I remember hearing about this in history class. It was a key concept during the Cold War, especially when it came to decisions about getting involved in places like Vietnam. The US believed that if one country in a region became communist, then neighboring countries would follow like dominoes falling in a row. That's why they tried to prevent communism from spreading by supporting anti-communist forces in those areas.\n\nOption A sounds interesting, but I don't recall the Cold War being directly compared to game theory principles. Game theory is more about strategic decision-making in competitive situations, but the Domino Theory seems more specific to the spread of communism.\n\nOption B mentions that certain states were of higher value than others to the US during the Cold War. While that might be true, it doesn't directly relate to the Domino Theory. The Domino Theory is more about the perceived inevitability of communism spreading from one country to another, not about the intrinsic value of particular states.\n\nOption D talks about the growth of democracy spreading to neighboring countries, which is sort of the opposite of the Domino Theory. There might be theories about democracy spreading, but that doesn't match the description of the Domino Theory.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that C is the right answer. The Domino Theory was the belief that if one nation came under the influence of communism, then neighboring countries would follow in a domino effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
