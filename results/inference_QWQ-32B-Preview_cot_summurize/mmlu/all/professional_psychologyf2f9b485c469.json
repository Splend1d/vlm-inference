                    "text": "I think this question is about social psychology, specifically about how we perceive others' behaviors. Let's look at each option to see which one fits best.\n\nOption A is \"self-serving bias.\" I know that self-serving bias is when people attribute their successes to their own abilities and efforts, but blame external factors for their failures. So, this is more about how we explain our own behaviors and outcomes, not necessarily others'.\n\nOption B is \"actor-observer effect.\" This one sounds familiar. The actor-observer effect is when we tend to attribute our own actions to external causes, but attribute others' actions to their internal characteristics or dispositions. So, for example, if I trip and fall, I might say it's because the floor was wet, but if someone else trips, I might think they're clumsy. So, this seems related to how we perceive others' behaviors differently from our own.\n\nOption C is \"fundamental attribution bias.\" I've heard this term before. It's also known as correspondence bias or attribution effect. This bias describes our tendency to overemphasize personal characteristics and intentions in explaining others' behaviors, while underestimating the influence of external circumstances. So, similar to the actor-observer effect, but perhaps more general.\n\nOption D is \"self-perception bias.\" I'm not as familiar with this term. A quick think suggests that self-perception bias might be about how we form our own attitudes and beliefs based on observing our own behavior, perhaps related to Bem's self-perception theory. But again, this seems more about our own self-perception rather than how we perceive others.\n\nComparing options B and C, both seem relevant to how we perceive others' behaviors. The actor-observer effect is a specific type of attribution bias where we attribute our own actions to external causes and others' actions to internal traits. The fundamental attribution bias is a broader tendency to overattribute others' behaviors to their personal traits and underattribute to situational factors.\n\nGiven that the question is about \"another person's behavior,\" and considering that both B and C are about attributing causes to others' behaviors, I need to decide which one is more accurate or general.\n\nThe actor-observer effect specifically highlights the difference in attribution based on whether we are the actor (our own behavior) or the observer (others' behavior). The fundamental attribution bias is more about the general tendency to overemphasize internal attributes in others, regardless of whether we are acting or observing.\n\nPerhaps the fundamental attribution bias encompasses the actor-observer effect. In that case, fundamental attribution bias might be a more overarching concept.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it's about \"another person's behavior,\" which suggests it's specifically about how we perceive others, not necessarily in comparison to our own behavior.\n\nGiven that, the fundamental attribution bias seems more directly applicable because it's about how we attribute causes to others' behaviors in general, emphasizing internal factors over external ones.\n\nThe actor-observer effect is a specific instance of this bias, where the difference in attribution is highlighted between our own actions and others'.\n\nSo, perhaps the fundamental attribution bias is the more appropriate answer here.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the definitions again.\n\nFundamental attribution bias: tendency to overemphasize internal attributes and underemphasize external circumstances in explaining others' behaviors.\n\nActor-observer effect: tendency to attribute our own actions to external causes and others' actions to internal traits.\n\nSelf-serving bias: attributing successes to internal factors and failures to external factors, but mainly regarding our own actions.\n\nSelf-perception bias: possibly related to forming attitudes based on observed behavior, but more about our own self-perception.\n\nGiven these, if the question is about how we perceive another person's behavior, the fundamental attribution bias seems to fit best, as it directly deals with how we attribute causes to others' behaviors.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Fundamental attribution bias.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
