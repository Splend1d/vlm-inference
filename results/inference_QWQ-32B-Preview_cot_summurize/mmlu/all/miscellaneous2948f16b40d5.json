They were sent by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase and find a route to the Pacific Ocean. So, where did they start their journey in 1804?\n\nLet me think about the options:\n\nA. Seattle - That's on the west coast, but their expedition started from the east and moved westward, so it doesn't make sense for them to begin in Seattle.\n\nB. St. Louis - Hmm, St. Louis is located near the Mississippi River, which was a major waterway for exploration at that time. I think this is a strong candidate.\n\nC. New Orleans - New Orleans is also part of the Louisiana Purchase, but I believe their expedition started further up north, maybe in St. Louis.\n\nD. Washington D.C. - That's the capital, but their expedition was focused on the west, so starting from D.C. wouldn't make much sense in terms of reaching the exploration grounds efficiently.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that St. Louis was an important starting point for many western expeditions because of its location at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. The Mississippi River runs from north to south, and the Missouri River runs from west to east, so starting in St. Louis would give them access to both rivers, which were crucial for their journey.\n\nAlso, President Jefferson appointed Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to lead this expedition, and they assembled their team and supplies in St. Louis before setting off up the Missouri River.\n\nI think the correct answer is B. St. Louis.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check the other options.\n\nSeattle is on the west coast, and the expedition aimed to reach the Pacific, but their starting point was definitely on the east side. So, A is not correct.\n\nNew Orleans is south, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, but their journey was headed west and then north up the Missouri River. Starting from New Orleans would require them to travel up the Mississippi first, which might not be the most direct route for their expedition.\n\nWashington D.C. is\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u79bb\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u63a2\u9669\u533a\u57df\u592a\u8fdc\uff0c\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u65c5\u884c\u5230\u897f\u90e8\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0cD\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u6211\u786e\u5b9a\u7b54\u6848\u662fB.
