                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I stuffed the pillow with chicken meat.\"\n\nHmm, stuffing a pillow with chicken meat seems unusual and potentially messy. But is it morally wrong? Well, eating chicken is common, and using chicken meat in various ways is acceptable. However, putting raw meat inside a pillow raises several concerns.\n\nFirstly, health and sanitation: Raw meat can spoil quickly and harbor bacteria like salmonella or E. coli, which can cause food poisoning. Using raw chicken meat in a pillow could lead to health hazards if someone were to come into contact with it and then touch their face or mouth.\n\nSecondly, there's the issue of respect for the animal. While eating chicken is acceptable, treating chicken meat in a way that's not intended for consumption might be seen as disrespectful to the animal or to the process of food preparation.\n\nLastly, there's the matter of personal hygiene and consideration for others who might use the pillow. It could be seen as inconsiderate or even disgusting to have raw meat in a pillow.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that stuffing a pillow with chicken meat is morally wrong due to health risks and potential disrespect.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I brought my deceased mom to the taxidermist so I can remember her forever.\"\n\nThis scenario involves bringing a deceased mother to a taxidermist to preserve her as a keepsake. Taxidermy is usually associated with preserving animals, like mounting a deer head on a wall or stuffing a beloved pet.\n\nApplying taxidermy to a human body raises significant moral and ethical questions.\n\nFirst, there are legal issues. In the US, preserving human remains in such a manner is likely illegal. There are strict regulations governing the handling and disposition of human remains, and taxidermy is not an accepted practice for humans.\n\nSecondly, there are ethical and moral considerations. Human bodies are treated with dignity and respect after death. Practices like cremation or burial are standard, and transforming a human body into a trophy or ornament is generally viewed as grotesque and disrespectful to the deceased and their loved ones.\n\nAdditionally, there might be psychological implications. Keeping a preserved body as a memento could be seen as unhealthy mourning or a form of fixation that hinders the grieving process.\n\nTherefore, bringing a deceased mother to a taxidermist seems clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
