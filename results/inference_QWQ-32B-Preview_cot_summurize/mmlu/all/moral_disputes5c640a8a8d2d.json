I remember that Carens is a philosopher who writes about immigration and global justice, so I think he's associated with some form of cosmopolitanism. Cosmopolitanism is the idea that all human beings are members of a single community and should be treated as such, regardless of their nationality or place of birth.\n\nOption A is Kantian distributionism. I'm not sure what exactly that is, but I know that Kant had ideas about justice and morality that influenced later theories. Maybe it's related to Kant's views on distributive justice?\n\nOption B is anticosmopolitanism. That sounds like the opposite of cosmopolitanism, so if Carens is known for his cosmopolitan views, this probably isn't the right answer.\n\nOption C is libertarian cosmopolitanism. Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual liberty and minimal state intervention. Combining that with cosmopolitanism might mean advocating for open borders and free movement of people, but I'm not sure if that's Carens's position.\n\nOption D is egalitarian cosmopolitanism. Egalitarianism is the belief in equality, so this would likely involve promoting equality on a global scale, beyond national boundaries.\n\nGiven that Carens is known for his work on immigration and arguing for more open borders and the rights of migrants, I think his views align more with a form of cosmopolitanism that emphasizes equality. So, maybe egalitarian cosmopolitanism is the way to go.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. I recall that Carens has written about the idea that people who have lived in a country for a certain period should have similar rights to citizens, including the right to stay and work. This seems to be about extending equal treatment to long-term residents, regardless of their nationality. That sounds like an egalitarian approach within a cosmopolitan framework.\n\nOn the other hand, libertarian cosmopolitanism might also support open borders, but perhaps for different reasons, such as maximizing individual freedom and economic efficiency. Carens, however, seems more focused on the moral claims of migrants and the need for societies to recognize the rights of all people within their borders, not just citizens.\n\nKantian distributionism is less familiar to me, but I know that Kant had principles about justice and distribution based on his categorical imperative. Maybe Carens has incorporated some Kantian ideas into his theory, but I don't recall specifics.\n\nAnticosmopolitanism is definitely not fitting, as Carens is known for his cosmopolitan views.\n\nSo, between C and D, I'm leaning towards D, egalitarian cosmopolitanism, because Carens emphasizes the equal moral worth of all people and the need for societies to treat all individuals within their jurisdiction equally, regardless of their nationality.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether Carens's views align more closely with libertarian principles. Libertarians often advocate for open borders based on the idea of individual liberty and the right to migrate. However, Carens's arguments seem to be more about the moral claims of migrants and the need for social justice, which sounds more egalitarian than libertarian.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D, egalitarian cosmopolitanism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
