                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a standard deck of 52 cards, which consists of 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 cards. We need to choose 3 cards such that all three are from different suits, and the order doesn't matter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We're to select 3 cards, each from a different suit, and since the order doesn't matter, it's a combination problem.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. There are 4 suits, and we need to choose 3 different suits for the 3 cards. So, first, I need to choose which 3 suits will be represented in my selection.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 3 suits out of 4 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{4}{3} \\), which is 4. So, there are 4 ways to choose which suits will be included.\n\nNow, for each of these suit combinations, I need to choose one card from each suit. Since there are 13 cards in each suit, the number of ways to choose one card from a suit is 13.\n\nTherefore, for each suit combination, the number of ways to choose one card from each suit is \\( 13 \\times 13 \\times 13 = 13^3 = 2197 \\).\n\nBut wait, since the order of the cards doesn't matter, does multiplying by 13 three times account for the order? Let's think about that.\n\nActually, in this case, because we're choosing one card from each distinct suit, and the suits are distinct, the multiplication \\( 13 \\times 13 \\times 13 \\) already considers the different cards from different suits without regard to order. So, no, it doesn't account for order in this context.\n\nTherefore, for each of the 4 suit combinations, there are 2197 possible sets of 3 cards, each from a different suit.\n\nSo, the total number of ways should be \\( 4 \\times 2197 = 8788 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 8788\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 2197\n\nD. 21\n\nIt seems that option A is 8788, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from 52, which is \\( \\binom{52}{3} \\), and then subtract the number of ways where not all suits are different.\n\nHowever, that might be more complicated. Let's stick with the initial approach, as it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step:\n\n1. Choose the first card: 52 options (since any card can be chosen first).\n\n2. Choose the second card: it must be from a different suit than the first card. Since there are 3 suits left, and each has 13 cards, there are \\( 3 \\times 13 = 39 \\) options.\n\n3. Choose the third card: it must be from a different suit than the first two cards. Now, only 2 suits are left, each with 13 cards, so \\( 2 \\times 13 = 26 \\) options.\n\nSo, the total number of ordered selections is \\( 52 \\times 39 \\times 26 \\).\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, we need to divide by the number of permutations of the 3 cards, which is \\( 3! = 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of unordered selections is \\( \\frac{52 \\times 39 \\times 26}{6} \\).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, \\( 52 \\times 39 = 2028 \\).\n\nThen, \\( 2028 \\times 26 = 52728 \\).\n\nFinally, \\( \\frac{52728}{6} = 8788 \\).\n\nAgain, I get 8788, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, it seems that the correct answer is 8788, which is option A.\n\nWait a minute, but let's consider if there's any overlap or overcounting in this approach.\n\nIn the first approach, I chose the suits first and then the cards within those suits. In the second approach, I considered the ordered selection and then adjusted for unordered selections.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same answer, which gives me confidence that 8788 is the correct number of ways to choose 3 cards from different suits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 8788.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8788} \\]"
