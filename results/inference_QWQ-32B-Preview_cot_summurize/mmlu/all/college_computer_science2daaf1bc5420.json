                    "text": "So I have this problem here. It defines a function T(n) with T(1) = 7 and T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n) for all integers n \u2265 1. I need to find the order of growth of T(n) as a function of n, and choose the correct option among \u0398(n), \u0398(n log n), \u0398(n^2), and \u0398(n^2 log n).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this recurrence relation is telling me. It's a recursive definition where each value of T(n) depends on the previous one, T(n-1), plus some term involving n.\n\nLet me try to expand this recurrence to see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form expression for T(n).\n\nStarting with T(1) = 7.\n\nThen, T(2) = 3*1 + T(1) = 3 + 7 = 10.\n\nT(3) = 3*2 + T(2) = 6 + 10 = 16.\n\nT(4) = 3*3 + T(3) = 9 + 16 = 25.\n\nT(5) = 3*4 + T(4) = 12 + 25 = 37.\n\nHmm, so the sequence is 7, 10, 16, 25, 37, and so on.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern here. Let me look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n10 - 7 = 3\n\n16 - 10 = 6\n\n25 - 16 = 9\n\n37 - 25 = 12\n\nSo the differences are 3, 6, 9, 12, which are multiples of 3. Specifically, 3*1, 3*2, 3*3, 3*4, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that T(n) is increasing quadratically, since the differences are linear.\n\nWait, in general, if the first differences are linear, that implies the function is quadratic.\n\nLet me consider that T(n) might be of the form a*n^2 + b*n + c, and try to find coefficients a, b, c that satisfy the recurrence.\n\nGiven T(1) = 7, T(2) = 10, T(3) = 16, I can set up a system of equations:\n\nFor n=1: a*(1)^2 + b*1 + c = 7 => a + b + c = 7\n\nFor n=2: a*(2)^2 + b*2 + c = 10 => 4a + 2b + c = 10\n\nFor n=3: a*(3)^2 + b*3 + c = 16 => 9a + 3b + c = 16\n\nNow, let's solve this system.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 10 - 7 => 3a + b = 3\n\nSubtract the second equation from the third:\n\n(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 16 - 10 => 5a + b = 6\n\nNow, I have:\n\n3a + b = 3\n\n5a + b = 6\n\nSubtract the first from the second:\n\n(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 6 - 3 => 2a = 3 => a = 3/2\n\nNow plug a = 3/2 into 3a + b = 3:\n\n3*(3/2) + b = 3 => 9/2 + b = 3 => b = 3 - 9/2 = -3/2\n\nNow plug a = 3/2 and b = -3/2 into a + b + c = 7:\n\n3/2 - 3/2 + c = 7 => c = 7\n\nSo, T(n) = (3/2)n^2 - (3/2)n + 7\n\nLet me verify this with T(4):\n\nT(4) = (3/2)*(16) - (3/2)*4 + 7 = 24 - 6 + 7 = 25, which matches earlier calculation.\n\nAnd T(5) = (3/2)*(25) - (3/2)*5 + 7 = 37.5 - 7.5 + 7 = 37, which also matches.\n\nGreat, so it seems T(n) = (3/2)n^2 - (3/2)n + 7\n\nNow, to find the order of growth, I need to consider the dominant term as n becomes large.\n\nIn this expression, the dominant term is (3/2)n^2, since n^2 grows faster than n or constants.\n\nTherefore, T(n) is \u0398(n^2).\n\nBut let me make sure there aren't any higher-order terms or logarithmic factors.\n\nLooking back at the recurrence, T(n+1) = 3n + T(n), which suggests that at each step, we're adding a linear term.\n\nWhen you sum up linear terms up to n, you get a quadratic function, which aligns with my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the order of growth is \u0398(n^2), which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
