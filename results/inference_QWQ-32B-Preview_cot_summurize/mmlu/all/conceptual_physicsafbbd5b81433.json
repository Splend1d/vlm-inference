                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"When you scale up an object to 3 times its linear size, the surface area increases by...\". And there are options A, B, C, and D. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to scale up an object linearly by 3 times. So, if I have a object, and I make each of its linear dimensions\u2014like length, width, height\u20143 times bigger, how does that affect its surface area and volume?\n\nI remember that for similar shapes, when you scale linear dimensions by a factor, the area scales by the square of that factor, and the volume scales by the cube of that factor. Is that right? Let me think.\n\nSo, if the linear scale factor is 3, then the area should scale by 3 squared, which is 9, and the volume should scale by 3 cubed, which is 27. That seems familiar from geometry.\n\nLet me test this with a simple example. Suppose I have a cube with sides of length 1. Its surface area is 6 times 1 squared, which is 6, and its volume is 1 cubed, which is 1.\n\nNow, if I scale up the cube by a factor of 3, each side becomes 3. The new surface area would be 6 times 3 squared, which is 6 times 9, equal to 54. And the new volume would be 3 cubed, which is 27.\n\nSo, comparing the new surface area to the original: 54 divided by 6 is 9. So, the surface area increases by 9 times. And the volume increases from 1 to 27, which is 27 times.\n\nThat matches what I thought earlier: area increases by the square of the scale factor, and volume by the cube.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. surface area increases by 3 and volume by 9.\n\nB. surface area increases by 3 and volume by 27.\n\nC. surface area increases by 9 and volume by 27.\n\nD. surface area increases by 4 and volume by 8.\n\nBased on my calculation and understanding, option C seems correct: surface area increases by 9 and volume by 27.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any scenario where scaling linearly by 3 would not result in area increasing by 9 and volume by 27? I think for similar shapes, this should hold true.\n\nLet me consider another shape, say a sphere. For a sphere, surface area is 4 pi r squared, and volume is 4/3 pi r cubed.\n\nIf I scale the radius by 3, the new surface area would be 4 pi (3r) squared, which is 4 pi times 9 r squared, so 9 times the original surface area. And the new volume would be 4/3 pi (3r) cubed, which is 4/3 pi times 27 r cubed, so 27 times the original volume.\n\nAgain, same results: area increases by 9, volume by 27.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident with option C.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's look at option D: surface area increases by 4 and volume by 8.\n\nThat would correspond to a linear scale factor of 2, because 2 squared is 4 and 2 cubed is 8. But in this problem, the linear scale factor is 3, not 2, so option D doesn't fit.\n\nOption B has surface area increasing by 3 and volume by 27. But according to the math, surface area should increase by 9, not 3. So that's incorrect.\n\nOption A has surface area increasing by 3 and volume by 9, which again doesn't match the squared and cubed relationship.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: surface area increases by 9 and volume by 27.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
