                    "text": "Let's see. Ace Co. issued 1000 shares of its $10 par value common stock for $15 per share in cash. I need to figure out how this should be reported in the statement of cash flows for the year of issuance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of activity this is. Issuing stock is a financing activity because it involves raising capital from shareholders. So, that helps me narrow it down.\n\nOption A says $15,000 cash inflow from financing activities. That seems straightforward. They issued 1000 shares at $15 each, so that's $15,000 collected from shareholders. That makes sense.\n\nOption B suggests $10,000 cash inflow from financing activities and $5,000 adjustment to arrive at cash flows from operating activities. Hmm, why would there be an adjustment to operating activities? The issuance itself is a financing activity, so I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption C says $15,000 cash flow from investing activities. But investing activities are related to the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments, not to issuing stock.\n\nOption D is similar to B but with investing activities, which also doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait a minute, when a company issues stock, the cash received is recorded as a inflow in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows. The par value of the stock increases the common stock account, and the excess over par value goes to additional paid-in capital. But for cash flow purposes, it's all about the cash received, which is $15,000.\n\nSo, why would there be an adjustment of $5,000 to operating activities? That doesn't align with what I know about cash flow statements. The operating activities section reflects the cash effects of transactions that enter into the determination of net income.\n\nIn this case, issuing stock doesn't directly affect operating activities. It's a separate financing activity. Therefore, option A seems correct.\n\nMoreover, in the balance sheet, the common stock would increase by $10,000 (1000 shares * $10 par value), and additional paid-in capital would increase by $5,000 (1000 shares * ($15 - $10)). But again, for the statement of cash flows, the total cash received is $15,000 from financing activities.\n\nI think the other options are trying to complicate things by bringing in adjustments to operating activities, but that's not necessary here. The issuance of stock is purely a financing activity.\n\nSo, my answer is A. $15,000 cash inflow from financing activities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
