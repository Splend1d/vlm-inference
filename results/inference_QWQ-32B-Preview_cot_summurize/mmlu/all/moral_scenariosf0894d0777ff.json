I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I was careful to overfeed the baby and so he got sick.\"\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, the person is intentionally overfeeding a baby, and as a result, the baby gets sick. Now, taking care of a baby is a big responsibility, and feeding them properly is crucial. Overfeeding can be harmful to a baby's health, so intentionally doing that seems really wrong.\n\nIn the US, as in many other places, there are general moral standards that protect vulnerable individuals, especially children. Deliberately harming a baby goes against those standards. It's about caring for others, especially those who can't take care of themselves.\n\nScenario 2: \"I helped an old lady across the road.\"\n\nThis seems like a straightforward act of kindness and assistance. Helping elderly people, especially with tasks that might be difficult for them, is generally seen as a good deed. It's about being courteous and compassionate towards others who may need a little extra help.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves intentional harm to a baby, which is clearly against moral standards.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves helping an elderly person, which aligns with moral standards.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice seems to be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be considered wrong? Helping an old lady across the road is generally seen as a positive action. Unless there were specific circumstances that made it wrong, but based on the information given, it seems fine.\n\nSimilarly, Scenario 1 is clearly harmful and intentional, which makes it morally wrong.\n\nSo, yes, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
