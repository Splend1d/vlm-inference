                    "text": "So Ty has 12 weeks to read some books, and he spends 2 weeks on each book. He wants to find out how many books he can read in that time. The question is asking for an expression that he can use to find the total number of books.\n\nLet's think about this step by step. If Ty spends 2 weeks per book, and he has 12 weeks in total, then the number of books he can read is the total weeks divided by the weeks per book. So, it should be 12 divided by 2, which is 6 books.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have division. Instead, they have subtraction and addition. So maybe there's another way to think about it.\n\nOption A is 12 - 2, which is 10. That doesn't make sense for the number of books.\n\nOption B is 12 + 12, which is 24. That's also not relevant.\n\nOption C is 12 - 2 - 2 - 2, which is 12 - 6 = 6. That gives us 6, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nOption D is 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2, which is 12 - 12 = 0. That doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, option C is giving us the correct number of books, which is 6. But why is subtraction working here?\n\nWell, if Ty spends 2 weeks per book, and he has 12 weeks, subtracting 2 weeks for each book he reads, he can do this until he runs out of weeks. So, 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 6, which means he can read 3 books. Wait, that doesn't make sense because earlier we thought it should be 6 books.\n\nHold on, maybe I messed up. Let's recast this.\n\nIf he has 12 weeks and spends 2 weeks per book, then the number of books is 12 divided by 2, which is 6 books.\n\nOption C is 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 6, which seems to suggest 3 subtractions for 3 books, but that equals 6, which is the number of books. Hmm, that seems off.\n\nWait, maybe it's a misinterpretation. Let's see:\n\nStarting with 12 weeks, subtract 2 weeks for each book.\n\nSo, for the first book: 12 - 2 = 10 weeks left.\n\nSecond book: 10 - 2 = 8 weeks left.\n\nThird book: 8 - 2 = 6 weeks left.\n\nFourth book: 6 - 2 = 4 weeks left.\n\nFifth book: 4 - 2 = 2 weeks left.\n\nSixth book: 2 - 2 = 0 weeks left.\n\nSo, he can read 6 books in 12 weeks, subtracting 2 weeks for each book.\n\nBut option C only shows three subtractions: 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 6.\n\nThat would suggest only 3 books, but we know he can read 6 books.\n\nOption D shows six subtractions: 12 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 0, which would correspond to 6 books.\n\nBut the expression equals 0, which isn't the number of books.\n\nSo, perhaps neither C nor D is correct.\n\nWait, maybe the expression is meant to show the number of subtractions, with each subtraction representing one book.\n\nIn that case, option D has six subtractions, which would correspond to 6 books.\n\nBut the result is 0, which isn't the number of books.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expression is supposed to represent the remaining weeks after subtracting the time spent on each book, and the number of subtractions indicates the number of books.\n\nIn that case, option D would show 6 subtractions, meaning 6 books, and the result is 0, which makes sense because he's used up all his weeks.\n\nBut the question is asking for an expression to find the total number of books he will read, not an expression where the number of subtractions equals the number of books.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky.\n\nPerhaps the question is poorly worded or the options are not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intention is to recognize that repeated subtraction can be used for division.\n\nIn other words, dividing 12 by 2 is the same as subtracting 2 from 12 until you reach 0, counting the number of subtractions, which is 6.\n\nSo, in that sense, option D, which shows six subtractions, would be correct.\n\nBut the expression equals 0, which isn't the number of books.\n\nMaybe the idea is to count the number of times you subtract 2 from 12 until you reach 0, and that count is the number of books.\n\nIn that case, option D would be correct, but the expression itself equals 0, not 6.\n\nThis is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that Ty spends 2 weeks per book, so for n books, he needs 2n weeks.\n\nGiven he has 12 weeks, so 2n = 12, hence n = 6.\n\nBut none of the options show division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they expect 12 divided by 2, but since that's not an option, maybe they want the equivalent subtraction expression.\n\nIn that case, option D represents subtracting 2 six times, which corresponds to 6 books.\n\nBut again, the expression equals 0, not 6.\n\nMaybe the answer is D, and the explanation is that the number of subtractions equals the number of books, which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I would choose option D as the closest to the correct approach, even though it's not ideal.\n\nSo, the answer is D."
