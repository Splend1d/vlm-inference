                    "text": "Let's see which of these problems can be solved using a standard greedy algorithm.\n\nFirst, what's a greedy algorithm? It's an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.\n\nOkay, so problem I is about finding a minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph where the edges have positive integer weights. I know that there are algorithms like Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms that are used to find minimum spanning trees, and both of them are greedy algorithms. So, I think I can safely say that problem I can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm.\n\nNow, problem II is about finding a maximum clique in an undirected graph. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. Finding the maximum clique is known to be an NP-hard problem, which means there's no known polynomial-time algorithm for it, and certainly, a standard greedy algorithm isn't going to solve it optimally in all cases. Greedy algorithms might give some approximation, but they won't guarantee the maximum clique. So, I don't think problem II can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm.\n\nProblem III is about finding a maximum flow from a source node to a sink node in a directed graph with positive integer edge capacities. I recall that algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp are used for this purpose. These algorithms use the idea of augmenting paths, which is a bit different from the greedy approach. They iteratively find paths from source to sink and augment the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found. So, this doesn't seem like a standard greedy algorithm. Greedy algorithms make choices based on the best immediate benefit, whereas these flow algorithms are more about finding paths that can carry additional flow.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, only problem I can be solved by a standard greedy algorithm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nIt seems like A is the correct choice.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think again.\n\nIs there any way that problem II could be solved by a greedy algorithm? Well, in some specific graphs, maybe, but not in general. For instance, in a complete graph, every subset is a clique, so finding the maximum one is trivial. But in general graphs, it's not possible to guarantee finding the maximum clique using a greedy approach.\n\nAnd for problem III, while there might be greedy elements in the algorithms, like always choosing the path with the maximum available capacity, it's not purely greedy because it involves multiple iterations and the possibility of undoing previous choices by finding augmenting paths.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
