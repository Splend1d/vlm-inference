                    "text": "To determine which of these compounds has the lowest melting point, I need to consider the types of intermolecular forces each one experiences. The strength of these forces affects the melting point: stronger forces lead to higher melting points, while weaker forces result in lower melting points.\n\nLet's look at each compound one by one:\n\nA. HCl (hydrogen chloride)\n\nHCl is a molecular compound consisting of covalently bonded hydrogen and chlorine atoms. The primary intermolecular forces in HCl are dipole-dipole interactions because the molecule is polar. However, hydrogen bonding can also occur in some molecules, but in HCl, the hydrogen is bonded to chlorine, which isn't one of the highly electronegative atoms that typically participate in hydrogen bonding (like F, O, or N). So, I think dipole-dipole interactions are the main forces here.\n\nB. AgCl (silver chloride)\n\nAgCl is an ionic compound formed by silver ions (Ag+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between their positive and negative ions, which typically result in higher melting points compared to molecular compounds.\n\nC. CaCl2 (calcium chloride)\n\nCaCl2 is also an ionic compound, consisting of calcium ions (Ca2+) and chloride ions (Cl-). Like AgCl, it has strong ionic bonds, which should contribute to a high melting point.\n\nD. CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride)\n\nCCl4 is a molecular compound with carbon at the center bonded to four chlorine atoms. Since all C-Cl bonds are polar, but the molecule is symmetric (tetrahedral), the dipole moments cancel out, making CCl4 nonpolar. Therefore, the primary intermolecular forces in CCl4 are London dispersion forces, which are generally weaker than dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nComparing the types of intermolecular forces:\n\n- A. HCl: dipole-dipole interactions\n\n- B. AgCl: ionic bonds\n\n- C. CaCl2: ionic bonds\n\n- D. CCl4: London dispersion forces\n\nIonic bonds are much stronger than dipole-dipole interactions or London dispersion forces. Therefore, the ionic compounds (B and C) are likely to have higher melting points than the molecular compounds (A and D).\n\nBetween A and D, dipole-dipole interactions are generally stronger than London dispersion forces, so HCl should have a higher melting point than CCl4.\n\nHowever, I should consider the size and mass of the molecules as well. London dispersion forces increase with the size and mass of the molecule. CCl4 has a larger molecular mass than HCl, so its London dispersion forces might be stronger than those in HCl, even though dipole-dipole interactions are generally stronger than London dispersion forces in smaller molecules.\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIn general:\n\n- Ionic compounds have the highest melting points due to strong electrostatic forces.\n\n- Molecular compounds with dipole-dipole interactions have intermediate melting points.\n\n- Molecular compounds with only London dispersion forces have the lowest melting points.\n\nBut in this case, CCl4 has a larger molecular mass, which could mean stronger London dispersion forces compared to HCl, which has weaker dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nI need to recall that while dipole-dipole interactions are generally stronger than London dispersion forces for molecules of similar size, for larger molecules, London dispersion forces can become significant and even surpass dipole-dipole interactions.\n\nGiven that, CCl4 has a larger molecular mass (154 g/mol) compared to HCl (36.5 g/mol), so its London dispersion forces might be stronger than the dipole-dipole interactions in HCl.\n\nTherefore, CCl4 might have a higher melting point than HCl, which contradicts my initial thought.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in reality, HCl has a melting point of -114.2\u00b0C, while CCl4 has a melting point of -22.9\u00b0C. So HCl has a lower melting point than CCl4.\n\nThis suggests that even though CCl4 has weaker intermolecular forces (London dispersion), its higher molecular mass makes those forces stronger compared to the dipole-dipole interactions in HCl.\n\nTherefore, HCl should have a lower melting point than CCl4.\n\nBut among the options, we have to choose the one with the lowest melting point.\n\nSo, between A (HCl), B (AgCl), C (CaCl2), and D (CCl4), the ionic compounds B and C have the highest melting points, and between A and D, A (HCl) has a lower melting point than D (CCl4).\n\nTherefore, the compound with the lowest melting point should be A. HCl.\n\nBut let's double-check the melting points to be sure.\n\nLooking up the melting points:\n\n- A. HCl: -114.2\u00b0C\n\n- B. AgCl: 455\u00b0C\n\n- C. CaCl2: 772\u00b0C\n\n- D. CCl4: -22.9\u00b0C\n\n\u786e \u5b9e\uff0cHCl has the lowest melting point among these compounds.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. HCl.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
