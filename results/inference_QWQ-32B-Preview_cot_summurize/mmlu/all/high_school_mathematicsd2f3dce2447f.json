                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find the equation of the tangent line to the curve defined by F(t) = (t^2 + 1, 2^t) at the point where y = 4. The options are:\n\nA. y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 2)\n\nB. y \u2013 4 = 4 ln 2(x \u2013 2)\n\nC. y \u2013 4 = 4(x \u2013 5)\n\nD. y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 5)\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's going on here. The curve is parametric, with x and y both expressed in terms of t. Specifically, x = t^2 + 1 and y = 2^t. I need to find the tangent line at the point where y = 4.\n\nSo, step one is to find the value of t that corresponds to y = 4. Since y = 2^t, setting that equal to 4 gives me:\n\n2^t = 4\n\nI know that 2^2 = 4, so t = 2.\n\nAlright, so t = 2 corresponds to y = 4. Now, I need to find the point on the curve where t = 2. Plugging t = 2 into the x equation:\n\nx = (2)^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the point is (5, 4).\n\nNow, to find the tangent line at this point, I need to find the slope of the curve at t = 2. For parametric equations, the slope dy/dx is given by (dy/dt)/(dx/dt).\n\nSo, let's find dy/dt and dx/dt.\n\nFirst, dy/dt.\n\ny = 2^t\n\nThe derivative of 2^t with respect to t is 2^t * ln(2).\n\nSo, dy/dt = 2^t * ln(2)\n\nAt t = 2, dy/dt = 2^2 * ln(2) = 4 * ln(2)\n\nNext, dx/dt.\n\nx = t^2 + 1\n\nThe derivative of x with respect to t is 2t.\n\nSo, dx/dt = 2t\n\nAt t = 2, dx/dt = 2*(2) = 4\n\nNow, the slope dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = (4 * ln(2))/4 = ln(2)\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at t = 2 is ln(2).\n\nNow, I have the point (5, 4) and the slope ln(2). I can write the equation of the tangent line in point-slope form, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is the point.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ny - 4 = ln(2)(x - 5)\n\nWait a minute, looking at the options, this seems to match option D: y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 5)\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the point:\n\nx = t^2 + 1, t = 2 \u2192 x = 4 + 1 = 5\n\ny = 2^t, t = 2 \u2192 y = 4\n\nPoint is (5, 4)\n\nSlope:\n\ndy/dt = 2^t * ln(2) \u2192 at t=2, 4 * ln(2)\n\ndx/dt = 2t \u2192 at t=2, 4\n\ndy/dx = (4 * ln(2))/4 = ln(2)\n\nEquation:\n\ny - 4 = ln(2)(x - 5)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, option A is y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 2). That has the same slope but a different x-value.\n\nOption B has y \u2013 4 = 4 ln 2(x \u2013 2), which has a different slope and different x-value.\n\nOption C has y \u2013 4 = 4(x \u2013 5), which has a different slope but the correct x-value.\n\nOption D is y \u2013 4 = ln 2(x \u2013 5), which matches what I derived.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of mistake.\n\nIs there another value of t where y = 4? Let's see.\n\ny = 2^t = 4\n\nOnly t = 2 satisfies this, since 2^2 = 4.\n\nNo other real t satisfies 2^t = 4.\n\nAlso, double-checking the derivatives:\n\ndy/dt: yes, 2^t * ln(2)\n\ndx/dt: 2t\n\ndy/dx: (2^t * ln(2))/(2t)\n\nAt t=2, that's (4 * ln(2))/4 = ln(2)\n\nAnd the point is indeed (5,4)\n\nSo, the tangent line equation is y - 4 = ln(2)(x - 5)\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
