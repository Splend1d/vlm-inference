Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, I need to find the largest number that divides both 25 and 55.\n\nLet me list the divisors of each number. For 25, the divisors are 1, 5, and 25. For 55, the divisors are 1, 5, 11, and 55.\n\nNow, looking at the common divisors of both numbers, they share 1 and 5. So, the greatest common divisor is 5.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check this to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe there's a better way to find the GCD, like using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm states that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. So, let's apply that.\n\nFirst, 55 minus 25 is 30. Now, GCD of 25 and 30.\n\nNext, 30 minus 25 is 5. So, GCD of 25 and 5.\n\nNow, 25 divided by 5 is 5 with no remainder. So, the GCD is 5.\n\nOkay, that matches what I found earlier by listing the divisors.\n\nNow, looking back at the options: A. 5, B. 11, C. 50, D. 275.\n\nOption A is 5, which matches what I found. Option B is 11, but 11 doesn't divide 25 evenly. 25 divided by 11 is about 2.27, which is not an integer. So, 11 can't be the GCD.\n\nOption C is 50, but 50 doesn't divide 25 and 55 evenly. 25 divided by 50 is 0.5, which is not an integer, and 55 divided by 50 is 1.1, also not an integer.\n\nOption D is 275, which is even larger and clearly doesn't divide 25 or 55 evenly.\n\nSo, the only possible answer is A. 5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's make sure that 5 is indeed the greatest common divisor. Is there any number larger than 5 that divides both 25 and 55?\n\nWell, let's see. 10 divides 25? 25 divided by 10 is 2.5, not an integer. 15 divides 25? 25 divided by 15 is about 1.666, not an integer. 25 divides 25, but 25 doesn't divide 55 evenly, since 55 divided by 25 is 2.2.\n\nSo, no, there's no number larger than 5 that divides both 25 and 55 evenly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
