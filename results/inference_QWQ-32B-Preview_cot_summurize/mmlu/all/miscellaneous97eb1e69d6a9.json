So the correct answer is A. dragon.\n\nThe Chinese zodiac, also known as Sheng Xiao or the twelve animal signs, is a repeating cycle of 12 years, each year being represented by an animal and its reputed attributes. The 12 animals in order are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.\n\nTo determine the animal for a specific year, you can use the following method:\n\n1. **Identify the cycle**: The Chinese zodiac operates on a 12-year cycle.\n\n2. **Known reference**: For example, if you know that the year 2000 was the Year of the Dragon, you can count forward or backward from there.\n\n3. **Calculate the position**: Subtract the reference year from the target year and find the remainder when divided by 12.\n\nFor instance, to confirm that 2000 is the Year of the Dragon:\n\n- Let's take 2000 as our target year.\n\n- We know that 1984 was the Year of the Rat (the first animal in the cycle).\n\n- Calculate the difference: 2000 - 1984 = 16 years.\n\n- Divide 16 by 12: 16 \u00f7 12 = 1 with a remainder of 4.\n\n- Starting from Rat (0), count 4 positions: Rat (0), Ox (1), Tiger (2), Rabbit (3), Dragon (4).\n\n- Therefore, 2000 is the Year of the Dragon.\n\nAlternatively, you can use a list or a table that maps each year to its corresponding zodiac animal.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick reference for the Chinese zodiac animals and their sequence:\n\n1. Rat\n\n2. Ox\n\n3. Tiger\n\n4. Rabbit\n\n5. Dragon\n\n6. Snake\n\n7. Horse\n\n8. Goat\n\n9. Monkey\n\n10. Rooster\n\n11. Dog\n\n12. Pig\n\nEach animal has its own characteristics and is associated with specific traits and fortunes in Chinese culture.\n\n"
