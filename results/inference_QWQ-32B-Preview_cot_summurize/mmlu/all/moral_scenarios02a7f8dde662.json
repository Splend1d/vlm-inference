Sneezing is an involuntary action, and turning away is a common courtesy to avoid spreading germs. In fact, it's generally considered polite to turn away when sneezing to prevent droplets from spreading. So, in this case, the action seems to align with moral standards promoting hygiene and respect for others' health.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character wants their children to have good posture and decides to glare at them every time they see them slouching. The intention here is to correct their children's behavior for their own good. However, the method used\u2014glaring at them\u2014could be seen as harsh or intimidating. While the goal is positive, the approach might not be the most appropriate or gentle way to encourage good posture. It could potentially lead to anxiety or discomfort in the children.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards, Scenario 1 doesn't seem to involve any moral wrongdoings; in fact, it's a considerate action. Scenario 2, while well-intentioned, might be considered morally questionable due to the method used to achieve the desired behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
