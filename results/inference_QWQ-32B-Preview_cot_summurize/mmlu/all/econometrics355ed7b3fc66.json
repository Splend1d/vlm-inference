                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about antithetic variates in Monte Carlo simulations. I need to figure out which statements correctly describe how antithetic variates are used in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what antithetic variates are. I remember that they are a variance reduction technique used in Monte Carlo simulations. The idea is to reduce the variance of the simulation results, which in turn can lead to more accurate estimates with fewer simulations.\n\nLet's look at each statement one by one.\n\nStatement (i): \"Antithetic variates work by reducing the number of replications required to cover the whole probability space.\"\n\nHmm, this sounds plausible. If antithetic variates help reduce variance, then perhaps fewer simulations are needed to achieve the same level of accuracy. So, this might be correct.\n\nStatement (ii): \"Antithetic variates involve employing a similar variable to that used in the simulation, but whose properties are known analytically.\"\n\nThis one is a bit\u6a21\u7cca. Antithetic variates do involve using variables that are negatively correlated with the original variables, but I don't recall that they need to have known analytical properties. I think this might not be the most accurate description.\n\nStatement (iii): \"Antithetic variates involve using the negative of each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\"\n\nI think this is getting closer to the actual definition. Antithetic variates typically involve generating pairs of correlated random variables where one is in some sense the \"opposite\" of the other. For example, if you have a random draw U, you might use 1 - U as its antithetic variate. So, using the negative might not always be the case, depending on the distribution.\n\nStatement (iv): \"Antithetic variates involve taking one over each of the random draws and repeating the experiment using those values as the draws.\"\n\nThis sounds less familiar. Taking the reciprocal of the random draws doesn't sound like a standard method for creating antithetic variates. I think this is likely incorrect.\n\nBased on my initial thoughts, statement (i) seems plausible, statement (ii) is unclear, statement (iii) seems partially correct, and statement (iv) seems incorrect.\n\nLet me try to recall the precise definition of antithetic variates. The basic idea is to introduce negative correlation between pairs of simulations. For example, if you have a uniform random variable U, its antithetic variate would be 1 - U, which is negatively correlated with U.\n\nSo, in a Monte Carlo simulation, instead of just using U, you use both U and 1 - U to generate two simulations. The average of these two simulations can have lower variance than using two independent U's.\n\nGiven that, let's revisit the statements.\n\nStatement (i): Reducing the number of replications by covering the probability space more efficiently. This makes sense because with lower variance, you need fewer simulations to achieve the same precision.\n\nStatement (ii): Using a similar variable with known analytical properties. This doesn't directly align with the concept I recall. Antithetic variates don't require the properties to be known analytically; they rely on the correlation structure.\n\nStatement (iii): Using the negative of each random draw. This might not always be appropriate, depending on the distribution. For uniform variables, it's 1 - U, not -U. For normal variables, it might be -U. So, this statement is too vague.\n\nStatement (iv): Taking one over each random draw. This doesn't sound like a standard method for creating antithetic variates.\n\nGiven this, I think statement (i) is correct, and statement (iii) is partially correct but poorly worded. Statement (ii) is likely incorrect, and statement (iv) is incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iv) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nBased on my analysis, option B seems the closest, but I'm not entirely confident about statement (iii).\n\nMaybe I should look for a more precise definition or example.\n\nLet me consider a simple example. Suppose I'm simulating the price of a European call option using Monte Carlo. I generate random variables from a standard normal distribution to simulate stock prices.\n\nTo apply antithetic variates, for each random draw Z, I also use -Z. Since Z and -Z are perfectly negatively correlated, this can reduce the variance of my simulation estimator.\n\nIn this case, statement (iii) seems correct because I'm using the negative of the random draw.\n\nBut what about uniform random variables? For uniform variables, the antithetic variate of U is 1 - U, not -U. So, statement (iii) is not universally correct.\n\nTherefore, statement (iii) is incorrect in general.\n\nSo, only statement (i) is correct.\n\nBut that's not one of the options. All the options include multiple statements.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that antithetic variates pair each random draw with its antithetic counterpart, effectively doubling the number of simulations without increasing the computational cost, which leads to variance reduction.\n\nTherefore, statement (i) is correct in that antithetic variates can reduce the number of replications needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy.\n\nStatement (ii) is still unclear to me. It mentions employing a similar variable with known analytical properties. I'm not sure how that fits into the concept of antithetic variates.\n\nPerhaps it's referring to using a variable that has known properties to create the antithesis, but I'm not sure.\n\nStatement (iii) is incorrect because it's not always appropriate to use the negative of the random draw; it depends on the distribution.\n\nStatement (iv) is definitely incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is that only statement (i) is correct, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both (i) and (ii) are correct, but I'm not fully convinced about (ii).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (i) and (iii) are both considered correct, even though (iii) is not entirely accurate, but that seems like a stretch.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I might have to choose option B: (i) and (iii) only, acknowledging that (iii) is not entirely correct but closer than the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing my understanding of antithetic variates, and the correct answer is B, but with the understanding that (iii) is not perfectly accurate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is poorly worded, and I need to select the best available option.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option B: (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
