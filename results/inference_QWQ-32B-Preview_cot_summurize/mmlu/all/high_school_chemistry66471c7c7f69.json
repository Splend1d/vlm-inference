                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. We have the reaction:\n\nS(s) + O2(g) \u2192 SO2(g)\n\nAnd we have four statements:\n\nA. Either S(s) or O2(g) will be completely used up.\n\nB. Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.\n\nC. This reaction goes to completion.\n\nD. Adding O2 will change the equilibrium constant.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each statement is saying and whether it's true or false based on the reaction given.\n\nStarting with statement A: \"Either S(s) or O2(g) will be completely used up.\"\n\nThis suggests that in this reaction, one of the reactants will be fully consumed. But in reality, for a reaction to reach equilibrium, it doesn't necessarily mean that one reactant is completely used up. Equilibrium can be reached with amounts of both reactants and products present. So, I think this statement might be false.\n\nMoving on to statement B: \"Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.\"\n\nQ is the reaction quotient, which can be compared to the equilibrium constant K to determine the direction in which the reaction will proceed. However, the fact that there is one mole of gas on each side doesn't necessarily mean Q is close to 1.0. Q depends on the current concentrations or partial pressures of the reactants and products, not just on the stoichiometry. So, I think this statement is also false.\n\nStatement C: \"This reaction goes to completion.\"\n\nIf a reaction goes to completion, it means that virtually all of the reactants are converted into products. However, in reality, many reactions are reversible and reach a state of equilibrium where both reactants and products are present. Without knowing the value of the equilibrium constant K, I can't say for sure, but sulfur dioxide formation from sulfur and oxygen is a reversible reaction, especially under certain conditions. So, I suspect this statement is false.\n\nStatement D: \"Adding O2 will change the equilibrium constant.\"\n\nThe equilibrium constant K is a characteristic of the reaction at a given temperature and is not affected by changes in concentration or pressure. Adding more O2 might shift the position of equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier's principle, but it won't change the value of K. Therefore, I believe this statement is false.\n\nWait a minute, all these statements seem false based on my initial thoughts. Maybe I need to think deeper or consider specific aspects of the reaction.\n\nLet's consider the reaction again:\n\nS(s) + O2(g) \u2192 SO2(g)\n\nThis is a common reaction for the combustion of sulfur. However, in reality, sulfur dioxide can further react with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide, but let's focus on this particular step.\n\nStatement A: \"Either S(s) or O2(g) will be completely used up.\"\n\nIn practice, if you have a limited amount of one reactant, it could be completely used up, but that's not necessarily always the case. Equilibrium means that both reactants and products are present, so it's possible that neither is completely used up. Therefore, I still think this statement is false.\n\nStatement B: \"Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.\"\n\nThe reaction quotient Q is calculated based on the activities or concentrations of the reactants and products. In this case, since S is a solid, its activity is taken as 1, so Q would be [SO2]/[O2]. There's no inherent reason why this ratio must be close to 1.0 just because there's one mole of gas on each side. It depends on the actual concentrations or partial pressures. So, this statement seems false.\n\nStatement C: \"This reaction goes to completion.\"\n\nAgain, without knowing the value of K, it's hard to say definitively, but sulfur dioxide formation is known to be reversible, especially under certain conditions like high pressure or temperature. Therefore, it's unlikely that the reaction goes to completion. So, I think this statement is false.\n\nStatement D: \"Adding O2 will change the equilibrium constant.\"\n\nNo, adding more O2 would shift the equilibrium position, perhaps favoring the formation of more SO2, but the equilibrium constant K remains the same at a given temperature. So, this statement is false.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the question is about which statement is true, not false. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"Oh, I see. The question says 'which of the following statements is true?' and I was thinking about which ones are false. So, based on my earlier thoughts, all statements seem false, which would imply that none of them are true. But that seems unlikely, as probably at least one is true.\n\nMaybe I need to reevaluate.\n\nLet's consider statement A again: \"Either S(s) or O2(g) will be completely used up.\"\n\nIn a closed system at equilibrium, neither reactant is completely used up; both reactants and products coexist. However, in an open system, where one reactant is continuously supplied, it's possible for one to be completely used up. But based on the information given, it's a closed system, so I think this statement is false.\n\nStatement B: \"Q must be close to 1.0 since there is one mole of gas on each side of the equation.\"\n\nAs I thought earlier, Q depends on the current concentrations, not just the stoichiometry. So, this is false.\n\nStatement C: \"This reaction goes to completion.\"\n\nGiven that it's a reversible reaction, and equilibrium is established, it doesn't go to completion. So, false.\n\nStatement D: \"Adding O2 will change the equilibrium constant.\"\n\nNo, adding more O2 affects the position of equilibrium, not the equilibrium constant itself. So, false.\n\nHmm, if all statements are false, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's about the thermodynamics or kinetics of the reaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the context is that the reaction is carried out under certain conditions where one of these statements holds true.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"the reaction S(s) + O2(g) \u2192 SO2(g)\" and asks which statement is true regarding this reaction.\n\nPerhaps statement A could be true under certain conditions, like if one reactant is in excess and the reaction proceeds until one reactant is completely used up.\n\nBut in a closed system at equilibrium, both reactants are present, so it's not necessarily true that one is completely used up.\n\nMaybe statement C is true if the equilibrium constant K is very large, meaning the reaction proceeds almost to completion.\n\nBut without knowing the value of K, I can't say for sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in practice, under certain conditions, this reaction is considered to go to completion.\n\nBut in reality, it's known that sulfur dioxide can react further with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide, indicating that the reaction is reversible.\n\nGiven that, I think statement C is false.\n\nStatement D is definitely false because adding more O2 doesn't change the equilibrium constant; it only affects the equilibrium position.\n\nSo, if all statements seem false, maybe the question is testing whether I recognize that none of the statements are true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the reaction quotient Q in more detail.\n\nLet me consider the expression for Q.\n\nFor the reaction S(s) + O2(g) \u2192 SO2(g), the reaction quotient Q would be [SO2]/[O2], since the activity of a solid is taken as 1.\n\nThere's no inherent reason why this ratio must be close to 1.0; it depends on the concentrations or partial pressures at a given time.\n\nTherefore, statement B is false.\n\nSimilarly, statement A is false because equilibrium does not require one reactant to be completely used up.\n\nStatement C is false because the reaction is reversible and doesn't go to completion.\n\nStatement D is false because adding more O2 doesn't change the equilibrium constant.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements are true.\n\nBut perhaps I need to choose one that is closest to being true.\n\nIn that case, maybe statement B is the least false, but it's still not true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the reaction.\n\nWait, perhaps the reaction is written in such a way that it's assumed to go to completion, but in reality, it doesn't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe under certain conditions, one of these statements holds true.\n\nBut based on general principles of chemistry, I think all statements are false.\n\nTherefore, I would answer that none of the statements are true.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for which one statement is true, and all seem false, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to identify the least false statement.\n\nIn that case, perhaps statement B is the closest to being true, but even then, it's not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps statement C could be considered true if the equilibrium constant is very large, meaning the reaction proceeds nearly to completion.\n\nBut without knowing the value of K, I can't definitively say that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the course or textbook, this reaction is considered to go to completion, but in general chemistry principles, it's known to be reversible.\n\nGiven that, I'm still inclined to think that none of the statements are true, but since the question asks for one true statement, perhaps I need to choose the one that is most accurate.\n\nAmong the options, statement C seems to be the most plausible, assuming that the reaction proceeds nearly to completion.\n\nTherefore, I would choose statement C as the true statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
