Here are the arguments in predicate logic:\n\n1. Wn \u2228 Wm\n\n2. (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)]\n\n3. Ln \u2022 Dn / ~(\u2200x)~Wx\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\n\nB. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\n\nC. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\n\nD. Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the predicate logic means.\n\nLet's decode the symbols:\n\n- Wx: x is at work\n\n- Lx: x is a lawyer\n\n- Dx: x is out to dinner\n\n- n: Nancy\n\n- m: Marvin\n\nSo, the premises are:\n\n1. Wn \u2228 Wm: Either Nancy is at work or Marvin is at work.\n\n2. (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)]: For all x, if x is a lawyer, then if x is out to dinner, x is not at work.\n\n3. Ln \u2022 Dn: Nancy is a lawyer and Nancy is out to dinner.\n\nAnd the conclusion is: ~(\u2200x)~Wx: It is not the case that all x are not at work, which means at least one x is at work.\n\nNow, let's look at the options and see which one matches these translations.\n\nOption A:\n\n\"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\"\n\nThis matches:\n\n- Wn \u2228 Wm: Either Nancy or Marvin are at work.\n\n- (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)]: All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner.\n\n- Ln \u2022 Dn: Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner.\n\n- ~(\u2200x)~Wx: Not everything is not at work.\n\nOption B:\n\n\"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is not at work.\"\n\nThis has a different translation for the second premise:\n\n- (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (~Wx \u2283 Dx)]: All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work.\n\nBut in the original, it's (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)], which is \"if a lawyer is out to dinner, then they are not at work.\"\n\nSo, this is not matching the original premise.\n\nOption C:\n\n\"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are out to dinner if they are not at work. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\"\n\nAgain, the second premise is misinterpreted, same as in option B.\n\nOption D:\n\n\"Either Nancy or Marvin are at work. All lawyers are not at work if they are out to dinner. Nancy is a lawyer and out to dinner. So not everything is at work.\"\n\nThis matches the premises but has a different conclusion: \"not everything is at work,\" which is (\u2203x)~Wx, not ~(\u2200x)~Wx.\n\nBut ~(\u2200x)~Wx is equivalent to (\ufffd\u2203x)Wx, meaning at least one x is at work.\n\nSo, the conclusion in option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best match is option A.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check.\n\nIn option A, the conclusion is \"not everything is not at work,\" which is indeed ~(\u2200x)~Wx, equivalent to (\u2203x)Wx, meaning at least one person is at work.\n\nThat matches the conclusion in the original argument.\n\nOption D has \"not everything is at work,\" which is ~(\u2200x)Wx, meaning not everyone is at work, which is different.\n\nSo, option A is indeed the correct interpretation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if the argument is valid.\n\nGiven:\n\n1. Wn \u2228 Wm\n\n2. (\u2200x)[Lx \u2283 (Dx \u2283 ~Wx)]\n\n3. Ln \u2022 Dn\n\nConclusion: ~(\u2200x)~Wx\n\nFrom premise 3, Ln and Dn.\n\nFrom premise 2, since Ln, we have Ln \u2283 (Dn \u2283 ~Wn). Given Ln, then Dn \u2283 ~Wn.\n\nGiven Dn, then ~Wn.\n\nSo, ~Wn.\n\nFrom premise 1, Wn \u2228 Wm. Since ~Wn, therefore Wm.\n\nSo, Marvin is at work.\n\nTherefore, there exists someone at work, namely Marvin, so ~(\u2200x)~Wx is true.\n\nThus, the argument is valid, and option A correctly interprets the premises and conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
