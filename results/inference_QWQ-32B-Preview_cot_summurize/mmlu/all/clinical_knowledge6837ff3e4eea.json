                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on my anatomy, but I think I can figure this out. So, the knee joint is a hinge joint, right? That means it mainly allows for flexion and extension movements, like bending and straightening the leg.\n\nI remember that a normal knee should be able to extend to 0 degrees, which means the leg is straight. And for flexion, it should be able to bend to a certain degree. But I'm not sure exactly how many degrees that is.\n\nLet me think about this. When someone squats down, their knees bend quite a lot. I've heard that some people can achieve over 120 degrees of flexion when squatting deep. But I don't know if that's normal or if it's exceptional flexibility.\n\nMaybe I should consider the average range of motion for a healthy adult. I think most people can bend their knees to about 135 degrees without any issues. But I'm not sure if that's the maximum possible.\n\nWait, I recall that in physical therapy, they often talk about knee flexion being important for activities like walking, going up and down stairs, and squatting. I think 135 degrees is sufficient for most daily activities.\n\nBut let me see what the options are:\n\nA. 0-115 degrees.\n\nB. 0-135 degrees.\n\nC. 0-155 degrees.\n\nD. 0-175 degrees.\n\nOption A seems a bit limited. I think most people can bend their knees beyond 115 degrees. Option D seems too excessive; 175 degrees would almost bring the heel to touch the buttock, which might be possible for some, but I don't think it's the normal range.\n\nOption C, 155 degrees, sounds plausible. I think that's a common range for knee flexion. But then there's option B, 135 degrees, which I also recall being mentioned in some contexts.\n\nMaybe I should look up the average range of motion for the knee joint. Unfortunately, I don't have access to that right now, so I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nConsidering that 135 degrees seems to be sufficient for most activities and that many people can achieve that, I'll go with option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
