This is in contrast to traditional theories which propose that attitudes drive behavior. According to Bem, sometimes behavior can lead to the development of attitudes.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not correct in this context:\n\nA. This description is more aligned with Cognitive Dissonance Theory, proposed by Leon Festinger. This theory suggests that people experience discomfort when their behaviors are inconsistent with their attitudes, beliefs, or values, and they are motivated to reduce this dissonance.\n\nB. This seems to relate to Social Identity Theory, which suggests that individuals derive part of their self-esteem from their group memberships and strive to maintain a positive social identity.\n\nC. This is characteristic of the Self-Serving Bias, where people tend to attribute their successes to internal factors (dispositional) and their failures to external factors (situational).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, as it directly corresponds to Bem's Self-Perception Theory.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nBem, D.
