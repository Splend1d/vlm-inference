                    "text": "So I've got this question here about nitrous acid, HNO2, which has a pKa of 3.3. The solution has a pH of 4.2, and I need to figure out something about the concentrations of the conjugate acid-base pair in the solution. The options are:\n\nA. [HNO2] > [NO2-]\n\nB. [NO2-] > [HNO2]\n\nC. [H2NO2+] > [HNO2]\n\nD. [HNO2] > [H2NO2+]\n\nFirst, I need to recall what pKa is and how it relates to pH and the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base. pKa is the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant, Ka, which tells us how much an acid dissociates in solution. A lower pKa means a stronger acid.\n\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates pH, pKa, and the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base:\n\npH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])\n\nwhere [A-] is the concentration of the conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of the acid.\n\nIn this case, the acid is HNO2 and its conjugate base is NO2-.\n\nGiven that pKa is 3.3 and pH is 4.2, I can plug these values into the equation:\n\n4.2 = 3.3 + log([NO2-]/[HNO2])\n\nNow, I can solve for the ratio [NO2-]/[HNO2]:\n\nlog([NO2-]/[HNO2]) = 4.2 - 3.3 = 0.9\n\nTaking antilogarithm on both sides:\n\n[NO2-]/[HNO2] = 10^0.9 \u2248 7.94\n\nSo, [NO2-] is about 7.94 times greater than [HNO2].\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. [HNO2] > [NO2-] - This would be true if pH < pKa, but here pH > pKa, so this is probably not correct.\n\nB. [NO2-] > [HNO2] - This aligns with what I just calculated, so this seems likely.\n\nC. [H2NO2+] > [HNO2] - H2NO2+ is the conjugate acid of HNO2, but in this solution, HNO2 is the acid, and its conjugate base is NO2-. This option seems irrelevant to the given information.\n\nD. [HNO2] > [H2NO2+] - Similar to option C, H2NO2+ is not directly relevant here, and from my calculation, [HNO2] is less than [NO2-], so this might not be correct.\n\nWait a minute, I should consider whether H2NO2+ is even present in significant amounts. Nitrous acid, HNO2, can act as both an acid and a base, meaning it can donate a proton to form H2NO2+ or accept a proton to form NO2-. However, in this case, since we're given pH and pKa, and we're dealing with the dissociation of HNO2 to H+ and NO2-, I think the relevant species are HNO2 and NO2-.\n\nOption C is suggesting that [H2NO2+] > [HNO2], but I don't think H2NO2+ is a significant species in this solution because HNO2 is a weak acid, and its conjugate acid, H2NO2+, would be even weaker, meaning it wouldn't protonate water to a significant extent. Therefore, [H2NO2+] should be negligible compared to [HNO2].\n\nSimilarly, option D states that [HNO2] > [H2NO2+], which seems plausible because [H2NO2+] should be very small.\n\nBut based on my earlier calculation, [NO2-] is much larger than [HNO2], so option B seems correct.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider the charge balance in the solution. In an aqueous solution of a weak acid, the charges should balance, meaning:\n\n[H+] = [OH-] + [NO2-]\n\nAssuming the solution is dilute, [OH-] is small, but at pH 4.2, [H+] is 10^-4.2 M, which is about 6.31 x 10^-5 M. The concentration of NO2- is related to [HNO2] by the dissociation constant.\n\nBut I think I've overcomplicated it. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation already gives me the relationship between [NO2-] and [HNO2], and based on that, [NO2-] is greater than [HNO2], so option B seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Yes, pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). When pH > pKa, the log term is positive, meaning [A-]/[HA] >1, so [A-] > [HA]. That matches option B.\n\nSimilarly, when pH < pKa, [HA] > [A-], which would correspond to option A, but that's not the case here.\n\nOptions C and D involve H2NO2+, which I don't think is significant in this solution, so I can likely disregard them.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: [NO2-] > [HNO2].\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
