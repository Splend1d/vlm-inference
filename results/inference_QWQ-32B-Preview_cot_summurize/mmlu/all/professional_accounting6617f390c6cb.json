                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out which option a partner in a general partnership isn't usually entitled to. So, first, I need to recall what rights and responsibilities partners have in a general partnership.\n\nI know that in a general partnership, partners usually have equal rights and duties unless the partnership agreement says otherwise. So, they can participate in management, review accounting records, and they're also jointly and individually liable for the partnership's debts and liabilities.\n\nOption A says \"to participate in management.\" That sounds right; partners typically manage the business together.\n\nOption B is \"to review accounting records.\" Again, that makes sense; partners should have access to the financial records to know how the business is doing.\n\nOption C is \"to enter into a contract with a third party without the consent of the other partners.\" Hmm, this is tricky. In a general partnership, partners have the authority to bind the partnership in contracts, but I think some actions might require consent from other partners, especially if it's something outside the ordinary course of business.\n\nOption D is \"to be liable only for personal negligence.\" This one stands out. In a general partnership, partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. That means each partner can be held responsible for the entire debt, not just their share. Also, for negligence, if a partner acts negligently in the course of partnership business, the partnership can be held liable, and the partners might be personally liable as well.\n\nSo, thinking about it, being liable only for personal negligence seems like it's not a right that partners enjoy. In fact, it's quite the opposite; they can be liable for the actions of other partners.\n\nLet me double-check. In a general partnership, partners have unlimited liability, meaning they're personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the partnership, including the negligence of other partners. So, they're not just liable for their own negligence but for the negligence of their co-partners as well.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer. Partners aren't entitled to be liable only for their personal negligence.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Maybe there's a scenario where a partner is only liable for their own actions. But in general partnership law, that's not the case. Partners are jointly and severally liable.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
