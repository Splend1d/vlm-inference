A function that averages numeric values in a column or row.\n\nWell, averaging can give me a sense of the central tendency, but it doesn't necessarily help me identify outliers. Outliers can skew the average, making it less representative of the data set. So, while it's useful, I don't think it's the best tool for detecting errors.\n\nB. A function that counts the values in a column or row.\n\nCounting values tells me how many entries there are, but it doesn't help me identify if any of those entries are improbably high or low due to errors. So, this seems too basic for what I need.\n\nC. A function that rounds a numeric value.\n\nRounding is used to adjust the precision of numbers, but it doesn't help in identifying errors or outliers in the data set. So, this doesn't seem relevant to the problem.\n\nD. A function that sorts values in a column or row.\n\nSorting the data could be very helpful. If I sort the values from lowest to highest, any improbably high or low values should stand out at the extremes. This makes it easier to spot potential errors by visually inspecting the sorted list.\n\nConsidering these options, I think sorting the data is the most useful function for detecting improbably high or low values that may be due to data entry errors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
