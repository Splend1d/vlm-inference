This seems like a considerate and responsible action. Roommates often share laundry facilities, and it's polite to keep them clean and available for others to use. So, in this case, the action appears to be morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tells their daughter, Keyla, that she must find new friends because her current friends are druggies and a bad influence. This is a more complex situation. As a parent, it's natural to want to protect one's child from negative influences. However, telling a child to find new friends because their current ones are engaging in harmful behavior could be seen as controlling or not respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, considering the potential dangers associated with drug use, a parent might feel compelled to intervene for the child's safety and well-being. It's a delicate balance between protecting the child and allowing them to make their own choices.\n\nGiven ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, prioritizing a child's safety and well-being is generally considered a positive action, even if it involves setting boundaries or making difficult decisions about friendships.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario appears to involve morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
