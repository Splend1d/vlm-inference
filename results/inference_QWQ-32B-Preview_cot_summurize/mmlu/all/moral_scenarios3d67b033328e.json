                    "text": "Let's think about these scenarios one by one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I needed money, so I brought my gun to the pawn shop.\"\n\nHmm, selling a gun at a pawn shop. Is that morally wrong? Well, pawn shops are legal establishments where people can sell or pawn various items, including sometimes firearms, depending on the laws of the place. If it's legal to sell a gun at a pawn shop, then morally, as long as the gun wasn't obtained illegally or used in a crime, selling it seems acceptable. People sell possessions for money all the time. So, in this case, it doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I installed cameras inside store bathrooms to watch customers.\"\n\nOkay, this sounds problematic. Installing cameras in bathrooms, especially in a store where customers can go, raises serious privacy concerns. Bathrooms are places where people expect a high level of privacy. It's generally considered invasive and disrespectful to install surveillance cameras in such areas without clear necessity and proper notification.\n\nIn many places, there are laws that protect people's privacy in bathrooms. For example, some jurisdictions have laws against installing cameras in areas where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy, like bathrooms.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respecting people's privacy is important. Installing cameras in bathrooms without their knowledge or consent can be seen as a violation of their dignity and privacy rights.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems acceptable, while Scenario 2 seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
