                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"If a deviant act is 'normalized', it is:\n\nA. recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior\n\nB. seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character\n\nC. the first step in establishing a deviant career\n\nD. attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical makeup\"\n\nHmm, I need to think about what \"normalizing\" a deviant act means. Normalizing, I guess, means making something acceptable or usual within a society or a group. So, if a deviant act is normalized, it probably means that it's no longer considered deviant anymore.\n\nOption A says it's recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior. But if it's normalized, that means it's accepted, so it wouldn't be seen as breaking a norm anymore. That seems contradictory.\n\nOption B says it's seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character. Hmm, that sounds like the act is still considered deviant, just a one-time thing. But normalization suggests that it's accepted as normal, not just a temporary deviation.\n\nOption C says it's the first step in establishing a deviant career. That seems like it's about someone starting to engage in deviant behavior repeatedly, maybe becoming a professional deviant or something. But normalization is about making the act acceptable, not about the person's career in deviance.\n\nOption D attributes the act to the person's genetic or anatomical makeup. That seems like it's about explaining why someone does a deviant act, perhaps by blaming it on their biology. But normalization is about accepting the act, not explaining its causes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to look back at some sociology concepts here. In sociology, deviance is behavior that violates social norms, and normalization would involve making that behavior acceptable, so it's no longer seen as deviant.\n\nSo, if an act is normalized, it means that society or a group has accepted it as normal, meaning it no longer breaks any norms. Therefore, option A can't be right because if it's normalized, it's not seen as breaking a norm anymore.\n\nOption B seems to suggest that the act is still considered deviant, just an exception to the person's normal behavior. But normalization suggests that the act itself is now considered normal, not just an aberration.\n\nOption C seems off track; it's about the individual's path to deviance, not about the act being normalized.\n\nOption D is about attributing the act to personal biology, which doesn't relate to normalization.\n\nMaybe none of these options perfectly capture what normalization means in this context. Perhaps the question is expecting a different perspective.\n\nLet me consider the term \"normalization\" more carefully. In some contexts, normalization can mean that a behavior is made standard or usual, perhaps through repeated acceptance or approval.\n\nIf a deviant act is normalized, it might be that the act is now so common or accepted that it's no longer considered deviant. So, in a way, it's like the norm has shifted to include what was previously deviant behavior.\n\nGiven that, option A doesn't make sense because if it's normalized, it's not seen as breaking a norm.\n\nOption B seems to suggest that the act is still viewed as deviant, just a one-time thing, which contradicts normalization.\n\nOption C seems to be about the individual's trajectory into deviance, not about the act being normalized.\n\nOption D is about attributing the act to biological factors, which isn't directly related to normalization.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to trick me into choosing A, but that doesn't align with the concept of normalization.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is poorly worded, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about examples. For instance, consider same-sex relationships. In many societies, they were once considered deviant, but now they are normalized and accepted as normal variations of human sexuality.\n\nIn this case, same-sex relationships are no longer seen as breaking an important norm; in fact, they are recognized as part of the norm.\n\nSo, if I apply this example to the options:\n\nA. Recognized as breaking an important norm of behavior \u2013 no, because they are now normalized and accepted.\n\nB. Seen as a temporary aberration \u2013 no, because it's accepted as a regular part of behavior.\n\nC. The first step in establishing a deviant career \u2013 that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nD. Attributed to the person's genetic or anatomical makeup \u2013 while some might believe that, it's not directly related to normalization.\n\nTherefore, none of these options seem to correctly describe what happens when a deviant act is normalized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing my understanding of how normalization affects perception of deviance.\n\nIf a deviant act is normalized, it means that society or a group has adjusted its norms to include the act as acceptable. Therefore, the act is no longer considered deviant.\n\nGiven that, option A is the opposite of normalization, as it suggests the act is still seen as deviant.\n\nOption B also suggests that the act is still seen as deviant, just a temporary lapse.\n\nOption C seems unrelated to normalization.\n\nOption D is about attributing the act to biological factors, which isn't directly related to normalization.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to say that normalizing a deviant act involves seeing it as not deviant anymore, which isn't directly represented in any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is poorly constructed, or I'm missing something fundamental.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"normalizing\" in this context means something different than what I thought.\n\nLet me check the term \"normalization\" in sociology. Normalization can refer to the process of making something standard or usual, or it can refer to the process of accepting deviations as normal variations.\n\nIn disability studies, for example, normalization refers to adapting the environment to accommodate disabilities, making them normal.\n\nIn surveillance studies, normalization refers to the acceptance of surveillance as a normal part of life.\n\nSo, in general, normalization involves accepting something as normal, which contrasts with viewing it as deviant.\n\nGiven that, in the context of deviant acts, normalization would involve accepting the act as normal,\u4e0d\u518d\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879A\u8bf4\u201crecognized as breaking an important norm of behavior\u201d\u4e0e
