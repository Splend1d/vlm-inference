                    "text": "Fertilization in humans typically occurs in the fallopian tube. So, the correct answer is B. Fallopian tube.\n\nTo provide more detail, let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Ovulation**: This is when the ovary releases an egg (ovum). This usually happens midway through the menstrual cycle.\n\n2. **Journey to the Fallopian Tube**: After being released, the egg is caught by the fimbriae, which are finger-like projections at the end of the fallopian tube closest to the ovary. The egg then begins its journey through the fallopian tube towards the uterus.\n\n3. **Fertilization**: If sperm are present in the fallopian tube, fertilization can occur. Sperm swim up from the vagina through the cervix and into the uterus, and then into the fallopian tubes. It's in the fallopian tube, specifically in the ampulla section, where the sperm and egg usually meet and fertilization takes place.\n\n4. **Implantation**: After fertilization, the zygote (the fertilized egg) continues to move down the fallopian tube and into the uterus, where it implants into the uterine lining.\n\nSo, to summarize, fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube, not in the ovary, uterus, or placenta.\n\n**Why not the other options?**\n\n- **Ovary (Option A)**: This is where the egg is produced and released, but fertilization doesn't occur here.\n\n- **Uterus (Option C)**: This is where the fertilized egg implants and develops, but fertilization itself happens in the fallopian tube.\n\n- **Placenta (Option D)**: The placenta is an organ that develops during pregnancy and is crucial for nourishing the fetus, but it's not involved in fertilization.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things!
