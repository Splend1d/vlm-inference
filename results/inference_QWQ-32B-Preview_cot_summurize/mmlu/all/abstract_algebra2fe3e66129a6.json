We need to determine which property this relation has from the given options: not anti-symmetric, transitive, reflexive, or symmetric.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these properties means for a relation.\n\n1. **Reflexive**: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. That is, for all a in A, (a, a) \u2208 ~.\n\n2. **Symmetric**: A relation is symmetric if whenever (a, b) \u2208 ~, then (b, a) \u2208 ~.\n\n3. **Anti-symmetric**: A relation is anti-symmetric if whenever (a, b) \u2208 ~ and (b, a) \u2208 ~, then a = b.\n\n4. **Transitive**: A relation is transitive if whenever (a, b) \u2208 ~ and (b, c) \u2208 ~, then (a, c) \u2208 ~.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given relation ~ = {(1,2), (1,3), (4,2)} with respect to these properties.\n\n**Reflexive**: Check if (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4) are in ~.\n\nLooking at ~, we see that none of these pairs are present. Therefore, ~ is not reflexive.\n\n**Symmetric**: Check if for every (a, b) in ~, (b, a) is also in ~.\n\n- (1,2) is in ~, but (2,1) is not in ~.\n\n- (1,3) is in ~, but (3,1) is not in ~.\n\n- (4,2) is in ~, but (2,4) is not in ~.\n\nSince none of the reverse pairs are present, ~ is not symmetric.\n\n**Anti-symmetric**: Check if whenever (a, b) and (b, a) are in ~, then a = b.\n\nIn ~, there are no pairs (a, b) and (b, a) both present for any a and b. For example:\n\n- (1,2) is in ~, but (2,1) is not.\n\n- (1,3) is in ~, but (3,1) is not.\n\n- (4,2) is in ~, but (2,4) is not.\n\nSince there are no cases where both (a, b) and (b, a) are in ~ with a \u2260 b, the condition for anti-symmetry is vacuously true. Therefore, ~ is anti-symmetric.\n\nBut the option is \"not anti-symmetric,\" which would be false based on this analysis.\n\n**Transitive**: Check if whenever (a, b) and (b, c) are in ~, then (a, c) is in ~.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- From (1,2) and (2, ...), but there is no (2, x) in ~.\n\n- From (1,3) and (3, ...), but there is no (3, x) in ~.\n\n- From (4,2) and (2, ...), but there is no (2, x) in ~.\n\nSince there are no cases where (a, b) and (b, c) are both in ~ for some b and c, the condition for transitivity is vacuously true. Therefore, ~ is transitive.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. not anti-symmetric\n\nB. transitive\n\nC. reflexive\n\nD. symmetric\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n- ~ is not reflexive.\n\n- ~ is not symmetric.\n\n- ~ is anti-symmetric.\n\n- ~ is transitive.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. transitive.\n\nHowever, let's double-check if there might be any misunderstanding.\n\nIs there any possibility that ~ is not anti-symmetric?\n\nAnti-symmetry requires that if both (a, b) and (b, a) are in ~, then a = b.\n\nSince neither (a, b) and (b, a) are both in ~ for any a \u2260 b, the relation satisfies anti-symmetry.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nIs ~ transitive?\n\nAs there are no cases where (a, b) and (b, c) are both in ~, the transitivity condition holds vacuously.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nIs ~ reflexive?\n\nNo, because none of the pairs (a, a) are in ~.\n\nTherefore, option C is incorrect.\n\nIs ~ symmetric?\n\nNo, because for each (a, b) in ~, (b, a) is not in ~.\n\nTherefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. transitive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
