                    "text": "Jus cogens is a term in international law that refers to peremptory norms from which no derogations are permitted, and which cannot be altered even with the consent of states. These norms are considered fundamental principles that are binding on all states, regardless of whether they have expressly consented to them or not. They represent the most basic and fundamental principles of international law, such as the prohibition of aggression, genocide, slavery, and torture.\n\nOption A is correct because jus cogens norms are indeed peremptory norms from which no derogations are allowed, and they cannot be altered even with the consent of states. These norms are considered to be of such importance that they override other international obligations and treaties.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while multilateral treaties with wide participation may contain jus cogens norms, not all such treaties consist solely of jus cogens norms. Many multilateral treaties deal with various aspects of international law that are not necessarily peremptory norms.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the decisions of the UN Security Council, although they carry significant authority, are not synonymous with jus cogens. The Security Council makes decisions under Chapter VII of the UN Charter to maintain international peace and security, but these decisions are not equivalent to peremptory norms of international law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the International Court of Justice (ICJ) may base its decisions on jus cogens norms, not all the rules of international law on which the ICJ founds its decisions are jus cogens. The ICJ applies a wide range of international legal principles, including customary international law, treaties, and general principles of law, not all of which are peremptory norms.\n\nIn summary, jus cogens refers specifically to the most fundamental and non-derogable norms of international law that are binding on all states, regardless of their consent. These norms form the foundation of the international legal order and cannot be set aside or modified except by a new norm of general international law having the same character."
