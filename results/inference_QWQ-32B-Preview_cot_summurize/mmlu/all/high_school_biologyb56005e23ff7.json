                    "text": "Let's see which one of these options describes a symbiotic relationship. I know that symbiosis involves a close and long-term interaction between different biological species. There are different types of symbiosis: mutualism, where both species benefit; commensalism, where one species benefits and the other is unaffected; and parasitism, where one species benefits at the expense of the other.\n\nOption A: A tapeworm feeds off its host's nutrients, causing the host to lose large amounts of weight. This sounds like parasitism because the tapeworm is benefiting at the host's expense.\n\nOption B: Certain plants grow on trees to gain access to sunlight, not affecting the tree. This seems like commensalism because the plants are benefiting from the tree without affecting it positively or negatively.\n\nOption C: Remora fish eat parasites off sharks; the sharks stay free of parasites, and the remora fish are protected from predators. This looks like mutualism because both the shark and the remora fish are benefiting from the relationship.\n\nOption D: Meerkats sound alarm calls to warn other meerkats of predators. This is more about social behavior within the same species, which is called intraspecific interaction, not symbiosis, which involves different species.\n\nSo, all of these options except D involve interactions between different species, but only C shows a relationship where both species benefit. Therefore, the answer should be C, as it describes a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
