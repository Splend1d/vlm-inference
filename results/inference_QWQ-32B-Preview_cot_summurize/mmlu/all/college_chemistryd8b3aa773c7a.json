                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how radioactive decay works. Radioactive isotopes decay over time, and the rate of decay is described by their half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive atoms to decay.\n\nIn this case, the isotope has a half-life of 6.0 hours. That means every 6 hours, the activity of the isotope is reduced by half.\n\nWe are given that the initial activity is 150 mCi, and we need to find out how much activity remains after 24 hours.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many half-lives are there in 24 hours.\n\nNumber of half-lives (n) = total time / half-life\n\nn = 24 hours / 6 hours = 4\n\nSo, there are 4 half-lives in 24 hours.\n\nNow, the activity after n half-lives can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFinal activity (A) = Initial activity (A\u2080) * (1/2)^n\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nA = 150 mCi * (1/2)^4\n\nFirst, calculate (1/2)^4:\n\n(1/2)^4 = 1/16\n\nNow, multiply that by the initial activity:\n\nA = 150 mCi * (1/16) = 150 / 16 = 9.375 mCi\n\nRounding to one decimal place, that's approximately 9.4 mCi.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9.4 mCi.\n\nLet's double-check the calculation to make sure.\n\nStarting with 150 mCi:\n\nAfter 1 half-life (6 hours): 150 / 2 = 75 mCi\n\nAfter 2 half-lives (12 hours): 75 / 2 = 37.5 mCi\n\nAfter 3 half-lives (18 hours): 37.5 / 2 = 18.75 mCi\n\nAfter 4 half-lives (24 hours): 18.75 / 2 = 9.375 mCi\n\nYes, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the activity remaining after 24 hours is approximately 9.4 mCi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
