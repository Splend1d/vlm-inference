Let's look at each option to understand which method of abortion is most costly and carries the greatest risk of complications.\n\nOption A: Hysterotomy\n\nHysterotomy is a surgical procedure similar to a cesarean section, where an incision is made in the uterus to remove the fetus. This method is typically used in the second trimester or later. Given its surgical nature, it's likely to be more expensive and carry higher risks compared to other methods.\n\nOption B: Saline-Induced Abortion\n\nIn saline-induced abortion, a saline solution is injected into the amniotic sac to induce labor and expel the fetus. This method is also used in the second trimester. While it avoids surgery, it can be painful and has potential risks such as infection and damage to the cervix.\n\nOption C: Prostaglandin Abortion\n\nProstaglandin abortion involves the use of prostaglandin medications to induce labor and expel the fetus. This method is often used in the second trimester and can be effective, but it may also cause strong contractions and cramping.\n\nOption D: Dilation and Curettage (D&C)\n\nDilation and curettage is a surgical procedure where the cervix is dilated, and the uterus is scraped to remove the fetal tissue. It's commonly used in the first trimester and is generally considered safer and less costly than methods used in later trimesters.\n\nComparing these options, hysterotomy (Option A) seems to be the most invasive and surgical method, which would likely make it the most costly and carry the greatest risk of complications. Saline-induced abortion (Option B) and prostaglandin abortion (Option C) are less invasive but still carry risks, particularly in the second trimester. Dilation and curettage (Option D) is generally safer and less costly, especially in the first trimester.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. hysterotomy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
