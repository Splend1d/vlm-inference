Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the \u0153cumenical position, the \u0153cumenical traditions, of Rome&\u2026.\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nEdward A.

                    "text": "I'm looking at this passage from Edward A. Freeman, who was a British historian and politician in the late 19th century. He's talking about the unification of Italy, which happened around his time. So, the question is asking about which major European political movement of the 19th century these feelings relate to.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Romanticism - That's more about art and literature, emphasizing emotion and individualism. Not really about political movements.\n\nB. Socialism - That's about economic and social equality, often advocating for collective ownership of production.\n\nC. Conservatism - That's about preserving traditional institutions and resisting change.\n\nD. Nationalism - That's about people identifying with a nation based on shared culture, language, history, and aiming for self-determination.\n\nFrom the passage, Freeman is talking about the unification of Italy, which is a nationalist movement. Nationalism in the 19th century was a big deal in Europe, with many countries undergoing unification or seeking independence based on national identity.\n\nFreeman seems to have mixed feelings about Italian unification. He says, \"we all rejoiced in its union,\" but then expresses some doubts about whether the union was too speedy and too thorough. He mentions that it's sad to see Sicily's independence erased and that Rome, which had a special status, is now just the capital of Italy.\n\nSo, his bittersweet feelings are about the results of nationalism, specifically the unification of Italy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Nationalism.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the other options again.\n\nRomanticism, as I said, is more about art and culture, not directly about political movements, so it's unlikely.\n\nSocialism was rising in the 19th century, but it's not directly related to the unification of nations based on national identity.\n\nConservatism would probably be against such unifications if they involve changing existing political structures and potentially overthrowing traditional authorities.\n\nBut Freeman seems to accept the unification while having some reservations about certain aspects of it.\n\nSo, overall, the political movement he's referring to is nationalism, which aimed to create nation-states based on shared national identities.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. Nationalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
