Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nGiven the perspective of the passage above, William Hickling Prescott believed which of the following about the conquest of the Aztec Empire?\n\nA.

                    "text": "I'm looking at this passage from William Hickling Prescott's \"History of the Conquest of Mexico\" from 1843. It's all about Hernando Cortes and his conquest of Mexico in the 16th century. Prescott seems to have a pretty high opinion of Cortes. Let's see what he's saying.\n\nFirst off, Prescott calls Cortes a \"helpful assistant\" filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise. He says that Cortes wasn't deterred by dangers and difficulties; instead, they seemed to have a charm for him. That suggests that Prescott sees Cortes as a daring and adventurous leader, someone who embraced challenges rather than shying away from them.\n\nPrescott mentions that Cortes conceived the idea of conquering Mexico right from the moment he landed there. Even when he saw the strength of the Aztec civilization, he didn't back down. This shows that Cortes was determined and had a lot of confidence in his abilities.\n\nPrescott then addresses a possible criticism of Cortes: that he was just a lucky adventurer, not a true general. But Prescott defends Cortes, saying that he was indeed a great general because he achieved great things with resources that his own genius created. That means Prescott thinks Cortes was resourceful and able to make the most out of what he had.\n\nThe passage goes on to describe the diverse and somewhat chaotic group that Cortes led. It was a mix of people from different backgrounds: Spanish adventurers from Cuba and the islands who were after gold, hidalgos (Spanish nobles) who came to win glory, and various native tribes who were traditional enemies. Despite all these differences, Cortes managed to unite them under his command, make them work together, and move towards a common goal.\n\nPrescott seems impressed by Cortes's ability to bring together such a diverse and potentially conflicting group and make them act in harmony, almost as if they shared the same spirit and principles of action.\n\nNow, the question is asking about Prescott's perspective on the conquest of the Aztec Empire based on this passage. The options are:\n\nA. The actions of Hernando Cortes were irrational.\n\nB. The conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity.\n\nC. Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\n\nD. The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\nLet's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The actions of Hernando Cortes were irrational.\n\nFrom the passage, Prescott portrays Cortes as a rational and strategic leader. He describes Cortes as a great general who achieved remarkable feats through his own genius and resourcefulness. So, Prescott doesn't seem to think that Cortes's actions were irrational. In fact, he seems to admire Cortes's strategic abilities.\n\nOption B: The conquest of Mexico was a racist atrocity.\n\nThe passage doesn't mention anything about racism or atrocities committed during the conquest. Prescott focuses on Cortes's leadership and the way he united diverse groups to achieve his goals. There's no indication here that Prescott viewed the conquest as a racist atrocity.\n\nOption C: Cortes was chiefly motivated by a desire for wealth.\n\nWhile the passage mentions that some of the Spanish adventurers were craving for gold, it doesn't specifically state that Cortes was primarily motivated by wealth. Prescott seems to emphasize Cortes's spirit of adventure and his strategic genius more than his desire for wealth.\n\nOption D: The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\nThis option is interesting. Prescott describes the Aztec Empire as a strong and civilized society, but he also seems to suggest that Spain had a superior civilization that was destined to conquer and replace the Aztec Empire. However, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the Aztec Empire had to give way to Spain's superior civilization. It's more focused on Cortes's abilities as a leader.\n\nBut let's look deeper. Prescott mentions that Cortes saw the strength of the Aztec civilization but still pursued the conquest, which might imply that Prescott believes that the Spanish civilization was superior and therefore destined to prevail. However, this is not directly stated.\n\nGiven the options, I think the best answer is D: The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain. This is because Prescott seems to accept the conquest as a natural outcome of Spain's superiority, although he doesn't explicitly state it.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure. The passage is more about Cortes's leadership and his ability to unite diverse groups than about the overall righteousness or inevitability of the conquest. Maybe I need to consider the historical context.\n\nPrescott wrote this in the 19th century, during a time when European imperialism was at its height, and the idea of the superiority of Western civilization was widely accepted. So, it's possible that Prescott held the view that the conquest was inevitable because of Spain's superior civilization, even if he doesn't spell it out in this particular passage.\n\nOption A seems clearly incorrect because Prescott portrays Cortes as a rational and strategic leader. Option B is not supported by the passage, as there's no mention of racism or atrocities. Option C might be partially true, but the passage doesn't emphasize Cortes's motivation for wealth.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option D: The Aztec Empire had to give way to the superior civilization of Spain.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
