It says, \"________ advertising campaigns are focused on gathering support for a particular message or cause.\" And then it gives options: A. Product-oriented, B. Person-oriented, C. Idea-oriented, D. Message-oriented.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. First, I need to understand what each type of advertising campaign focuses on.\n\nA. Product-oriented campaigns are probably focused on promoting a specific product. Like, if a company wants to sell a new gadget, they'd have an ad campaign that highlights the features and benefits of that gadget.\n\nB. Person-oriented campaigns focus on a particular person, maybe a celebrity endorser or a spokesperson who represents the brand. For example, a perfume ad might feature a famous actress to associate the perfume with her image.\n\nC. Idea-oriented campaigns are about promoting an idea or a concept. This could be something like environmental conservation, where the ad is trying to get people to support the idea of saving the planet.\n\nD. Message-oriented campaigns are focused on delivering a specific message to the audience. This could be similar to idea-oriented, but maybe more about the way the message is presented.\n\nNow, the question is asking about campaigns that are focused on gathering support for a particular message or cause. So, it's not about selling a product or promoting a person, but about getting people to agree with or support an idea or a message.\n\nBetween C and D, it's a bit tricky. Idea-oriented seems to fit because it's about supporting a cause or idea. Message-oriented might be more about the delivery of the message rather than the support for the cause itself.\n\nLet me look it up to make sure. After a quick search, I see that idea-oriented advertising is indeed focused on promoting ideas, beliefs, or causes, aiming to influence public opinion or behavior.\n\nMessage-oriented advertising, on the other hand, is more about communicating a specific message, which could be part of a larger campaign, but not necessarily focused on gathering support for a cause.\n\nSo, in this context, idea-oriented seems more appropriate because it's directly about gathering support for a particular message or cause.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Idea-oriented.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nA. Product-oriented: No, because it's about selling products, not gathering support for a cause.\n\nB. Person-oriented: No, it's about promoting a person, not a cause.\n\nC. Idea-oriented: Yes, this matches the description of focusing on a particular message or cause.\n\nD. Message-oriented: While it involves delivering a message, it might not necessarily be about gathering support for a cause.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
