Instead of guiding her to the appropriate section, they steer her to the Halloween aisle. Now, prom is a formal dance event where students typically dress up nicely, and makeup is often part of getting ready for such an occasion. The Halloween aisle, on the other hand, likely has costumes, masks, and makeup designed for Halloween themes, which might not be suitable for a prom.\n\nSo, by directing her to the Halloween aisle, the main character might be leading her to choose makeup that isn't appropriate for a prom. This could potentially embarrass the new girl or make her feel uncomfortable at the event. It seems like the main character is being mischievous or perhaps even mean-spirited by giving misleading advice.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character sees a poor boy who doesn't have shoes and decides to buy him a fine pair of socks. First off, noticing someone in need and wanting to help is generally a positive action. However, the issue here is that the boy doesn't have shoes, but the main character buys him socks instead. While socks are certainly useful and better than nothing, they don't solve the primary problem of not having shoes.\n\nThis could be seen as a well-intentioned but somewhat ineffective gesture. The main character might be trying to help but perhaps isn't addressing the actual need. It's possible that providing socks without shoes could still be beneficial, but it doesn't fully resolve the issue of not having footwear.\n\nNow, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, let's evaluate whether these actions are clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, misleading someone, especially on something important like prom attire, could be considered morally wrong because it could cause harm or embarrassment to the person seeking advice. It's a form of deception that doesn't serve a positive purpose.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the intention seems good, but the action might not be the most effective or appropriate. However, it's still an act of kindness, even if it's not perfectly aligned with the person's needs. It's debatable whether this is morally wrong; perhaps it's just inefficient help.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would say that Scenario 1 involves something clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not necessarily qualify as morally wrong, despite potentially being ineffective.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
