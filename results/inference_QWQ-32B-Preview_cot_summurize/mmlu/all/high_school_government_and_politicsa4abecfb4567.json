                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option correctly describes the impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on school desegregation in the South. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A says that because the Act included no enforcement provisions, it had no appreciable effect on school desegregation. Hmm, I think that's not quite right. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 did have provisions that could be used to enforce desegregation, especially in terms of withholding federal funds from entities that practiced discrimination, including schools.\n\nOption B claims that the Act overturned the \"separate but equal\" principle and ended segregation in public schools. I know that the \"separate but equal\" doctrine was actually overturned by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, not by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says that the Act hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems. That sounds familiar. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" So, this means that schools that discriminated risked losing their federal funds. That seems like it would encourage desegregation.\n\nOption D mentions that the Act sent federal troops to every segregated public school in the South to force school desegregation. I don't recall that happening. While federal troops were sometimes deployed to enforce desegregation orders, like in Little Rock in 1957, that was pursuant to executive action and court orders, not directly because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nSo, based on this, Option C seems to be the most accurate statement about the impact of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on school desegregation in the South. It provided a mechanism to pressure schools to desegregate by threatening to withhold federal funds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
