It has both exocrine and endocrine functions. The exocrine portion secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine to help break down food, while the endocrine portion consists of clusters of cells called islets of Langerhans, which produce hormones such as insulin and glucagon that regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. It is produced and secreted by the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. When blood sugar levels rise, such as after a meal, the pancreas releases insulin to facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly in the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue.\n\nIn contrast, the other options listed are not primarily associated with insulin secretion:\n\nA. Adrenal gland: These glands sit atop the kidneys and secrete hormones like adrenaline and cortisol in response to stress, but they do not secrete insulin.\n\nB. Gallbladder: This organ stores and concentrates bile produced by the liver, which is then released into the small intestine to help digest fats. It does not secrete insulin.\n\nC. Liver: Although the liver plays a significant role in metabolism and glucose regulation, it does not secrete insulin. Instead, it responds to insulin by taking up glucose and storing it as glycogen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Pancreas."
