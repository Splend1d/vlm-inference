                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Substances whose Lewis structures must be drawn with an unpaired electron are called...\" and then there are options: A. ionic compounds, B. free radicals, C. resonance structures, D. polar molecules. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Lewis structure is. Lewis structures are diagrams that show the bonding between atoms of a molecule and the lone pairs of electrons that may exist in the molecule. They help us visualize the electron distribution in a molecule.\n\nNow, the question is about substances that have an unpaired electron in their Lewis structure. An unpaired electron means that there's an electron that doesn't have a partner in the atom or molecule.\n\nLet me think about option A: ionic compounds. Ionic compounds are substances made up of ions, where one atom donates an electron to another, forming positive and negative ions that attract each other. In Lewis structures, ionic compounds are often represented by showing the transfer of electrons with dots and crosses. But do they necessarily have unpaired electrons? I don't think so. Ionic compounds are generally stable, with complete octets or duets, so unpaired electrons are not a requirement for them. So, maybe A is not the correct answer.\n\nOption B: free radicals. I've heard about free radicals in chemistry and biology. Free radicals are molecules that have at least one unpaired electron. They are highly reactive because that unpaired electron wants to pair up with another electron. So, in Lewis structures, free radicals would indeed have an unpaired electron represented by a single dot. This seems plausible.\n\nOption C: resonance structures. Resonance structures are different Lewis structures that represent the same molecule, differing only in the arrangement of electrons. They are used to describe molecules where the actual structure is a hybrid of the resonance forms. Resonance involves the delocalization of electrons, but it doesn't necessarily mean there's an unpaired electron. In fact, resonance structures are used for molecules with paired electrons that can be delocalized. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption D: polar molecules. Polar molecules are molecules that have a separation of charge, meaning they have partial positive and partial negative charges due to differences in electronegativity between atoms. Polar molecules can have dipole moments, but they don't necessarily have unpaired electrons. Molecules can be polar and still have all electrons paired. So, this doesn't seem to fit the description.\n\nComparing all the options, option B, free radicals, seems to be the most appropriate answer because they are defined as molecules with at least one unpaired electron, which would require that in their Lewis structures, there is an unpaired electron represented.\n\nTo confirm, let me think of an example. A common example of a free radical is the hydroxyl radical, OH\u00b7. In its Lewis structure, oxygen has seven electrons: two lone pairs and one unpaired electron, and hydrogen has one electron paired with the unpaired electron from oxygen. So, there is indeed an unpaired electron in the Lewis structure of OH\u00b7.\n\nOn the other hand, ionic compounds like NaCl have complete octets for chlorine and duet for sodium, with no unpaired electrons. Resonance structures, like those of benzene, show delocalized electrons but all electrons are paired. Polar molecules like water have partial charges due to electronegativity differences but all electrons are paired.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. free radicals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
