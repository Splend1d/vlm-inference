                    "text": "So I have this question here: If we take sin x and change it to 3 sin 2x, what happens to the domain and range of the function? And there are options A through D to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what domain and range mean in the context of a function. The domain is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined, and the range is the set of all possible output values (y-values) that the function can produce.\n\nSo, starting with sin x, I know that the sine function is defined for all real numbers, meaning its domain is all real numbers, or in interval notation, (-\u221e, \u221e). The range of sin x is from -1 to 1, inclusive, so [-1, 1].\n\nNow, the function is being changed to 3 sin 2x. Let's break this down. There are two changes here: the coefficient 3 in front of the sine function and the 2 inside the argument of the sine function.\n\nFirst, the coefficient 3 in front of sin 2x affects the amplitude of the sine function. The amplitude is the maximum value the function can reach from its central axis. For sin x, the amplitude is 1, since it goes from -1 to 1. Multiplying by 3 means the amplitude is now 3, so the function will go from -3 to 3. Therefore, the range of 3 sin 2x should be [-3, 3].\n\nNext, the 2 inside the argument of the sine function affects the period of the function. The period of sin x is 2\u03c0, meaning it repeats every 2\u03c0 units. Multiplying the x by 2 changes the period to 2\u03c0/2 = \u03c0, so the function repeats every \u03c0 units. However, the period is related to the frequency of the function, not directly to the domain or range.\n\nNow, considering the domain, since sine is defined for all real numbers, and multiplying x by 2 doesn't restrict the input values, the domain remains all real numbers for 3 sin 2x.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Domain remains the same: all real numbers.\n\n- Range changes from [-1, 1] to [-3, 3], which is tripled in amplitude.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Domain and range remain the same.\n\nB. Domain is double; range remains the same.\n\nC. Domain is tripled; range is doubled.\n\nD. Domain is the same; range is tripled.\n\nOption D seems to match what I've concluded: the domain remains the same, and the range is tripled (from 1 to 3, but more accurately, the amplitude is tripled, and the range extends from -3 to 3).\n\nHowever, I should double-check if the domain is indeed unchanged. Multiplying x by 2 inside the sine function doesn't impose any restrictions on x; sine is still defined for all real numbers. So, domain remains the same.\n\nRegarding the range, multiplying sin x by 3 scales the output by 3, so the range becomes [-3, 3], which is indeed tripled in amplitude compared to [-1, 1].\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure that \"tripled\" is the right term. The amplitude is tripled, as the maximum value goes from 1 to 3, and the minimum from -1 to -3. So, the range is stretched by a factor of 3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is D: Domain is the same; range is tripled.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
