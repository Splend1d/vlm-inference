They assume authority, and juggle before us with impudent words, saying that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, whether he be evil or good, albeit they cannot prove it by a single letter. That is why the canon law contains so many heretical and unchristian, nay unnatural, laws; but of these we need not speak now. For whereas they imagine the Holy Ghost never leaves them, however unlearned and wicked they may be, they grow bold enough to decree whatever they like. But were this true, where were the need and use of the Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost dwells, who, however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I could never have believed that the devil should have put forth such follies at Rome and find a following.\"\nMartin Luther, Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520\nHow is the \"temporal power\" mentioned in the passage best understood contextually?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this passage from Martin Luther's \"Address to the Nobility of the German Nation\" from 1520. It's pretty dense, but I need to understand what he's saying about the \"temporal power.\" The question is asking how the \"temporal power\" is best understood in this context, and the options are:\n\nA. A clerical or ecclesiastical authority\n\nB. A legal or scholarly authority\n\nC. A state or secular authority\n\nD. A business or economic authority\n\nFirst, I need to get a sense of what Luther is talking about here. He's critiquing the Roman Catholic Church, specifically the Pope and the clergy, and he's pointing out what he sees as three main defenses they use to protect themselves from reform.\n\nThe first defense he mentions is that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, and that the spiritual power is above the temporal. So, there's a distinction being made between temporal and spiritual powers.\n\nGiven that, temporal power seems to be contrasted with spiritual power, which I assume refers to the authority of the Church, particularly the Pope.\n\nSo, if spiritual power is the Church's authority, then temporal power must be something else. Looking at the options, A is clerical or ecclesiastical authority, which seems to align with spiritual power, not temporal.\n\nOption B is legal or scholarly authority. While the Church does have its own legal system and scholars, in this context, Luther is distinguishing between spiritual and temporal authorities, so I'm not sure if legal or scholarly fits best here.\n\nOption C is state or secular authority. That sounds plausible because the state is typically secular and distinct from the Church.\n\nOption D is business or economic authority. While the Church had significant economic power in those days, that doesn't seem directly relevant to the contrast Luther is making here.\n\nLet me read that part again: \"if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\"\n\nSo, it's clear that temporal power is being contrasted with spiritual power, and the Church is asserting that spiritual power supersedes temporal power.\n\nGiven that, temporal power must refer to authority that is not spiritual, i.e., not from the Church.\n\nIn historical context, during the time of Luther, there was a lot of tension between the authority of the Church and the authority of the state. The Church claimed that its authority was supreme in spiritual matters, and that even secular rulers should be subject to the Pope in certain areas.\n\nSo, in this context, temporal power likely refers to the authority of the secular rulers, the kings, princes, and other nobility who governed the various states and territories in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\n\nTherefore, option C, a state or secular authority, seems to be the best fit.\n\nTo double-check, let's look at the other parts of the passage. Luther mentions that the Romanists (meaning the Catholic Church) have drawn three walls to protect themselves:\n\n1. They claim that temporal power has no jurisdiction over them.\n\n2. Only the Pope can interpret the Scriptures.\n\n3. Only the Pope can call a council.\n\nSo, the first wall is about resisting authority from outside the Church, specifically from secular rulers.\n\nThe second wall is about controlling interpretation of the Scriptures, making themselves the sole arbiters of what the Bible says.\n\nThe third is about controlling church governance, claiming that only the Pope can convene a council to address church matters.\n\nSo, the first wall is clearly about resisting secular authority, which reinforces the idea that temporal power refers to state or secular authority.\n\nAdditionally, the title of the work is \"Address to the Nobility of the German Nation,\" so Luther is speaking to the secular leaders of Germany, urging them to take action against the abuses of the Church.\n\nHe's essentially saying that the Church has been asserting its authority over secular matters and resisting any interference from secular rulers, which is part of the problem he sees.\n\nTherefore, in this context, temporal power refers to secular, state authority, making option C the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOption A, clerical or ecclesiastical authority, doesn't make sense because the Church itself is the spiritual authority, and Luther is contrasting temporal with spiritual power.\n\nOption B, legal or scholarly authority, might have some relevance because secular rulers had their own legal systems and scholars, but the contrast is more clearly between spiritual and temporal authorities.\n\nOption D, business or economic authority, isn't directly relevant to the power dynamics Luther is discussing here. While the Church had significant economic power, that's not the main point in this passage.\n\nHence, the best answer is C, a state or secular authority.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
