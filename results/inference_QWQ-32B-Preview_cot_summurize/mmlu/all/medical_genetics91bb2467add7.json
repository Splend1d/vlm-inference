                    "text": "So I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nThe question is: \"The likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be:\n\nA. 0.4\n\nB. 0.32\n\nC. 0.08\n\nD. 0.02\"\n\nOkay, so it's about alleles and their frequencies in a population. I remember that alleles are different forms of a gene, and in population genetics, we often deal with allele frequencies.\n\nThe frequencies given are both 0.2 for each allele. The question is asking for the likelihood that an individual has two specific alleles, which I think means they're homozygous for that marker, assuming both alleles are the same.\n\nWait, but it says \"two specific alleles,\" which might include both homozygous and heterozygous cases, or maybe it's specifying two different alleles. I need to clarify that.\n\nIf the two alleles are the same, then it's homozygous, and the probability would be the frequency of that allele squared, which would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. But that's not an option.\n\nHmm, maybe the alleles are different. If there are two specific alleles, say allele A with frequency 0.2 and allele B with frequency 0.2, and we're looking for the probability of an individual having one A and one B, that would be a heterozygote.\n\nIn that case, the probability would be 2 * frequency of A * frequency of B, because they can inherit A from one parent and B from the other, or vice versa.\n\nSo that would be 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08.\n\nLooking at the options, 0.08 is option C.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"each of which has a frequency of 0.2.\" Does that mean both alleles have the same frequency, or that each allele in question has a frequency of 0.2, possibly being different alleles?\n\nIf they are the same allele, then it's homozygous, which would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, but that's not an option.\n\nIf they are different alleles, then it's heterozygous, which is 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08, which is option C.\n\nBut the question says \"two specific alleles,\" which could imply that they are two distinct alleles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a diploid organism, and we're looking at two copies of the gene, each with a probability of 0.2 of having that allele.\n\nIn that case, the probability of having both alleles would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, but again, that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the probability of carrying both alleles in the population, not necessarily at the same locus.\n\nBut it specifies \"two specific alleles of a human DNA marker,\" which suggests that it's about two alleles at the same locus.\n\nIn that case, if the alleles are the same, it's homozygous, and if they are different, it's heterozygous.\n\nBut in population genetics, the frequency of homozygotes for allele A is p^2, and for heterozygotes, it's 2pq, where p and q are the frequencies of the alleles.\n\nHere, if both alleles have a frequency of 0.2, and assuming there are only two alleles, then p = q = 0.2.\n\nWait, but that would mean p + q = 0.4, which is less than 1, which is not possible because the sum of allele frequencies should be 1.\n\nSo perhaps there are more than two alleles at that locus, and we're dealing with just two of them, each with a frequency of 0.2.\n\nIn that case, the probability of an individual having one of each of these two specific alleles would be 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because there might be other alleles present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only these two alleles, but that seems unlikely because allele frequencies should add up to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the Hardy-Weinberg principle.\n\nAccording to Hardy-Weinberg, in a large, randomly mating population without selection, mutation, or migration, the allele frequencies remain constant, and the genotype frequencies can be calculated as p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p and q are the frequencies of the two alleles.\n\nBut in this case, if there are only two alleles, each with a frequency of 0.2, that would mean p + q = 0.4, which is not possible because the sum should be 1.\n\nSo perhaps there are more than two alleles, and we're dealing with just two of them, each with a frequency of 0.2.\n\nIn that case, the probability of an individual having one of each of these two specific alleles would still be 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08.\n\nLooking back at the options, 0.08 is option C.\n\nBut I feel like there might be something I'm missing here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability of carrying two copies of the same specific allele.\n\nIn that case, if the frequency of the allele is 0.2, the probability of being homozygous for that allele would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability of carrying two specific alleles, which could be the same or different, but specified in advance.\n\nIn that case, if the alleles are specified, and each has a frequency of 0.2, then the probability of having both alleles would depend on whether they are the same or different.\n\nBut the question seems to imply that they are two specific distinct alleles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a question about linkage disequilibrium or something more complex, but that seems unlikely for this level.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is referring to two different loci, each with an allele frequency of 0.2, and we're to find the probability of an individual having both alleles at both loci.\n\nIn that case, assuming independence, it would be 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, but again, that's not an option.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should look back at the question.\n\n\"The likelihood of an individual in a population carrying two specific alleles of a human DNA marker, each of which has a frequency of 0.2, will be:\n\nA. 0.4\n\nB. 0.32\n\nC. 0.08\n\nD. 0.02\"\n\nI think the key here is \"two specific alleles of a human DNA marker.\" In genetics, a DNA marker usually refers to a specific location on the DNA, which could be a gene or any other identifiable site.\n\nSo, if it's a single marker, it could have multiple alleles, and we're dealing with two specific ones, each with a frequency of 0.2.\n\nIf there are only two alleles at that marker, then p = q = 0.2, but that doesn't make sense because p + q should equal 1.\n\nTherefore, there must be more than two alleles at that marker.\n\nLet's say there are n alleles, with frequencies p1, p2, ..., pn, and p1 + p2 + ... + pn = 1.\n\nWe're interested in the probability of an individual having two specific alleles, say allele A with frequency 0.2 and allele B with frequency 0.2, assuming they are different alleles.\n\nIn that case, the probability of being heterozygous for A and B would be 2 * pA * pB = 2 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.08.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the two alleles are the same, say both are allele A, then the probability would be pA^2 = 0.2^2 = 0.04, but that's not an option.\n\nBut the question says \"two specific alleles,\" which probably means two distinct alleles.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0.08, option C.\n\nI think that's the best answer given the information provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
