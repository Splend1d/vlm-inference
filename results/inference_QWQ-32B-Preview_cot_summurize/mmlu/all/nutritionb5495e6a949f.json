                    "text": "Let's see which statement about the stomach is correct. I need to think carefully about each option.\n\nOption A says: \"Acid secretion occurs in response to secretion of the hormone, carbonic anhydrase.\" Hmm, carbonic anhydrase is actually an enzyme involved in carbon dioxide transport and not a hormone that triggers acid secretion. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption B: \"Glands called Peyer's patches are responsible for acid secretion.\" Peyer's patches are part of the immune system in the small intestine, not glands in the stomach responsible for acid secretion. So, that's probably wrong.\n\nOption C: \"The vagus nerve inhibits acid secretion after a meal has been consumed.\" I know that the vagus nerve is involved in stimulating gastric acid secretion during the cephalic and gastric phases of digestion. So, it seems like it would stimulate, not inhibit, acid secretion. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach.\" I recall that pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells in the stomach and is converted to pepsin, which helps digest proteins. Gastric lipase is also secreted in the stomach and helps in fat digestion. So, this seems accurate.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Pepsinogen is indeed secreted in the stomach and activated to pepsin in the acidic environment. Gastric lipase is also secreted there to begin fat digestion. So, both of these enzymes are indeed secreted into the stomach lumen.\n\nLet me make sure there isn't any confusion with other enzymes or secretions. For example, I know that hydrochloric acid is secreted by parietal cells, and intrinsic factor is also secreted there for vitamin B12 absorption. But the question is specifically about enzymes secreted into the lumen.\n\nPepsinogen is inactive and is activated to pepsin in the presence of acid, which helps in breaking down proteins. Gastric lipase, on the other hand, starts the breakdown of triglycerides.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that option D is the correct statement among the ones provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
