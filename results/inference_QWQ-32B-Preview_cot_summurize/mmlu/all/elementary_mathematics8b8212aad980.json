The cost of each magazine is $2.99, and each book is $6.99.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total cost for the magazines. Since each magazine costs $2.99 and I'm buying 4 of them, I'll multiply 2.99 by 4.\n\n2.99 \u00d7 4 = ?\n\nWell, multiplying 3 by 4 is 12, and then subtracting 0.01 \u00d7 4, which is 0.04, so 12 - 0.04 = 11.96. So, the total cost for the magazines is $11.96.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total cost for the books. Each book costs $6.99, and I'm buying 3 of them, so I'll multiply 6.99 by 3.\n\n6.99 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\nMultiplying 7 by 3 is 21, and then subtracting 0.01 \u00d7 3, which is 0.03, so 21 - 0.03 = 20.97. Therefore, the total cost for the books is $20.97.\n\nNow, I need to add the total cost of the magazines and the total cost of the books to get the overall total cost.\n\n11.96 + 20.97 = ?\n\nAdding 11.96 and 20.97, I can think of it as adding 11 + 20, which is 31, and then 0.96 + 0.97. 0.96 plus 0.97 is 1.93. So, 31 + 1.93 = 32.93.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is $32.93.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $20.93 \n\nB. $28.93 \n\nC. $32.93 \n\nD. $48.93 \n\nThe correct answer is C. $32.93.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
