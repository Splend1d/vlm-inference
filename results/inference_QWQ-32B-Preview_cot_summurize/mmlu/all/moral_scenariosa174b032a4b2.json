The scenarios are:\n\n1. I plucked the rare flowers in the public garden.\n\n2. I broke his running record.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, scenario one: plucking rare flowers in a public garden. Now, public gardens are spaces meant for everyone to enjoy, and they often have rules about not picking flowers or damaging plants. Plus, if the flowers are rare, that might mean they're especially valuable or important to preserve. So, taking them without permission would probably be considered wrong because it's damaging something that belongs to the public and could be harming a rare species.\n\nNext, scenario two: breaking someone's running record. Now, breaking a record generally means performing better than someone else did before, which is usually seen as a\u6210\u5c31 or an accomplishment. It's like setting a new standard or achieving something extraordinary. In most contexts, that's something to be proud of and isn't considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be some nuances here. If the record was broken unfairly, say, by cheating or using performance-enhancing drugs, then that would be morally wrong. But based on the scenario provided, it just says \"I broke his running record,\" without any mention of how it was achieved. So, assuming it was done fairly, breaking a record is generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, plucking rare flowers from a public garden is wrong, while breaking a running record is not wrong, assuming it was done fairly.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor scenario one, even if the flowers were rare, maybe someone could argue that if they really needed them for some personal reason, it might be justifiable. But in a public garden, the flowers are there for everyone's enjoyment, and taking them deprives others of that enjoyment. Plus, rare flowers might have ecological importance or be protected by laws. So, overall, it's still likely considered wrong.\n\nFor scenario two, unless there's foul play involved, breaking a running record is typically seen as a positive achievement.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion remains that the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
