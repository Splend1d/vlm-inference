                    "text": "So I've got this question here about why the power and prestige of the presidency have grown since 1932. There are four options listed, and I need to pick which ones account for that growth. Let's see what they are.\n\nOption I says: \"America's increased prominence in international affairs.\" Hmm, that makes sense. Starting in the 1930s, especially after World War II, the United States really stepped up on the global stage. It became a superpower, involved in more international agreements and organizations. So, with more international responsibilities, the president's role would probably expand because the president is the face of the U.S. in foreign affairs. So, I think I should include this one.\n\nOption II is: \"Continually improved public confidence in the federal government.\" Hmm, that's interesting. I'm not sure about this one. If public confidence in the federal government improved, that might mean people trust the government more, which could lead to more support for presidential actions. But, I'm not entirely sure if this has been continually improving since 1932. In fact, I think there have been ups and downs in public trust over the years. So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption III says: \"The New Deal and other programs that have expanded federal responsibility.\" Oh, the New Deal was a big deal, starting in the 1930s as a response to the Great Depression. It greatly expanded the role of the federal government in the economy and in people's lives. With more responsibilities and powers granted to the federal government, the president's office would naturally become more powerful because the president oversees the execution of these programs. So, this seems like a solid reason for the growth in presidential power and prestige.\n\nOption IV is: \"The president's increased visibility, due to the development of mass media.\" Absolutely. Mass media, starting with radio, then television, and now the internet, has made presidents more visible and accessible to the public. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a master of radio, using fireside chats to connect with Americans. Later, presidents used television to address the nation. This increased visibility can enhance the president's prestige and influence. People see the president more, hear directly from them, which can bolster their image and power.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nI. America's increased prominence in international affairs - yes\n\nII. Continually improved public confidence in the federal government - not sure, seems questionable\n\nIII. The New Deal and other programs that expanded federal responsibility - yes\n\nIV. The president's increased visibility due to mass media - yes\n\nSo, it looks like options I, III, and IV are the ones that account for the growth in presidential power and prestige since 1932. Looking at the answer choices:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. I and IV only\n\nC. I, III, and IV only\n\nD. II and IV only\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. I, III, and IV only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
