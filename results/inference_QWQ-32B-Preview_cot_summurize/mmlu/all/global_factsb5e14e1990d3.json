So, the correct answer is C. 4%.\n\nTo provide some context, this figure represents the average percentage of a country's gross domestic product that governments allocate to education. It's important to note that this can vary significantly between different countries, with some investing much more in education relative to their GDP, while others spend less. This data is crucial for understanding global trends in education funding and for assessing how much importance different nations place on education in their overall budget allocations."
