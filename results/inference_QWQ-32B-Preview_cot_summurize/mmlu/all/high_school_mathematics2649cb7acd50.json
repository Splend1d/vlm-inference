                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three polynomials: \\( f(x) \\) of degree 6, \\( g(x) \\) of degree 3, and \\( h(x) \\) of some degree we need to find, say degree \\( n \\). The expression given is \\( f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) \\), and we're told that this entire expression is a polynomial of degree 36. We need to determine the degree of \\( h(x) \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall that when you compose two polynomials, the degree of the composition is the product of their degrees. That is, if you have \\( f(x) \\) of degree \\( m \\) and \\( g(x) \\) of degree \\( k \\), then \\( f(g(x)) \\) will have degree \\( m \\times k \\).\n\nSo, for \\( f(g(x)) \\), since \\( f(x) \\) is degree 6 and \\( g(x) \\) is degree 3, the degree of \\( f(g(x)) \\) should be \\( 6 \\times 3 = 18 \\).\n\nNext, \\( g(h(x)) \\): \\( g(x) \\) is degree 3, and \\( h(x) \\) is degree \\( n \\), so \\( g(h(x)) \\) should have degree \\( 3 \\times n = 3n \\).\n\nThen, \\( h(f(x)) \\): \\( h(x) \\) is degree \\( n \\), and \\( f(x) \\) is degree 6, so \\( h(f(x)) \\) should have degree \\( n \\times 6 = 6n \\).\n\nNow, the expression is the sum of these three composed polynomials: \\( f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) \\), and the overall degree of this sum is given as 36.\n\nWhen adding polynomials, the degree of the sum is the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials, provided that the leading coefficients do not cancel each other out. In the worst case, if leading coefficients cancel, the degree could be less, but since we're given the exact degree of the sum, we can assume that the highest degree term comes from one of these three compositions.\n\nSo, the degree of the sum is the maximum of 18, \\( 3n \\), and \\( 6n \\), and this maximum is equal to 36.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\max(18, 3n, 6n) = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n1. If \\( 6n > 3n \\) and \\( 6n > 18 \\), then \\( 6n = 36 \\), so \\( n = 6 \\).\n\n2. If \\( 3n > 6n \\) and \\( 3n > 18 \\), then \\( 3n = 36 \\), so \\( n = 12 \\).\n\n3. If 18 is the largest, then \\( 18 = 36 \\), which is not possible.\n\nSo, the possible values for \\( n \\) are 6 or 12.\n\nBut we need to check if these values satisfy the condition without any degree conflicts.\n\nLet's check \\( n = 6 \\):\n\n- \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree 18.\n\n- \\( g(h(x)) \\) has degree \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\).\n\n- \\( h(f(x)) \\) has degree \\( 6 \\times 6 = 36 \\).\n\nThe sum would have degree 36, which matches the given information.\n\nNow, let's check \\( n = 12 \\):\n\n- \\( f(g(x)) \\) has degree 18.\n\n- \\( g(h(x)) \\) has degree \\( 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\).\n\n- \\( h(f(x)) \\) has degree \\( 6 \\times 12 = 72 \\).\n\nThe sum would have degree 72, which does not match the given degree of 36.\n\nTherefore, \\( n = 12 \\) is not a valid solution because it would result in the sum having degree 72, not 36.\n\nHence, the only valid solution is \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nWait a minute, but according to our earlier analysis, \\( n = 6 \\) gives degrees 18, 18, and 36, with the sum having degree 36, which matches. And \\( n = 12 \\) gives degrees 18, 36, and 72, with the sum having degree 72, which does not match.\n\nTherefore, the degree of \\( h(x) \\) must be 6.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is 72, B is 6, C is 18, D is 12. So, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, let's double-check if there's any possibility that \\( n \\) could be another value.\n\nSuppose \\( n = 6 \\), as we have, and the degrees are 18, 18, and 36. The sum has degree 36, which matches.\n\nIf \\( n \\) were less than 6, say \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n- \\( f(g(x)) \\) still 18.\n\n- \\( g(h(x)) \\) would be \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\).\n\n- \\( h(f(x)) \\) would be \\( 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\).\n\nThe sum would have degree 30, which is less than 36, so not a match.\n\nIf \\( n = 7 \\):\n\n- \\( f(g(x)) \\) is 18.\n\n- \\( g(h(x)) \\) is \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\).\n\n- \\( h(f(x)) \\) is \\( 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\).\n\nSum would have degree 42, which is more than 36.\n\nSo, only \\( n = 6 \\) gives the sum with degree 36.\n\nTherefore, the degree of \\( h(x) \\) is 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
