                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about IPv4 datagrams, and I need to figure out which statements are true. The statements are:\n\nI. Datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest maximum transmission unit (MTU) of all the links on a path to the destination.\n\nII. Datagrams may be fragmented during routing.\n\nIII. Datagrams are reassembled only at the destination.\n\nAnd the options are A. I only, B. II only, C. III only, D. II and III.\n\nOkay, first, I need to recall how IPv4 handles datagrams and fragmentation.\n\nStatement I says that datagrams at the source must be the size of the smallest MTU on the path to the destination. I think this might not be entirely accurate. From what I remember, the source doesn't necessarily know the smallest MTU along the path. Instead, there's a concept called Path MTU Discovery, where the source tries to find out the smallest MTU on the path and sets the datagram size accordingly to avoid fragmentation. But it's not a hard requirement that the datagram must be set to the smallest MTU at the source. So, I'm leaning towards thinking that statement I is false.\n\nStatement II says that datagrams may be fragmented during routing. I know that in IPv4, if a router receives a datagram that is larger than the MTU of the outgoing link, it can fragment the datagram into smaller pieces. So, yes, fragmentation can happen during routing. Therefore, statement II is true.\n\nStatement III says that datagrams are reassembled only at the destination. Again, from my understanding, fragmentation allows datagrams to be split into fragments that travel independently through the network. These fragments are reassembled back into the original datagram only when they reach the destination. So, statement III is also true.\n\nGiven that, it seems like statements II and III are true, while statement I is not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. II and III.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to statement I. Perhaps in some cases, the source does set the datagram size based on the smallest MTU. I recall that there's an option in the IP header called \"Don't Fragment\" (DF) bit, which, if set, prevents routers from fragmenting the datagram. If the datagram is larger than the MTU of a link, it will be dropped, and an ICMP message will be sent back to the source. So, in that case, the source might need to know the path MTU to avoid fragmentation or dropping of packets.\n\nBut even with the DF bit set, it's not that the datagram must be set to the smallest MTU at the source; it's more about the source trying to discover the path MTU to set an appropriate datagram size. So, I still think statement I is not entirely accurate.\n\nTherefore, my final answer is D. II and III.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
