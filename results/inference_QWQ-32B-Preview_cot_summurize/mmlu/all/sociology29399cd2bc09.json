Let's look at the options:\n\nA. reading a textual document quickly to understand the gist of it.\n\nHmm, I've heard of skimming, which is like quickly reading to get the main ideas, but is that the same as eyeballing? Maybe not exactly.\n\nB. gathering a sample from whoever you can see in a public place.\n\nOkay, so this sounds like convenience sampling, where you just pick participants who are easily accessible. Is eyeballing related to sampling methods? Possibly, but I'm not sure.\n\nC. scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures.\n\nThis seems interesting. Eyeballing could mean looking at data visually to spot trends or important numbers without doing detailed analysis. That makes sense in research or data interpretation.\n\nD. keeping your eyes on research participants at all times.\n\nThis sounds more like direct observation, where you continuously monitor participants. While it involves looking at them, I don't think that's what eyeballing refers to.\n\nLet me think about it. Eyeballing, to me, suggests using visual inspection to make judgments or identify features without precise measurement. So, in research, it might involve looking at data tables or graphs to get a rough idea of what's going on.\n\nOption A is about reading text quickly, which is more about comprehension speed than visual inspection for data.\n\nOption B is about sampling based on visibility, which is more about selection methods.\n\nOption C is about scanning tables for patterns, which aligns well with the idea of eyeballing data.\n\nOption D is about continuous observation, which is different from making quick visual judgments about data.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is C. Scanning a table to identify general patterns and significant figures.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if eyeballing could also relate to other options.\n\nIs eyeballing used in reading texts? Well, maybe in the sense of getting a quick overview, but that's more what skimming is for.\n\nIn sampling, eyeballing might refer to selecting participants based on visual cues, but that seems more like convenience or purposive sampling.\n\nIn data analysis, eyeballing is commonly used to initially explore data, look for outliers, or see trends before doing formal analysis.\n\nIn observation studies, keeping eyes on participants is important, but that's more about data collection than making visual judgments about the data.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
