                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have an expansionary fiscal policy that leads to a big jump in real output and only a small rise in the price level. I need to figure out what that tells us about the state of the economy before the stimulus.\n\nOption A says that inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus. But if inflation was already a issue, wouldn't an expansionary fiscal policy make it worse by pushing prices up even more? But here, prices only increase a little bit, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nOption B says that the economy initially had some unemployed resources. Unemployed resources mean there's room to increase output without putting much upward pressure on prices. So, if there's a lot of unused capacity, you can boost output a lot without causing a big jump in prices. That seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that aggregate supply decreased. But an expansionary fiscal policy usually shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right. If aggregate supply decreased, that would typically lead to higher prices and potentially lower output, depending on the scenario. But here, output increases and prices barely budge, so that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D says that aggregate demand is steeply sloped. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Usually, we talk about the slope of the aggregate supply curve determining how much output changes versus how much prices change in response to a shift in aggregate demand.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to recall the AS-AD model. In the AS-AD model, the aggregate supply curve can be upward sloping, and its slope determines how much output responds versus prices to a shift in aggregate demand.\n\nIf the AS curve is flat, then a rightward shift in AD would lead to a large increase in output with little change in prices. If the AS curve is steep, then the same shift in AD would lead to a smaller increase in output but a larger increase in prices.\n\nSo, in this case, with a large increase in output and a small increase in prices, it suggests that the AS curve is fairly flat.\n\nNow, why would the AS curve be flat? A flat AS curve typically indicates that there are unemployed resources in the economy. When there's excess capacity, firms can increase production without facing much upward pressure on costs, so prices don't rise much.\n\nOn the other hand, if the economy is at full capacity, the AS curve is steeper, and any increase in AD would mainly lead to higher prices rather than higher output.\n\nSo, going back to the options, option B says that the economy initially had some unemployed resources, which aligns with the idea of a flat AS curve.\n\nOption A about inflation already impacting the economy seems less relevant here, because if inflation was already a problem, you'd expect prices to rise more in response to a fiscal stimulus.\n\nOption C says aggregate supply decreased, but that wouldn't lead to higher output; it would likely lead to lower output and higher prices.\n\nOption D mentions that aggregate demand is steeply sloped, but I think that's not directly related to the outcome described.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible inference is that the economy initially had some unemployed resources, which allowed for a large increase in output with only a small increase in the price level in response to the expansionary fiscal policy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
