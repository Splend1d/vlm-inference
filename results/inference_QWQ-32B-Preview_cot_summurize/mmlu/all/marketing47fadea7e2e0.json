The conflicts are over things like carrying a specific product range or price increases. The options are Channel conflict, Horizontal conflict, Vertical conflict, and Supply chain conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the differences between these types of conflicts.\n\nChannel conflict, I think, is a broad term that can include different types of conflicts within a distribution channel. But maybe there's a more specific term for conflicts between different levels of the channel, like producers and retailers.\n\nHorizontal conflict, I believe, is when conflict happens between competitors at the same level in the distribution channel. For example, two different retailers fighting over territory or customers. So, that doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about conflicts between sequential members, like producers and distributors, which are at different levels.\n\nVertical conflict, on the other hand, is conflict between different levels of the distribution channel, such as between producers and distributors, or distributors and retailers. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nSupply chain conflict might be similar to channel conflict, but I'm not entirely sure about the distinction. Maybe supply chain conflict is a broader term that includes not just distribution channel members but also other partners in the supply chain, like suppliers to the producers.\n\nGiven that, I think the most appropriate answer is Vertical conflict because it specifically refers to conflicts between different levels of the distribution channel, which matches the description in the question.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\n- Channel conflict: Could be either horizontal or vertical, but not specific.\n\n- Horizontal conflict: Between peers at the same level, which isn't the case here.\n\n- Vertical conflict: Between different levels, which fits the description.\n\n- Supply chain conflict: Possibly broader, including more partners.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with C. Vertical conflict.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
