                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about parallel computing and I need to figure out the best possible elapsed times for a program running on 2 and 4 processors. The computation takes 100 seconds on a single processor, and 40% of it is inherently sequential, which means that part can't be sped up by using more processors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"inherently sequential\" means. It means that 40% of the computation has to be done one after the other, without any parallelism. So, no matter how many processors I have, that 40% will always take the same amount of time because it can't be divided among multiple processors.\n\nThat leaves 60% of the computation that can be parallelized. This part can be divided among multiple processors to reduce the total time.\n\nSo, for 1 processor, the total time is 100 seconds, which includes both the sequential and parallel parts.\n\nLet me calculate the time for the sequential part and the parallel part separately.\n\nSequential part: 40% of 100 seconds = 0.4 * 100 = 40 seconds.\n\nParallel part: 60% of 100 seconds = 0.6 * 100 = 60 seconds.\n\nNow, when using multiple processors, the sequential part remains the same because it can't be parallelized. The parallel part can be divided among the processors.\n\nFor 2 processors, the parallel part should take half the time, assuming perfect load balancing and no overhead.\n\nSo, time for parallel part with 2 processors: 60 seconds / 2 = 30 seconds.\n\nTherefore, total time with 2 processors: sequential time + parallel time with 2 processors = 40 seconds + 30 seconds = 70 seconds.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 processors, the parallel part should take one-fourth of the time.\n\nTime for parallel part with 4 processors: 60 seconds / 4 = 15 seconds.\n\nTotal time with 4 processors: 40 seconds + 15 seconds = 55 seconds.\n\nSo, the best possible elapsed times are 70 seconds for 2 processors and 55 seconds for 4 processors.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 20 and 10 seconds\n\nB. 30 and 15 seconds\n\nC. 50 and 25 seconds\n\nD. 70 and 55 seconds\n\nIt seems that D is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs there a formula for this? I think there is. It's called Amdahl's Law, which gives the theoretical speedup in latency of the execution of a task at fixed workload that can be expected of a system whose resources are improved.\n\nAmdahl's Law states that:\n\nSpeedup = 1 / (sequential_part + (parallel_part / number_of_processors))\n\nIn this case, sequential_part = 0.4, parallel_part = 0.6.\n\nFor 2 processors:\n\nSpeedup = 1 / (0.4 + (0.6 / 2)) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.3) = 1 / 0.7 \u2248 1.4286\n\nSo, time with 2 processors = total time with 1 processor / speedup = 100 / 1.4286 \u2248 70 seconds.\n\nFor 4 processors:\n\nSpeedup = 1 / (0.4 + (0.6 / 4)) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.15) = 1 / 0.55 \u2248 1.8182\n\nTime with 4 processors = 100 / 1.8182 \u2248 55 seconds.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 70 and 55 seconds.\n\nBut let's see why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: 20 and 10 seconds. That would imply a speedup of 5 and 10, which is not possible with only 2 and 4 processors if 40% is sequential.\n\nOption B: 30 and 15 seconds. That would be a speedup of approximately 3.33 and 6.67, which again is not achievable given the sequential portion.\n\nOption C: 50 and 25 seconds. Speedup of 2 and 4, which still doesn't account for the sequential part.\n\nOnly option D accounts for the sequential part correctly, resulting in the speedup being limited by that sequential portion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 70 and 55 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
