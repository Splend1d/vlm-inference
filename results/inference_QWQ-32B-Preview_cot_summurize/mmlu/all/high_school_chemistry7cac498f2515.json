                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this buffer solution problem. So, I have a liter of a 0.100 M solution of a strong acid, and I need to mix it with something to prepare a buffer. The options are a strong acid, a weak acid, a weak base, or a strong base. I know that buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH when small amounts of acid or base are added to them. But I'm a bit confused about what to add to my strong acid to make a buffer.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a buffer is composed of. I think buffers are typically made up of a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. That way, they can neutralize small additions of acid or base without changing the pH much. So, if I have a strong acid, like hydrochloric acid (HCl), and I want to turn it into a buffer, what should I add?\n\nOption A is a strong acid. Adding another strong acid to my existing strong acid solution wouldn't create a buffer; it would just make the solution more acidic. That doesn't sound right for making a buffer.\n\nOption B is a weak acid. If I add a weak acid to a strong acid, I'm still mostly dealing with the strong acid's protons, which wouldn't help in creating a buffer. I don't think this is the right choice.\n\nOption C is a weak base. Hmm, adding a weak base to a strong acid could lead to a reaction where the weak base accepts protons from the strong acid, forming its conjugate acid. If I have both the weak base and its conjugate acid in the solution, that could act as a buffer. Wait, but actually, buffers are made from a weak acid and its conjugate base, or a weak base and its conjugate acid. So, if I add a weak base to a strong acid, it might react to form the conjugate acid of the weak base, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.\n\nOption D is a strong base. Adding a strong base to a strong acid would lead to a neutralization reaction, producing water and a salt. Depending on the stoichiometry, I could end up with a salt solution, which might not necessarily be a buffer unless the salt is from a weak acid and a strong base or vice versa.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should consider the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of a buffer to the pKa of the weak acid and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base to the weak acid. So, to have a buffer, I need both the weak acid and its conjugate base present in solution.\n\nIn my case, I start with a strong acid. If I add a weak base to it, some of the weak base will react with the strong acid to form its conjugate acid. So, I would have the weak base and its conjugate acid in solution, which should act as a buffer.\n\nAlternatively, if I add a weak acid to the strong acid, it might not create a buffer because the strong acid would protonate the weak acid, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider an example. Let's say my strong acid is HCl, and I add a weak base like ammonia (NH3). The HCl will react with NH3 to form NH4Cl. NH4Cl is the conjugate acid of NH3. So, in solution, I would have NH3 and NH4Cl, which can act as a buffer system because NH3 is a weak base and NH4+ is its conjugate acid.\n\nSimilarly, if I added a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) to the HCl, the HCl would protonate the acetate ions, but I'm not sure if that would create a buffer.\n\nWait, perhaps adding a weak base is the way to go. So, option C seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider adding a strong base, like NaOH, to the HCl. They would neutralize each other to form water and NaCl. NaCl is a salt from a strong acid and a strong base, so its solution should be neutral, without buffer capacity.\n\nTherefore, adding a strong base doesn't seem to create a buffer.\n\nAdding another strong acid, option A, would just make the solution more acidic, without creating a buffer.\n\nAdding a weak acid, option B, might not create a buffer because the strong acid would likely protonate any conjugate base present.\n\nSo, it seems that adding a weak base, option C, is the best choice to create a buffer from a strong acid solution.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check what happens if I add a weak base to a strong acid.\n\nLet's say I have HCl and NH3:\n\nHCl + NH3 \u2192 NH4Cl\n\nIn solution, NH4Cl dissociates into NH4+ and Cl-. NH4+ can act as an acid, and NH3 can act as a base. So, the solution would contain NH4+ and NH3, which can act as a buffer system.\n\nSimilarly, if I added a weak base like pyridine to HCl, pyridine would accept a proton from HCl to form pyridinium chloride. Then, in solution, I'd have pyridine and pyridinium ions, which can act as a buffer.\n\nTherefore, adding a weak base to a strong acid does create a buffer solution.\n\nOn the other hand, adding a weak acid to a strong acid wouldn't create a buffer because the strong acid would protonate the weak base, but I'm not sure about this.\n\nWait, perhaps adding a weak acid to a strong acid would result in two acids in solution, but since one is strong and the other is weak, it might not provide the necessary conjugate base to act as a buffer.\n\nSimilarly, adding a strong base would neutralize the strong acid, likely forming a salt without buffer properties.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is to add a weak base to the strong acid to prepare a buffer.\n\nSo, the answer is C. a weak base.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
