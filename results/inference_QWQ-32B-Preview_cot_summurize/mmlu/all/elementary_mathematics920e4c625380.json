                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a basketball player who scored 18 points in his first game. This score is 4 points fewer than what he scored in his second game. We need to find out how many points he scored in his second game, and we're given some options to choose from.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the problem is saying. It says that the first game's score is 4 points fewer than the second game's score. In other words, if we take the second game's score and subtract 4 points, we should get the first game's score, which is 18 points.\n\nLet's use a variable to represent the second game's score. Let's call it p. So, p is the number of points scored in the second game.\n\nNow, according to the problem, the first game's score (18 points) is equal to the second game's score (p) minus 4 points. So, we can write this relationship as an equation:\n\n18 = p - 4\n\nThat makes sense. Now, we need to solve for p to find out how many points were scored in the second game.\n\nTo solve for p, we can add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate p:\n\n18 + 4 = p - 4 + 4\n\n22 = p\n\nSo, p equals 22. That means the player scored 22 points in his second game.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 18 = p \u2212 4; 14\n\nB. 18 = p \u2212 4; 22\n\nC. 18 \u2212 4 = p; 14\n\nD. 18 \u2212 p = 4; 22\n\nWe can see that option B has the correct equation and the correct solution: 18 = p \u2212 4; p = 22.\n\nWait a minute, option C has 18 \u2212 4 = p; 14. That would be 14 = p, which is not correct based on our earlier calculation.\n\nOption D has 18 \u2212 p = 4; 22. If we solve this equation:\n\n18 - p = 4\n\nSubtract 18 from both sides:\n\n- p = 4 - 18\n\n- p = -14\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\np = 14\n\nBut we already found that p should be 22, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option B: 18 = p \u2212 4; 22.\n\nJust to double-check, let's plug p = 22 back into the original equation:\n\n18 = 22 - 4\n\n18 = 18\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 18 = p \u2212 4; 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
