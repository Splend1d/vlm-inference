Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here that refers to some Congressional testimony from 1865 by Colonel Samuel Thomas about the treatment of African Americans after the Civil War. It sounds like it's talking about how even after emancipation, white people still didn't see African Americans as having any rights and treated them poorly in various ways. It mentions that whites felt they had a natural right over blacks and that they could treat them however they wanted without any moral qualms.\n\nNow, the question is asking which factor Alexander Hamilton believed was a source for the problems described in this excerpt from Federalist #15. So, I need to connect this post-Civil War issue of racial inequality and discrimination to something that Hamilton was concerned about in the Federalist Papers, specifically Federalist #15.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Federalist #15 is about. I remember that the Federalist Papers were a series of essays written by Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to persuade New Yorkers to ratify the new Constitution. Federalist #15 is part of the early essays where Hamilton lays out the problems with the existing government under the Articles of Confederation and argues for the need for a stronger central government.\n\nSo, in Federalist #15, Hamilton discusses the inadequacies of the Articles of Confederation and how they lead to various problems in the young nation. He talks about how the lack of power in the central government prevents it from addressing national issues effectively.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Economic class divisions among the American people that prevented them from forging a unified vision.\n\nB. A failure of American policy-makers to abandon mercantilist principles and to embrace a laissez-faire approach to trade.\n\nC. A weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\nD. An unhealthy obsession among the American people with religion and individual salvation, at the expense of interest in solving practical national problems.\n\nI need to think about which of these Hamilton would have identified as a problem in Federalist #15.\n\nOption A mentions economic class divisions. While class divisions may have existed, I don't recall Hamilton focusing on that particular issue in Federalist #15. His main concern in that essay was the structural weaknesses of the government.\n\nOption B talks about a failure to abandon mercantilist principles and embrace laissez-faire trade. Again, in Federalist #15, Hamilton's focus was on the governmental structure rather than specific economic policies.\n\nOption C states that the central government was too weak to address pressing issues. This sounds familiar. In Federalist #15, Hamilton does argue that the government under the Articles of Confederation lacked the necessary power to deal with national problems effectively.\n\nOption D mentions an unhealthy obsession with religion and individual salvation. I don't think Hamilton brought up this point in Federalist #15. His concern was more about political and governmental issues.\n\nSo, based on my recall, option C seems to be the most accurate. Hamilton believed that a weak central government was a source of problems, and this connects to the issue in the excerpt where the treatment of African Americans wasn't being adequately addressed by the government.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check this. Maybe I'm misremembering Federalist #15. Let me try to recall some key points.\n\nIn Federalist #15, Hamilton starts by acknowledging that some people believe the current confederation is sufficient and just needs some minor revisions. However, he argues that this is a mistaken view and that the confederation is fundamentally flawed because it lacks the necessary energy and resources to manage the affairs of the nation properly.\n\nHe gives examples of how the government's inability to enforce its laws and regulations leads to chaos and dysfunction. For instance, he mentions that the government can't reliably collect taxes, regulate trade, or defend the country effectively.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Hamilton's primary concern was the weakness of the central government, which aligns with option C.\n\nNow, connecting this back to the excerpt about the treatment of African Americans, it seems that even after emancipation, there were systemic issues and prejudices that weren't being addressed properly by the government. Perhaps Hamilton would argue that a stronger central government, as he proposed, would be better equipped to enforce laws and protections for all citizens, including African Americans.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the other options could be considered, but based on what I recall, option C seems the most directly related to Hamilton's arguments in Federalist #15.\n\nI should also consider whether any of the other options might be plausible. For example, option A about economic class divisions\u2014while class divisions may have played a role in racial issues, it doesn't seem directly related to Hamilton's focus in Federalist #15.\n\nOption B about economic policies seems more related to Hamilton's views on finance and trade, but again, not directly tied to the specific problems he outlines in Federalist #15.\n\nOption D about religion doesn't seem relevant to the governmental structure discussions in Federalist #15.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C: a weak central government without the powers to address pressing issues.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
