                    "text": "So I've got this question here about sound waves moving from one medium to another, specifically into a denser medium. It's asking which of the properties doesn't change except for one option. The properties listed are velocity, intensity, frequency, and wavelength. I need to figure out which one remains the same when sound moves into a denser medium.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how sound behaves when it transitions from one medium to another. I know that sound waves can change their speed, intensity, and wavelength when they move from one medium to another, but what about frequency?\n\nLet me think about frequency. Frequency is the number of wave cycles per unit time, and it's determined by the source of the sound. So, regardless of the medium, the frequency should remain the same because the source is what dictates how fast the waves are produced. So, perhaps frequency doesn't change when sound moves into a denser medium.\n\nNow, what about velocity? I recall that the speed of sound is different in different media. Generally, sound travels faster in denser media, like from air into water. So, if the medium becomes denser, the velocity of sound should increase.\n\nIntensity is related to the energy of the sound wave and how it's transmitted through the medium. When sound moves from one medium to another, there can be reflections and transmissions at the boundary, which affect the intensity of the sound in the second medium. So, intensity can change.\n\nWavelength is related to the speed and frequency of the wave by the equation: velocity equals frequency times wavelength (v = f\u03bb). Since frequency remains the same and velocity changes, wavelength must also change to keep the equation balanced.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Velocity changes when entering a denser medium.\n\n- Intensity can change due to transmission and reflection at the boundary.\n\n- Frequency remains the same because it's determined by the source.\n\n- Wavelength changes because it's dependent on velocity and frequency.\n\nTherefore, the property that does not change when sound enters a denser medium is frequency.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. velocity\n\nB. intensity\n\nC. frequency\n\nD. wavelength\n\nThe question says \"all of the following changes EXCEPT,\" so it's asking for the one that doesn't change. Based on my reasoning, that should be frequency, which is option C.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider each option:\n\nA. velocity: changes, as sound travels faster in denser media.\n\nB. intensity: can change due to transmission properties at the boundary.\n\nC. frequency: remains the same, as it's source-dependent.\n\nD. wavelength: changes because v = f\u03bb, and v changes while f remains constant.\n\nYes, so frequency is the one that doesn't change.\n\nI think the answer is C. frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
