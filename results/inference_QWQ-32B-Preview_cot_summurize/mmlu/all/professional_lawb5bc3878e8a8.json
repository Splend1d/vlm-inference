The farmer's tract was located next to an adjacent 300-acre ranch to the east. Immediately to the west of the farmer's parcel was a 100-acre tract. The farmer subdivided his property into two 10-acre parcels:Parcel 1 was the northern half and bordered along the major boulevard; Parcel 2 was the southern sector and abutted a river to the south. In March 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel ito a man by warranty deed. No encumbrances were mentioned in the deed. Then in September 1997, the farmer conveyed Parcel 2 by warranty deed to a woman. Both the man and the woman promptly recorded their deeds with the County Recorder's Office. In 1965, the farmer constructed a driveway from what is now Parcel 2, extending over Parcel 1, where it connected with the major boulevard. This driveway lies across what is now Parcel 1 and was used continuously by the farmer until 1997 when he conveyed his property in parcels to the man and the woman. When the woman took possession of Parcel 2, she immediately began to use the drive way across Parcel 1. Thereafter, the man requested that the woman cease to use the driveway over Parcel 1. After the woman refused, the man brought an appropriate action to enjoin the woman from using the driveway. In this action, the man will\n\nA. win, because his deed antedated the woman's deed.\nB. win, because no encumbrances were mentioned in his deed.\nC. lose, because the woman has an easement by necessity.\nD. lose, because the woman has an express easement.\n"

                    "text": "So here's this scenario about a farmer who owned a 20-acre tract of land, right? It's right next to a big road that goes east to west, and it's bordered by a big ranch on the east and another tract on the west. The farmer divided his land into two 10-acre parcels: Parcel 1 is the northern half, touching the major boulevard, and Parcel 2 is the southern half, next to a river.\n\nIn March 1997, he sold Parcel 1 to a man with a warranty deed, and in September 1997, he sold Parcel 2 to a woman, also with a warranty deed. Both of them recorded their deeds right away.\n\nBack in 1965, the farmer built a driveway from what's now Parcel 2, crossing over Parcel 1 to connect to the major boulevard. So, the driveway goes from Parcel 2, across Parcel 1, to the road.\n\nThe farmer used this driveway until 1997 when he sold both parcels. After the woman took possession of Parcel 2, she started using the driveway across Parcel 1. Then, the man who owns Parcel 1 asked her to stop using the driveway, but she refused. So, the man is suing to stop her from using the driveway.\n\nWe need to figure out who will win this lawsuit. The options are:\n\nA. The man will win because his deed is older than the woman's.\n\nB. The man will win because there were no encumbrances mentioned in his deed.\n\nC. The woman will win because she has an easement by necessity.\n\nD. The woman will win because she has an express easement.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the man bought Parcel 1 in March 1997, and the woman bought Parcel 2 in September 1997. So, the man's deed is older. But does that matter?\n\nIn real estate, the general rule is that the first buyer to record their deed gets priority, but in this case, both recorded their deeds promptly, so that might not be the issue here.\n\nOption A says the man will win because his deed antedates the woman's deed. Antedate means it's earlier in time. So, his deed is older. But is that relevant to the use of the driveway?\n\nWell, maybe, but we need to look deeper.\n\nOption B says the man will win because no encumbrances were mentioned in his deed. An encumbrance is like a claim or a right on the property that's not the owner's. So, if there was an easement or something, it would be an encumbrance.\n\nBut the problem is, the driveway was already there, built by the farmer in 1965, and it was used continuously until 1997. So, even though it's not mentioned in the deed, maybe there's still an easement.\n\nOption C says the woman will win because she has an easement by necessity. An easement by necessity is when there's a legal necessity to use another's land to access your own property. For example, if your property is landlocked and the only way to get to your property is through someone else's land, you might have an easement by necessity.\n\nIn this case, Parcel 2 is next to a river to the south, and the only way to get to the major boulevard is through Parcel 1. So, does the woman have an easement by necessity?\n\nWell, it seems like she does because her parcel doesn't have direct access to the boulevard; she has to go through Parcel 1.\n\nOption D says the woman will win because she has an express easement. An express easement is one that is explicitly granted in a deed or other written document.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no mention of any express easement in the woman's deed. So, it's unlikely that she has an express easement.\n\nWait, but the farmer built the driveway and used it continuously until 1997. Maybe there's an implied easement.\n\nAn implied easement is one that is inferred by the court based on the circumstances, like prior use.\n\nIn this case, the driveway was built in 1965 and used until 1997. So, when the farmer sold the parcels, maybe an implied easement was created for the continued use of the driveway.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the woman started using the driveway immediately after taking possession, and the man is trying to stop her.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the options again.\n\nOption A: Man wins because his deed is older. But in terms of easements, the date of the deed might not be directly relevant.\n\nOption B: Man wins because no encumbrances were mentioned in his deed. But if there's an easement by necessity or implied easement, that could be an encumbrance not mentioned in the deed.\n\nOption C: Woman wins because of easement by necessity. This seems plausible because her parcel doesn't have direct access to the boulevard.\n\nOption D: Woman wins because of an express easement. But there's no mention of an express easement in the deed.\n\nSo, between C and D, C seems more likely.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it.\n\nLet me think about easements in general.\n\nThere are different types of easements:\n\n1. Easement by necessity: When there's no other access to a property.\n\n2. Easement by prescription: Similar to adverse possession, where continuous use over a certain period creates an easement.\n\n3. Implied easement: Based on prior use or the intention of the parties.\n\n4. Express easement: Specifically granted in a deed.\n\nIn this case, easement by necessity seems applicable because Parcel 2 doesn't have direct access to the boulevard.\n\nBut perhaps there's also an implied easement based on the continuous use of the driveway by the farmer.\n\nHowever, easement by necessity is probably the strongest argument for the woman.\n\nSo, if she has an easement by necessity, she has a right to use the driveway, and the man can't stop her.\n\nTherefore, the man won't win; the woman will.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Man wins because his deed is older. Doesn't seem directly relevant to the easement issue.\n\nOption B: Man wins because no encumbrances were mentioned in his deed. But if there's an easement by necessity, that's an encumbrance that exists regardless of whether it's mentioned in the deed.\n\nOption C: Woman wins because she has an easement by necessity. This seems correct.\n\nOption D: Woman wins because she has an express easement. But there's no mention of an express easement in the deed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\nThe woman will win because she has an easement by necessity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
