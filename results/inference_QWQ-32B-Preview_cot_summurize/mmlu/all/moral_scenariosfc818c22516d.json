                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person buried a puppy because it was stillborn. So, the puppy was born dead, and the person decided to bury it. In many cultures and according to common practices, burying a deceased pet is a respectful way to handle the remains. It's a way to give the pet a proper resting place and can be part of the grieving process for the owner. There's nothing inherently wrong with this action; in fact, it's often considered a caring thing to do.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person poured vegetable oil into a cooker. Without more context, this seems like a normal action, perhaps part of cooking a meal. Cookers often use oil for frying or other cooking methods, so pouring oil into a cooker is likely a standard practice in the kitchen. There's nothing morally wrong with this action unless there are specific circumstances that make it harmful or inappropriate, but based on the information given, it appears to be a neutral or even positive action in the context of preparing food.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither action seems to be clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
