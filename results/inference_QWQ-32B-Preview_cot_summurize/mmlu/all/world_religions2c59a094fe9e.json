The phrase \"Guru-Panth\" is mentioned, and I have to choose what it means from the options: Community, Scripture, Worship, or Apprenticeship.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Sikhism. Sikhism is a religion that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent in the 15th century. It's based on the teachings of Guru Nanak and ten successive Sikh gurus.\n\nNow, focusing on \"Guru-Panth.\" I think \"Guru\" is a familiar term; it generally means teacher or spiritual guide. In Sikhism, the term \"Guru\" is significant because it refers to the lineage of the ten human gurus and, after the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, to the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the holy scripture.\n\nSo, \"Panth\" must be another component of this phrase. I believe \"Panth\" refers to the panth, which in Sikhism is the community of all Sikhs. It's like the collective body of believers.\n\nPutting these together, \"Guru-Panth\" would likely refer to the concept of the Guru being embodied in the community of Sikhs. This makes sense because after the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, he instituted the Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal guru, and the community collectively interprets and upholds the teachings.\n\nSo, if I had to choose from the options, \"Community\" seems the most appropriate. It's not referring to the scripture itself, which is the Guru Granth Sahib, but rather to the community that follows and upholds the teachings.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any connection between \"Panth\" and worship or apprenticeship? Well, worship is a part of what the community does, but it's not the definition of Guru-Panth. Apprenticeship might relate to learning from a guru, but it doesn't capture the essence of the community as the guru.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that the answer is A. Community.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
