                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain.\n\nFirst, recall that an integral domain is a commutative ring with unity (1 \u2260 0) and no zero divisors. So, if R is an integral domain, it has no zero divisors.\n\nNow, consider R[x], the ring of polynomials with coefficients in R. We need to check if R[x] also has no zero divisors.\n\nSuppose f(x) and g(x) are non-zero polynomials in R[x]. Let's say f(x) has degree m and g(x) has degree n. The leading coefficient of f(x) is a_m and of g(x) is b_n, both non-zero since they are the highest degree coefficients of non-zero polynomials.\n\nThe product f(x)g(x) will have a leading term a_m b_n x^{m+n}. Since R is an integral domain, and a_m and b_n are non-zero, their product a_m b_n is also non-zero. Therefore, the leading term of f(x)g(x) is non-zero, which means f(x)g(x) is not the zero polynomial.\n\nHence, R[x] has no zero divisors if R is an integral domain. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg(f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).\n\nThis statement seems intuitive at first glance, but we need to verify it carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s denote deg f(x) = m and deg g(x) = n.\n\nIn general, when multiplying two polynomials, the degree of the product should be the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials, provided that the leading coefficients do not multiply to zero.\n\nHowever, if R is a ring that has zero divisors, it's possible that the leading coefficients of f(x) and g(x) are zero divisors in R. In that case, their product could be zero, which would make the leading term of f(x)g(x) zero.\n\nIf the leading term is zero, then the degree of f(x)g(x) would be less than m + n.\n\nTherefore, in rings with zero divisors, it's possible that deg(f(x)g(x)) < deg f(x) + deg g(x).\n\nTo illustrate, consider R = Z_6, the integers modulo 6, which has zero divisors (e.g., 2 and 3 are zero divisors since 2*3 = 0 mod 6).\n\nLet f(x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = 3x + 1 in Z_6[x].\n\nThen, f(x)g(x) = (2x + 1)(3x + 1) = 6x^2 + (2*1 + 3*1)x + 1 = 0x^2 + 5x + 1 = 5x + 1 in Z_6[x].\n\nHere, deg f(x) = 1, deg g(x) = 1, but deg(f(x)g(x)) = 1, which is less than 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false in general for arbitrary rings R.\n\nHowever, if R is an integral domain, then R has no zero divisors, and the statement holds true because the leading coefficients' product is non-zero.\n\nBut since the statement says \"if R is a ring,\" which includes rings with zero divisors, the statement is not universally true.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
