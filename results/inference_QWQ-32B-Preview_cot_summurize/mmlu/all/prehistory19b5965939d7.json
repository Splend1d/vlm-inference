                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on South American history, but I think I can figure this out. So, the question is asking about one of the earliest kingdoms in South America and when it reached its height.\n\nFirst, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Moche; AD 400\n\nB. Wari; AD 100\n\nC. Inca; AD 200\n\nD. Maya; AD 400\n\nHmm, the Maya are actually from Mesoamerica, which is part of North America, not South America. So, I can probably eliminate option D.\n\nNow, between Moche, Wari, and Inca, which one is the earliest?\n\nI know that the Inca Empire was the largest empire in pre-Columbian America, but it was much later, around the 15th and 16th centuries. So, AD 200 seems way too early for the Inca. Maybe they're mentioning the beginning of the Inca civilization, but I think the height of the Inca Empire was much later. So, option C might not be correct.\n\nThat leaves Moche and Wari. I recall that the Moche culture was prominent in northern Peru from about AD 100 to 700. So, AD 400 would be within their flourishing period. The Wari culture, on the other hand, was around from about AD 500 to 1000, so AD 100 seems too early for them.\n\nWait, but the question says \"reaching its height at around _________.\" The Moche culture did reach its height around AD 400, and the Wari culture was around AD 500 to 1000, so AD 100 would be before their height.\n\nActually, I think I need to double-check the dates for Wari. I might be misremembering.\n\nLet me see: The Wari culture, also known as Huari, was a pre-Inca civilization that flourished from around AD 500 to 1000, and their influence spread across much of the Andean region. So, if their height was around AD 500 to 1000, then AD 100 would be before their peak.\n\nSimilarly, the Moche culture was prominent from about AD 100 to 700, with their height around AD 400.\n\nNow, considering that the question is about one of the earliest kingdoms in South America, the Moche would be earlier than the Wari.\n\nBut, I'm not entirely sure which one was the earliest. Maybe there was an even earlier civilization.\n\nWait, perhaps there's something more basic I should consider. Maybe the Incas weren't the earliest, but they were certainly not around in AD 200.\n\nAnd the Maya, as I thought earlier, are from Mesoamerica, which is part of North America, not South America.\n\nSo, between Moche and Wari, which is earlier? Moche started around AD 100, and Wari around AD 500. So, Moche is earlier.\n\nBut, I think there might be even earlier civilizations in South America. For example, the Norte Chico civilization, also known as Caral-Supe, which dates back to about 3000 BC to 1800 BC. That's way earlier, but I'm not sure if they had a kingdom structure.\n\nAnother early culture is the Chav\u00edn culture, around 900 BC to 200 BC. They had a significant influence in the Andean region.\n\nBut, looking at the options, neither Chav\u00edn nor Norte Chico are listed.\n\nSo, between Moche and Wari, Moche is earlier, starting around AD 100 and reaching its height around AD 400.\n\nThe Wari culture came later, around AD 500 to 1000.\n\nTherefore, the earliest kingdom among the options given would be the Moche, reaching its height around AD 400.\n\nBut, I should consider if there were other cultures that might have had kingdoms earlier than Moche.\n\nFor example, the Nazca culture was contemporaneous with the Moche, from around AD 100 to 700, but I'm not sure if they had a kingdom structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Chav\u00edn culture had some form of kingdom, but their society was more of a cultural horizon than a centralized kingdom.\n\nGiven that, the Moche culture seems like a strong candidate for one of the earliest kingdoms in South America, reaching its height around AD 400.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. Moche; AD 400.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
