                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this problem here about an unknown substance with some specific properties, and I need to figure out what type of bonding it most likely has based on those properties. The substance has a high melting point, is a poor conductor of electricity, doesn't dissolve in water, and I have to choose between ionic, nonpolar covalent, covalent network, or metallic bonding.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the characteristics of each type of bonding:\n\n1. **Ionic bonding**: This is between metals and nonmetals, where electrons are transferred from one atom to another, forming ions that are attracted to each other. Ionic compounds usually have high melting points because the electrostatic forces between ions are strong. They are good conductors of electricity when dissolved in water or melted because the ions are free to move. They also tend to dissolve in water because water is polar and can separate the ions.\n\n2. **Nonpolar covalent bonding**: This is when atoms share electrons equally, usually between nonmetals that are similar in electronegativity. These compounds typically have low melting points because the intermolecular forces are weak (like London dispersion forces). They are poor conductors of electricity and are usually insoluble in water because water is polar and doesn't interact well with nonpolar substances.\n\n3. **Covalent network bonding**: This involves a network of covalently bonded atoms, like in diamond or quartz. These substances have extremely high melting points because all the atoms are bonded together in a lattice. They are poor conductors of electricity because there are no free-moving electrons or ions. They are also generally insoluble in water.\n\n4. **Metallic bonding**: This is found in metals, where electrons are delocalized and shared among all the atoms. Metals have high melting points due to the strong metallic bonds. They are good conductors of electricity because the electrons can move freely. They are generally not soluble in water.\n\nNow, let's match these characteristics to the properties of the unknown substance:\n\n- **High melting point**: This suggests strong interatomic or intermolecular forces, which is consistent with ionic, covalent network, or metallic bonding.\n\n- **Poor conductor of electricity**: This rules out metallic bonding, as metals are good conductors. It also suggests that the substance doesn't have free-moving electrons or ions, which would be necessary for conductivity.\n\n- **Does not dissolve in water**: This suggests that the substance is nonpolar or has strong enough bonds that water cannot disrupt them. Ionic compounds often dissolve in water due to the polar nature of water, which can separate the ions.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Ionic bonding**: Ionic compounds usually have high melting points and dissolve in water, but this substance does not dissolve in water. That seems contradictory. Maybe there are some exceptions, like certain large ions that don't dissolve easily, but generally, ionic compounds do dissolve in water.\n\nB. **Nonpolar covalent bonding**: These compounds typically have low melting points, but the substance has a high melting point, which doesn't match.\n\nC. **Covalent network bonding**: This type of bonding results in very high melting points, poor conductivity, and insolubility in water, which matches all the given properties.\n\nD. **Metallic bonding**: Metals have high melting points and are good conductors of electricity, but the substance is a poor conductor, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBased on this analysis, the substance most likely contains **covalent network bonding**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
