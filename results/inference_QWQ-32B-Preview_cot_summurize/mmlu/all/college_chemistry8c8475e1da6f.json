                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options is a primary standard for standardizing bases. So, first things first, what's a primary standard? A primary standard is a substance that is pure, stable, and has a known composition, which makes it suitable for calibrating or standardizing solutions, especially in titrations.\n\nOkay, so among the options given:\n\nA. Ammonium hydroxide - That's a base, right? Ammonium hydroxide is NH4OH, which is a weak base. I don't think it's used as a primary standard for standardizing bases. Primary standards are usually acids or salts that can react with bases.\n\nB. Sulfuric acid - H2SO4, that's a strong acid. It's used in acid-base titrations, but as far as I know, it's not commonly used as a primary standard for standardizing bases. Usually, primary standards are solids that you can weigh accurately.\n\nC. Acetic acid - CH3COOH, that's another weak acid. It's a liquid, and while it can be used in titrations, it's not typically used as a primary standard for standardizing bases.\n\nD. Potassium hydrogen phthalate - That sounds like a salt. Potassium hydrogen phthalate, or KHP for short, is KHC8H4O4. I think this is a commonly used primary standard in acid-base titrations.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure. Let's recall that KHP is a solid, it's stable, and it has a known composition. It's often used to standardize bases like sodium hydroxide because it reacts with them in a known stoichiometric ratio.\n\nSo, if I'm trying to standardize a base, I would use a primary standard that is an acid or a salt that can react with the base in a known way. KHP is a monoprotic acid, meaning it donates one proton per molecule, so it's great for titrating bases.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAmmonium hydroxide is a base, so it wouldn't be used to standardize another base; it would be the titrant itself.\n\nSulfuric acid is an acid, but it's a liquid, and its concentration can be difficult to determine accurately because it's hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air, which can change its concentration.\n\nAcetic acid is also a liquid and can absorb moisture, plus it's a weak acid, which might make titrations less precise.\n\nTherefore, KHP seems to be the most appropriate choice here. It's a solid, it's stable, and it reacts completely with bases in a 1:1 ratio, making it ideal for standardizing base solutions.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Potassium hydrogen phthalate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
