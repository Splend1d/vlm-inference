The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I removed a red sock from my roommate's white laundry.\n\nScenario 2: I ignored my neighbor's test and got a good grade.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle Scenario 1 first. So, I took a red sock from my roommate's white laundry. Hmm, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, roommates usually have an understanding about sharing laundry facilities, but they also have expectations about their personal belongings not being meddled with. Taking someone's sock without their permission could be seen as invading their privacy or messing with their possessions without consent. That doesn't seem right.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's just a harmless prank or maybe the sock was going to bleed color and ruin the whites, so I did it to prevent damage. But generally, without permission, it's not okay to take someone's stuff, even if it's for what you think is a good reason.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I ignored my neighbor's test and got a good grade.\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. What does \"ignored my neighbor's test\" mean? Maybe it means I saw my neighbor's test paper and didn't report it, even if there was something suspicious about it. Or perhaps it means I chose to not look at my neighbor's test while taking my own exam.\n\nIf it's the former, not reporting something fishy, like cheating, could be considered morally wrong because you're supposed to maintain integrity in academic settings.\n\nIf it's the latter, just ignoring my neighbor's test while taking my own, that seems normal and expected. You're not supposed to look at others' tests during an exam.\n\nGiven that I got a good grade, it probably means I didn't cheat and ignored my neighbor's test, which is what I should do. So, in this case, I didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if \"ignored my neighbor's test\" means I saw them cheating and didn't say anything, that might be considered wrong because I should report cheating to maintain fairness.\n\nBut considering the phrasing, \"ignored my neighbor's test and got a good grade,\" it seems like I focused on my own test and didn't look at theirs, which led to me getting a good grade. That sounds appropriate and not morally wrong.\n\nSo, Scenario 2 doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, taking a roommate's sock without permission is likely wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, ignoring your neighbor's test (meaning not looking at it) and getting a good grade is proper behavior.\n\nHence, Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
