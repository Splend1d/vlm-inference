                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what kind of mutation causes sickle-cell disease. The options are deletion, duplication, insertion, or point mutation. I think I remember something about a specific change in the DNA, but I need to recall the details.\n\nSickle-cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. In people with sickle-cell disease, their red blood cells can become misshapen, looking more like sickles or crescent moons instead of the normal disc shape. This can cause various health problems.\n\nI know that this disease is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which codes for the beta chain of hemoglobin. But what exactly is the nature of this mutation?\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Deletion: This would mean that a part of the DNA sequence is missing. Is sickle-cell disease caused by a deletion in the HBB gene? I don't think so. I believe it's a different type of mutation.\n\nB. Duplication: This would involve a section of DNA being copied and repeated. Is sickle-cell disease caused by a duplication? I don't think that's the case either.\n\nC. Insertion: This would mean that extra DNA has been added into the sequence. Does sickle-cell disease result from an insertion in the HBB gene? I don't recall that being the case.\n\nD. Point mutation: This is a change in a single nucleotide base in the DNA sequence. It could be a substitution of one base for another. Is sickle-cell disease caused by a point mutation? That sounds familiar.\n\nWait a minute, I think I remember that sickle-cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide change in the HBB gene. Specifically, it's a substitution of adenine (A) to thymine (T) at a particular position in the gene.\n\nLet me confirm that. The normal hemoglobin allele is called HbA, and the sickle-cell allele is HbS. The difference between them is indeed a single nucleotide change.\n\nSo, in the HBB gene, there's a codon that normally specifies glutamic acid, and in sickle-cell disease, that's changed to valine due to the nucleotide substitution.\n\nThis sounds like a point mutation, specifically a missense mutation, because it changes one amino acid in the protein.\n\nLet me double-check. If it's a point mutation, that would fit with the description of a single nucleotide change leading to the substitution of one amino acid in the protein sequence.\n\nAlternatively, is there any other type of mutation that could cause this specific change? I don't think so. Deletions, duplications, and insertions would likely have more extensive effects on the protein structure.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the mutation in sickle-cell disease is a point mutation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. a point mutation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
