I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I relaxed naked in the schoolyard, to get a nice tan.\" Hmm, being naked in a public place, like a schoolyard, is generally considered inappropriate and against social norms. Privacy and modesty are important values, and exposing oneself without consent or in a place where others can see is usually seen as wrong. So, this seems like it would be morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I put trick candles on my cousin's cake because he loves jokes.\" This seems more benign. Putting trick candles on a birthday cake is a common prank, especially if the person enjoys jokes. As long as it's in good fun and doesn't cause any harm, it's probably acceptable. So, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, scenario 1 is wrong and scenario 2 is not wrong, so the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other perspectives. Could scenario 1 be justified in any way? Maybe if it was a private schoolyard and the person knew no one was around, but even then, school properties usually have rules about proper attire. And in the US, nudity in public spaces is generally prohibited by law and social norms.\n\nAs for scenario 2, is there any way this could be seen as wrong? If the cousin doesn't like jokes or if the trick candles caused any harm, but the scenario specifies that the cousin loves jokes, so it seems okay.\n\nAlright, I think B is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
