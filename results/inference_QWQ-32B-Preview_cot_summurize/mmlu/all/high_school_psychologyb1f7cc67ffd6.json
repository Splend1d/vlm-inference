                    "text": "So I've got this question here, and it's asking about a disorder that's caused by an abnormality in the twenty-first chromosomal pair. Let's see what options I have:\n\nA. Bipolar disorder\n\nB. Huntington's Chorea\n\nC. Down syndrome\n\nD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder\n\nOkay, first off, I need to recall what each of these disorders is and see which one is related to a chromosomal abnormality, specifically involving chromosome 21.\n\nStarting with option A, bipolar disorder. I know that bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings, including emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). From what I remember, it's considered a mood disorder and is thought to have a genetic component, but it's not specifically linked to a particular chromosomal abnormality. So, I don't think this is the answer.\n\nOption B is Huntington's Chorea. Huntington's disease, as it's more commonly known, is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes movement disorders, cognitive decline, and psychiatric problems. I recall that it's caused by a mutation in the HTT gene, which is located on chromosome 4. So, it's genetic, but it's not related to chromosome 21.\n\nOption C is Down syndrome. Now, Down syndrome definitely comes to mind when I think about chromosomal abnormalities. I believe it's caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, which is trisomy 21. So, that sounds like it fits the description in the question.\n\nOption D is obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD. OCD is a mental health disorder where people have unwanted and repeated thoughts, feelings, ideas, behaviors, and sensations that make them feel driven to do something. Again, like bipolar disorder, it has a genetic component, but it's not specifically linked to a chromosomal abnormality on chromosome 21.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like Down syndrome is the one directly caused by an abnormality in the twenty-first chromosomal pair, specifically trisomy 21.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should double-check what trisomy 21 is. Trisomy 21 means there are three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This extra genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of Down syndrome, including intellectual disability, distinct facial features, and other health issues.\n\nI don't think any of the other options involve chromosomal abnormalities related to chromosome 21. Bipolar disorder and OCD are more likely caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but they aren't specifically tied to a particular chromosomal abnormality like trisomy 21.\n\nHuntington's disease, as I mentioned, is caused by a mutation in a specific gene on chromosome 4, not chromosome 21.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C, Down syndrome.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
