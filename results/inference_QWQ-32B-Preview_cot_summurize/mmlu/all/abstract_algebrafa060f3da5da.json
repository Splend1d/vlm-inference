                    "text": "So I have these two statements to evaluate, and I need to determine if they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** Any set of two vectors in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) is linearly independent.\n\nHmm, linear independence means that neither vector is a scalar multiple of the other. In \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\), vectors can be visualized as arrows in a plane. If two vectors are not pointing in the same direction or exactly opposite directions, they should be linearly independent.\n\nBut wait, if I have two vectors that are scalar multiples of each other, they are linearly dependent. For example, if I have vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and vector \\( \\mathbf{w} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\), then \\( \\mathbf{w} = 2\\mathbf{v} \\), so they are linearly dependent.\n\nSo, not any set of two vectors in \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) is linearly independent; only those that are not scalar multiples of each other are. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If \\( V = \\text{span}(\\mathbf{v}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{v}_k) \\) and \\( \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{v}_k\\} \\) are linearly independent, then \\( \\dim(V) = k \\).\n\nOkay, the dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space. A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space.\n\nHere, it's given that \\( V \\) is the span of \\( \\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{v}_k\\} \\) and that these vectors are linearly independent. So, this set is a basis for \\( V \\), and hence the dimension of \\( V \\) should be \\( k \\).\n\nThat seems correct. So, Statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
