The equation given is:\n\n3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the equation by expanding any parentheses and combining like terms.\n\nStarting with the parentheses:\n\n-4(x - 2) = -4*x + (-4)*(-2) = -4x + 8\n\nSo, substituting back into the equation:\n\n3x - 4x + 8 + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n3x - 4x + 6x = (3 - 4 + 6)x = 5x\n\nAnd 8 - 8 = 0\n\nSo, the equation simplifies to:\n\n5x = 0\n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 0 / 5\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, the answer is B. 0\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n3x - 4(x - 2) + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nExpand the parentheses:\n\n3x - 4x + 8 + 6x - 8 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(3x - 4x + 6x) + (8 - 8) = 0\n\nThat's (5x) + (0) = 0\n\nSo, 5x = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 0\n\nYes, that seems correct. The answer is B. 0\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]"
