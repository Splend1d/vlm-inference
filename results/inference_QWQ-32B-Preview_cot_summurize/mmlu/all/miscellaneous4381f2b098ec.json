                    "text": "Let's see which one of these words is an adverb. I know that adverbs usually describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, and they often tell us how something is done. For example, \"she ran quickly\" \u2013 here, \"quickly\" is an adverb describing how she ran.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. hurried \u2013 This seems like an adjective or a verb. If it's a verb, it could be the past tense of \"hurry.\" As an adjective, it would describe someone who is in a hurry. Not sure if it's an adverb.\n\nB. fast \u2013 This can be both an adjective and an adverb. As an adjective, you might say \"a fast car,\" meaning the car is quick. As an adverb, \"he ran fast,\" meaning he ran quickly. So, it can function as an adverb.\n\nC. speedy \u2013 This also seems like an adjective, describing something that is quick or rapid. I don't think it's typically used as an adverb.\n\nD. quickly \u2013 This looks like an adverb. It directly describes how an action is performed, like \"she spoke quickly.\"\n\nSo, between these options, both \"fast\" and \"quickly\" can function as adverbs. However, \"fast\" is versatile and can be used as both an adjective and an adverb, while \"quickly\" is more distinctly an adverb.\n\nBut since the question is to pick one, and \"quickly\" is more clearly an adverb, I think D. quickly is the best answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Let's consider each option again.\n\nA. hurried \u2013 As I thought, it's likely a verb or an adjective, not an adverb.\n\nB. fast \u2013 It can be both an adjective and an adverb, so it's correct, but perhaps not the most distinct adverb.\n\nC. speedy \u2013 Again, seems like an adjective: \"a speedy delivery.\" Not typically used as an adverb.\n\nD. quickly \u2013 Definitely an adverb: \"speaks quickly.\"\n\nSo, yes, D. quickly is the clear adverb among these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
