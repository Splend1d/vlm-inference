                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the algebraic representation of the fitted regression line. There are four options, and I need to pick the one that best describes it. Let's see:\n\nOption A: \\(\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t + \\hat{u}_t\\)\n\nOption B: \\(\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t\\)\n\nOption C: \\(\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t + u_t\\)\n\nOption D: \\(y_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t + \\hat{u}_t\\)\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the fitted regression line is. In simple linear regression, we have a dependent variable \\(y\\) and an independent variable \\(x\\), and we try to fit a line that best predicts \\(y\\) based on \\(x\\). The general form of the population regression line is:\n\n\\(y_t = \\alpha + \\beta x_t + u_t\\)\n\nHere, \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta\\) is the slope, and \\(u_t\\) is the error term, which accounts for the variation in \\(y\\) that isn't explained by \\(x\\).\n\nBut in practice, we don't know the true values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), so we estimate them from the data. The estimated values are \\(\\hat{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\), and the fitted regression line is:\n\n\\(\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t\\)\n\nThis is the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. The residual \\(\\hat{u}_t\\) is the difference between the actual \\(y_t\\) and the fitted \\(\\hat{y}_t\\):\n\n\\(\\hat{u}_t = y_t - \\hat{y}_t\\)\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A includes the residual \\(\\hat{u}_t\\) in the fitted equation, which doesn't make sense because the fitted value \\(\\hat{y}_t\\) is supposed to be the predicted value without the error.\n\nOption B is \\(\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t\\), which matches what I just recalled about the fitted regression line.\n\nOption C has the residual term \\(u_t\\) in the fitted equation, but \\(u_t\\) is the theoretical error term, not the estimated residual.\n\nOption D is the actual \\(y_t\\) expressed in terms of the estimated coefficients and the residual, which is correct, but it's not the fitted regression line itself.\n\nTherefore, it seems like Option B is the correct choice. The fitted regression line is simply the predicted values based on the estimated coefficients, without the error term.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Sometimes textbooks include the residual in the fitted equation, but I think that's misleading. The fitted value is the part that's explained by the model, and the residual is the unexplained part.\n\nLet me look up a reference to confirm. According to my econometrics textbook, the fitted regression line is indeed \\(\\hat{y}_t = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_t\\), and the residual is \\(\\hat{u}_t = y_t - \\hat{y}_t\\).\n\nSo, yes, Option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
