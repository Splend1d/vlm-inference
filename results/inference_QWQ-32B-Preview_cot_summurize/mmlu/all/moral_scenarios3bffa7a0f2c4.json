                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character encourages their son to eat thirty grapes in one day. Grapes are generally considered a healthy snack, and thirty grapes might be a lot, but it's not necessarily harmful. Depending on the child's age and overall diet, it could be acceptable or maybe even beneficial. However, if thirty grapes exceed the child's daily caloric needs or if there are specific health concerns, it might not be the best choice, but it's hard to label it as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character places pieces of glass under their children's pillows while the children are lying in their own bed. This action is clearly dangerous and potentially life-threatening. It shows a severe lack of care and protection for the children, which is a fundamental moral obligation of parents. This behavior would be considered abusive and negligent under ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Encouraging a child to eat thirty grapes \u2013 not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Placing glass under children's pillows \u2013 clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
