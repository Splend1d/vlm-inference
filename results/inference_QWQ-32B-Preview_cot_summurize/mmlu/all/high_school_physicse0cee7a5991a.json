                    "text": "So I've got this question here about gravity and masses. Let's see what it's asking. We have two small objects, and we're supposed to figure out what happens to the force of gravitational attraction between them if we double the mass of each object and also double the distance between their centers. The options are that the force gets doubled, quadrupled, halved, or remains the same.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the formula for gravitational force. I think it's something like F equals G times m1 times m2 over r squared, where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. Yeah, that sounds right. So, F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2.\n\nNow, the question says that the mass of each object is doubled. So, m1 becomes 2*m1 and m2 becomes 2*m2. Also, the distance between their centers is doubled, so r becomes 2*r.\n\nLet me plug these new values into the formula and see what happens.\n\nSo, the new force F' would be:\n\nF' = G * (2*m1) * (2*m2) / (2*r)^2\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerator:\n\n(2*m1) * (2*m2) = 4 * m1 * m2\n\nAnd the denominator:\n\n(2*r)^2 = 4 * r^2\n\nSo, F' = G * 4 * m1 * m2 / (4 * r^2)\n\nNow, the 4 in the numerator and the 4 in the denominator cancel each other out, so:\n\nF' = G * m1 * m2 / r^2\n\nWait a minute, that's the original formula for F. So, F' = F.\n\nDoes that mean the force remains the same? But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nF' = G * (2*m1) * (2*m2) / (2*r)^2\n\n= G * 4 * m1 * m2 / (4 * r^2)\n\n= (4/4) * G * m1 * m2 / r^2\n\n= 1 * G * m1 * m2 / r^2\n\n= F\n\nYes, it seems like the force remains the same. So, the answer should be D. It remains the same.\n\nBut wait, is there any other way to look at this? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about it differently.\n\nGravitational force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. So, if both masses are doubled, that would multiply the force by 2 * 2 = 4. But if the distance is doubled, that would divide the force by 2 squared, which is 4. So, 4 divided by 4 is 1, meaning the force doesn't change.\n\nYeah, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the exponents. In the formula, the masses are in the numerator with an exponent of 1 each, and the distance is in the denominator with an exponent of 2.\n\nSo, if m1 and m2 are both multiplied by 2, that's 2^1 * 2^1 = 2^2 = 4.\n\nAnd if r is multiplied by 2, that's 2^2 = 4 in the denominator.\n\nSo, overall, it's 4 in the numerator and 4 in the denominator, which cancels out to 1.\n\nTherefore, the force remains the same.\n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways now. So, the answer should be D. It remains the same.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this. For example, is there anything about the objects being \"small\" that might change things? Probably not, since the formula applies to point masses or spherically symmetric objects, and the problem says they're small, so we can treat them as point masses.\n\nAlso, is there any relativistic effect or anything like that that might come into play? I don't think so, because gravitational force is well described by Newton's law in most everyday situations, and since the objects are small, they probably don't have extreme masses or speeds.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that the force remains the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
