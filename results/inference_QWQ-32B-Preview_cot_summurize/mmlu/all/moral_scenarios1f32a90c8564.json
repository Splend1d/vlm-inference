Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nLet's look at each scenario:\n\nScenario 1: \"I used shampoo to clean the dishes.\"\n\nUsing shampoo to clean dishes is not morally wrong; it's just not the usual or effective way to clean dishes. Shampoo is meant for cleaning hair, not dishes. So, it's more of a practical mistake than a moral wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I knew my hard-working husband loved sports, so I turned on the ballgame when we sat down to watch TV.\"\n\nThis seems like a thoughtful act. You're considering your husband's interests and making an effort to enjoy something together. There's nothing morally wrong with that.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves a clear moral wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
