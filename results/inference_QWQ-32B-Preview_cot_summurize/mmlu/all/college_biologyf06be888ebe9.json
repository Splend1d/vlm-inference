                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what a frameshift mutation is. The question says: \"A frameshift mutation is created when\" and gives four options. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nOption A: \"telomeric sequences are removed from DNA.\" Hmm, telomeres are the ends of chromosomes, and they have repeating sequences. Removing them might affect chromosome stability, but is that a frameshift mutation? I don't think so. Frameshift mutations are about changing the reading frame of the genetic code, which affects how the sequence is translated into protein. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B: \"a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one.\" This sounds like a point mutation, specifically a missense mutation. In this case, one nucleotide is changed, which can change one amino acid in the protein. But in a frameshift mutation, the whole reading frame is shifted, which affects all the codons following the mutation. So, this doesn't seem to be the correct definition.\n\nOption C: \"a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene.\" Okay, insertion or deletion of a base pair. That sounds familiar. Insertions and deletions can cause the reading frame to shift because the sequence is no longer read in the correct groups of three nucleotides. For example, if you add one nucleotide, everything after that is read in a new frame, which can change all the codons and lead to completely different amino acids being incorporated into the protein. That sounds like a frameshift mutation.\n\nOption D: \"a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation.\" This sounds like a nonsense mutation, where a codon is changed to a stop codon, causing translation to end prematurely. While this can be a result of a mutation, it's not specifically a frameshift mutation. Frameshifts can lead to premature stop codons, but they're not the same thing.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option C seems to be the most accurate description of a frameshift mutation. It's about inserting or deleting a base pair, which shifts the reading frame and affects the entire sequence downstream.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Is there any scenario where option D could be considered a frameshift mutation? Well, a frameshift could lead to a premature stop codon, but the frameshift itself is the insertion or deletion that causes the reading frame to shift. The premature stop is a consequence, not the frameshift itself. So, I think C is still the best answer.\n\nAlso, option A about telomeric sequences doesn't seem relevant to frameshift mutations, as telomeres are at the ends of chromosomes and frameshifts occur within genes.\n\nOption B is more about point mutations that change a single amino acid, which is different from frameshift mutations that affect multiple amino acids.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C: a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
