                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Marx's views on religion. So, Marx is famous for his critique of religion, and he had some pretty strong opinions about it. The question is asking when Marx proclaimed that religion would disappear based on the options provided.\n\nOption A says: \"a new trend of moral individualism became established.\" Hmm, Marx did talk about individualism, but I'm not sure if he directly linked the disappearance of religion to moral individualism. He was more focused on the economic and social structures shaping religion.\n\nOption B: \"a socialist revolution removed the need for capitalist ideology.\" This seems more aligned with Marx's thoughts. He saw religion as a tool of oppression, used by the ruling classes to keep the working class submissive. So, if there was a socialist revolution that dismantled capitalism, perhaps religion wouldn't serve that purpose anymore.\n\nOption C: \"church attendance dropped below 15%.\" This seems like a specific statistic, but I don't recall Marx setting any numerical thresholds for the disappearance of religion. His analysis was more theoretical and less about specific metrics.\n\nOption D: \"people came to believe more in science and technology.\" Again, Marx did value science and technology, but I don't think he specifically stated that religion would disappear when people believed more in science and technology.\n\nLet me think about this. Marx famously described religion as the \"opium of the people,\" meaning that it was a way to dull the pain of oppression and exploitation under capitalism. He believed that once the material conditions that gave rise to religion were eliminated, religion would cease to be necessary.\n\nSo, in the context of Marx's ideas, a socialist revolution that overturns capitalism and establishes a classless society would remove the need for religion as a means of coping with oppression. Therefore, option B seems to be the most accurate.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Moral individualism. Marx was critical of individualism, seeing it as a product of capitalist society. However, I don't think he specifically linked the end of religion to the establishment of moral individualism.\n\nOption C: Church attendance dropping below 15%. This seems too arbitrary. Marx wasn't concerned with attendance statistics; he was more interested in the role religion played in society and its relationship to the economic base.\n\nOption D: People believing more in science and technology. While Marx valued science and technology as tools for advancing society, I don't think he saw the shift to science as the direct cause for the disappearance of religion.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: a socialist revolution removed the need for capitalist ideology. This aligns with Marx's broader theory that religion is a superstructural element that reflects the economic base, and once that base changes, so will the superstructure, including religion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
