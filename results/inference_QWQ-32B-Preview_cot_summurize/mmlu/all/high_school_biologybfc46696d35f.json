Genetic variation among individuals\n\nB. Variation among individuals caused by environmental factors\n\nC. Sexual reproduction\n\nD. B and C only\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Natural selection is the process where organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. So, for natural selection to work, there needs to be some differences among individuals that affect their survival and reproduction.\n\nOption A is genetic variation among individuals. This makes sense because genetic variation is the raw material for evolution. If there's no genetic differences, there's nothing for natural selection to act on. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption B is variation caused by environmental factors. Now, environmental variations can cause differences among individuals, but these are not heritable. Meaning, if an individual grows taller because of better nutrition, that tallness might not be passed on to its offspring if they don't have the same nutrition. So, while environmental variation can affect an individual's phenotype, it doesn't provide the heritable basis that natural selection needs to cause evolutionary change.\n\nOption C is sexual reproduction. While sexual reproduction is a powerful mechanism for generating genetic variation, it's not the only way to have genetic variation. Asexual reproduction also produces genetic variation through mutations and other processes. So, while sexual reproduction contributes to genetic variation, it's not necessarily a must for natural selection to act.\n\nOption D combines B and C, but as we've seen, B isn't necessarily required for natural selection, and C is just one way to get genetic variation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like the key thing needed for natural selection is genetic variation among individuals. That way, some individuals have traits that make them more suited to their environment, and they're more likely to pass those genes on.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Genetic variation among individuals.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where natural selection can act without genetic variation? Well, if all individuals are exactly the same genetically, then natural selection wouldn't be able to pick any favorites, because there's no difference in their heritable traits. So, yes, genetic variation is essential.\n\nEnvironmental variation can influence phenotypes, but unless it affects heritable traits, it doesn't contribute to evolutionary change through natural selection.\n\nSexual reproduction is useful for generating genetic variation, but it's not the only way, and natural selection can occur in asexual populations as well, albeit perhaps at a different rate.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
