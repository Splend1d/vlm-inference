                    "text": "So Mr. Kelly has 12 rolls of paper towels that he wants to distribute equally into 4 rooms. He's using the number sentence 12 \u00f7 t = 4 to find out how many rolls, t, go into each room. But we need to find another way to represent this situation with a different number sentence from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what's being asked. He has 12 rolls in total and wants to split them equally into 4 rooms. So, essentially, he's dividing 12 rolls by 4 rooms to find out how many rolls per room.\n\nThe original equation is 12 \u00f7 t = 4. Wait a minute, that seems a bit off because if he's dividing 12 by t to get 4, that would mean t is 3, because 12 divided by 3 is 4. But that doesn't make sense in the context because if he puts 3 rolls into each of the 4 rooms, that would be 12 rolls in total, which matches what he has. So, t should be 3.\n\nBut the question is asking for another way to find t, which is the number of rolls per room.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. 4 \u00f7 12 = t\n\nThis would mean t is 4 divided by 12, which is 1/3. But that doesn't make sense in this context because he can't put 1/3 of a roll into each room if he's trying to distribute 12 rolls into 4 rooms.\n\nB. 4 \u2013 t = 12\n\nThis would mean t = 4 - 12 = -8. Negative rolls don't make sense here.\n\nC. 4 + 12 = t\n\nThis would mean t = 16, which also doesn't make sense because he only has 12 rolls to distribute.\n\nD. 4 \u00d7 t = 12\n\nThis seems promising. If he has 4 rooms and each room gets t rolls, then the total number of rolls is 4 times t, which equals 12.\n\nSo, 4 \u00d7 t = 12.\n\nSolving for t, t = 12 \u00f7 4 = 3, which matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 4 \u00d7 t = 12.\n\nTo double-check, let's see if there are any other ways to represent this.\n\nAnother way could be to say that the total number of rolls is equal to the number of rooms times the number of rolls per room, which is exactly what option D is saying.\n\nThe other options don't make sense in this context, so D is indeed the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
