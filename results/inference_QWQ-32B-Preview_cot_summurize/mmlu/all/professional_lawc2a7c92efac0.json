This is in accordance with the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.\n\nOption A is correct because when a regulation is considered a taking, the government is obligated to compensate the property owner for the value of the property taken or the impact of the regulation on the property's value.\n\nOption B is incorrect because terminating the regulation and paying damages is not the standard remedy for a regulatory taking. The primary remedy is to provide just compensation for the taking, not to remove the regulation and pay damages.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is no general requirement for the government to pay double damages if the issue is not addressed within 30 days. The Fifth Amendment requires just compensation, but it does not specify penalties for delay beyond providing compensation for the period during which the taking occurred.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that either option A or B could be correct, but as explained, only option A is the accurate remedy for a regulatory taking.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Pay just compensation for the property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
