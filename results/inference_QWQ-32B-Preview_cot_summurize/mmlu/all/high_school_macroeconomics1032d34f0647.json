                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics question step by step. So, we've got an economy that's initially in long-run equilibrium, and then it experiences a temporary expansionary supply shock. We need to figure out how this affects the short-run Phillips curve, the short-run unemployment rate, and the long-run unemployment rate. The options are a bit tricky, so I'll try to understand each part carefully.\n\nFirst, what's a supply shock? A supply shock is an event that affects the economy's productive capacity suddenly. An expansionary supply shock means that there's an increase in the supply of goods and services, perhaps because of a technological advancement, a discovery of new resources, or a decrease in input prices.\n\nNow, in the context of the Phillips curve, which shows the relationship between inflation and unemployment, how does this supply shock play out?\n\nLet's recall that the Phillips curve suggests that there's an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment in the short run. That is, when inflation is high, unemployment tends to be low, and vice versa.\n\nBut with a supply shock, things get a bit more complicated.\n\nA temporary expansionary supply shock would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the right because more can be produced at each price level. This would lead to lower prices and higher real GDP in the short run.\n\nNow, how does this affect inflation and unemployment?\n\nWell, lower prices mean lower inflation. And higher real GDP typically means lower unemployment, as more people are employed to produce the additional output.\n\nSo, in the short run, we'd expect both inflation to decrease and unemployment to decrease.\n\nNow, the Phillips curve plots inflation against unemployment. So, if both inflation and unemployment are falling, where does that show up on the Phillips curve?\n\nWait a minute, the Phillips curve typically shows inflation on one axis and unemployment on the other, with a negative relationship. But here, both are falling, which seems a bit outside the standard Phillips curve framework.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the supply shock shifts the Phillips curve itself.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nAn expansionary supply shock reduces the cost of production, which could allow firms to produce more at lower prices, which could mean that for any given level of demand, there's less inflationary pressure.\n\nSo, perhaps the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward. That is, for any given unemployment rate, inflation is lower than before the shock.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around.\n\nWait, no. If the supply shock reduces costs, firms can afford to hire more workers without increasing prices as much, which could mean that unemployment can be lower for any given inflation rate.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nLet me look at a graph to visualize this.\n\nIn the short run, the economy is at a point on the short-run Phillips curve. A supply shock would shift this curve.\n\nAn expansionary supply shock should shift the short-run Phillips curve downward because it reduces inflation for any given level of unemployment.\n\nSo, option A says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, and short-run unemployment falls.\n\nThat seems consistent with what I just thought.\n\nBut then it says that the long-run unemployment rises. Is that correct?\n\nWait, in the long run, the economy adjusts.\n\nAfter the temporary supply shock, the economy will adjust back to the natural rate of unemployment, which is the rate where there's no inflationary or deflationary pressure.\n\nSo, in the long run, the unemployment rate should return to its natural rate, assuming that the supply shock is temporary.\n\nTherefore, the long-run unemployment rate shouldn't change due to a temporary supply shock.\n\nBut option A says it rises, which doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the supply shock affects the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nBut generally, supply shocks don't permanently change the natural rate of unemployment; they mainly affect the price level and output in the short run.\n\nSo, perhaps the long-run unemployment rate remains unchanged.\n\nBut looking at the options, none reflect that.\n\nWait, option C says that both the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, short-run unemployment falls, and long-run unemployment falls.\n\nBut again, I don't think the long-run unemployment rate falls due to a temporary supply shock.\n\nOption D says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts up, short-run unemployment rises, and long-run unemployment rises.\n\nThat seems contrary to what I think should happen.\n\nOption B says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts up, short-run unemployment rises, and long-run unemployment falls.\n\nThat also doesn't align with my understanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nLet me try to recall the effects of a supply shock on the Phillips curve.\n\nIn the short run, an expansionary supply shock should decrease inflation and decrease unemployment.\n\nOn the Phillips curve, that would mean a movement to a point with lower inflation and lower unemployment.\n\nBut typically, the Phillips curve shows that lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation, so a downward shift of the curve would be necessary to have lower inflation at lower unemployment.\n\nTherefore, the short-run Phillips curve shifts downward in response to an expansionary supply shock.\n\nNow, in the long run, the economy adjusts, and the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate, but with a lower inflation rate if the supply shock is permanent.\n\nBut in this case, the supply shock is temporary, so in the long run, both inflation and unemployment return to their original levels.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about a temporary supply shock, so perhaps the long-run unemployment rate remains unchanged.\n\nBut according to the options, we have to choose among different combinations.\n\nGiven that, option A says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, short-run unemployment falls, and long-run unemployment rises.\n\nBut why would long-run unemployment rise?\n\nI don't see a reason for that.\n\nOption C says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts down, short-run unemployment falls, and long-run unemployment falls.\n\nAgain, I don't think the long-run unemployment rate falls due to a temporary supply shock.\n\nOption B says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts up, short-run unemployment rises, and long-run unemployment falls.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive.\n\nOption D says that the short-run Phillips curve shifts up, short-run unemployment rises, and long-run unemployment rises.\n\nThis also doesn't align with my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\n\nIn that model, the Phillips curve incorporates expected inflation.\n\nA supply shock can affect inflation and unemployment in the short run, but in the long run, people adjust their expectations, and the economy settles back to the natural rate of unemployment with a new inflation rate.\n\nBut in this case, since the supply shock is temporary, perhaps in the long run, everything returns to normal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the supply shock affects the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nBut I don't recall that being the case.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\n- Initial equilibrium: long-run equilibrium, so unemployment is at the natural rate, and inflation is at the expected rate.\n\n- Temporary expansionary supply shock: shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, lowers prices, increases real GDP, decreases unemployment in the short run, and decreases inflation.\n\n- On the Phillips curve, this would mean moving to a point with lower unemployment and lower inflation.\n\n- To have lower inflation and lower unemployment simultaneously, the short-run Phillips curve must shift downward.\n\n- In the long run, since the supply shock is temporary, the economy adjusts back to the original long-run equilibrium, with unemployment returning to the natural rate and inflation returning to its original level.\n\nTherefore, in the long run, unemployment doesn't change; it remains at the natural rate.\n\nBut looking at the options, none specifically say that long-run unemployment remains unchanged.\n\nOptions A, B, C, and D all suggest that long-run unemployment either rises or falls.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question assumes that the temporary supply shock has some persistent effect on long-run unemployment.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the impact on the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nWait, perhaps a temporary supply shock can have an impact on the natural rate if it affects the economy's potential output.\n\nIf potential output increases due to the supply shock, perhaps the natural rate of unemployment changes.\n\nBut generally, supply shocks are considered temporary fluctuations around the trend, and the natural rate is associated with the economy's potential output in the long run.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the natural rate doesn't change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a hysteresis effect, where short-run fluctuations affect the long-run unemployment rate.\n\nBut that's more related to persistent demand shocks rather than temporary supply shocks.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nLet me consider the following logic:\n\n- Short-run Phillips curve shifts downward due to the temporary supply shock.\n\n- Short-run unemployment falls as real GDP increases.\n\n- In the long run, the economy adjusts, and unemployment returns to the natural rate.\n\nTherefore, long-run unemployment doesn't change.\n\nBut none of the options reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the temporary supply shock has some effect on the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nBut I don't recall that being a standard result.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the perspective of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n\u03c0 = \u03c0\u2091 - \u03b2(u - u_n)\n\nWhere \u03c0 is inflation, \u03c0\u2091 is expected inflation, \u03b2 is a positive constant, u is unemployment, and u_n is the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nIn the short run, if there's a supply shock, it affects \u03c0 without immediately changing \u03c0\u2091.\n\nSo, a positive supply shock decreases \u03c0, leading to a lower inflation rate in the short run.\n\nFirms may respond by adjusting their pricing strategies, and in the long run, expected inflation adjusts to the new actual inflation.\n\nBut in this case, since the supply shock is temporary, perhaps expected inflation doesn't change much in the long run.\n\nWait, but if the supply shock is temporary, in the long run, expected inflation should return to its original level.\n\nTherefore, the long-run unemployment rate should also return to its natural rate.\n\nBut again, the options don't reflect that.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Shifts down, Falls, Rises\n\nB. Shifts up, Rises, Falls\n\nC. Shifts down, Falls, Falls\n\nD. Shifts up, Rises, Rises\n\nGiven my earlier reasoning, option A seems closest, but I'm unsure about the long-run unemployment rising.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the temporary supply shock could have different effects based on how expectations are formed.\n\nWait, maybe if the supply shock leads people to expect higher future supply shocks, which could affect their expectations of inflation and unemployment.\n\nBut that seems too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the temporary supply shock affects the Phillips curve in a way that allows for a permanent reduction in unemployment.\n\nBut that doesn't sound right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the temporary supply shock causes a reduction in unemployment in the short run, but in the long run, if the shock is not sustained, unemployment might rise back to its natural rate or even above if there are adjustment costs.\n\nBut that still doesn't align with any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the temporary supply shock allows firms to hire more workers temporarily, but in the long run, without the shock, firms may lay off those additional workers, leading to higher long-run unemployment.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because in the long run, the economy should adjust back to the natural rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the supply shock leads to structural changes in the economy that affect the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nFor example, if the supply shock is due to a technological advancement, it could change the skill requirements and lead to higher structural unemployment in the long run.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch, and not directly related to a temporary supply shock.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the temporary supply shock leads to a boom in certain sectors, which then attract workers, but when the shock subsides, those workers may face difficulty readjusting to other sectors, leading to higher long-run unemployment.\n\nBut again, this seems like a second-order effect and not directly captured in standard Phillips curve analysis.\n\nI think I'm overthinking this.\n\nGiven the standard Phillips curve framework, a temporary expansionary supply shock should shift the short-run Phillips curve downward, decrease short-run unemployment, and have no effect on the long-run unemployment rate.\n\nSince none of the options reflect that, perhaps the question is expecting a different answer based on a specific model or additional assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of what \"long-run unemployment\" refers to.\n\nPerhaps \"long-run unemployment\" here refers to the natural rate of unemployment, which could change over time due to various factors.\n\nBut in standard Phillips curve analysis, the natural rate of unemployment is considered exogenous and not directly affected by temporary supply shocks.\n\nGiven that, I'm inclined to choose option A, despite my reservations about the long-run unemployment rising.\n\nPerhaps there's an argument that the temporary supply shock allows firms to operate more efficiently in the short run, leading to lower unemployment, but in the long run, if the shock is not sustained, firms may have to adjust back, potentially leading to higher unemployment.\n\nBut that still seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to Okun's law, which relates unemployment to GDP growth.\n\nBut that's not directly related to the Phillips curve.\n\nI think I need to make a decision based on the standard Phillips curve analysis.\n\nSo, in the short run, the Phillips curve shifts down, unemployment falls, and in the long run, unemployment returns to its natural rate.\n\nBut since none of the options reflect that, and I have to choose among A, B, C, or D, I'll go with option A, keeping in mind that I'm unsure about the long-run unemployment rising.\n\nPerhaps the question's answer key has a different perspective, but based on my understanding, option A seems closest, even if it doesn't perfectly align with what I think should happen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
