                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these options would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, what is aggregate demand? It's the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time and price level. The aggregate demand curve typically slopes downward, meaning that as the price level decreases, the quantity of output demanded increases, and vice versa.\n\nNow, a shift to the right in the aggregate demand curve means that at every price level, the quantity of output demanded is higher than before. So, I need to find which of these options would cause people and businesses to want to buy more stuff at every price level.\n\nOption A is \"An increase in the price level.\" Hmm, according to the basic aggregate demand curve, an increase in the price level should lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded, moving us along the curve, not shifting it. So, this seems like it would cause a movement along the curve, not a shift of the curve itself.\n\nOption B is \"Depreciation in the international value of the dollar.\" If the dollar depreciates internationally, that means it's worth less compared to other currencies. This would make U.S. exports cheaper for foreign buyers and imports more expensive for U.S. buyers. Cheaper exports could stimulate domestic production and increase demand for domestic goods. More expensive imports might encourage people to buy domestic goods instead. So, overall, this could increase aggregate demand.\n\nOption C is \"An increase in personal income tax rates.\" If personal income tax rates increase, people have less disposable income after paying taxes. With less money in their pockets, they might spend less, which would decrease aggregate demand. So, this seems like it would shift the aggregate demand curve to the left, not to the right.\n\nOption D is \"An increase in interest rates.\" Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which could discourage investment and consumer spending on big tickets items like houses and cars. This would likely decrease aggregate demand, shifting the curve to the left.\n\nSo, looking back, option B seems to be the only one that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing with option A. If the price level increases, doesn't that just move us along the same aggregate demand curve? It doesn't change the curve itself, right? Yes, that makes sense.\n\nOption C: higher taxes mean less disposable income, leading to lower consumption, which decreases aggregate demand. That seems straightforward.\n\nOption D: higher interest rates discourage spending and investment, again decreasing aggregate demand.\n\nOption B: a depreciating dollar makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which should boost domestic demand for goods and services.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Depreciation in the international value of the dollar would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
