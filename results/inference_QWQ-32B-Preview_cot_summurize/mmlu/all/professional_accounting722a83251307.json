                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Skinner contributing some assets to a partnership and I need to figure out his basis in the partnership interest. Let's see what I've got.\n\nFirst, Skinner contributes $5,000 cash and land with a $12,000 basis and a $20,000 fair market value. The land has a $10,000 mortgage that the partnership assumes. Also, the partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities that will be shared by partners according to their partnership interests. Skinner gets a 20% partnership interest for his contributions.\n\nOkay, so to find Skinner's basis in his partnership interest, I need to use the general rule for contributing property to a partnership. The basis is generally the adjusted basis of the property contributed, plus any mortgage assumed by the partnership, plus any money contributed, minus any liabilities relieved.\n\nWait, but there's more to it because the partnership also has existing liabilities.\n\nLet me recall the formula for determining a partner's basis in a partnership interest:\n\nPartner's basis = basis of property contributed + money contributed + liabilities assumed by the partnership - liabilities relieved + gain recognized - loss recognized.\n\nBut I also need to consider the partnership's existing liabilities and how they affect the partner's basis.\n\nFirst, let's list out the contributions:\n\n- Cash: $5,000\n\n- Land: basis of $12,000, fair market value of $20,000\n\n- Mortgage assumed by partnership: $10,000\n\nSo, according to the formula:\n\nBasis = $5,000 (cash) + $12,000 (basis of land) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) - 0 (no liabilities relieved) + 0 (no gain recognized) - 0 (no loss recognized)\n\nWait, but when you contribute property to a partnership, you don't recognize gain or loss unless there's a boot involved or something. Here, the partnership is assuming the mortgage, which is equal to $10,000, and the fair market value of the land is $20,000, with a basis of $12,000. So, the gain would be $20,000 - $12,000 = $8,000, but since the mortgage is assumed, which is $10,000, and the fair market value is $20,000, the boot is $20,000 - $10,000 = $10,000. But I think in this case, since it's a contribution to a partnership, no gain is recognized unless there's money or other property received in addition to the partnership interest.\n\nWait, I need to check the rules again.\n\nGenerally, when you contribute property to a partnership, your basis in the partnership interest is equal to the adjusted basis of the property contributed, plus any money you contributed, plus the amount of any liability assumed by the partnership, minus any liability you relieve the partnership of.\n\nBut in this case, the partnership is assuming the mortgage on the land, which is a liability that the partnership is taking on.\n\nSo, your basis should include the basis of the land plus the mortgage assumed.\n\nWait, but I think there's a specific rule for liabilities assumed by the partnership.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAccording to IRC Section 722, a partner's basis is increased by the amount of any liability assumed by the partnership.\n\nSo, in this case, the partnership assumes the $10,000 mortgage on the land.\n\nTherefore, Skinner's basis would be his basis in the land ($12,000) plus the mortgage assumed ($10,000), plus the cash contributed ($5,000), totaling $27,000.\n\nBut wait, there's more.\n\nThe partnership also has existing recourse liabilities of $20,000 that will be shared by the partners according to their partnership interests.\n\nSkinner has a 20% interest, so his share of the existing liabilities is 20% of $20,000, which is $4,000.\n\nAccording to IRC Section 705, a partner's basis is increased by the amount of any liability to which the partner is personally liable.\n\nBut in this case, the liabilities are partnership liabilities, not personal liabilities, unless specified as recourse liabilities.\n\nGiven that these are recourse liabilities, the partners are personally liable for them.\n\nTherefore, Skinner's basis should be increased by his share of the existing recourse liabilities.\n\nSo, his basis would be:\n\nContributed basis: $12,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) = $27,000\n\nPlus his share of existing recourse liabilities: $4,000\n\nTotal basis: $27,000 + $4,000 = $31,000\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check the regulations or see if there's a specific way to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mortgage assumed by the partnership is already included in the partnership's liabilities, so I shouldn't add it separately.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nFirst, determine the total contributions and liabilities.\n\nSkinner contributes cash of $5,000 and land with a basis of $12,000 and a fair market value of $20,000, subject to a $10,000 mortgage.\n\nThe partnership assumes the $10,000 mortgage.\n\nSo, the gain recognized would be the fair market value minus the adjusted basis, which is $20,000 - $12,000 = $8,000.\n\nBut in a contribution to a partnership, gain is generally not recognized unless there is boot received.\n\nHere, the only boot is the cash contributed, but I think the general rule is that no gain is recognized on the transfer of property to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest.\n\nTherefore, Skinner's basis in his partnership interest is his basis in the property contributed plus any money contributed, plus the amount of any liability assumed by the partnership.\n\nSo, basis = $12,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) = $27,000.\n\nBut wait, I think there might be a different way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps the mortgage assumed should not be added again since it's already a liability of the partnership.\n\nLet me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the basis is just the basis of the property contributed plus cash, and the mortgage assumed is already factored into the partnership's liabilities.\n\nSo, basis = $12,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) = $17,000.\n\nThen, add his share of the partnership's existing liabilities, which is $4,000.\n\nTotal basis = $17,000 + $4,000 = $21,000.\n\nThat matches option B.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it should be $27,000.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look up the exact language in the tax code or regulations.\n\nAccording to Treas. Reg. \u00a71.705-1(b)(3), a partner's capital account is increased by the amount of money contributed by the partner, the adjusted basis of property contributed, and the amount of any liability assumed by the partnership in connection with the contribution.\n\nSo, in this case, Skinner's basis should be increased by the basis of the land ($12,000), the cash contributed ($5,000), and the mortgage assumed by the partnership ($10,000), totaling $27,000.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider his share of the partnership's existing liabilities.\n\nThe partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities, which will be shared according to partnership interests.\n\nSkinner has a 20% interest, so his share is $4,000.\n\nTherefore, his total basis would be $27,000 + $4,000 = $31,000.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mortgage assumed is already included in the partnership's liabilities, so I shouldn't add it twice.\n\nLet me try calculating it differently.\n\nTotal liabilities of the partnership after assumption: existing $20,000 + assumed mortgage of $10,000 = $30,000.\n\nSkinner's share of the total liabilities: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000.\n\nThen, his basis would be his contributions ($12,000 land + $5,000 cash) plus his share of the liabilities ($6,000) = $23,000.\n\nBut that's not among the options either.\n\nI must be missing something fundamental here.\n\nLet me try starting over.\n\nWhen you contribute property to a partnership, your basis in the partnership interest is generally your basis in the property contributed, plus any money contributed, plus the amount of any liability assumed by the partnership.\n\nSo, basis = $12,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) = $27,000.\n\nBut perhaps the mortgage assumed is not added separately because it's already a liability of the partnership.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the basis is only increased by the amount of liability assumed to the extent it doesn't exceed the partner's inside basis in the property.\n\nI need to check the regulations regarding liabilities assumed by the partnership.\n\nAccording to Treas. Reg. \u00a71.752-1(a), a partner's outside basis is increased by the amount of any liability assumed by the partnership in connection with the contribution.\n\nSo, in this case, the partnership assumes the $10,000 mortgage on the land, so Skinner's basis should increase by $10,000.\n\nTherefore, basis = $12,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) = $27,000.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the partnership's existing liabilities differently.\n\nThe partnership has $20,000 in recourse liabilities that are shared according to partnership interests.\n\nAfter Skinner contributes, the partnership has $20,000 existing liabilities plus the $10,000 mortgage assumed, totaling $30,000 in liabilities.\n\nSkinner has a 20% interest, so his share is $6,000.\n\nTherefore, his basis would be his contributions ($12,000 + $5,000 + $10,000) plus his share of the existing liabilities ($6,000), totaling $27,000 + $6,000 = $33,000.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nI must be overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me consider a simpler approach.\n\nOption A is $27,000, which is the sum of cash, basis of land, and mortgage assumed.\n\nOption B is $21,000, which is cash plus basis of land plus share of existing liabilities ($12,000 + $5,000 + $4,000).\n\nOption C is $19,000, which might be cash plus basis of land minus mortgage relief.\n\nOption D is $13,000, which is unclear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is $21,000, considering contributions and share of existing liabilities without double-counting the assumed mortgage.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumed mortgage is already included in the partnership's liabilities, so it's already factored into the 20% interest.\n\nI'm getting more confused.\n\nLet me try to look for a similar example in a tax textbook or IRS publication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is calculated based on the fair market value of the contributions, but that doesn't seem right because generally, basis is based on adjusted basis, not fair market value, unless there's gain recognized.\n\nBut in this case, no gain is recognized.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the partnership's capital accounts.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe partnership's capital accounts would include the capital contributions from all partners.\n\nAssuming Skinner is the only contributing partner for now, his capital account would be increased by his contributions.\n\nCash: $5,000\n\nLand: $12,000 (his basis in the land)\n\nMortgage assumed: $10,000\n\nSo, his capital account would be $5,000 + $12,000 + $10,000 = $27,000.\n\nThen, the partnership has existing recourse liabilities of $20,000, which are shared according to partnership interests.\n\nSkinner has a 20% interest, so his share is $4,000.\n\nTherefore, his basis would be his capital account ($27,000) plus his share of the liabilities ($4,000), totaling $31,000.\n\nBut again, that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe his basis is just his capital account of $27,000.\n\nOr perhaps his basis is his capital account plus his share of the partnership's liabilities, which would be $27,000 + $4,000 = $31,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the existing liabilities are already inclusive of the assumed mortgage, so I shouldn't add the mortgage assumed separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the partnership's existing liabilities of $20,000 already include the mortgage on the land.\n\nBut the problem says the land's mortgage is assumed by the partnership in addition to the existing $20,000 in recourse liabilities.\n\nSo, they are separate.\n\nTherefore, total liabilities are $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.\n\nSkinner's share: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000.\n\nTherefore, his basis would be contributions ($12,000 + $5,000 + $10,000) + share of liabilities ($6,000) = $27,000 + $6,000 = $33,000.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nI must be missing a key principle here.\n\nLet me consider that when a partnership assumes a liability, it's as if the partner is contributing the assumed liability.\n\nBut I think it's already covered in the capital account.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is just the basis of the property contributed plus cash, without adding the assumed liability again.\n\nSo, basis = $12,000 (land) + $5,000 (cash) = $17,000.\n\nThen, add his share of the existing liabilities: $4,000.\n\nTotal basis: $17,000 + $4,000 = $21,000.\n\nThat matches option B.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it should include the assumed mortgage.\n\nHowever, perhaps the assumed mortgage is already reflected in the partnership's liabilities, so it's not added again to the partner's basis.\n\nIn other words, the partnership's liabilities include the assumed mortgage, and the partner's basis includes his share of those liabilities.\n\nTherefore, by adding his share of the liabilities, I'm already accounting for the assumed mortgage.\n\nHence, total basis is $17,000 (contributions) + $4,000 (share of liabilities) = $21,000.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is the basis of the property contributed plus cash plus the amount of liability assumed, which is $12,000 + $5,000 + $10,000 = $27,000.\n\nThen, add his share of the existing liabilities: $4,000.\n\nTotal: $31,000.\n\nBut again, that's not an option.\n\nGiven that, maybe the correct answer is $21,000, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the partnership's total capital.\n\nAssuming Skinner is the only contributor, the partnership has capital of $5,000 (cash) + $12,000 (basis of land) = $17,000.\n\nPlus, it assumes a $10,000 mortgage.\n\nSo, total liabilities are $20,000 (existing) + $10,000 (assumed mortgage) = $30,000.\n\nSkinner has a 20% interest, so his capital account is 20% of the partnership's capital.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because his capital account should be based on his contributions.\n\nI'm getting more confused.\n\nMaybe I should look at it from the partnership's perspective.\n\nPartnership has:\n\n- Cash: $5,000\n\n- Land: $12,000 basis, $20,000 FMV\n\n- Liabilities: $20,000 existing + $10,000 assumed mortgage = $30,000\n\nSkinner's capital account: $5,000 (cash) + $12,000 (land) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) = $27,000.\n\nBut the partnership's total capital is $5,000 + $12,000 = $17,000, minus liabilities of $30,000, which would result in negative capital, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the capital account is calculated differently.\n\nI think I need to revisit the capital account regulations.\n\nAccording to Treas. Reg. \u00a71.704-1(b), a partner's capital account is increased by amounts contributed, including the adjusted basis of property contributed, and amounts equal to liabilities assumed by the partnership.\n\nSo, Skinner's capital account should be increased by $5,000 (cash) + $12,000 (basis of land) + $10,000 (mortgage assumed) = $27,000.\n\nThen, his basis in his partnership interest is generally equal to his capital account balance, adjusted for certain items.\n\nOne of those adjustments is his share of the partnership's liabilities.\n\nSo, his basis would be $27,000 plus his share of the partnership's liabilities.\n\nPartnership's total liabilities are $30,000.\n\nHis 20% share is $6,000.\n\n"
