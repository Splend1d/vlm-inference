This doctrine is fundamental to the common law system, ensuring consistency and predictability in the law. It means \"to stand by things decided\" in Latin.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other options to understand why they are not the correct answer:\n\nA. Certiorari: This is a type of writ used by higher courts to review the decision of a lower court. It is not related to following precedent.\n\nB. De jure: This term refers to something that is according to law, as opposed to de facto, which refers to something that exists in fact but not necessarily in law.\n\nC. Ex post facto: This refers to laws that retroactively change the legal consequences of actions that were committed before the enactment of the law. Such laws are generally prohibited in criminal law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. stare decisis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
