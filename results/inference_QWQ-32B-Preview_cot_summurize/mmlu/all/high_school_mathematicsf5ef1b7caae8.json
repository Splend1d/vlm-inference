The function f(x) is strictly convex, which means that between any two points on its graph, the part of the graph between those points lies below the straight line connecting those two points. It's given that f(x) passes through the points (-2,5) and (2,9), and I need to find the range of possible values for f(1).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what strictly convex means. If I have two points on the graph, say (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b)), then for any x between a and b, the value of f(x) should be less than the value on the straight line connecting those two points.\n\nSo, in this case, a = -2, b = 2, f(a) = 5, and f(b) = 9. I need to find f(1), where 1 is between -2 and 2.\n\nLet me first find the equation of the straight line connecting (-2,5) and (2,9). The slope m of this line is (9 - 5)/(2 - (-2)) = 4/4 = 1.\n\nSo, the equation of the line is y - y1 = m(x - x1), using point (2,9):\n\ny - 9 = 1(x - 2)\n\ny = x - 2 + 9\n\ny = x + 7\n\nSo, the line connecting (-2,5) and (2,9) is y = x + 7.\n\nNow, since the function is strictly convex, the value of f(1) must be less than the value of the line at x=1.\n\nSo, at x=1, y = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nTherefore, f(1) < 8.\n\nBut I need to consider if there are any lower bounds for f(1). Since the function is strictly convex, it must lie below the line segment between any two points, but there's no specified lower bound in the problem.\n\nWait, but in reality, functions can't have y-values less than negative infinity, so the lower bound should be negative infinity.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there are no constraints that would prevent f(1) from being arbitrarily small.\n\nLet me think about it. If I have points (-2,5) and (2,9), and the function is strictly convex, then between x=-2 and x=2, the function must lie below the straight line connecting those points.\n\nThere's no lower limit specified, so theoretically, f(1) can be as small as negative infinity.\n\nSo, the range of possible values for f(1) is from negative infinity to 8, not including 8.\n\nIn interval notation, that would be (-\u221e, 8).\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. (-\u221e, 10)\n\nB. (-\u221e, 9)\n\nC. (-\u221e, 8)\n\nD. (-\u221e, 7)\n\nOption C is (-\u221e, 8), which matches what I've deduced.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nIf f(1) could be equal to 8, that would mean it lies on the line, but since it's strictly convex, it must lie below the line, so f(1) < 8.\n\nTherefore, f(1) can be any value less than 8, with no lower limit.\n\nHence, the answer should be (-\u221e, 8).\n\nSo, option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{(-\\infty,8)} \\]"
