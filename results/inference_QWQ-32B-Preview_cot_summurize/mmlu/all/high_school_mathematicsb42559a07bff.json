                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: compute the area of a triangle whose altitudes have lengths 10, 12, and 15. And there are multiple-choice options provided. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with how to find the area of a triangle when I know the altitudes, but I know that area is usually base times height over two. Maybe I can work backwards from that.\n\nLet me denote the sides of the triangle opposite to these altitudes as a, b, and c, corresponding to altitudes of 10, 12, and 15, respectively. So, the area A of the triangle can be expressed in three different ways:\n\nA = (a * 10)/2 = (b * 12)/2 = (c * 15)/2\n\nFrom these equations, I can express the sides in terms of the area:\n\na = (2A)/10 = A/5\n\nb = (2A)/12 = A/6\n\nc = (2A)/15 = A/7.5\n\nWait, 2A divided by 15 is A/7.5, but maybe it's better to keep it as a fraction:\n\nc = (2A)/15 = (2/15)A\n\nOkay, so now I have expressions for all three sides in terms of A.\n\nI recall that in any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Maybe I can use that to relate a, b, and c.\n\nSo, a + b > c\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\n(A/5) + (A/6) > (2A)/15\n\nLet's find a common denominator to combine these fractions. The least common multiple of 5, 6, and 15 is 30.\n\nSo:\n\n(6A/30) + (5A/30) > (4A)/30\n\n11A/30 > 4A/30\n\nSubtract 4A/30 from both sides:\n\n7A/30 > 0\n\nSince A is the area of a triangle, it must be positive, so this inequality holds.\n\nSimilarly, a + c > b:\n\n(A/5) + (2A)/15 > A/6\n\nAgain, find a common denominator, which is 30:\n\n(6A/30) + (4A/30) > 5A/30\n\n10A/30 > 5A/30\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nA/3 > A/6\n\nSubtract A/6 from both sides:\n\nA/3 - A/6 > 0\n\n(A/6) > 0, which is true since A > 0.\n\nLastly, b + c > a:\n\n(A/6) + (2A)/15 > A/5\n\nCommon denominator 30:\n\n(5A/30) + (4A/30) > 6A/30\n\n9A/30 > 6A/30\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3A/30 > 0, or A/10 > 0, which is true.\n\nSo, all the triangle inequalities hold, which is a good check, but I still need to find A.\n\nMaybe I can use Heron's formula, which gives the area in terms of the sides. But since the sides are in terms of A, it might get messy.\n\nHeron's formula is A = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nFirst, find s:\n\ns = (a + b + c)/2 = [(A/5) + (A/6) + (2A)/15]/2\n\nLet's find a common denominator for the fractions:\n\nDenominator is 30:\n\ns = (6A/30 + 5A/30 + 4A/30)/2 = (15A/30)/2 = (A/2)/2 = A/4\n\nNow, s - a = A/4 - A/5 = (5A - 4A)/20 = A/20\n\ns - b = A/4 - A/6 = (3A - 2A)/12 = A/12\n\ns - c = A/4 - 2A/15 = (15A - 8A)/60 = 7A/60\n\nNow, plug into Heron's formula:\n\nA = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[(A/4)(A/20)(A/12)(7A/60)]\n\nMultiply the fractions inside the square root:\n\n(A/4)*(A/20)*(A/12)*(7A/60) = (7A^4)/(4*20*12*60) = (7A^4)/(57600)\n\nSo, A = sqrt[(7A^4)/(57600)] = (A^2)sqrt(7)/(sqrt(57600))\n\nSimplify sqrt(57600):\n\n57600 = 576 * 100, and 576 is 24^2, so sqrt(57600) = 24 * 10 = 240\n\nTherefore:\n\nA = (A^2 * sqrt(7))/240\n\nNow, solve for A:\n\nMultiply both sides by 240:\n\n240A = A^2 * sqrt(7)\n\nDivide both sides by A (assuming A \u2260 0, which it isn't since it's a triangle):\n\n240 = A * sqrt(7)\n\nSo, A = 240 / sqrt(7)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nA = (240 * sqrt(7)) / 7\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 240sqrt(7)/7, which matches my answer.\n\nBut wait, there are other options: A. 56sqrt(15), B. 240sqrt(7), C. 60sqrt(7), D. 240sqrt(7)/7\n\nSo, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the steps:\n\n1. Expressed sides in terms of A: a = A/5, b = A/6, c = 2A/15\n\n2. Calculated semi-perimeter s = A/4\n\n3. Calculated s - a = A/20, s - b = A/12, s - c = 7A/60\n\n4. Plugged into Heron's formula and simplified to A = (A^2 * sqrt(7))/240\n\n5. Solved for A to get A = 240sqrt(7)/7\n\nSeems correct. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula that directly relates the area to the altitudes.\n\nI recall that in a triangle, the product of the area and the corresponding altitude gives twice the area, but that's not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that relates the area directly to the altitudes.\n\nLet me think differently. If I let the area be A, then:\n\nA = (a * 10)/2 \u21d2 a = 2A/10 = A/5\n\nSimilarly, b = 2A/12 = A/6\n\nAnd c = 2A/15 = A/7.5\n\nWait, earlier I had c = 2A/15, which is correct.\n\nNow, in any triangle, the relation between the sides and the altitudes can be complicated, but perhaps I can use the fact that the area can also be expressed in terms of the circumradius or something, but that seems overly complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the exradii, but that doesn't seem directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the area to the product of the altitudes and the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nI recall that in any triangle, the product of the sides divided by the product of the altitudes is equal to twice the area.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nProduct of sides a * b * c = (A/5)(A/6)(2A/15) = (2A^3)/(5*6*15) = (2A^3)/450 = A^3/225\n\nProduct of altitudes h_a * h_b * h_c = 10 * 12 * 15 = 1800\n\nNow, is there a relationship between these products and the area?\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the fact that in any triangle, the area can be expressed as A = (1/2) * base * height, and since I have three different bases and heights, maybe I can set up equations accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the area is the same regardless of which base and height I use.\n\nSo, (1/2)a*10 = (1/2)b*12 = (1/2)c*15 = A\n\nTherefore, a = 2A/10 = A/5\n\nb = 2A/12 = A/6\n\nc = 2A/15 = A/7.5\n\nNow, perhaps I can use the fact that in any triangle, the sum of the squares of any two sides is equal to the square of the third side plus twice the square of the median to that side, but that seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the sides and the angles, but I don't know the angles.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the area to the sides and the circumradius, but again, without knowing the angles or the circumradius, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter, but I don't know the inradius or the semiperimeter directly.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick with my initial approach using Heron's formula, as it seems to have given a consistent answer that matches one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula that directly relates the area to the altitudes.\n\nAfter some research, I recall that for any triangle with altitudes h_a, h_b, h_c corresponding to sides a, b, c, the area A can be related to the altitudes by the formula:\n\n1/h_a + 1/h_b + 1/h_c = 2A/(a*b*c)\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\n1/h_a + 1/h_b + 1/h_c = 2/(A)\n\nBut that doesn't make sense dimensionally.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\n(h_a * h_b * h_c)/(A^2) = 8 * R^3 / (a * b * c)\n\nWhere R is the circumradius, but this seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the fact that in any triangle, the product of the altitudes is related to the area and the sides in a specific way.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since I have expressions for all three sides in terms of A, perhaps I can use the law of cosines to relate them.\n\nLet's pick angle C opposite side c. Then, by the law of cosines:\n\nc^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C)\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of A:\n\n(A/7.5)^2 = (A/5)^2 + (A/6)^2 - 2*(A/5)*(A/6)*cos(C)\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n(A/7.5)^2 = A^2 / 56.25\n\n(A/5)^2 = A^2 / 25\n\n(A/6)^2 = A^2 / 36\n\nAnd 2*(A/5)*(A/6) = 2*(A^2)/(30) = A^2 / 15\n\nSo, plugging back in:\n\nA^2 / 56.25 = A^2 / 25 + A^2 / 36 - (A^2 / 15)*cos(C)\n\nFactor out A^2:\n\nA^2 [1/56.25 - 1/25 - 1/36 + cos(C)/15] = 0\n\nSince A^2 \u2260 0, the expression in the brackets must be zero:\n\n1/56.25 - 1/25 - 1/36 + cos(C)/15 = 0\n\nLet's compute 1/56.25, 1/25, and 1/36.\n\n1/56.25 = 0.01777...\n\n1/25 = 0.04\n\n1/36 \u2248 0.02777...\n\nBut this seems messy. Maybe I should keep them as fractions.\n\n1/56.25 = 1/(225/4) = 4/225\n\n1/25 = 4/100\n\n1/36 = 1/36\n\nAnd cos(C)/15\n\nLet me find a common denominator for 225, 100, and 36. The least common multiple of these denominators is 900.\n\nSo, convert each fraction:\n\n4/225 = (4*4)/900 = 16/900\n\n4/100 = (4*9)/900 = 36/900\n\n1/36 = (1*25)/900 = 25/900\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n16/900 - 36/900 - 25/900 + (cos(C)/15) = 0\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(16 - 36 - 25)/900 + cos(C)/15 = 0\n\n(-45)/900 + cos(C)/15 = 0\n\nSimplify -45/900 to -1/20:\n\n-1/20 + cos(C)/15 = 0\n\nTherefore, cos(C)/15 = 1/20\n\nSo, cos(C) = 15/20 = 3/4\n\nNow, I can find sin(C) since sin^2(C) + cos^2(C) = 1:\n\nsin^2(C) = 1 - (3/4)^2 = 1 - 9/16 = 7/16\n\nSo, sin(C) = sqrt(7)/4\n\nNow, the area of the triangle can also be expressed as:\n\nA = (1/2)*a*b*sin(C)\n\nSubstituting a = A/5 and b = A/6:\n\nA = (1/2)*(A/5)*(A/6)*sin(C) = (A^2)/(60)*sin(C)\n\nWe know sin(C) = sqrt(7)/4, so:\n\nA = (A^2)/(60)*(sqrt(7)/4) = (A^2 * sqrt(7))/(240)\n\nNow, solve for A:\n\nA = (A^2 * sqrt(7))/240\n\nMultiply both sides by 240:\n\n240A = A^2 * sqrt(7)\n\nDivide both sides by A (since A \u2260 0):\n\n240 = A * sqrt(7)\n\nTherefore, A = 240 / sqrt(7)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nA = (240 * sqrt(7)) / 7\n\nWhich matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the area of the triangle is 240sqrt(7)/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\dfrac{240\\sqrt{7}}{7}}\\]"
