                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure this out. So, there's a purchaser who signed an agreement to buy some real estate, and there's a contingency clause that says he has to make a completed application for a mortgage within a certain time. It also says that \"time is of the essence,\" which I think means that sticking to the time frames is really important.\n\nThe purchaser didn't make the application on time; instead, he asked his mortgage broker friend if he would qualify. Then, the seller said she's rescinding the sale because the mortgage application wasn't made within the agreed time. After that, the purchaser finally made the application and got approved, but the seller still wants to rescind the contract.\n\nThe question is, will the seller likely prevail in rescinding the transaction?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\n\nB. Yes, because she rescinded the sale prior to his notifying her of the approval \u2013 the first notice communicated is the effective one.\n\nC. No, because the amount of time that he was late was a \"de minimis\" delay that should not preclude him from the benefit of the bargain.\n\nD. No, because the original request to his mortgage broker friend was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement.\n\nOkay, first, since the agreement says that time is of the essence and the purchaser didn't make the application by the specified time, that seems like a problem. The purchaser tried to get an opinion from his friend, but that's not the same as making a mortgage application.\n\nOption A suggests that because he didn't make a timely application, he lost the protection of the contingency clause. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B says yes, the seller will prevail because she rescinded before getting notice of approval, and the first notice is effective. Hmm, that might be relevant, but I'm not entirely sure about the \"first notice communicated is the effective one.\" Maybe I need to think more about contract law principles here.\n\nOption C says no, because the delay was de minimis, meaning very small or insignificant. Maybe the delay was only a few days, so it shouldn't prevent him from getting the benefit. But, since time is of the essence, maybe even a small delay matters.\n\nOption D says no, because his request to the mortgage broker was a timely application within the spirit of the agreement. But, again, that's not the same as making an actual mortgage application.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In contract law, if time is of the essence and a party fails to perform by the specified time, the other party can treat that as a material breach and rescind the contract. In this case, the purchaser didn't make the mortgage application by the deadline, so the seller might have the right to rescind.\n\nBut, the purchaser did eventually make the application and got approved. Does that mean the seller can't rescind? Probably not, because the seller already rescinded before getting the approval notice.\n\nAlso, the seller communicated her intention to rescind before the purchaser notified her of the approval. So, perhaps the rescission is effective based on the first notification.\n\nOption B seems to align with that idea. The first notice communicated is the effective one. So, since the seller notified the purchaser of rescission first, that takes precedence over the later approval notification.\n\nOption A also makes sense because the purchaser didn't comply with the contingency clause regarding the mortgage application deadline.\n\nOption C mentions de minimis delay, but even a small delay could be material if time is of the essence.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because asking a friend for an opinion isn't the same as making a mortgage application.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely answer is A: Yes, because the purchaser did not make a timely application and lost the protection of the contingency clause.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any room for the purchaser to argue that his action with the mortgage broker was substantially fulfilling the contingency.\n\nMaybe he could argue that asking his friend was a step towards applying for the mortgage, but I don't think that holds up legally because the contract specified making a completed application, not just seeking advice.\n\nTherefore, I believe the seller is likely to prevail in rescinding the transaction because the purchaser didn't meet the deadline for the mortgage application, and time was of the essence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
