                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out which crimes the defendant should be convicted of. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the situation with the victim and the ring. The victim invited the defendant up to her apartment for coffee, and they started kissing on the couch. Then, the defendant tried to lift the victim's shirt, but she pushed his hand away and went to make coffee. During this time, the defendant picked up the victim's solid gold ring that was left on the living room table and put it in his pocket, intending to give it back to her with a diamond in it. So, regarding the ring, it seems like the defendant took it without permission, but with the intention of returning it.\n\nNow, for battery upon the victim, that would involve intentional harmful or offensive contact. In this case, the defendant was trying to lift the victim's shirt, which she pushed away. That seems more like an attempted sexual advance rather than a battery. Since she pushed his hand away, it doesn't seem like there was harmful or offensive contact. So, probably not battery.\n\nMoving on to larceny of the ring. Larceny is the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. Here, the defendant took the ring without permission and intended to give it back with a diamond. So, his intent wasn't to permanently deprive the victim of the ring; he wanted to return it. Therefore, larceny might not apply here.\n\nEmbezzlement, on the other hand, is the lawful possession of property that is later converted to one's own use with intent to deprive the owner of it. In this case, the defendant had lawful possession of the ring when he picked it up, but his intention was to give it back, not to keep it for himself. So, embezzlement also seems unlikely.\n\nNext, there's the part about the plasma TV. The defendant bought a two-month-old plasma TV for $200 from a patron at a bar, who said he had to get out of town quickly and only accepted cash. The defendant knew the TV was worth $1,000. The patron didn't tell the defendant that he had just stolen it from a house down the street.\n\nSo, regarding receiving stolen property, that would involve knowingly receiving property that one knows or has reason to believe is stolen. Here, the defendant knew the TV was worth $1,000 but bought it for $200, and the patron was in a hurry to sell it. These circumstances might raise suspicions that the TV was stolen, but the patron didn't explicitly say it was stolen. So, it's a bit gray.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, if someone receives property that they should have known was stolen, they can still be convicted of receiving stolen property. Given the suspicious circumstances\u2014selling a $1,000 TV for $200, the patron's urgency to sell, and the fact that the patron had some unboxed silverware and jewelry from his van\u2014it's possible that the defendant should have known or had reason to believe the TV was stolen.\n\nTherefore, the defendant might be convicted of receiving stolen property.\n\nSumming it up:\n\n- Battery upon the victim: unlikely, as the contact was not harmful or offensive.\n\n- Larceny of the ring: unlikely, because the intent was to return it.\n\n- Embezzlement of the ring: unlikely, for similar reasons.\n\n- Receiving stolen property: possible, given the suspicious circumstances surrounding the purchase of the TV.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Receiving stolen property.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
