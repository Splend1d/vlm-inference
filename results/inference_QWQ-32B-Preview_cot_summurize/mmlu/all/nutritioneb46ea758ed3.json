                    "text": "Functional isolation refers to a situation where a child, due to malnutrition and lack of proper stimulation, fails to develop normally and becomes isolated in terms of their functional abilities. This can lead to delays in cognitive, social, and emotional development.\n\nOption A suggests that a child is developing only one function at a time, which is not necessarily related to malnutrition or isolation. Option B specifically mentions isolation from proper nutrition but does not address the functional aspects or the impact on development. Option C describes a malnourished and apathetic child who is not receiving adequate stimulation, which aligns closely with the concept of functional isolation. Option D dismisses all the above options.\n\nGiven this, the most accurate answer is C. A malnourished, apathetic child that is not receiving the same stimulation from the environment affecting his/her development negatively.\n\nThis term is often used in the context of early childhood development, where proper nutrition and environmental stimulation are crucial for healthy growth. Malnutrition can lead to apathy and reduced interaction with the environment, creating a cycle where the child receives even less stimulation, further hindering development.\n\nIt's important to note that functional isolation is not just about physical isolation but about the functional capacities of the child being limited due to these factors. Therefore, option C best captures the essence of functional isolation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
