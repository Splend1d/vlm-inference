                    "text": "So, let's see what's going on here. We have this scenario in the country of Sherwood where the average price level tripled, meaning everything costs three times as much as before. And Robin's income went from $30,000 to $60,000. We need to figure out what happened to Robin's nominal and real income.\n\nFirst, let's understand what nominal and real income are.\n\nNominal income is the income in current dollars, without adjusting for inflation. So, it's just the dollar amount you earn at the time. In this case, Robin's nominal income increased from $30,000 to $60,000. That's a straightforward increase, right? So, nominal income increased.\n\nNow, real income is the purchasing power of your income, adjusted for inflation. It tells you how much you can actually buy with your money after accounting for price changes.\n\nGiven that the price level tripled, that means inflation is high. Everything costs three times more than before. So, if Robin's income only increased to $60,000 from $30,000, we need to see if that's enough to keep up with the inflation.\n\nLet's do a little calculation to see what happened to Robin's real income.\n\nFirst, let's assume that initially, with an income of $30,000, Robin could buy a certain amount of goods and services at the initial price level.\n\nNow, the price level has tripled. So, if Robin's income had also tripled, he would have $90,000, which would allow him to buy the same amount of goods and services as before, because prices have tripled.\n\nBut Robin's income only increased to $60,000, which is double the original income, not triple. So, in terms of purchasing power, he can't buy as much as before.\n\nLet me put it another way. Suppose initially, with $30,000, Robin could buy 30,000 units of goods at $1 per unit.\n\nNow, prices have tripled, so each unit costs $3.\n\nWith the new income of $60,000, Robin can buy $60,000 / $3 = 20,000 units.\n\nBut before, he could buy 30,000 units. So, now he can only buy 20,000 units, which is less.\n\nTherefore, his real income has decreased.\n\nSo, nominal income increased (from $30,000 to $60,000), but real income decreased (from being able to buy 30,000 units to only 20,000 units).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Increased Decreased\n\nB. Increased Increased\n\nC. Decreased Decreased\n\nD. Increased Stayed the same\n\nIt seems that option A is correct: nominal income increased, and real income decreased.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nAnother way to look at real income is to adjust nominal income for inflation. The inflation rate here is 200% because prices tripled (from 1 to 3 is a 200% increase).\n\nTo find the real income, we can divide the nominal income by the price index.\n\nLet's assume the initial price index is 100.\n\nIf prices tripled, the new price index is 300.\n\nReal income is nominal income divided by price index, times 100 to get it back to original terms.\n\nSo, initial real income: $30,000 / 100 * 100 = $30,000\n\nNew real income: $60,000 / 300 * 100 = $20,000\n\nYes, so real income decreased from $30,000 to $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: nominal income increased, real income decreased.\n\nBut hold on, is there any other way to interpret this?\n\nSuppose we consider that Robin's income doubled while prices tripled. So, his purchasing power has diminished because prices went up more than his income did.\n\nAlternatively, if his income had kept up with inflation, his real income would have stayed the same.\n\nBut in this case, his income didn't keep up with inflation, so his real income fell.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other factor that might be affecting this.\n\nFor example, if Robin's income increase was due to him working more hours or getting a raise that reflected the inflation, then his real income might have stayed the same.\n\nBut in this scenario, it's not specified that his income increase was due to inflation adjustments.\n\nIt just says that the average price level tripled and his income increased from $30,000 to $60,000.\n\nSo, based on the information given, it seems correct to say that nominal income increased and real income decreased.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
