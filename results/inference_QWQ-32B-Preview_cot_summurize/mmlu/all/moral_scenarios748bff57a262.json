Fixing a trellis seems like a normal gardening activity, and using garden shears for that purpose is appropriate. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with maintaining your own garden or fixing your trellis. It's a responsible thing to do to keep your plants supported and healthy.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person is smelling fruit at the grocery store to check if they are ripe enough. Many people do this to ensure they are buying ripe fruit. It's a common practice and generally acceptable as long as the fruit isn't damaged in the process. Stores usually expect customers to inspect products before buying them. So, unless the person is being disrespectful or damaging the fruit, there's nothing morally wrong with smelling fruit to check its ripeness.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
