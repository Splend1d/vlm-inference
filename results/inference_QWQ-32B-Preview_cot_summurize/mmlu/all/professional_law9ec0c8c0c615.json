She hired an architect to design a high tech office building with an objective of attracting upscale tech-industry tenants. She approached Microhard and secured a lease agreement for over half of the available square footage. The lease was not recorded, but the agreement allowed Denise to attract other wealthy tenants. She also disclosed the Microhard lease on her application for a $1,500,000 construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company. Denise executed a mortgage and related promissory note in favor of Maximum. Maximum recorded the mortgage immediately. The office building was completed and Denise had more tenant demand than available space, so the building opened full. One year later, Denise ran into financial trouble and defaulted on the mortgage. Maximum took possession and immediately notified all the tenants that their leases were cancelled, that they were evicted, and that they must vacate immediately unless they were willing to sign a new lease at double the previous rent. The recording statute in the jurisdiction specified \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\" The tenants retained you to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents.

It's a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what happened:\n\n1. Denise Developer found a commercial property in downtown Pleasantville and wanted to build an office building for tech industries.\n\n2. She secured a lease agreement with Microhard for over half of the available space. This lease wasn't recorded.\n\n3. Denise disclosed the Microhard lease in her application for a $1.5 million construction loan from Maximum Mortgage Company.\n\n4. Denise mortgaged the property to Maximum, and Maximum recorded the mortgage immediately.\n\n5. The building was completed, and Denise had high demand from tenants, so the building was full.\n\n6. One year later, Denise defaulted on the mortgage, and Maximum took possession.\n\n7. Maximum notified all tenants that their leases were canceled and demanded they vacate or sign new leases at double the previous rent.\n\n8. The recording statute in the jurisdiction states that \"every conveyance, encumbrance, or lease not recorded is void as against any subsequent party recording first.\"\n\n9. The tenants hired me to compel Maximum to honor the leases at the lower rents.\n\nNow, I need to advise which statement is the most accurate.\n\nOption A: All the tenants will prevail (unless otherwise in default on their leases), because Maximum loaned money to Denise with actual knowledge that she intended to enter into binding leases with the tenants.\n\nOption B: Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease.\n\nOption C: Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease.\n\nOption D: All the tenants should renegotiate their leases with Maximum.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nStarting with Option A: It suggests that all tenants will prevail because Maximum had actual knowledge that Denise intended to enter into binding leases. But the problem is that only the Microhard lease was mentioned as being disclosed to Maximum. The other leases might not have been disclosed, so it might not apply to all tenants.\n\nOption B: It states that Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had constructive notice of their prior lease. Constructive notice usually means that someone should have known about something if they had done their due diligence, like checking public records. But in this case, the lease wasn't recorded, so perhaps constructive notice doesn't apply.\n\nOption C: This says Microhard is entitled to continue their lease because Maximum had actual notice of their prior lease. This seems promising because Denise disclosed the Microhard lease in her loan application to Maximum. So, Maximum knew about it.\n\nOption D: This\u5efa\u8bae\u6240\u6709\u79df\u6237\u4e0eMaximum\u91cd\u65b0\u8c08\u5224\u79df\u8d41\u5408\u540c\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u7acb\u573a\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3 recording statute \u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6839\u636e\u9898\u610f\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u8f6c\u8ba9\u3001\u8d1f\u62c5\u6216\u79df\u8d41\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9996\u5148\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u65b9\u800c\u8a00\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u3002\n\n\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c Denise\u4e0eMicrohard\u7684\u79df\u8d41\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u800cMaximum\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u62b5\u62bc\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6839\u636erecording statute\uff0cMicrohard\u7684\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u79df\u8d41\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eMaximum\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u62b5\u62bc\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\u3002\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0cMaximum\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5f55\u5728\u5148\u7684\u62b5\u62bc\u6743\u4eba\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u79df\u8d41\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c Denise\u5728\u7533\u8bf7\u8d37\u6b3e\u65f6\u62ab\u9732\u4e86Microhard\u7684\u79df\u8d41\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5Maximum\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08actual notice\uff09 of this lease\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u79df\u8d41\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46Maximum\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e2a\u79df\u8d41\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aDenise\u62ab\u9732\u4e86\u5b83\u3002\n\n\u5728\u8bb8\u591ajurisdictions\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u62b5\u62bc\u6743\u4eba\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08actual notice\uff09 of an unrecorded lease, they are bound by it, even if it's not recorded.\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u79df\u8d41\u672a\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46Maximum\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e2a\u79df\u8d41\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u5c0a\u91cd\u8fd9\u4e2a\u79df\u8d41\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879C\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5373Microhard\u6709\u6743\u7ee7\u7eed\u5176\u79df\u8d41\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aMaximum\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08actual notice\uff09 of the prior lease.\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9009\u9879A\u8bf4\u6240\u6709\u79df\u6237\u90fd\u5c06\u83b7\u80dc\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aMaximum\u77e5\u9053Denise\u6253\u7b97\u8fdb\u5165\u7ed1\u5b9a\u79df\u8d41\u3002\u4f46\u53ea\u6709Microhard\u7684\u79df\u8d41\u88ab\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u79df\u8d41\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5Maximum\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u79df\u8d41\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879A\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5047\u8bbeMaximum\u77e5\u9053\u6240\u6709\u79df\u8d41\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ea\u6709Microhard\u7684\u79df\u8d41\u88ab\u62ab\u9732\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879B\u63d0\u5230\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u77e5\uff08constructive notice\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e2\u7136Maximum\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\u6bd4\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u77e5\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879C\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u518d\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u9009\u9879D\u5efa\u8bae\u6240\u6709\u79df\u6237\u4e0eMaximum\u91cd\u65b0\u8c08\u5224\u79df\u8d41\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u9898\u76ee\u662f\u5bfb\u6c42\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9009\u9879D\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9009\u9879C\u662f\u6700\u51c6\u786e\u7684\uff1aMicrohard\u6709\u6743\u7ee7\u7eed\u5176\u79df\u8d41\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aMaximum\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08actual notice\uff09 of the prior lease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
