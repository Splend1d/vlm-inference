Person-oriented advertising\n\nPerson-oriented advertising is most common in political campaigns because it focuses on raising the public's awareness about a particular person\u2014the candidate\u2014in hopes that they will either support or not support that person. This type of advertising emphasizes the candidate's personality, character, experience, and qualifications, aiming to create a positive image or, in some cases, to discredit an opponent.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are less suitable:\n\nA. Product-oriented advertising: This type of advertising is typically used to promote goods or services, focusing on the features and benefits of the product. While political candidates may have platforms or policies that resemble a \"product,\" the primary focus in political advertising is usually on the candidate themselves.\n\nB. Idea-oriented advertising: This focuses on promoting a particular idea, concept, or ideology. While political campaigns do promote ideas and policies, the central figure in political advertising is still the candidate. The ideas are often tied to the candidate's personality and leadership.\n\nD. Platform-oriented advertising: This would focus specifically on the candidate's platform or set of policies. While important in political campaigns, advertising often balances between promoting policies and presenting the candidate's persona. However, person-oriented advertising is more commonly used to build a connection with voters on a personal level.\n\nIn summary, person-oriented advertising is the most common in political campaigns because it directly targets the candidate's image and appeal, which are crucial factors in swaying public opinion and garnering support."
