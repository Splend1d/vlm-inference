External intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nC. Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nD. External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens during quiet breathing. Quiet inspiration is the normal, relaxed breathing we do at rest. It's not forced or deep; just regular breathing.\n\nI know that the diaphragm is a major muscle involved in breathing. When it contracts, it flattens and moves downward, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity. This decrease in pressure allows air to flow into the lungs. So, the diaphragm is definitely involved in quiet inspiration.\n\nNext, there are the intercostal muscles, which are between the ribs. There are external and internal intercostal muscles. The external intercostal muscles lift the ribs upward and outward, expanding the thoracic cavity and helping to decrease pressure for inspiration. The internal intercostal muscles, on the other hand, pull the ribs downward and inward, which would typically be more involved in expiration.\n\nSo, during quiet inspiration, I would think that the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are the main muscles active. The internal intercostal muscles should be at rest or less active during this phase.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I should consider if both external and internal intercostal muscles are active during quiet inspiration. But I recall that during deep inspiration, both external and internal intercostal muscles may be involved, but for quiet inspiration, it's primarily the external intercostals and the diaphragm.\n\nAlso, during quiet expiration, the muscles are at rest, and expiration is passive due to the elastic recoil of the lungs and the chest wall.\n\nSo, option B seems correct: external intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nBut let me check if the internal intercostal muscles have any role in quiet inspiration. I think during quiet inspiration, the internal intercostal muscles are inactive or may even be slightly lengthened as the ribs move upward and outward due to the external intercostal muscles.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up a reliable source to confirm this. Unfortunately, I don't have access to textbooks right now, but based on my physiology knowledge, I'm going with option B.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that during quiet inspiration, the breathing is minimal and doesn't require much force, so only the primary muscles of inspiration are active, which are the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles.\n\nIn contrast, during forced inspiration, like when taking a deep breath before diving, more muscles come into play, such as the scalene muscles and the sternocleidomastoid muscle, but that's not the case for quiet inspiration.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Diaphragm contracts, flattens, and moves downward.\n\n- External intercostal muscles contract, lifting the ribs upward and outward.\n\n- Internal intercostal muscles are relaxed or inactive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
