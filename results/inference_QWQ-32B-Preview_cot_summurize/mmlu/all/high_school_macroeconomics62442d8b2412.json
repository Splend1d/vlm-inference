                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which fiscal policy combination would slowly increase real GDP without causing a big jump in the price level. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A suggests increasing government spending while decreasing taxes by the same amount. So, the government spends more, which should stimulate the economy, and at the same time, it's giving people more disposable income by cutting taxes. Both of these actions are expansionary fiscal policies, which typically boost economic activity. However, doing both at the same time might be too stimulative and could lead to inflation if the economy is already near full capacity. So, this might not be the best choice for slowly increasing real GDP without putting upward pressure on prices.\n\nOption B is the opposite: decreasing government spending and increasing taxes by the same amount. This sounds like a double whammy of contractionary fiscal policy, which would likely slow down economic growth. If the goal is to slowly increase real GDP, this option seems counterproductive because it's more likely to decrease GDP rather than increase it.\n\nOption C is to increase government spending without changing taxes. This is a straightforward expansionary fiscal policy. It should stimulate economic activity and increase real GDP. However, depending on the size of the increase, it could also put upward pressure on prices if the economy is already operating at or near full capacity.\n\nOption D suggests increasing taxes while also increasing government spending by the same amount. This is an interesting combination. On one hand, increasing taxes could reduce disposable income and dampen private sector spending. On the other hand, increasing government spending would add to aggregate demand. The net effect on real GDP might be minimal if the two actions offset each other. However, if the government spending is more effective in stimulating the economy than the tax increase is in dampening it, there could be a small increase in real GDP.\n\nConsidering the goal is to slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level, option D might be the most appropriate. The increase in government spending could provide a boost to the economy, while the increase in taxes helps to reduce any inflationary pressure by slightly reducing private sector spending. This balanced approach could lead to a gradual increase in real GDP without causing significant inflation.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual effects would depend on various factors, such as the current state of the economy, the specific areas where government spending is increased, and how the tax increases are implemented.\n\nLet me think about this some more. If the economy is operating below full capacity, with some slack, then even option A might not cause much inflation because there are underutilized resources that can absorb the increased demand without leading to price increases. But the question specifies \"without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level,\" so perhaps option D is still safer.\n\nAlternatively, option C could be acceptable if the increase in government spending is modest and targeted towards areas that have a high multiplier effect, thereby stimulating the economy without causing inflation.\n\nBut comparing options C and D, option D has the added benefit of the tax increase, which can help to control any potential inflationary pressures. So, perhaps D is a better choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe option A isn't as inflationary as I initially thought. If the government increases spending and decreases taxes by the same amount, it could stimulate the economy through both channels, but the net effect on the budget deficit might be manageable if the tax cut offsets the spending increase. However, this could still be quite stimulative and potentially inflationary.\n\nOption B is clearly contractionary and would not help in increasing real GDP.\n\nSo, between options C and D, D seems more balanced, as it attempts to stimulate the economy while also being cautious about inflation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better option not listed here, like implementing supply-side policies that increase potential GDP without directly stimulating demand. But since that's not an option, I'll stick with D.\n\nLet me check if there's any other consideration I'm missing. For example, the timing of these policies could be important. If government spending increases take time to implement, the impact on real GDP might be delayed, which could make the policy less effective in the short run.\n\nAlso, the multiplier effects need to be considered. The spending multiplier is typically larger than the tax multiplier, meaning that an increase in government spending has a bigger impact on GDP than an equivalent tax cut. So, in option A, the spending increase and tax cut might not have equal effects on GDP.\n\nGiven that, option A might actually lead to a larger increase in GDP than option D, which could potentially put more upward pressure on prices.\n\nTherefore, option D seems more aligned with the goal of slowly increasing real GDP without causing significant inflation.\n\nI think I've considered enough. I'll go with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
