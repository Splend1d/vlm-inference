                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have an actress who signed a contract with a photographer to get twelve glossy prints that capture her as a gifted dramatic actress with varied talents. The prints were supposed to be delivered by November 15, with payment of $1,500 due thirty days after delivery. There's also a guarantee that the prints would be fully satisfactory and delivered on time.\n\nNow, the photographer had an accident on October 16, broke his leg, and couldn't photograph the actress until October 31. He informed the actress that he needed a few more days beyond November 15 to deliver the prints. The actress said she needed the pictures for her promotional portfolio for an upcoming movie role.\n\nThe photographer worked diligently and delivered the prints on November 18. The manager looked at them and seemed satisfied, but the actress called the next day saying the prints were awful, made her look horrible, and she was sending them back without paying.\n\nSo, if the actress sues the photographer for breach of contract, what's the photographer's best defense among the options given?\n\nOption A: The photographs, if subjectively viewed, were not satisfactory.\n\nOption B: The photographs, if objectively viewed, were not satisfactory.\n\nOption C: The photographs were not delivered on time, thereby resulting in a failure of condition precedent to the actress's liability.\n\nOption D: The photographer's injury constituted a temporary impracticability of performance, which excused his duty to perform for a reasonable period of time.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A: Subjective satisfaction means that the acceptance of the performance depends on the personal judgment or taste of the promisee. In this case, if the contract required the prints to be satisfactory to the actress's subjective view, then she could reject them if she personally doesn't like them, regardless of their actual quality.\n\nHowever, the contract says the photographer \"guarantees that the prints will be fully satisfactory and delivered on time.\" The term \"satisfactory\" could be interpreted either subjectively or objectively. If it's subjective, then the actress's personal satisfaction is the standard. If it's objective, then it's based on what a reasonable person would find satisfactory.\n\nGiven that the contract is between a professional photographer and an actress for promotional purposes, it's possible that \"satisfactory\" is meant to be objective\u2014meaning the prints meet the industry standards for quality and representation.\n\nBut the actress is claiming the prints make her look horrible, which seems like a subjective assessment. So, if the standard is subjective, then the photographer might have a hard time defending against the breach claim.\n\nOption B: If the standard is objective, then the photographer could argue that a reasonable person would find the prints satisfactory, especially since the manager initially seemed satisfied.\n\nHowever, the actress is the one who has to accept the prints, and if her standard is objective, then it's based on reasonable standards, not her personal taste.\n\nBut the contract doesn't specify whether \"satisfactory\" is subjective or objective. In such cases, courts might interpret it as subjective unless the context suggests otherwise.\n\nOption C: This option suggests that the late delivery somehow fails a condition precedent to the actress's liability. A condition precedent is an event or action that must occur before a party's performance becomes due.\n\nIn this contract, the photographer is obligated to deliver the prints by November 15, and the actress is to pay $1,500 thirty days after delivery.\n\nIf the delivery is late, does that mean the condition precedent hasn't been met? Well, the delivery was late by only two days, which might not be significant, especially since the photographer informed the actress in advance about the delay, and she didn't object at that time.\n\nMoreover, the actress's manager accepted the prints initially, suggesting that the late delivery wasn't a major issue.\n\nTherefore, this option seems weak.\n\nOption D: This option invokes the doctrine of temporary impracticability. Impracticability refers to situations where performance becomes extremely difficult or costly due to unforeseen events, making it unjust to require strict compliance with the contract.\n\nIn this case, the photographer's accident was unforeseen and led to a temporary inability to perform. This might qualify as temporary impracticability.\n\nHowever, the photographer did eventually perform, just two days late. So, the impracticability was only temporary, and he was able to make up for the delay.\n\nIn such cases, courts often allow for a reasonable extension of time for performance, especially when the delay is due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the party's control.\n\nGiven that the photographer informed the actress about the delay and she didn't object, it seems reasonable to conclude that the late delivery was acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the photographer's best defense might be that his injury constituted a temporary impracticability, excusing his performance for a reasonable period, and that he eventually delivered the prints with minimal delay.\n\nComparing all options, Option D seems the strongest defense for the photographer.\n\nOption A and B depend on the interpretation of \"satisfactory,\" which is unclear from the contract. If it's subjective, the photographer has a weaker position, but if it's objective, he might have a stronger case.\n\nOption C doesn't seem directly applicable, as the late delivery didn't seem to be a major issue, given the manager's initial acceptance.\n\nTherefore, the photographer's best defense is likely Option D: the injury constituted a temporary impracticability, excusing his performance for a reasonable time, and he ultimately delivered the prints with only a two-day delay.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
