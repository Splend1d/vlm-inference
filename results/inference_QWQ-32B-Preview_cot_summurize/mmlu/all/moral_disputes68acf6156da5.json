The question says it's a war over ideological differences, but it's not a full-blown, sustained military action, and diplomatic relations aren't broken off. The options are a war simpliciter, a hot war, a cold war, or none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA war simpliciter, I think, is just a general term for war without any specific qualifiers. So, it's just war in its basic form.\n\nA hot war, I believe, is one where there's active military fighting going on, like when countries are shooting at each other.\n\nA cold war is something I've heard of, but I'm not entirely sure what it entails. I think it's a state of tension and rivalry between countries without direct military conflict.\n\nGiven that, the description in the question matches what I think a cold war is. It's a war of ideologies, not involving sustained military action, and diplomatic relations are maintained.\n\nLet me double-check the definitions to make sure.\n\nWar simpliciter seems like a straightforward war, without any modifiers. So, it probably refers to a conventional war where there is direct military engagement.\n\nHot war, as I thought, is a war with active fighting and military hostilities.\n\nCold war is a period of political tension and military rivalry between countries, characterized by threats, propaganda, and economic competition, but not direct military action.\n\nThe description in the question fits a cold war perfectly. It's about ideological differences, short of sustained military action, and diplomatic relations are not broken off.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. a cold war.\n\nBut let me consider if there might be another interpretation.\n\nOption D is none of the above, but that seems unlikely since cold war fits the description.\n\nOption A, war simpliciter, doesn't fit because it implies direct military action, which the question says is not sustained or overt.\n\nOption B, hot war, also involves direct military action, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. a cold war.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
