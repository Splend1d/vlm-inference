It's supposed to establish relationships, rights, and responsibilities fairly. The options are Social Contract, Duty Ethics, Consequentialism, and Virtue Ethics. I think it's talking about the Social Contract, but I'm not entirely sure about the differences between these terms.\n\nSo, first, what's a Social Contract? I remember from history class that it's an idea that dates back to philosophers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. The basic idea is that people agree to give up some of their freedoms in exchange for security and order provided by a governing body. It's like a deal between the rulers and the ruled, establishing everyone's rights and responsibilities. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nNow, Duty Ethics, also known as Deontological Ethics, is a moral theory that suggests that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong, under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action. So, it's more about following rules and duties rather than making agreements or contracts.\n\nConsequentialism, on the other hand, is an ethical theory that argues that the consequences of one's conduct are the primary basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. So, it's all about looking at the outcomes to decide if something is moral or not, which doesn't really fit the description in the question.\n\nVirtue Ethics is another ethical theory that emphasizes the character of the moral agent rather than the nature of particular actions. It's about cultivating good character traits and virtues, like courage, generosity, and honesty, rather than focusing on rules or consequences.\n\nComparing all these, the Social Contract seems to be the most fitting answer because it specifically deals with an agreement between society members and their governors regarding rights and responsibilities. The other options are more about different approaches to ethics and morality, but not specifically about a contractual agreement.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options could also relate to the concept in question. For example, Duty Ethics could potentially involve agreements about duties, but it's more about adhering to moral duties and rules rather than a hypothetical agreement between rulers and ruled.\n\nConsequentialism focuses on the outcomes of actions, which might indirectly relate to establishing a fair basis for relationships, but it's not directly about a contract or agreement.\n\nVirtue Ethics is about personal character and virtues, which again doesn't directly relate to a hypothetical agreement between society members and governors.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, the Social Contract is the most appropriate term for describing the hypothetical agreement between members of society and those who govern them, establishing inter-relationships, rights, and responsibilities on a fair basis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
