The options are:\n\nA. Piaget's cognitive development theory\n\nB. Erikson's psychosocial stage theory\n\nC. Kohlberg's moral development theory\n\nD. Ainsworth's social attachment theory\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories is about.\n\nStarting with Piaget's cognitive development theory. I remember that Piaget focused on how children develop thinking and reasoning skills. He proposed stages like sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational periods. So, it's more about cognitive abilities than personality characteristics.\n\nNext, Erikson's psychosocial stage theory. Erikson expanded on Freud's psychosexual stages and proposed eight stages of development spanning from birth to old age. Each stage presents a crisis that needs to be resolved for healthy development. These crises influence personality development. For example, trust vs. mistrust in infancy, initiative vs. guilt in preschool, identity vs. role confusion in adolescence, and so on.\n\nThen, Kohlberg's moral development theory. Kohlberg focused on how moral reasoning develops through stages. He proposed three levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional, each with two stages. This theory is about moral judgment and ethics, not directly about personality characteristics.\n\nLastly, Ainsworth's social attachment theory. Mary Ainsworth is known for her work on attachment styles, particularly the strange situation experiment, which classifies attachment into secure, avoidant, and resistant attachments. This theory focuses on early relationships and bonding, mainly in infancy, and how they influence later relationships and behaviors.\n\nNow, considering the question is about how experiences across various life stages influence later personality characteristics, it seems like Erikson's psychosocial stage theory is the most comprehensive and directly relevant. It covers all the stages from infancy to old age and links experiences in each stage to specific aspects of personality development.\n\nPiaget's theory is more about cognitive development, Kohlberg's about moral development, and Ainsworth's about attachment and relationships, but Erikson's theory specifically addresses psychosocial development and its impact on personality across the entire lifespan.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Erikson's psychosocial stage theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
