                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.\n\nFirst, what is an integral domain? It's a commutative ring with unity (1 \u2260 0) and no zero divisors. Characteristic 0 means that the smallest positive integer n such that n\u00b71 = 0 is n = 0, which essentially means that no finite sum of 1's equals zero.\n\nNow, in an integral domain with characteristic 0, consider the elements 0, 1, 1+1, 1+1+1, and so on. Since the characteristic is 0, none of these sums can be zero unless we have added zero times. Therefore, all these elements are distinct. This implies that the ring has infinitely many elements, hence it is infinite.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\n\nAgain, in an integral domain, the characteristic is either 0 or a prime number. This is because if the characteristic were composite, say pq, then (p)(q) = pq\u00b71 = 0, which would imply that p\u00b71 or q\u00b71 is zero, contradicting the minimality of the characteristic.\n\nSo, in an integral domain, the characteristic is either 0 or a prime number.\n\nNow, consider an integral domain with prime characteristic p. Does this imply that the domain is finite?\n\nConsider the field of rational numbers, Q. It has characteristic 0 because you need to add 1 to itself infinitely many times to get 0. But consider the field Z/pZ, which is the integers modulo p, where p is prime. This is an integral domain (in fact, a field) with characteristic p, and it is finite, having p elements.\n\nHowever, there are infinite integral domains with prime characteristic as well. For example, consider the ring of polynomials over Z/pZ, denoted as (Z/pZ)[x]. This is an integral domain because Z/pZ is a field, and polynomial rings over fields are integral domains. The characteristic of this ring is p, since the characteristic of Z/pZ is p, and it is infinite because there are infinitely many polynomials of increasing degrees.\n\nTherefore, not every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite. There are infinite integral domains with prime characteristic.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStatement 1: True\nStatement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
