                    "text": "In the Classical model, the aggregate supply curve is vertical, indicating that the economy's output is determined solely by its productive capacity, regardless of the price level. This means that in the long run, changes in aggregate demand only affect the price level, not the quantity of output.\n\nHowever, if we consider a shift in the aggregate supply curve itself, such as a leftward shift, it implies that for any given price level, the economy can produce less output. This could be due to factors like a decrease in the labor force, a reduction in capital stock, or a decline in productivity.\n\nGiven that the aggregate supply curve shifts to the left, and assuming the aggregate demand curve remains unchanged, the new equilibrium will occur at a higher price level and a lower quantity of output.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Initial Equilibrium**: The economy is at equilibrium where the aggregate demand curve intersects the initial vertical aggregate supply curve. Let's call this equilibrium price level P1 and equilibrium output Y1.\n\n2. **Shift in Aggregate Supply**: The aggregate supply curve shifts to the left due to a negative supply shock. This could be because of an increase in input prices, a natural disaster, or other factors that reduce the economy's productive capacity.\n\n3. **New Equilibrium**: The new aggregate supply curve is now to the left of the initial one. The aggregate demand curve intersects this new supply curve at a higher price level, say P2, and a lower quantity of output, Y2.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The equilibrium price level increases while the equilibrium quantity of output decreases.\n\n**Additional Insight**:\n\nIt's important to note that in the Classical model, the economy is assumed to always be at full employment in the long run. However, in the short run, aggregate supply can be upward sloping or vertical, depending on the specific assumptions about wages and prices. In this case, assuming a vertical aggregate supply curve, a leftward shift would indeed lead to higher prices and lower output.\n\n**Graphical Representation**:\n\nImagine a graph with the price level on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. The initial aggregate supply curve is a vertical line at Y1. The aggregate demand curve intersects this at point (P1, Y1). When the aggregate supply curve shifts left to a new vertical line at Y2 (where Y2 < Y1), the new intersection with the aggregate demand curve occurs at (P2, Y2), where P2 > P1 and Y2 < Y1.\n\n**Policy Implications**:\n\nThis scenario suggests that if there is a negative supply shock, such as a sudden increase in oil prices or a natural disaster that destroys capital, the economy will experience stagflation\u2014higher inflation and lower output. Policymakers may need to consider both inflationary and recessionary pressures when formulating responses.\n\n**Comparative Analysis with Other Models**:\n\nIn contrast, in the Keynesian model, the aggregate supply curve can be horizontal or upward sloping in the short run, implying that a leftward shift in aggregate supply could lead to different outcomes depending on the slope of the AS curve and the position relative to aggregate demand.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nUnderstanding how shifts in aggregate supply affect equilibrium price levels and output is crucial for grasping macroeconomic fluctuations and policy responses. In the context of a Classical vertical aggregate supply curve, a leftward shift unambiguously leads to higher prices and lower output.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
