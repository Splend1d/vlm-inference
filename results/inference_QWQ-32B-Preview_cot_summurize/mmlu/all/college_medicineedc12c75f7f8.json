                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about codons. So, codons are kind of like the building blocks that tell cells which amino acids to use when they're making proteins. It's all part of the bigger process called protein synthesis, which is essential for life.\n\nNow, the question is asking about what codons are composed of. We have four options here:\n\nA. Triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\n\nB. Quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\n\nC. Triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains.\n\nD. Triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.\n\nFirst off, let's remember what a codon is. A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides that corresponds to a specific amino acid (or sometimes a stop signal). These codons are read by the cell during translation, which is when the information in mRNA is used to assemble amino acids into proteins.\n\nOption A says \"triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.\" That sounds familiar. DNA and mRNA both contain nucleotide bases, and codons are indeed sequences of three of these bases. DNA has the bases Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G), while mRNA has A, U (Uracil), C, and G. So, codons can be found in both DNA and mRNA.\n\nOption B mentions \"quadruplet sequences,\" which suggests four nucleotides. But we know that codons are triplets, meaning three nucleotides, not four. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C talks about \"triplet sequences of amino acids in polypeptide chains.\" Now, polypeptide chains are made up of amino acids, and the sequence of amino acids is determined by the codons in mRNA. However, the codons themselves are made of nucleotides, not amino acids. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption D says \"triplet sequences of deoxyribose sugars in DNA.\" Deoxyribose is a type of sugar that's part of the DNA molecule, but codons are sequences of bases, not sugars. So, this doesn't make sense either.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like option A is the correct answer. Codons are triplet sequences of nucleotide bases found in both mRNA and DNA.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about why codons are triplets. The genetic code is based on triplets because there are four different nucleotide bases, and 4^3 equals 64 possible combinations. That's more than enough to code for the 20 standard amino acids, with some codons serving as stop signals.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that while DNA contains the genetic information in the form of codons, it's the mRNA that carries this information from the DNA to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs. So, codons are present in both DNA and mRNA, but they serve different roles in each.\n\nIn summary, codons are triplet sequences of nucleotide bases found in mRNA and DNA, which correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals in protein synthesis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
