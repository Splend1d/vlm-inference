                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"A 10-\u03a9 resistor carries 10 A. The voltage across the resistor is\n\nA. 0\nB. more than 0 but less than 10 V\nC. 10 V\nD. more than 10 V\"\n\nOkay, so I need to find the voltage across a resistor when I know the resistance and the current passing through it. I remember there's a basic formula that relates voltage, current, and resistance. It's Ohm's Law, right?\n\nOhm's Law states that the voltage across a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, with the proportionality constant being the resistance. Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n\nV = I \u00d7 R\n\nWhere:\n\n- V is the voltage in volts (V)\n\n- I is the current in amperes (A)\n\n- R is the resistance in ohms (\u03a9)\n\nSo, in this case, I have:\n\nI = 10 A\n\nR = 10 \u03a9\n\nPlugging these values into Ohm's Law:\n\nV = 10 A \u00d7 10 \u03a9 = 100 V\n\nWait, but that doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"A 10-\u03a9 resistor carries 10 A. The voltage across the resistor is\n\nA. 0\n\nB. more than 0 but less than 10 V\n\nC. 10 V\n\nD. more than 10 V\"\n\nHmm, according to my calculation, it should be 100 V, which is more than 10 V. So, option D seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I misremembered Ohm's Law. Is there any possibility that the voltage is less than 10 V with these values?\n\nLet's see, if I had a resistance of 1 \u03a9 and a current of 10 A, the voltage would be 10 V. But here, the resistance is 10 \u03a9, so the voltage should be higher.\n\nAlternatively, if the resistance was less than 1 \u03a9, say 0.1 \u03a9, then 10 A would give 1 V, which is less than 10 V. But in this case, the resistance is 10 \u03a9, which is higher, so the voltage should be higher as well.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the options. According to Ohm's Law, it should be 100 V, but that's not listed here. The options go up to more than 10 V, which would include 100 V, I suppose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem. Maybe the resistor is part of a larger circuit, and I need to consider other components. But the question only mentions the resistor and the current through it, so perhaps it's a straightforward application of Ohm's Law.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility of the voltage being zero. If there's current flowing through a resistor, there has to be a voltage across it, unless the resistance is zero, which would be a short circuit. But here, the resistance is 10 \u03a9, so option A is definitely incorrect.\n\nOption B says more than 0 but less than 10 V. As I calculated, it should be 100 V, which is more than 10 V, so B is not correct.\n\nOption C is 10 V, which would be the voltage if the resistance was 1 \u03a9 with 10 A, but here it's 10 \u03a9, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is more than 10 V, which aligns with my calculation of 100 V.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. more than 10 V.\n\nBut I'm still a bit puzzled because 100 V seems like a straightforward application of Ohm's Law, and I'm not sure why the options don't include a specific value or at least indicate a range. Maybe the intention was to have options that cover different scenarios, and \"more than 10 V\" is the appropriate choice given the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the question, and the resistance or current values are misstated. For example, if the resistor was 1 \u03a9 instead of 10 \u03a9, then the voltage would be 10 V, which is option C. But as it stands, with 10 \u03a9 and 10 A, the voltage should be 100 V.\n\nIn any case, based on Ohm's Law and the given values, the voltage across the resistor is 100 V, which falls under option D. more than 10 V.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
