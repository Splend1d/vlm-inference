So, the correct answer is B.\n\nNPM emerged in the 1980s and 1990s as a response to perceived inefficiencies in public administration. It emphasizes concepts such as competition, customer focus, performance measurement, and accountability, which are commonly found in private sector management.\n\nOption A, profit maximization, is a key goal in the private sector but not typically in the public sector, where the focus is on providing public services rather than generating profits.\n\nOption C, replacing public management with private sector management, is not accurate because NPM aims to adapt private sector principles to improve public management, not to completely replace it with private management.\n\nOption D, restructuring public organizations, is a part of NPM but is too narrow to capture the overall guiding principle. NPM involves more than just restructuring; it's about changing the way public services are managed and delivered by adopting business-like approaches.\n\nSo, the core idea is to bring in private sector efficiency and management practices into the public sector to improve service delivery and accountability."
