                    "text": "Let's see. I have two scenarios here and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I saw the squirrel trapped and set it free.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I saved the child who was about to fall into a hole.\"\n\nSo, I need to think about whether in either of these scenarios, the main character is doing something that would be considered morally wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: setting a trapped squirrel free. Generally, in the US, there's a lot of appreciation for animals and nature. Rescuing an animal that's trapped would usually be seen as a kind and positive action. I can't think of any moral wrongdoing in helping a squirrel or any other animal in distress. In fact, it's often encouraged to help animals in need.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: saving a child from falling into a hole. This seems like an even clearer case of doing something morally right. Protecting children from harm is a fundamental moral obligation in most societies, including the US. Saving a child from danger is something that would be praised, not condemned.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve positive, morally acceptable actions. There doesn't appear to be any moral wrongdoing in either scenario.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's consider if there could be any circumstances where these actions might be considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1: setting a squirrel free. What if the squirrel was trapped for a good reason, like it was causing damage somewhere, or it was sick and needed to be contained for public health reasons? In those cases, setting it free might not be the best action. However, the scenario just says \"trapped,\" without any context about why it was trapped. So, without additional information, it's hard to conclude that setting it free is wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2: saving a child. It's hard to imagine a situation where saving a child from falling into a hole would be considered wrong, unless perhaps the child was in danger due to their own reckless behavior and the saver interfered in a way that escalated the risk, but again, the scenario is straightforward: \"saved the child who was about to fall into a hole.\" This sounds like a clear act of rescue.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
