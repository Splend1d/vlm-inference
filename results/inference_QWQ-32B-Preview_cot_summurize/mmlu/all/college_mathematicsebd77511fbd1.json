                    "text": "So I've got this problem: \"Suppose today is Wednesday. What day of the week will it be 10^(10^(10)) days from now?\" And the options are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 10^(10^(10)) means. That's a really big number! 10^10 is 10 billion, and then 10^(10^10) is 10 raised to the power of 10 billion. That's an astronomically large number.\n\nBut I don't need to calculate the exact value because I'm dealing with days of the week, which repeat every 7 days. So, I can find the remainder when 10^(10^(10)) is divided by 7. That will tell me how many days beyond complete weeks there are.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding 10^(10^(10)) mod 7.\n\nFirst, let's see what 10 mod 7 is. 10 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 3. So, 10 \u2261 3 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10^(10)) \u2261 3^(10^(10)) mod 7.\n\nNow, I need to find 3^(10^(10)) mod 7.\n\nThis is still a huge exponent, so I can use Euler's theorem to simplify it. Euler's theorem says that if a and n are coprime, then a^(\u03c6(n)) \u2261 1 mod n, where \u03c6 is Euler's totient function.\n\nHere, n is 7, which is prime, so \u03c6(7) = 6.\n\nSo, 3^6 \u2261 1 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, I can reduce the exponent modulo 6.\n\nSo, 3^(10^(10)) mod 7 \u2261 3^(10^(10) mod 6) mod 7.\n\nNow, I need to find 10^(10) mod 6.\n\n10 divided by 6 is 1 with a remainder of 4, so 10 \u2261 4 mod 6.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10) \u2261 4^(10) mod 6.\n\nNow, 4 mod 6 is 4, and 4^2 = 16, which is 16 mod 6 = 4.\n\nSo, 4 raised to any positive integer power is congruent to 4 mod 6.\n\nTherefore, 4^(10) \u2261 4 mod 6.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10) \u2261 4 mod 6.\n\nTherefore, 3^(10^(10)) \u2261 3^4 mod 7.\n\nNow, 3^4 = 81.\n\n81 divided by 7 is 11 with a remainder of 4, since 7*11=77 and 81-77=4.\n\nSo, 3^4 \u2261 4 mod 7.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10^(10)) days from now is equivalent to 4 days from now.\n\nIf today is Wednesday, then 4 days from now would be:\n\nWednesday + 1 = Thursday\n\nThursday + 1 = Friday\n\nFriday + 1 = Saturday\n\nSaturday + 1 = Sunday\n\nSo, 4 days from Wednesday is Sunday.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Sunday.\n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 10 \u2261 3 mod 7, so 10^(10^(10)) \u2261 3^(10^(10)) mod 7.\n\nThen, using Euler's theorem, since \u03c6(7)=6, and 3 and 7 are coprime, 3^6 \u2261 1 mod 7.\n\nSo, 3^(10^(10)) \u2261 3^(10^(10) mod 6) mod 7.\n\nThen, 10 \u2261 4 mod 6, so 10^(10) \u2261 4^(10) mod 6.\n\nAnd 4^(any positive integer) \u2261 4 mod 6.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10) \u2261 4 mod 6.\n\nTherefore, 3^(10^(10)) \u2261 3^4 mod 7.\n\n3^4 = 81, and 81 mod 7 is indeed 4.\n\nTherefore, 10^(10^(10)) days from now is 4 days from Wednesday, which is Sunday.\n\nSo, the answer is Sunday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Sunday}} \\]"
