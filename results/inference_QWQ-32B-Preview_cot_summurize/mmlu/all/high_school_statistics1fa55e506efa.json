                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about Tina's science fair project. She estimated the mean amount of chemicals in her city\u2019s water supply. Initially, she planned to use 15 observations, but her teacher asked her to increase it to 35. Surprisingly, the mean and standard deviation from 35 observations were about the same as from 15 observations. Now, the question is whether there's any advantage in using 35 observations instead of 15.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the goal is here. Tina is trying to estimate the mean amount of chemicals in the water supply. To do this, she's taking samples and calculating the sample mean and standard deviation. Then, she's probably using these to create a confidence interval for the true mean.\n\nSo, the key here is understanding how the sample size affects the confidence interval.\n\nI recall that the width of a confidence interval for the mean is influenced by the sample size. Specifically, as the sample size increases, the standard error of the mean decreases, which leads to a narrower confidence interval, assuming the standard deviation remains constant.\n\nWait a minute, in this case, the standard deviation from 35 observations is about the same as from 15 observations. So, if the standard deviation doesn't change much with the larger sample size, does that mean the advantage of a larger sample size is diminished?\n\nLet me recall the formula for the confidence interval for the mean. For a large sample size, it's approximately:\n\nsample mean \u00b1 (critical value) * (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nOr, for small samples, it's similar but uses the t-distribution instead of the z-distribution.\n\nIn either case, the standard error is standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nSo, if the standard deviation stays roughly the same, but the sample size increases from 15 to 35, then the standard error should decrease because the denominator increases.\n\nTherefore, the margin of error in the confidence interval should be smaller with the larger sample size.\n\nThat suggests that the confidence interval with 35 observations should be narrower than with 15 observations.\n\nWait, but option C says there's no advantage because the confidence interval with 35 observations will be wider. That seems contrary to what I just thought.\n\nOption D says there is some advantage because the confidence interval with 35 observations will be narrower. That aligns with my current understanding.\n\nBut let me think about this more carefully. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nAnother consideration is the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution. With a smaller sample size, the t-distribution has fatter tails, which means the critical value is larger, leading to a wider confidence interval.\n\nSo, increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 would decrease the degrees of freedom from, say, n-1=14 to n-1=34.\n\nWait, actually, degrees of freedom increase with sample size, so with 35 observations, df=34, which is larger than df=14 with 15 observations.\n\nAnd as df increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution, meaning the critical value decreases.\n\nSo, with a larger sample size, not only is the standard error smaller, but also the critical value is smaller, leading to an even narrower confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 should result in a narrower confidence interval, assuming the sample mean and standard deviation remain approximately the same.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says there's no advantage because the mean and standard deviation are about the same, so the confidence intervals should be approximately the same.\n\nBut as I just thought, even if the mean and standard deviation are the same, the standard error decreases with larger sample size, leading to a narrower confidence interval.\n\nSo, this isn't correct.\n\nOption B says there's no advantage and that the 20 extra observations will increase the likelihood of error.\n\nBut actually, increasing the sample size generally reduces the margin of error and makes the estimate more precise, assuming the sampling is done properly.\n\nSo, this doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C says there's no advantage because the confidence interval with 35 observations will be wider.\n\nBut based on my understanding, it should be narrower, not wider.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: there is some advantage because the confidence interval with 35 observations will be narrower.\n\nWait, but the question says that the mean and standard deviation from 35 observations are approximately the same as those from 15 observations.\n\nDoes this affect anything?\n\nWell, the sample mean and standard deviation are used to estimate the population parameters, but the standard error is standard deviation divided by sqrt(n).\n\nSo, even if s is the same, s/sqrt(n) will be smaller with larger n.\n\nTherefore, the standard error decreases, leading to a narrower confidence interval.\n\nSo, despite the sample mean and standard deviation being similar, the confidence interval should still be narrower with the larger sample size.\n\nThus, option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
