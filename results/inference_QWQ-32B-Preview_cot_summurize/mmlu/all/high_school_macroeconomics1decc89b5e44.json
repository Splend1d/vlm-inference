Hmm.\n\nOption A says it won't affect the demand right now. But that doesn't sound right. If I think something is going to cost more later, I might want to buy it now before it gets more expensive.\n\nOption B says it will decrease the demand. That seems opposite to what I was thinking. If people expect prices to go up, wouldn't they buy more now, not less?\n\nOption C says it won't affect demand now or later. But that can't be right because if people expect prices to increase, their behavior might change both now and in the future.\n\nOption D says it will increase the demand for the product. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. If prices are going up, people might rush to buy it now to avoid paying more later.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. If people expect prices to increase, and they buy more now, that could deplete the current supply, which might actually cause the price to go up even sooner or higher than expected. But that's a bit complicated.\n\nLet me think about a real-life example. Like, if there's a rumor that a popular toy's price is going to increase before the holiday season, what do people do? They probably rush to buy it earlier to get it at the current price.\n\nSo, in that case, the demand increases before the price increase actually happens.\n\nBut maybe some people would wait if they think the price is going to go up because they might think it will come down after a while. But that seems less likely.\n\nOverall, it seems that if people expect prices to increase, they might try to buy the product sooner rather than later to avoid paying more.\n\nTherefore, the demand for the product right now would increase.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. this will increase the demand for the product.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any economic principle that supports this?\n\nYes, in economics, expectations about future prices can affect current demand. If consumers expect prices to rise, they may accelerate their purchases to avoid higher costs in the future, thus increasing current demand.\n\nOn the other hand, if they expect prices to fall, they might delay their purchases, hoping to get a better deal later, which would decrease current demand.\n\nSo, in this case, expecting prices to increase should lead to an increase in current demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
