                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem about property restrictions. So, there's a man and his neighbor who both own homes in a subdivision, and they agreed not to put detached storage sheds in their yards because they think they're unsightly. They wrote this agreement and recorded it, and it says it's enforceable against their heirs and successors. Then, three years later, the neighbor gives his home to his daughter, and she wants to put a shed in her backyard, saying the restriction doesn't apply to her. The question is, does the man have the right to stop her from putting up the shed?\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's going on here. They live in a subdivision, and there are recorded restrictions, but those don't prohibit storage sheds. So, sheds are allowed by the general rules of the subdivision. But the man and his neighbor made their own private agreement not to have sheds in their yards. They put it in writing, recorded it, and it's binding on their heirs and successors.\n\nNow, the neighbor gives his house to his daughter, and she wants to put a shed in her yard, saying the restriction doesn't apply to her. The man wants to know if he can get a court to stop her from putting up the shed.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because several homeowners in the subdivision have storage sheds in their yards.\n\nB. No, because there was no horizontal privity between the man and the neighbor.\n\nC. Yes, because the neighbor conveyed the home to the daughter by gift rather than by sale.\n\nD. Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nOkay, starting with option A: No, because several homeowners have sheds in their yards. Well, the subdivision's restrictions don't prohibit sheds, and some people have them. But the man and his neighbor made a separate agreement not to have sheds. So, the fact that others have sheds might not affect their private agreement. Maybe the agreement still stands between them.\n\nOption B: No, because there was no horizontal privity between the man and the neighbor. Horizontal privity is a legal concept that refers to the relationship between parties to a covenant in the same chain of title. I think this might be relevant. For a covenant to run with the land and bind successors, there needs to be horizontal privity between the original parties. If there wasn't horizontal privity, then maybe the restriction doesn't bind the daughter.\n\nOption C: Yes, because the neighbor conveyed the home to the daughter by gift rather than by sale. I'm not sure about this. The way the restriction is worded, it says it's enforceable against assignees, heirs, and successors, regardless of how the property is conveyed. So, whether it's a sale or a gift, it should still apply, right?\n\nOption D: Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor. This seems plausible because the agreement says it's binding on heirs and successors, and the daughter is the neighbor's heir through the gift.\n\nWait a minute, the neighbor gave the house to his daughter, so she's his heir. The agreement says it's enforceable against heirs and successors. So, it seems like it should bind the daughter.\n\nBut option B mentions horizontal privity, which might be a legal requirement for the covenant to run with the land. Maybe without horizontal privity, the restriction isn't enforceable against the daughter.\n\nLet me think about horizontal privity. Horizontal privity is typically present in a conveyance, like a sale, where there's a mutual interest in the land at the time the covenant is made. In this case, the man and the neighbor are two separate property owners making an agreement between themselves. They're not in the same chain of title.\n\nSo, perhaps there's no horizontal privity between them. If that's the case, then the covenant might not run with the land, meaning it doesn't bind subsequent owners like the daughter.\n\nBut the agreement was recorded, and it says it's enforceable against heirs and successors. Does that make a difference?\n\nI think in property law, for a covenant to be enforceable against successors, there needs to be privity of estate or privity of contract. Here, there's privity of contract between the original parties, but the daughter wasn't a party to the original agreement.\n\nHowever, since the agreement expressly states that it's binding on heirs and successors, and it was recorded, perhaps that's enough to make it binding on the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, if there was no horizontal privity, some courts might not enforce the restriction against the daughter.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's consider the fact that the subdivision's recorded restrictions don't prohibit sheds. So, the general rules allow sheds, but the man and his neighbor made a private agreement not to have them.\n\nNow, when the neighbor conveys the property to his daughter, she's bound by the recorded restrictions of the subdivision, but does she have to honor this private agreement between her father and the man?\n\nSince the agreement was recorded and says it's binding on heirs and successors, it's likely that a court would enforce it against the daughter.\n\nOption C says yes, because the conveyance was by gift rather than sale. I don't think the manner of conveyance should make a difference. Whether it's a sale or a gift, the daughter is still the successor in title.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is the correct answer: Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nBut option B suggests that there was no horizontal privity, which might mean the restriction isn't enforceable against the daughter.\n\nI need to decide between B and D.\n\nLet me look up horizontal privity in this context.\n\nHorizontal privity is the relationship between the original parties to the covenant at the time it was created. It usually requires that both parties have an interest in the same land or that there's a mutual benefit or burden arising from the covenant.\n\nIn this case, the man and the neighbor are adjacent property owners making an agreement between themselves. They're not in the same chain of title, so there might not be horizontal privity.\n\nIf there's no horizontal privity, then the covenant may not run with the land, meaning it doesn't bind subsequent owners like the daughter.\n\nHowever, since the agreement was recorded and states that it's binding on heirs and successors, perhaps that language overcomes the lack of horizontal privity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the agreement can be enforced against the daughter through the doctrine of equitable servitudes.\n\nEquitable servitudes can be enforced if the original parties intended the restriction to run with the land and if the restriction touches and concerns the land.\n\nIn this case, the agreement was in recordable form, recorded, and states it's binding on heirs and successors, which suggests an intention for it to run with the land.\n\nAlso, the restriction relates to the use of the land (i.e., not placing storage sheds), which touches and concerns the land.\n\nTherefore, even without horizontal privity, the restriction might still be enforceable against the daughter as an equitable servitude.\n\nGiven that, option D seems correct: Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the fact that other homeowners have sheds doesn't affect the private agreement between the man and the neighbor.\n\nOption B might be misleading because, in some jurisdictions, the lack of horizontal privity doesn't necessarily prevent the enforcement of the restriction if it meets the requirements for an equitable servitude.\n\nOption C is irrelevant because the manner of conveyance (gift vs. sale) shouldn't affect the enforceability of the restriction against the daughter.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D: Yes, because the restriction is binding on the daughter as a successor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
