                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Mulholland's argument on how privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers. The options are a bit tricky, and I need to think carefully about what privatization typically entails and how it might affect management.\n\nFirst, let's recall what privatization is. Privatization is when a government transfers ownership of a business, industry, or service from the public sector to the private sector. This often involves selling off state-owned enterprises to private investors or companies.\n\nNow, Mulholland in 1998 would be discussing the effects of privatization on the relationship between companies and their managers. So, I need to consider how privatization might alter the dynamics between the owners of the company (now private owners after privatization) and the managers who run the day-to-day operations.\n\nOption A says that flexibility was reduced by the introduction of detailed daily worksheets. Hmm, that seems a bit specific and not directly related to the broader changes brought about by privatization. Privatization is more about changing ownership and control structures rather than implementing specific managerial tools like detailed worksheets. So, I'll probably rule this one out.\n\nOption B states that the state had greater control than managers over production processes. But wait, privatization is about transferring control from the state to private entities. So, after privatization, the state should have less control, not more. Therefore, this option seems contradictory to the nature of privatization. Likely not the correct choice.\n\nOption C says that ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers. Well, privatization usually involves transferring ownership from the state to private shareholders, which could include a variety of investors, not necessarily just senior managers. It's possible that senior managers could buy shares or be given shares as part of the privatization process, but it's not necessarily the main feature. This seems a bit too narrow.\n\nOption D says that employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment. This seems plausible. In a state-owned enterprise, there might be more job security, and employment could be based on seniority or other factors besides pure performance. After privatization, private owners might place a greater emphasis on performance metrics to ensure profitability and competitiveness. This could lead to a situation where managers' employment is more tied to their performance outcomes.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Privatization often brings in new management practices focused on efficiency and profitability. This could mean that managers are evaluated more strictly based on performance indicators, and their continued employment is contingent on meeting those targets. In contrast, in a state-owned enterprise, there might be more emphasis on stability and job security, with employment based on trust and long-term commitment rather than solely on performance.\n\nAlso, with privatization, there might be more pressure to cut costs and improve efficiency, which could lead to a performance-based culture where only the most productive managers are retained. This aligns with option D.\n\nFurthermore, privatization can lead to a clearer alignment of ownership and control, where owners have more direct influence over management decisions. This could mean that managers are held more accountable for their performance, as owners seek to maximize returns on their investment.\n\nIn contrast, in a state-owned enterprise, the objectives might be more diverse, including social objectives or political considerations, which could lead to a different approach to managing employees.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the most accurate reflection of how privatization changes the relationship between companies and managers, according to Mulholland's argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
