                    "text": "So I've got this question here about cross-price elasticity of demand. It says that a positive sign on cross-price elasticity of demand indicates that the two products are... and then it gives options: luxuries, necessities, substitutes, or complements. Hmm, I need to figure out what a positive cross-price elasticity means in terms of the relationship between these two products.\n\nFirst off, I remember that cross-price elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. So, it's basically looking at the relationship between the price of one product and the demand for another product.\n\nNow, the sign of the cross-price elasticity tells us about the type of relationship between the two products. If the cross-price elasticity is positive, that means that when the price of one product increases, the quantity demanded of the other product also increases. Conversely, if the price decreases, the quantity demanded of the other product decreases.\n\nLet me think about what that implies. If two products have a positive cross-price elasticity, it suggests that they are substitutes. Substitutes are goods that can be used in place of each other. So, if the price of one substitute goes up, people will tend to buy more of the other substitute because it becomes relatively cheaper.\n\nFor example, consider coffee and tea. If the price of coffee increases, some people might switch to buying more tea instead. So, the quantity demanded of tea would increase when the price of coffee increases, indicating a positive cross-price elasticity between coffee and tea.\n\nOn the other hand, if two products are complements, their cross-price elasticity would be negative. Complements are goods that are used together. So, if the price of one complement increases, the quantity demanded of the other complement decreases because the higher price makes the overall combination more expensive.\n\nFor instance, consider cars and gasoline. If the price of gasoline increases, people might buy fewer cars or drive less, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded of cars. So, the cross-price elasticity between cars and gasoline would be negative.\n\nNecessities and luxuries are categories of goods based on their income elasticity of demand, not their cross-price elasticity. Necessities have low income elasticity, meaning that their demand doesn't change much with income changes, while luxuries have high income elasticity, meaning that their demand is more sensitive to income changes.\n\nBut in this question, we're talking about cross-price elasticity, which is about how the demand for one good changes in response to the price change of another good, not about how demand changes with income.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA. Luxuries \u2013 that's about income elasticity, not cross-price elasticity.\n\nB. Necessities \u2013 same as above.\n\nC. Substitutes \u2013 this seems to fit because substitutes have a positive cross-price elasticity.\n\nD. Complements \u2013 these have a negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. substitutes.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider another example. Suppose we have two types of fruits: apples and oranges. If the price of apples goes up, people might buy more oranges instead. So, the quantity demanded of oranges increases when the price of apples increases, indicating a positive cross-price elasticity, which again suggests that apples and oranges are substitutes.\n\nAnother example could be butter and margarine. If the price of butter increases, people might switch to margarine, increasing its quantity demanded. Again, positive cross-price elasticity indicates substitutes.\n\nIn contrast, if we look at complements like pizza and pizza toppings, an increase in the price of pizza might lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded of pizza toppings, resulting in a negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nSo, overall, it seems clear that a positive cross-price elasticity indicates that the two products are substitutes.\n\nI think I've got it now. The answer is C. substitutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
