So, I need to figure out which one correctly describes what an appeal to fear is.\n\nFirst, I should understand what an appeal to fear is. From what I know about logical fallacies, an appeal to fear is a type of emotional appeal where someone tries to convince you to agree with them by making you afraid of what might happen if you don't. It's like using scare tactics to influence your decision.\n\nOption A says: \"arguing something should be done only because it will make the person doing it feel good.\" Hmm, that sounds more like an appeal to pleasure or ego, not fear. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption B says: \"arguing someone should do something only because of ill will towards someone else.\" This seems more like appealing to malice or envy. Not directly related to fear.\n\nOption C says: \"arguing actions should be taken to avoid exaggerated, unlikely, or irrelevant negative results.\" This sounds a lot like appealing to fear. When someone exaggerates the negative consequences to scare you into taking a certain action, that's an appeal to fear. So, this seems promising.\n\nOption D says: \"characterizing an opponent's position in a way that makes it seem silly.\" That sounds like a straw man fallacy, where you misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack.\n\nComparing these options, Option C seems to best describe an appeal to fear. It mentions arguing for actions based on exaggerated or unlikely negative outcomes, which is exactly what an appeal to fear does. It tries to instill fear by painting a worst-case scenario, even if it's not very likely.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Arguing actions should be taken to avoid exaggerated, unlikely, or irrelevant negative results.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
