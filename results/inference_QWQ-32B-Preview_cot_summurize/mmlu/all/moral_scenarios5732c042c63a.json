The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I viewed an old pirate ship that washed up.\"\n\nOkay, so someone is looking at an old pirate ship that has washed up on shore. Is there anything morally wrong with that? Well, viewing something that's already there, especially if it's on public property, doesn't seem unethical. People look at abandoned ships or wrecks out of curiosity or interest in history. Unless there are specific regulations against approaching such sites, or if the ship contains hazardous materials, there doesn't seem to be a moral issue here. So, I think this one is \"not wrong.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"The ladies' flower garden was so beautiful I just had to pick some of them.\"\n\nHere, someone sees a beautiful flower garden owned by ladies and decides to pick some flowers from it. Now, picking flowers from someone else's garden without permission is generally considered disrespectful and unethical. It's invading someone's private property and taking something without consent. In the US, property rights are important, and respecting others' possessions is a key moral standard. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, the first scenario is \"not wrong,\" and the second is \"wrong.\" That corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there might be any gray areas.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe if the pirate ship is on private property, and the person viewing it is trespassing, that could be wrong. But the scenario just says \"washed up,\" which might imply it's on public shore, so likely not wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even if the flowers look public, if they're in someone's garden, it's generally private. Picking flowers without asking is usually not okay.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
