                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"What is not true about conversion?\" and gives four options. So, I need to figure out which one of these statements is incorrect regarding the legal concept of conversion.\n\nFirst, I should recall what conversion means in law. Conversion is a civil wrong, or tort, where someone interferes with another person's possession of personal property without consent and in a way that deprives the owner of its use. It's like stealing, but it's a broader term that can include mishandling or misusing someone's property.\n\nOption A says, \"It is an interference with another's right of possession so severe as to warrant defendant to pay full price of chattel.\" Hmm, that sounds pretty accurate. Conversion is indeed about interfering with someone's possession of property, and the damages can be significant, sometimes requiring payment equivalent to the full value of the property.\n\nOption B states, \"The intent is to do the act that brings about the interference.\" Okay, in conversion, intent is important. The person committing conversion must have intended to perform the act that resulted in the interference with possession. So, this seems correct too.\n\nOption C says, \"The remedy is recovery of actual damages from harm to chattel or loss of use.\" Now, this is interesting. Conversion does allow the owner to seek damages, and those damages can cover the harm done to the property or the loss of use of it. So, this seems right.\n\nOption D says, \"Remedy is damage award of fair market value of chattel.\" Wait a minute, this sounds similar to option A, but it's phrased differently. Here, it's saying the remedy is to award the fair market value of the chattel. In some cases, that might be true, but I think conversion damages can vary.\n\nLet me think about this. In conversion, the measure of damages is typically the fair market value of the property at the time and place of the conversion. However, in some situations, if the property has a special value to the owner, damages might be awarded based on that special value. Also, sometimes, the plaintiff can choose between different remedies, like recovering the property itself or getting damages.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C mentions \"actual damages from harm to chattel or loss of use,\" which seems to cover situations where the property is damaged or the owner is deprived of its use. Option D, on the other hand, directly states the remedy is the fair market value of the chattel.\n\nI think the difference lies in the fact that conversion damages are generally measured by the fair market value, but in some cases, especially where there's sentimental value or unique properties, the damages might exceed the fair market value.\n\nBut looking back at the question, it's asking what is not true about conversion. So, I need to find the statement that is incorrect.\n\nOption A seems correct; option B seems correct; option C seems correct in certain scenarios; and option D seems correct in general, but possibly too narrow.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that option D is too absolute. While it's true that in many cases, the remedy is an award equal to the fair market value, there might be exceptions where other measures of damages apply.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the incorrect statement is that the remedy is always an award of the fair market value, when in fact, in some jurisdictions, the plaintiff can choose between different remedies, such as replevin to recover the property or damages.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The question is multiple choice, and only one option is not true.\n\nLet me consider the definitions and see which one stands out as incorrect.\n\nOption A emphasizes that the interference is severe enough to warrant paying the full price of the chattel. That aligns with the typical damages in conversion cases.\n\nOption B correctly identifies that intent is required, specifically intent to perform the act that causes the interference.\n\nOption C mentions recovery of actual damages for harm to the chattel or loss of use, which is also a valid remedy in conversion.\n\nOption D states that the remedy is a damage award of the fair market value of the chattel. While this is often the case, it might not account for situations where the property has sentimental value or is unique, leading to damages exceeding the fair market value.\n\nWait, but in standard conversion cases, damages are indeed the fair market value of the property at the time and place of conversion.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, if the property has a special value to the owner, damages can be awarded based on that special value. For example, if a family heirloom is converted, the damages might reflect its sentimental value beyond its market value.\n\nTherefore, option D might be too broad or incorrect in suggesting that the remedy is always the fair market value, without considering special value situations.\n\nBut I need to confirm this. In many legal contexts, conversion damages are strictly the fair market value, unless there's proof of special value to the plaintiff.\n\nMoreover, in some cases, the plaintiff can elect to recover the property itself rather than damages, especially if it's unique or of sentimental value.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to cover scenarios where the property is damaged or the use is lost, which aligns with conversion damages.\n\nOption D, however, presents a more straightforward award of fair market value, potentially overlooking situations where special value applies.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the one that's not always true about conversion, making it the correct answer to this question.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
