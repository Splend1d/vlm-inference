I think it has something to do with the relationship between the Father and the Son in the Trinity.\n\nLet me break it down. \"Homoousios\" is a Greek word, and I think \"homo\" means \"same,\" and \"ousia\" means \"essence\" or \"substance.\" So, put together, it should mean \"of the same substance.\"\n\nBut let's double-check. Option A says \"of a similar substance.\" That sounds like \"homoiousios,\" which is similar but with an \"i\" in the middle. That was actually a different position in the Arian controversy, opposing the Nicene position.\n\nOption C is \"of like substance.\" I think that might be \"homoiousios\" as well, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think \"homoiousios\" specifically means \"of similar substance,\" implying a distinction in substance but similarity.\n\nOption D, \"of human substance,\" doesn't make sense in this context. The term is used to describe the relationship between the divine persons, not between divine and human.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be B. \"of the same substance.\" That aligns with the Nicene understanding that the Son is of the same substance as the Father.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the historical context. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD condemned Arius, who taught that the Son was a created being of a similar but different substance from the Father. The council affirmed that the Son was of the same substance as the Father, using the term \"homoousios.\"\n\nTherefore, the term \"homoousios\" clearly denotes \"of the same substance.\"\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is B. \"of the same substance.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
