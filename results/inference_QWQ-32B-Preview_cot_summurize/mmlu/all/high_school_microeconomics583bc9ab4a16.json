                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what Matt's demand curve for bratwurst would look like if his total utility increases at a constant rate no matter how many bratwurst he eats. The options are vertical, horizontal, downward sloping, or upward sloping.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what total utility means. Total utility is the overall satisfaction or happiness that a person gets from consuming a certain amount of a good or service. If Matt's total utility increases at a constant rate, that means every additional bratwurst he eats adds the same amount of satisfaction as the one before it.\n\nNow, typically, in economics, we have the law of diminishing marginal utility, which says that each additional unit of a good provides less additional satisfaction than the previous one. But in this case, it's different because the total utility is increasing at a constant rate. That implies that the marginal utility, which is the addition to total utility from one more unit, is constant.\n\nSo, if marginal utility is constant, what does that imply for demand?\n\nI remember that the demand curve shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. The theory behind it is that as price decreases, quantity demanded increases, and vice versa, due to the law of demand.\n\nBut here, we're dealing with utility. How does utility relate to the demand curve?\n\nWell, consumer theory tells us that consumers aim to maximize their utility given their budget constraints. So, the quantity demanded at a certain price will depend on how much utility they get from the good relative to its price.\n\nIf marginal utility is constant, that means each additional bratwurst provides the same additional satisfaction. So, the consumer's willingness to pay for each additional unit should be constant as well.\n\nLet me think about that. If marginal utility is constant, and assuming that the consumer has a certain amount of money to spend, how would they decide how much to buy?\n\nThe formula for marginal utility per dollar is MU/P, where MU is marginal utility and P is price. Consumers maximize utility by equating MU/P across all goods.\n\nIn this case, since MU is constant, MU/P would be constant divided by price. So, for bratwurst, MU/P = constant/P.\n\nIf there are other goods, the consumer needs to compare MU/P for bratwurst with MU/P for other goods.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let's assume that Matt is only buying bratwurst with his entire budget.\n\nSo, his total expenditure on bratwurst is P * Q, where P is price and Q is quantity.\n\nHis total utility is MU * Q, since MU is constant.\n\nTo maximize utility, he should choose Q such that MU = P, assuming that MU is measured in dollars.\n\nWait, actually, in consumer theory, the condition for utility maximization is MU = P, if we assume that MU is measured in terms of dollars.\n\nBut maybe I need to be more precise.\n\nLet me recall that the marginal utility represents the additional satisfaction from one more unit, and to make it comparable to price, we sometimes assume that MU is measured in utils per dollar, or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, if we assume that the marginal utility is in utils, and the price is in dollars, then the condition for utility maximization is MU/P = \u03bb, where \u03bb is the marginal utility of money.\n\nBut to simplify, often in introductory courses, it's assumed that MU = P.\n\nGiven that, if MU is constant, say MU = c, then setting MU = P implies that P = c.\n\nThat means that the consumer is willing to pay a constant price for each unit of bratwurst.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in terms of the typical demand curve, which shows quantity demanded at different prices.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the demand curve, which plots price against quantity demanded.\n\nIf Matt's willingness to pay for each additional bratwurst is constant, then at any price below that willingness to pay, he would want to buy as much as possible.\n\nBut that can't be right because consumers usually face budget constraints.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose Matt has a certain budget, say M dollars, and the price of bratwurst is P dollars per unit.\n\nIf his marginal utility is constant, say MU = c utils per unit.\n\nThen, the utility maximization condition would be to buy Q units such that MU = P.\n\nBut since MU is constant, that would imply P = c.\n\nSo, if P is less than c, he would want to buy as much as possible, up to his budget constraint.\n\nIf P is greater than c, he would buy nothing.\n\nWait, that sounds like a Giffen good or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the demand curve is perfectly elastic at P = c.\n\nPerfectly elastic would be a horizontal demand curve.\n\nSo, if P = c, he's indifferent between buying any quantity.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of total utility.\n\nTotal utility is TU = c * Q, where c is the constant marginal utility.\n\nHis budget constraint is P * Q \u2264 M.\n\nTo maximize TU, he should choose the highest Q possible that satisfies P * Q \u2264 M.\n\nSo, Q = M / P.\n\nWait, that seems like a linear demand curve where Q = M / P.\n\nBut that's the equation for a rectangular hyperbola, which is what we get in perfect competition, where demand is determined by P = MU.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall the relationship between marginal utility and demand.\n\nIn microeconomics, the demand curve is often derived from the marginal utility curve, with the assumption that MU decreases as consumption increases.\n\nBut in this case, MU is constant.\n\nSo, perhaps the demand curve is horizontal.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf MU is constant, then the consumer is willing to buy any quantity at a price equal to MU.\n\nIf the price is below MU, they want to buy infinitely much, which isn't realistic.\n\nIf the price is above MU, they won't buy any.\n\nSo, the demand curve would be horizontal at P = MU.\n\nBut that can't be right because in reality, people have budget constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of marginal utility per dollar.\n\nIf MU is constant, then MU/P is decreasing as P increases.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look back at the options.\n\nA. Vertical\n\nB. Horizontal\n\nC. Downward sloping\n\nD. Upward sloping\n\nI think a horizontal demand curve makes sense if MU is constant.\n\nA horizontal demand curve indicates perfect elasticity, meaning that the quantity demanded is infinitely responsive to changes in price.\n\nSo, at a specific price equal to MU, the quantity demanded can be any amount.\n\nBut in reality, people can't buy infinite quantities due to budget constraints.\n\nPerhaps in this context, the demand curve is horizontal up to the maximum quantity that the budget allows.\n\nBut I think for the purpose of this question, the demand curve would be horizontal at the price equal to MU.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Horizontal.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf total utility increases at a constant rate, MU is constant.\n\nIn the condition of utility maximization, P = MU.\n\nTherefore, the price that the consumer is willing to pay is constant, equal to MU.\n\nHence, the demand curve is horizontal at P = MU.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Horizontal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
