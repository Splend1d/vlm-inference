                    "text": "So Mrs. Johnson is spending her daily budget on potato chips and onion dip. The chips cost $1 each and the dip costs $2 each. Right now, she's getting 12 units of marginal utility from the last chip she bought and 30 units from the last dip. The question is asking what she should do to maximize her utility.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what utility maximization means. I think it's about getting the most satisfaction possible from the goods you consume, given your budget constraints.\n\nI remember that for two goods, the condition for utility maximization is that the marginal utility per dollar spent should be equal for both goods. That makes sense because you want the last dollar spent on each good to give you the same amount of extra satisfaction.\n\nSo, for chips, the price is $1 and the marginal utility is 12. So, the marginal utility per dollar for chips is 12 / 1 = 12.\n\nFor dip, the price is $2 and the marginal utility is 30. So, the marginal utility per dollar for dip is 30 / 2 = 15.\n\nHmm, so right now, MU per dollar for chips is 12 and for dip is 15. For utility maximization, these should be equal.\n\nSince the MU per dollar is higher for dip, that means she gets more satisfaction per dollar from dip compared to chips. So, to maximize her utility, she should reallocate her spending towards dip and away from chips.\n\nWait, but she has a fixed budget. So, if she spends more on dip, she has to spend less on chips, and vice versa.\n\nYes, that's the budget constraint.\n\nSo, the general rule is to keep adjusting consumption until MU per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nIn this case, since MU per dollar for dip is higher, she should buy more dip and less chips until MU per dollar equals for both.\n\nLet me see the options:\n\nA. Do nothing; she is consuming her utility maximizing combination.\n\nBut that's not true because MU per dollar is not equal.\n\nB. Increase her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.\n\nWait, currently MU of chips is 12, and MU of dip is 30. So, increasing chips would likely decrease MU of chips further (due to diminishing marginal utility), making MU/chip even lower.\n\nBut the issue is MU per dollar, not just MU.\n\nWait, price of chips is $1, so MU per dollar is MU/1 = MU.\n\nFor dip, it's MU/2.\n\nSo, option B is suggesting to increase chips until MU of chips equals 30.\n\nBut if she increases chips, MU of chips probably decreases, so it would move further away from 30.\n\nThis doesn't seem right.\n\nC. Decrease her consumption of chips until the marginal utility of chip consumption equals 30.\n\nSo, decreasing chips would increase MU of chips (since marginal utility increases as consumption decreases, ceteris paribus).\n\nSo, if she decreases chips, MU of chips goes up.\n\nShe needs to decrease until MU of chips equals 30.\n\nThen, MU/chips = 30/1 = 30.\n\nMU/dip = 30/2 = 15.\n\nWait, that's not equal. So, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nD. Decrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\nThis sounds like the general rule I recalled earlier.\n\nSo, she should decrease chips (which lowers spending on chips) and use that saved money to buy more dip.\n\nThis reallocation should continue until MU per dollar is equal for both.\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption C says to decrease chips until MU of chips equals 30.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, if MU of chips reaches 30, and price is $1, then MU per dollar for chips is 30.\n\nMU per dollar for dip is MU_dip / 2.\n\nFor equality, MU_dip / 2 = 30, so MU_dip should be 60.\n\nBut currently, MU_dip is 30, so she would need to increase dip until MU_dip decreases to 60 due to more consumption.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because usually, MU decreases as consumption increases.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing myself.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the general rule in option D.\n\nIt seems more straightforward and aligns with the utility maximization condition.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nDecrease her consumption of chips and increase her consumption of dip until the marginal utility per dollar is equal for both goods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
