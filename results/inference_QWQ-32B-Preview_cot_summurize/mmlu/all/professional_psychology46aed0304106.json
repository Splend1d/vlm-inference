It's talking about a highly cohesive group that's led in a directive way, and when they make decisions, they do it too quickly without looking at all the information or considering other options. The question is asking what this kind of behavior is called.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. groupthink\n\nB. group polarization\n\nC. social loafing\n\nD. risky shift\n\nI need to understand each of these terms to see which one fits best.\n\nFirst, groupthink. I think I've heard about this before. It happens when a group prioritizes harmony and consensus over critical evaluation of alternatives. So, people go along with the group decision to maintain unity, even if they have doubts. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing\u2014a highly cohesive group making decisions quickly without considering all the information.\n\nNext, group polarization. This is when a group's initial tendency becomes more extreme after discussion. For example, if a group tends to be risky, after talking, they become even more risky in their decisions. That doesn't seem to match the scenario here, which is more about rushing to a decision without considering alternatives.\n\nSocial loafing is when individuals exert less effort in a group than they would alone because they feel their contribution is less noticeable. That doesn't really fit here because the question is about decision-making processes, not about individual effort in group tasks.\n\nRisky shift is when a group makes decisions that are riskier than those made by individuals alone. Again, that doesn't align with the scenario described, which is about making decisions too quickly without\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30 available information.\n\nSo, going back to groupthink, it seems to fit the description provided. The group is highly cohesive, led directive, and they make decisions before fully assessing all the information or considering alternative solutions. This aligns with the concept of groupthink, where the desire for harmony leads to incomplete evaluation of options.\n\nI think the answer is A. groupthink.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
