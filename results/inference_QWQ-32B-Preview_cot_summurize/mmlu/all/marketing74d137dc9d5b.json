This makes sense because brand placement involves incorporating products or brands into films or TV shows in a way that they appear naturally within the story. This exposure is meant to enhance brand awareness and favorability among viewers, which aligns with the description provided.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure.\n\nB. Field marketing refers to marketing activities that take place in real-world settings, often outside traditional retail environments. This could include events, sampling, or demonstrations, but it doesn't specifically relate to the integration of brands into films or TV shows.\n\nC. Exhibition typically refers to the display of art, films, or other forms of entertainment in a public setting. While films and TV shows are exhibited, this term doesn't specifically pertain to the sponsorship or placement of brands within them.\n\nD. Viral marketing involves creating content that spreads rapidly online, often through social media and word of mouth. While this can include brand integrations, it's not specifically about placing brands within films or TV shows for exposure.\n\nTherefore, A. Brand placement seems to be the most accurate answer based on the description provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
