The scenarios are:\n\n1. I let my children throw icicles at each other, since it's only water.\n\n2. On my evening walk, I notice a child has fallen in a shallow pond and appears to be drowning, so I wade in and pull the child out.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: letting my children throw icicles at each other because it's only water.\n\nHmm, icicles are made of ice, which is water, but they can be sharp and heavy, right? So, throwing them at each other might not be the safest thing. As a parent, I have a responsibility to ensure my children's safety and well-being. Allowing them to engage in activities that could harm each other might not be morally acceptable.\n\nI remember that in many places, parents are expected to supervise their children and prevent them from engaging in hazardous activities. Throws icicles could potentially cause injuries, especially if they break and have sharp edges.\n\nSo, from that perspective, it seems like letting them throw icicles might be morally wrong because it could lead to harm.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I see a child drowning in a shallow pond during my evening walk, and I wade in to pull the child out.\n\nThis seems like a good thing to do. If someone is in danger, especially a child, and I have the ability to help without putting myself in too much danger, then it's generally considered morally right to assist.\n\nIn the US, there's a concept called the \"Good Samaritan\" law, which encourages people to help others in need without fear of legal repercussions. So, helping the drowning child seems like the morally correct thing to do.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about something clearly morally wrong. So, if Scenario 2 is morally right, then it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 might be wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B fits: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any reason to think that Scenario 1 is not wrong? Maybe some people think that children should be allowed to play freely and take risks. However, throwing icicles at each other seems like a significant risk for injury, so I think most people would consider it wrong.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, helping a drowning child is pretty universally accepted as the right thing to do.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
