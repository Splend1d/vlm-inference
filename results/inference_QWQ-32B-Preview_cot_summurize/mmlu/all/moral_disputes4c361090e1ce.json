The question is: \"According to Aristotle, if something has a function, then its good depends on...\" and it gives options A through D. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Aristotle said about functions and goodness. I remember that Aristotle had a concept of \"telos,\" which is about the purpose or end that something is meant to achieve. He believed that everything has a purpose or function, and that its goodness is tied to how well it fulfills that function.\n\nSo, if something has a function, its good would depend on that function. That sounds like option A: its function.\n\nBut let me think about the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is \"its substance.\" Aristotle did talk a lot about substance, or \"ousia\" in Greek, which is like the underlying reality or essence of things. But in this context, is goodness more dependent on substance or on function? I think function is more directly related to goodness in Aristotle's framework.\n\nOption C is \"our beliefs about it.\" This seems more subjective. Aristotle was more into objective standards of goodness based on the nature of things, so I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption D is \"cultural practices.\" Again, this seems more relativistic, which doesn't align with Aristotle's idea of there being universal natures and purposes.\n\nSo, going back, it seems like the best answer is A: its function.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up a quote from Aristotle that directly supports this.\n\nA quick search reminds me of his discussion in the Nicomachean Ethics, where he talks about how the goodness of a thing is determined by how well it performs its function. For example, the function of a knife is to cut, so a good knife is one that cuts well.\n\nSimilarly, for humans, Aristotle argues that our function is rational activity, and thus, a good human is one who engages in excellent rational activity.\n\nSo, yes, it's clear that for Aristotle, the goodness of something depends on its function.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Its function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
