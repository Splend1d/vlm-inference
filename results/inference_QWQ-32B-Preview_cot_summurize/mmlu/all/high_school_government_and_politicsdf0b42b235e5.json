I know a bit about this, but I'm not an expert, so I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, option A says that non-whites are more likely to vote Democratic than whites. From what I've read and observed, this seems accurate. Minority groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics, tend to support Democratic candidates at higher rates than white voters. So, I think A is true.\n\nOption B says that women are more likely to vote Democratic than men. Again, this aligns with what I've heard. Women have been voting Democratic in higher numbers compared to men in recent elections. So, B seems true as well.\n\nOption C states that low-income Americans are more likely to vote Democratic than upper-income Americans. I believe this is also correct. Democrats often advocate for policies that benefit lower-income groups, such as social welfare programs and higher taxes on the wealthy. Therefore, it makes sense that low-income individuals would lean Democratic.\n\nNow, option D says that evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Democratic than non-religious Americans. Hmm, this one sounds off. I recall that evangelical Christians have been a strong base for the Republican Party, especially in recent decades. They tend to support conservative social issues, which align more with the Republican platform. On the other hand, non-religious Americans are often more liberal and support Democratic candidates.\n\nSo, if evangelical Christians are more likely to vote Republican, then saying they are more likely to vote Democratic than non-religious Americans would be incorrect. Non-religious Americans, in fact, are more likely to vote Democratic.\n\nTherefore, I think statement D is not true.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- A: True\n\n- B: True\n\n- C: True\n\n- D: Not true\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
