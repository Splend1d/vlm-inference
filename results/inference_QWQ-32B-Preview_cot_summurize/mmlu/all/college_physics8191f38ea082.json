                    "text": "So I've got this question about organ pipes and harmonics. It says that for an organ pipe open at both ends, the first five harmonics are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Then, it asks which of these harmonics will still exist if the pipe is closed at one end. The options are A: 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only; B: 100 Hz and 200 Hz only; C: 150 Hz and 250 Hz only; and D: None.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the differences between standing waves in open and closed pipes. For a pipe open at both ends, all harmonics are present, meaning both odd and even multiples of the fundamental frequency. Whereas, for a pipe closed at one end, only the odd harmonics are present, meaning only odd multiples of the fundamental frequency.\n\nGiven that, I need to figure out what the fundamental frequency is for the open pipe. From the given harmonics: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz, it looks like the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, since the harmonics are integer multiples of this frequency (1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x).\n\nNow, if the pipe is closed at one end, only the odd harmonics should survive. So, that would be the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., harmonics of the fundamental frequency.\n\nLooking at the given harmonics:\n\n- 50 Hz: 1st harmonic (odd)\n\n- 100 Hz: 2nd harmonic (even)\n\n- 150 Hz: 3rd harmonic (odd)\n\n- 200 Hz: 4th harmonic (even)\n\n- 250 Hz: 5th harmonic (odd)\n\nSo, according to this, only the odd harmonics should remain when the pipe is closed at one end. That would be 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that these frequencies correspond to the allowed modes in a closed pipe. For a closed pipe, the allowed frequencies are given by f_n = (2n-1)*(v/4L), where n = 1,2,3,... and v is the speed of sound, L is the length of the pipe.\n\nIn an open pipe, the frequencies are f_n = n*(v/2L), where n = 1,2,3,...\n\nGiven that, in the open pipe, the fundamental is 50 Hz, which corresponds to n=1 in the open pipe formula: f1 = v/2L = 50 Hz.\n\nNow, for the closed pipe, the fundamental is f1_closed = v/4L, which should be equal to 50 Hz, since v/4L = (v/2L)/2 = 50 Hz / 2 = 25 Hz. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if v/2L = 50 Hz, then v/4L should be 25 Hz. But in the closed pipe, the fundamental is actually higher than in the open pipe, but in this case, it seems like the fundamental frequency changes when the pipe is closed.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps the pipe length remains the same, but the boundary conditions change.\n\nLet me think again. If the pipe is open at both ends, the fundamental frequency is f_open = v / 2L = 50 Hz.\n\nIf the pipe is closed at one end, the fundamental frequency becomes f_closed = v / 4L.\n\nSince v / 2L = 50 Hz, then v / 4L = 25 Hz.\n\nBut in the options, there's no 25 Hz; the lowest frequency is 50 Hz.\n\nDoes this mean that the fundamental frequency changes from 50 Hz to 25 Hz when the pipe is closed at one end? But that seems contradictory because closing one end should raise the fundamental frequency, not lower it.\n\nWait, no. Actually, closing one end of the pipe should raise the fundamental frequency because the wavelength changes. In an open pipe, the wavelength for the fundamental is 2L, so f_open = v / 2L.\n\nIn a closed pipe, the wavelength for the fundamental is 4L, so f_closed = v / 4L.\n\nWait, no, that's backwards. In a closed pipe, the fundamental has a quarter wavelength fitting into the pipe length, so wavelength is 4L, thus f_closed = v / 4L.\n\nIn an open pipe, fundamental has a half wavelength fitting into the pipe length, so wavelength is 2L, thus f_open = v / 2L.\n\nSo, if f_open = 50 Hz = v / 2L, then f_closed = v / 4L = (v / 2L) / 2 = 50 Hz / 2 = 25 Hz.\n\nBut in the given harmonics for the open pipe, the frequencies are up to 250 Hz, and 25 Hz is not among them. So, perhaps I need to consider the overtone series for the closed pipe.\n\nIn a closed pipe, only odd harmonics are present, so the frequencies are f, 3f, 5f, etc., where f is the fundamental frequency of the closed pipe, which is 25 Hz.\n\nSo, the frequencies in the closed pipe would be 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.\n\nBut in the options, the frequencies are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz, none of which match the closed pipe frequencies.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Maybe the pipe length remains the same, but the speed of sound doesn't change, so the frequencies in the closed pipe would be different from those in the open pipe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the pipe is the same in both cases, and we're just changing the boundary conditions.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Suppose the pipe has a certain length L, and when open at both ends, the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz.\n\nThen, when closed at one end, the fundamental frequency becomes v / 4L.\n\nGiven that v / 2L = 50 Hz, then v / 4L = 25 Hz.\n\nSo, the fundamental frequency in the closed pipe is 25 Hz.\n\nThen, the higher harmonics in the closed pipe would be odd multiples of the fundamental: 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.\n\nLooking back at the original harmonics in the open pipe: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz, none of these frequencies match the closed pipe frequencies (25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, etc.).\n\nTherefore, none of the original harmonics would survive when the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and option D is \"None,\" so maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the frequencies in terms of the original fundamental.\n\nIn the open pipe, f_n = n * (v / 2L), for n = 1,2,3,4,5,...\n\nIn the closed pipe, f_n_closed = (2n - 1) * (v / 4L), for n = 1,2,3,...\n\nGiven that v / 2L = 50 Hz, then v / 4L = 25 Hz.\n\nSo, the frequencies in the closed pipe would be:\n\nFor n=1: 1 * 25 Hz = 25 Hz\n\nFor n=2: 3 * 25 Hz = 75 Hz\n\nFor n=3: 5 * 25 Hz = 125 Hz\n\nFor n=4: 7 * 25 Hz = 175 Hz\n\nFor n=5: 9 * 25 Hz = 225 Hz\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNone of these frequencies match the original harmonics in the open pipe, which are multiples of 50 Hz.\n\nTherefore, none of the original harmonics would survive when the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: None.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that some of the higher frequencies in the open pipe coincide with the frequencies in the closed pipe.\n\nFor example, 150 Hz is present in both.\n\nIn the closed pipe, f_n_closed = (2n - 1) * 25 Hz.\n\nFor n=3: 5 * 25 Hz = 125 Hz\n\nFor n=4: 7 * 25 Hz = 175 Hz\n\nFor n=5: 9 * 25 Hz = 225 Hz\n\nWait, 150 Hz is not among these.\n\nSimilarly, 250 Hz is not among the closed pipe frequencies.\n\nTherefore, indeed, none of the original harmonics survive when the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: None.\n\nBut option A says 50 Hz, 150 Hz, and 250 Hz only, which are the odd harmonics of the open pipe, but as we've seen, in the closed pipe, the frequencies are different and don't coincide with these.\n\nWait, perhaps there's confusion because in the closed pipe, the frequencies are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency of the closed pipe, which is 25 Hz, not of the open pipe's fundamental.\n\nTherefore, the frequencies in the closed pipe are 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc., none of which match the open pipe's harmonics of 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz.\n\nHence, no frequencies overlap, and the answer is D: None.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in considering the fundamental frequency.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the fundamental frequency of the open pipe is 50 Hz.\n\nThen, for the closed pipe, the fundamental should be higher, but as calculated, it would be 25 Hz, which doesn't make sense because closing one end should effectively make the pipe longer for the sound wave, thus lowering the fundamental frequency.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in a closed pipe, the fundamental frequency is higher than in an open pipe of the same length because the wavelength is longer.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a closed pipe, the fundamental frequency is lower than in an open pipe of the same length.\n\nWait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me derive the expressions again.\n\nFor an open pipe:\n\nFundamental frequency: f_open = v / 2L\n\nFor a closed pipe:\n\nFundamental frequency: f_closed = v / 4L\n\nSo, f_closed = f_open / 2\n\nGiven that f_open = 50 Hz, then f_closed = 25 Hz.\n\nNow, the harmonics in the closed pipe are odd multiples of the fundamental:\n\nf_closed, 3*f_closed, 5*f_closed, etc.\n\nSo, 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.\n\nNone of these coincide with the open pipe harmonics: 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz.\n\nTherefore, none of the original harmonics survive when the pipe is closed at one end.\n\nThus, the answer is D: None.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects consideration of the fact that some of the higher frequencies in the open pipe might coincide with the closed pipe frequencies, but as we've seen, that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that when the pipe is closed at one end, some of the original harmonics might still be present if they match the closed pipe's harmonic series.\n\nBut as per the calculations, that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D: None.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
