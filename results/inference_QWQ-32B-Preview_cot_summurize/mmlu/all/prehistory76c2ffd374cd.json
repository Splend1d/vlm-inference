Teosinte is native to Mexico and was domesticated by indigenous peoples over thousands of years, leading to the development of modern maize. The other options\u2014einkorn, emmer, and legumes\u2014are not the wild progenitors of maize.\n\n- Einkorn and emmer are types of wheat.\n\n- Legumes are a family of plants that include peas, beans, and lentils.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. teosinte."
