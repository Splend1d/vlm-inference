So, first things first, I need to understand what starvation means in this context.\n\nStarvation in job scheduling refers to a situation where a job waits indefinitely to get access to a resource or to be executed, even though it's ready to proceed. So, a starvation-free policy ensures that no job gets stuck in perpetuity without getting its turn.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Round-robin.\n\nRound-robin is a scheduling algorithm where each job gets a fixed time slot in a cyclic order. So, if you have jobs A, B, and C, the scheduler gives each of them a turn in sequence, like A, B, C, A, B, C, and so on.\n\nThis seems fair because each job gets an equal share of the processor time. Since no job is given preference over others, and each gets a turn in a\u5faa\u73af\u65b9\u5f0f, it's unlikely that any job will starve. As long as the time quantum is reasonable, all jobs should get their share of the CPU eventually.\n\nOption B: Priority queuing.\n\nIn priority queuing, jobs are assigned priorities, and the scheduler selects the job with the highest priority to execute next. If higher priority jobs keep arriving, lower priority jobs might wait indefinitely, especially if high-priority jobs are continuously added.\n\nThis can lead to starvation of low-priority jobs because they might never get a chance to execute if there are always higher-priority jobs in the queue.\n\nSo, priority queuing is not necessarily starvation-free.\n\nOption C: Shortest job first.\n\nShortest job first (SJF) scheduling selects the job with the smallest estimated running time to execute next. The idea is to minimize the average waiting time.\n\nHowever, in SJF, longer jobs might have to wait for multiple shorter jobs to complete before they get a chance to run. If new short jobs keep arriving, a long job might wait indefinitely, leading to starvation.\n\nTherefore, SJF is not starvation-free.\n\nOption D: Youngest job first.\n\nYoungest job first scheduling gives preference to the most recently arrived jobs. So, the newest job gets executed first, pushing older jobs further back in the queue.\n\nThis can potentially cause older jobs to wait indefinitely if new jobs keep arriving, leading to starvation of older jobs.\n\nHence, youngest job first is also not starvation-free.\n\nBased on this analysis, round-robin seems to be the only scheduling policy among the options that ensures no job waits indefinitely, as long as the time quantum is appropriately set.\n\nSo, my answer would be A. Round-robin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
