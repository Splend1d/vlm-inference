                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about what happens when a wave moves from shallow water to deep water. I know that waves can behave differently in different depths, but I'm not sure about the specifics regarding frequency, wavelength, and speed.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. First, I recall that the speed of a wave is related to the medium it's traveling through. In this case, the medium is water, and the depth of the water affects the wave's speed.\n\nI think that in deeper water, waves can travel faster because there's less resistance from the ocean floor. So, maybe the speed increases when a wave moves from shallow to deep water.\n\nNow, about frequency. Frequency is the number of wave cycles passing a point per unit time, and I believe it's determined by the source of the wave, not by the medium. So, if the source doesn't change, the frequency should remain the same regardless of the water depth.\n\nThat leaves wavelength. I know that the speed of a wave is related to its wavelength and frequency by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\text{wavelength} \\times \\text{frequency} \\]\n\nIf the frequency stays the same and the speed increases, then the wavelength must also increase to satisfy this equation.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up how wave speed depends on water depth.\n\nI remember that for water waves, the speed is proportional to the square root of the water depth, at least in shallow water. But I think in deep water, the relationship is different.\n\nActually, I think that in deep water, the wave speed depends on the gravitational acceleration and the wavelength or period, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationship.\n\nLet me try to recall the deep-water wave speed formula. I think it's something like:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{k} \\tanh(kh)} \\]\n\nWhere \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity, \\( k \\) is the wave number (which is \\( 2\\pi \\) divided by the wavelength), and \\( h \\) is the water depth. The \\( \\tanh \\) function is the hyperbolic tangent.\n\nIn shallow water, where the depth \\( h \\) is much smaller than the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\), \\( \\tanh(kh) \\) approaches \\( kh \\), so the speed becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} \\approx \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{k} \\times kh } = \\sqrt{ gh } \\]\n\nSo, in shallow water, the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the depth.\n\nIn deep water, where the depth is much greater than the wavelength, \\( \\tanh(kh) \\) approaches 1, so the speed becomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{k} } \\]\n\nBut \\( k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g \\lambda}{2\\pi} } \\]\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check that.\n\nActually, I think in deep water, the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the wavelength, or more precisely:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{k} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g \\lambda}{2\\pi} } \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. Maybe I should look up the deep-water wave speed formula.\n\nUpon looking it up, I find that in deep water, the wave speed (or more accurately, the phase speed) is given by:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{k} \\tanh(kh)} \\]\n\nAnd since \\( h \\) is much larger than \\( \\lambda \\), \\( kh \\) is large, and \\( \\tanh(kh) \\) approaches 1. Therefore:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g}{k} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{g \\lambda}{2\\pi} } \\]\n\nSo, in deep water, the wave speed is proportional to the square root of the wavelength.\n\nNow, considering that the frequency remains constant, as it's determined by the source, and the speed increases in deeper water, then according to the equation \\( c = \\lambda f \\), where \\( c \\) is speed, \\( \\lambda \\) is wavelength, and \\( f \\) is frequency, if \\( f \\) is constant and \\( c \\) increases, then \\( \\lambda \\) must also increase.\n\nWait, but in shallow water, \\( c \\) is proportional to the square root of depth, and in deep water, \\( c \\) is proportional to the square root of the wavelength. This seems a bit circular.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Suppose a wave is moving from shallow water to deep water. As it enters deeper water, the restoring force of gravity becomes more dominant compared to the resistance from the ocean floor, so the wave speed should increase.\n\nSince frequency remains constant, and speed increases, wavelength must increase to satisfy \\( c = \\lambda f \\).\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Frequency remains the same.\n\n- Wavelength increases.\n\n- Speed increases.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. frequency decreases, the wavelength increases, and the speed increases\n\nB. frequency does not change, the wavelength increases, and the speed increases\n\nC. frequency does not change, the wavelength decreases, and the speed decreases\n\nD. frequency does not change, the wavelength increases, and the speed decreases\n\nOption B matches my conclusion.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any scenario where speed decreases when moving to deep water. I think generally, in deep water, waves can travel faster, but maybe under certain conditions, this isn't true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some situations, like when waves approach the shore and the water depth decreases, the wave speed decreases, and wavelength decreases, while frequency remains constant. But that's the opposite of the question, which is about moving from shallow to deep water.\n\nI think my initial reasoning is correct, and option B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
