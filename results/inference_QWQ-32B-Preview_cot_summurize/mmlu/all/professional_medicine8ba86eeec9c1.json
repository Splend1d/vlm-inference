                    "text": "So I have this case here about a 70-year-old woman who's coming in because her hand tremors are getting worse. Let's see what's going on.\n\nFirst, she's had this tremor most of her life, and it used to be mild, only happening when she was tired or stressed. But lately, in the past month, it's become more noticeable and frequent. Now, she's embarrassed to eat with others because of how obvious it is.\n\nShe's been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks to help cope with the death of her husband 2 months ago. So, she's on an antidepressant. Her medical history also includes essential hypertension, managed with lisinopril, and hyperlipidemia controlled with atorvastatin. She occasionally takes ibuprofen for joint pain. Recently, she started drinking one glass of wine daily, saying it reduces her tremor. Before, she only had one to two alcoholic beverages monthly.\n\nShe's 168 cm tall, weighs 70 kg, so her BMI is 25 kg/m2, which is normal. Vital signs are temperature 36.4\u00b0C, pulse 80/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 130/85 mm Hg. Physical exam shows a moderate tremor in both hands, but it's not present at rest.\n\nThey ordered a complete blood count, serum chemistry profile, and serum thyroid function tests, and the results are pending.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the most likely cause of her worsening tremor. The options are:\n\nA. Adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy\n\nB. Bereavement reaction\n\nC. Early Parkinson disease\n\nD. Increase in alcohol consumption\n\nAlright, let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A, adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy. Fluoxetine is an SSRI, used for depression and anxiety disorders. It's possible that the start of this medication could be causing or exacerbating her tremor. Some SSRIs are known to cause tremors as a side effect. Since she started taking it only 3 weeks ago, and her tremor worsened around the same time, there might be a connection here.\n\nOption B is bereavement reaction. She lost her husband 2 months ago, and she's been taking fluoxetine to cope with that. Grief can certainly cause or exacerbate physical symptoms, including tremors, due to stress and emotional distress. However, her tremor was already present and seems to have worsened recently, so while grief could be a factor, it might not be the primary cause.\n\nOption C is early Parkinson disease. Parkinson's is known for causing tremors, especially at rest, along with other symptoms like bradykinesia and rigidity. But in this case, the tremor is not present at rest; it's action-related. So, Parkinson's might be less likely, but we can't rule it out completely without more information.\n\nOption D is the increase in alcohol consumption. She used to drink minimally, but now she's having one glass of wine daily, and she says it reduces her tremor. Alcohol can sometimes temporarily reduce tremors, but withdrawal can exacerbate them. So, if she's increasing her alcohol intake to manage the tremor, it might be masking the underlying issue, but I'm not sure if the increase is directly causing the worsening.\n\nNow, considering her history, the tremor has been present most of her life and was mild, only with fatigue or stress. So, it sounds like she might have had essential tremor, which is a common type of tremor that can be exacerbated by stress, fatigue, and certain medications.\n\nGiven that she started fluoxetine recently, and her tremor worsened around the same time, it's possible that the fluoxetine is exacerbating her existing essential tremor.\n\nAlso, the fact that the tremor is action-related and not present at rest makes Parkinson's less likely.\n\nThe increase in alcohol might be a coping mechanism but may not necessarily be causing the worsening.\n\nBereavement could be a contributing factor due to stress but again, might not be the primary cause.\n\nSo, I think the most likely answer is A, adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be other causes.\n\nThe lab tests are pending, so maybe there's an underlying issue like thyroid dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances, but since the results aren't back yet, we can't consider those for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lisinopril or atorvastatin could be contributing, but those aren't typically associated with tremors.\n\nIbuprofen occasionally for joint pain seems unlikely to be the cause.\n\nSo, overall, given the recent start of fluoxetine and the worsening of tremors, I think option A is the most likely cause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
