I need to figure out which one of these options wasn't one of his indicators. Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A: \"Lacking exclusive use of a bath or shower.\" Hmm, that sounds like it's about housing conditions and privacy. I think Townsend was concerned with living standards and access to basic amenities, so this might be something he considered.\n\nOption B: \"Living in housing with serious structural defects.\" Again, this seems directly related to housing quality, which I believe was a key aspect of Townsend's work on deprivation.\n\nOption C: \"Buying fewer than twenty DVDs in the previous year.\" Now, this one raises an eyebrow. DVDs? In 1979? That seems off because DVDs weren't even around back then. DVDs were introduced much later, in the 1990s. So, this might be the odd one out.\n\nOption D: \"Going without a week's holiday in the previous year.\" This seems to be about leisure and time off, which could be considered as part of quality of life and relative deprivation.\n\nConsidering that Townsend's work in 1979 would be based on the social and economic conditions of that time, and knowing that DVDs didn't exist yet, I'm going to guess that option C is the one that wasn't part of Townsend's indicators.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Townsend had some indicators related to entertainment or consumption, but surely not DVDs specifically. Also, the technology wasn't available then, so it's unlikely that he would have used that as an indicator.\n\nYes, I'm quite confident that C is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
