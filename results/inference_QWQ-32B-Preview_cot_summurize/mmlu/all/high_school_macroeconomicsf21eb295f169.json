                    "text": "So I have this problem here: If nominal GDP equals $5000 and real GDP equals $4000, then the GDP deflator equals... and there are a few options: A. 125, B. 1.25, C. 800, D. 0.8. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what the GDP deflator is. I think it's a measure that compares nominal GDP to real GDP to show the effect of price changes over time. So, it's like an indicator of inflation or deflation in the economy.\n\nThe formula for the GDP deflator is:\n\nGDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100\n\nOkay, so plugging in the numbers:\n\nGDP deflator = ($5000 / $4000) * 100\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n5000 divided by 4000 is 1.25.\n\nThen, 1.25 multiplied by 100 is 125.\n\nSo, the GDP deflator is 125.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 125, B is 1.25, C is 800, and D is 0.8.\n\nSo, it seems like A is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check if I'm using the right formula. Sometimes, I get confused between the GDP deflator and the inflation rate.\n\nLet me recall: Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy, evaluated at current prices. Real GDP, on the other hand, is the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy, evaluated at constant prices, which means prices from a base year.\n\nThe GDP deflator is a price index that measures the average price level of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. It's calculated by comparing nominal GDP to real GDP.\n\nSo, yes, the formula I used seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen the GDP deflator expressed as:\n\nGDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100\n\nSometimes, it's expressed without multiplying by 100, in which case it would just be a decimal.\n\nIn this problem, the options include both 125 and 1.25, so maybe the formula doesn't always multiply by 100.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf I don't multiply by 100, then GDP deflator = nominal GDP / real GDP = 5000 / 4000 = 1.25.\n\nOption B is 1.25.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula can be presented both ways, with or without multiplying by 100, depending on the context or the textbook.\n\nIn that case, both A and B could be considered correct, but that doesn't make sense because usually, the GDP deflator is expressed as an index number, which is multiplied by 100.\n\nLet me see what Wikipedia says about the GDP deflator.\n\nOkay, according to Wikipedia, the GDP deflator is equal to nominal GDP divided by real GDP, multiplied by 100.\n\nSo, GDP deflator = (nominal GDP / real GDP) * 100.\n\nTherefore, in this case, it should be 125.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting the ratio without multiplying by 100.\n\nBut the question says \"the GDP deflator equals,\" and it provides options including both 125 and 1.25.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer could be either, depending on how it's calculated.\n\nBut to avoid confusion, I think the standard way is to express it as an index number multiplied by 100.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the options, 125 is likely the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the percentage change.\n\nWait, no, the GDP deflator is not a percentage change; it's a level of price changes.\n\nInflation rate would be the percentage change in the GDP deflator over time.\n\nBut here, we're just looking at a single period.\n\nSo, sticking with the formula: GDP deflator = (nominal GDP / real GDP) * 100 = (5000 / 4000) * 100 = 125.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 125.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that real GDP could be larger than nominal GDP? Well, in theory, if there is deflation, real GDP could be greater than nominal GDP, but in this case, nominal is larger than real, which suggests inflation, which makes sense.\n\nAlso, I should confirm that I'm using the correct definitions for nominal and real GDP.\n\nNominal GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, evaluated at current prices.\n\nReal GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced in an economy in a given year, evaluated at constant prices (base year prices).\n\nSo, again, the GDP deflator compares these two to measure price changes.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the GDP deflator shows how much of the change in nominal GDP is due to price changes rather than real changes in output.\n\nSo, in this case, nominal GDP is $5000, real GDP is $4000, so the price level has increased such that the same quantity of goods and services that were worth $4000 in base year prices are now worth $5000 in current prices.\n\nThus, the price level has increased by 25%, which aligns with a GDP deflator of 125 (since 100 represents the base year, and 125 indicates a 25% increase).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 125.\n\nOption B, 1.25, is likely the decimal equivalent, but traditionally, the GDP deflator is expressed as an index number multiplied by 100.\n\nSo, while 1.25 is also correct in a different context, given the options provided and the standard presentation, A. 125 is the better choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
