                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem. We have a box with 4 white balls and 4 black balls, and we're drawing them one at a time. We need to find the probability that all our draws alternate colors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the draws to alternate colors. That means if I draw a white ball first, the next one has to be black, then white again, and so on. Similarly, if I start with a black ball, the next one should be white, then black, and so on.\n\nSo, there are two possible scenarios for alternating colors:\n\n1. Starting with a white ball: W, B, W, B, W, B, W, B\n\n2. Starting with a black ball: B, W, B, W, B, W, B, W\n\nEach of these sequences represents a way to draw all 8 balls while alternating colors.\n\nNow, to find the probability of this happening, I need to calculate the probability for each of these scenarios and then add them up because they are mutually exclusive events.\n\nLet's start with the first scenario: starting with a white ball.\n\nThe sequence is W, B, W, B, W, B, W, B.\n\nThe probability of drawing a white ball first is 4/8, since there are 4 white balls out of 8 total balls.\n\nThen, the probability of drawing a black ball next is 4/7, because there are 4 black balls left out of 7 total balls remaining.\n\nNext, drawing a white ball again: there are now 3 white balls left out of 6 total balls, so 3/6.\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n\n- Draw black: 3/5\n\n- Draw white: 2/4\n\n- Draw black: 2/3\n\n- Draw white: 1/2\n\n- Draw black: 1/1\n\nSo, the probability for this entire sequence is:\n\n(4/8) * (4/7) * (3/6) * (3/5) * (2/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (1/1)\n\nNow, let's calculate this step by step:\n\nFirst, simplify each fraction:\n\n4/8 = 1/2\n\n4/7 = 4/7\n\n3/6 = 1/2\n\n3/5 = 3/5\n\n2/4 = 1/2\n\n2/3 = 2/3\n\n1/2 = 1/2\n\n1/1 = 1\n\nNow, multiply them together:\n\n(1/2) * (4/7) * (1/2) * (3/5) * (1/2) * (2/3) * (1/2) * 1\n\nLet's multiply the numerators and the denominators separately:\n\nNumerators: 1 * 4 * 1 * 3 * 1 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 24\n\nDenominators: 2 * 7 * 2 * 5 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 1680\n\nSo, the probability is 24/1680.\n\nLet's simplify this fraction:\n\n24 \u00f7 24 = 1\n\n1680 \u00f7 24 = 70\n\nSo, 1/70.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations.\n\nActually, I think I made a mistake in multiplying the denominators. Let's do that again:\n\n2 * 7 = 14\n\n14 * 2 = 28\n\n28 * 5 = 140\n\n140 * 2 = 280\n\n280 * 3 = 840\n\n840 * 2 = 1680\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, numerators: 1 * 4 = 4\n\n4 * 1 = 4\n\n4 * 3 = 12\n\n12 * 1 = 12\n\n12 * 2 = 24\n\n24 * 1 = 24\n\n24 * 1 = 24\n\nSo, 24/1680 simplifies to 1/70.\n\nNow, let's consider the second scenario: starting with a black ball.\n\nThe sequence would be B, W, B, W, B, W, B, W.\n\nThe probabilities would be similar, just starting with black instead of white.\n\nSo, the probability would be:\n\n(4/8) * (4/7) * (3/6) * (3/5) * (2/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * (1/1)\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly the same as the first scenario!\n\nSo, the probability for the second scenario is also 1/70.\n\nNow, since these are two mutually exclusive events (you can't start with both white and black), we add their probabilities together.\n\nSo, total probability is 1/70 + 1/70 = 2/70 = 1/35.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/8\n\nB. 1/7\n\nC. 1/40\n\nD. 1/35\n\nSo, the answer seems to be D. 1/35.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, in the first scenario, starting with white:\n\n(4/8) * (4/7) * (3/6) * (3/5) * (2/4) * (2/3) * (1/2) * 1 = 1/70\n\nSecond scenario, starting with black:\n\nSame calculations, so another 1/70\n\nTotal: 1/70 + 1/70 = 2/70 = 1/35\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of favorable sequences divided by the total number of possible sequences.\n\nTotal number of ways to draw 8 balls is 8! (since order matters), but since balls of the same color are indistinct, we need to account for that.\n\nActually, the total number of distinct sequences is the number of ways to arrange 4 white and 4 black balls in a sequence, which is 8! / (4! * 4!) = 70.\n\nNow, the number of favorable sequences is 2: one starting with white and one starting with black.\n\nSo, probability is 2/70 = 1/35.\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/35, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
