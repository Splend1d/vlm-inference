                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a landlord and a series of tenants who are assigning their interests in an apartment. It's a bit complicated with all the assignments and payments, so I need to carefully trace who was responsible for paying rent when.\n\nLet's start by understanding the timeline and who was occupying the apartment at each stage.\n\n1. **Original Lease:**\n\n- The landlord leased the apartment to a college senior on December 1, 2007, for a three-year term at $1,000 per month, payable on the first of each month.\n\n2. **First Assignment:**\n\n- After six months, which would be June 1, 2008, the college senior assigned his interest to a college junior.\n\n3. **College Junior's Tenure:**\n\n- The junior paid rent for two months. Since the assignment was on June 1, 2008, paying for two months would cover June and July 2008.\n\n- Then, the junior assigned his interest to a college sophomore on August 1, 2008.\n\n4. **College Sophomore's Tenure:**\n\n- The sophomore took possession on August 1, 2008, and paid rent for August but did not pay for the next three months. So, rent was due for September, October, and November 2008.\n\n- On December 1, 2008, the sophomore assigned the premises to a college freshman.\n\n5. **College Freshman's Tenure:**\n\n- The freshman took possession on December 1, 2008, and occupied the apartment until April 1, 2009, without paying any rent.\n\nNow, the landlord is suing the college freshman on April 5, 2009, to recover outstanding rent.\n\nI need to figure out how much the freshman is liable for.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the months where rent was due but not paid.\n\nStarting from December 1, 2007, to April 1, 2009, is a period of 16 months:\n\n- December 2007\n\n- January 2008\n\n- February 2008\n\n- March 2008\n\n- April 2008\n\n- May 2008\n\n- June 2008\n\n- July 2008\n\n- August 2008\n\n- September 2008\n\n- October 2008\n\n- November 2008\n\n- December 2008\n\n- January 2009\n\n- February 2009\n\n- March 2009\n\n- April 2009\n\nWait, but the lease is from December 1, 2007, to November 30, 2010, since it's a three-year term. But the events only go up to April 1, 2009.\n\nNow, let's see who paid what:\n\n- The college senior was responsible from December 2007 to May 2008 and paid for all these months.\n\n- The college junior took over on June 1, 2008, and paid for June and July 2008.\n\n- The college sophomore took over on August 1, 2008, paid for August but not for September, October, November 2008.\n\n- The college freshman took over on December 1, 2008, and didn't pay from December 2008 to April 2009.\n\nSo, the outstanding rent periods are:\n\n- September 2008\n\n- October 2008\n\n- November 2008\n\n- December 2008\n\n- January 2009\n\n- February 2009\n\n- March 2009\n\n- April 2009\n\nThat's 8 months in total.\n\nAt $1,000 per month, that would be $8,000.\n\nBut the question is, is the college freshman liable for all of that?\n\nIn property law, when a tenant assigns their interest to another tenant, the assignee generally steps into the shoes of the assignor and assumes all the obligations under the lease from the date of assignment.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- The senior assigned to the junior on June 1, 2008.\n\n- The junior assigned to the sophomore on August 1, 2008.\n\n- The sophomore assigned to the freshman on December 1, 2008.\n\nTherefore, the freshman is only responsible for the rent starting from December 1, 2008, to April 1, 2009, which is 5 months.\n\nBut wait, the sophomore didn't pay for September, October, and November 2008. Is the freshman liable for those months as well?\n\nIn general, an assignee is not liable for the debts or obligations that accrued before the assignment, unless there is a specific agreement to that effect.\n\nSo, the freshman would typically only be liable for the rent starting from the date he took possession, which is December 1, 2008.\n\nTherefore, the outstanding rent the freshman owes is for December 2008, January 2009, February 2009, March 2009, and April 2009, which is 5 months at $1,000 each, totaling $5,000.\n\nBut, there might be a argument that the freshman is jointly liable with previous tenants for the entire outstanding rent, but that seems less likely without specific language in the assignments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the landlord can hold all assignees liable for the entire debt, but I think that would require a more detailed analysis of the assignments and any assumptions of liability.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. $8,000.00\n\nB. $7,000.00\n\nC. $5,000.00\n\nD. $4,000.00\n\nI think the most likely answer is C. $5,000.00, corresponding to the five months the freshman occupied the apartment without paying rent.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there's any basis for the freshman to be liable for the rent owed by the sophomore.\n\nIf the assignment from the sophomore to the freshman included an agreement to pay all outstanding rent, then the freshman might be liable for the full $8,000.\n\nBut based on the information provided, it seems that each assignee only assumed liability from the date of their assignment onward.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C. $5,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
