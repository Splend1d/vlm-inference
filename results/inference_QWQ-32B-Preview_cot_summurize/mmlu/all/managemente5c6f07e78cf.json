Synergy means the combined effect of different elements, but I don't think it specifically refers to planning for contingencies.\n\nB. Ad hoc planning - \"Ad hoc\" means devised for a particular purpose or situation, often improvised. Contingency planning is about preparing for possible future events, so ad hoc planning might involve some contingency elements, but it doesn't seem like a direct synonym.\n\nC. Business level planning - This sounds like planning at the business level, perhaps strategic planning for an entire organization. Contingency planning is more about preparing for specific unforeseen events, so they might be related but not the same.\n\nD. Scenario planning - This one interests me. Scenario planning involves creating and analyzing possible future scenarios to prepare for different outcomes. It seems closely related to contingency planning, which is about preparing for possible events that might require alternative actions.\n\nLet me think about this. Contingency planning is about being ready to handle unexpected situations by having predefined responses or actions. Scenario planning involves envisioning various possible futures and planning how to respond to them.\n\nSo, scenario planning seems like it could be another name for contingency planning, or at least a closely related concept.\n\nWait, maybe they're not exactly the same. Contingency planning is more about planning for specific contingencies or emergencies, while scenario planning is broader, involving the exploration of multiple possible futures to inform strategic decisions.\n\nBut in practice, scenario planning can include planning for contingencies. For example, you might scenario plan for different economic conditions and then have contingency plans in place for if one of those scenarios occurs.\n\nPerhaps contingency planning is a type of scenario planning, but not all scenario planning is contingency planning.\n\nGiven that, maybe \"scenario planning\" is another name for contingency planning, or at least a synonym for it.\n\nLet me check the other options again. Synergy planning doesn't seem relevant here. Ad hoc planning is more about immediate, temporary solutions, not necessarily about planning for contingencies. Business level planning is too broad and doesn't specifically relate to contingency planning.\n\nSo, by process of elimination, D. Scenario planning seems to be the best answer.\n\nBut I should make sure. Let me look up a quick definition of contingency planning.\n\nContingency planning is the process of preparing and acting on alternate courses of action should a particular situation arise. It's about being prepared for unexpected events.\n\nScenario planning, on the other hand, is a strategic planning method that helps organizations anticipate and prepare for possible futures by considering multiple plausible scenarios.\n\nWhile they are related, they are not exactly the same. Contingency planning is more about preparing for specific contingencies, whereas scenario planning is about exploring a range of possible futures to inform overall strategy.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, they might be used interchangeably, or contingency planning could be a component of scenario planning.\n\nGiven that, I think D. Scenario planning is the best answer among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
