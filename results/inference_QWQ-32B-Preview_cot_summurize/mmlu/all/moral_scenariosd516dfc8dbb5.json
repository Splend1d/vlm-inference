So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I turned on the baseball field's sprinklers during the baseball game.\"\n\nHmm, turning on sprinklers during a game could be problematic. It might interfere with the game, make the field slippery or wet, which could be dangerous for the players. It could also be seen as disruptive or even malicious, depending on the context. Maybe the game is important, and disrupting it could cause inconvenience or even cancel the game. So, from a moral standpoint, interfering with a game in a way that could harm or inconvenience others might be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I threw a shovelful of dirt into the wheelbarrow.\"\n\nThis seems like a pretty normal action. Maybe someone is working in a garden or on a construction site, and they're moving dirt from one place to another. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. It's a routine task that people do without any ethical issues.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 seems potentially morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to Scenario 1. Maybe turning on the sprinklers was necessary for some reason. Perhaps the field was drying out too much, and it needed watering during the game. In that case, it might not be wrong. However, generally, interrupting a game for any reason, especially if it's without consent, could be seen as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 is just performing a task that doesn't seem to harm anyone or cause any moral issues.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
