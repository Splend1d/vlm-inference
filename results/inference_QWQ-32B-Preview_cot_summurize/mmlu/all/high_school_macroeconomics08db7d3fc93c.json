                    "text": "Let's see. The economy is operating beyond full employment. That means that the economy is producing more than its potential output, and unemployment is below the natural rate. So, I need to figure out which of these statements is true in that situation.\n\nOption A says that the short-run aggregate supply curve is horizontal. I know that a horizontal SRAS curve would imply that prices don't change regardless of the level of output, which is typical in the extreme Keynesian model. But beyond full employment, I think the SRAS curve should be upward sloping, indicating that as output increases, prices rise. So, I don't think A is correct.\n\nOption B says that further increases in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level. Hmm, that seems counterintuitive. If aggregate demand increases beyond full employment, I would expect prices to rise, not fall. So, B doesn't make sense to me.\n\nOption C says that a decrease in aggregate demand will result in a lower price level if prices are sticky. Sticky prices mean that prices don't adjust immediately to changes in demand. So, if aggregate demand decreases, but prices don't fall right away, that could lead to a lower price level in the short run. That seems plausible.\n\nOption D says that further increases in aggregate demand will not lower the unemployment rate but will create inflation. Beyond full employment, there shouldn't be much room to lower unemployment further because most people who want to work are already employed. So, increasing aggregate demand more would mainly lead to higher prices, i.e., inflation, rather than reducing unemployment. That makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, both C and D seem plausible. But the question is about the economy operating beyond full employment, and it's asking which is true at this point. Option C is about a decrease in aggregate demand, while option D is about further increases in aggregate demand.\n\nGiven that the economy is already beyond full employment, a decrease in aggregate demand might bring it back towards full employment, possibly lowering prices if prices are sticky. But the question is about what's true at this point, not what would happen with a change in aggregate demand.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, directly addresses what happens with further increases in aggregate demand beyond full employment, which aligns with the scenario described.\n\nSo, perhaps D is the better answer.\n\nLet me double-check. If the economy is beyond full employment, and aggregate demand increases further, unemployment is already low, so more demand would mainly lead to inflation. That sounds right.\n\nOption C is about a decrease in aggregate demand leading to a lower price level if prices are sticky. While that might be true, it's not directly addressing what's true at the point where the economy is beyond full employment. It's more about what could happen if aggregate demand changes.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
