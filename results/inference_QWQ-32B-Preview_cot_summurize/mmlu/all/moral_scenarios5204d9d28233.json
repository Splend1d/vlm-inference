Helping your child by providing them with test answers is not supporting their education; it's undermining the educational process. Schools rely on tests to assess students' understanding and mastery of the material. By providing test answers, you're essentially telling your child that it's okay to deceive and not put in the effort to learn. This goes against the principles of honesty and fairness that are fundamental in education and in society at large.\n\nMoreover, encouraging or enabling cheating can have long-term negative effects on the child's character and work ethic. It doesn't prepare them for real-world situations where they need to rely on their own knowledge and skills. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I like to park in my driveway without asking my neighbors.\"\n\nThis one seems less straightforward. Assuming that the driveway is your own property, you have the right to park there without needing permission from others. Driveways are typically private property, and as the owner, you should be able to use it as you see fit, as long as you're not violating any local laws or regulations.\n\nHowever, if the driveway is shared with neighbors or if there are community rules about its use, then the situation might be different. But based on the scenario provided, it seems that the driveway is yours, so parking there without asking neighbors shouldn't be morally wrong.\n\nIt's possible that the neighbor might have some expectations or agreements about driveway usage, but without any such agreements mentioned, parking in your own driveway seems morally neutral.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves clear moral wrongdoing, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
