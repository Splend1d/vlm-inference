                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this genetics question. It's asking for the proportion of genes shared by first cousins, and the options are fractions like 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16. I know that relatives share certain percentages of their genes, but I'm not sure exactly how it works for first cousins.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what first cousins are. From what I recall, first cousins are the children of siblings. So, if my aunt has a child, and I have a sibling, then my sibling and my cousin share grandparents, but not parents.\n\nNow, I know that siblings share about half of their genes, on average. That makes sense because each gets half of their genes from each parent, and since the parents are the same, there's overlap. But for first cousins, it's a bit different because they only share grandparents.\n\nMaybe I can think of it this way: each parent contributes half of their genes to their offspring. So, if my parents have another child, my sibling, we both get half our genes from each parent, so we share about half our genes.\n\nNow, for first cousins, they get half their genes from each of their parents. Their parents, being siblings, share half their genes because they have the same parents (our grandparents). So, perhaps first cousins share something like a quarter of their genes?\n\nWait, let's try to break it down more carefully. Let's consider the path of inheritance.\n\nLet's say we have two people who are first cousins. They each have parents who are siblings. So, the parents of these first cousins are brothers or sisters.\n\nLet's call the grandparents \"G1\" and \"G2.\" They have two children, \"P1\" and \"P2\" (parents of the first cousins). So, P1 and P2 are siblings.\n\nNow, P1 has a child, \"C1,\" and P2 has a child, \"C2.\" C1 and C2 are first cousins.\n\nNow, the question is, what proportion of genes do C1 and C2 share?\n\nI think it would help to consider the coefficients of relationship or something like that. I vaguely remember that the coefficient of relationship between two individuals is the probability that they share a copy of a gene from a common ancestor.\n\nSo, for siblings, it's 1/2 because they share both parents. For first cousins, they only share grandparents.\n\nLet me try to calculate it.\n\nEach person gets half their genes from each parent. So, C1 gets half from P1 and half from their other parent (let's call them P3, who is not related to P1 or P2).\n\nSimilarly, C2 gets half from P2 and half from their other parent (P4, also not related to the others).\n\nNow, P1 and P2 share half their genes because they are siblings.\n\nSo, C1 gets half of their genes from P1, and C2 gets half of their genes from P2.\n\nSince P1 and P2 share half their genes, that means that C1 and C2 should share 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 of their genes from P1 and P2.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because they also get genes from P3 and P4, who are not related.\n\nSo, perhaps the total shared genes are only from P1 and P2, which is 1/4.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nIn humans, full siblings share on average 50% of their genes (actually, it's slightly less due to crossing over and independent assortment, but let's assume 50% for simplicity).\n\nFirst cousins should share less than that because they're more distantly related.\n\nLooking at the options, 1/2 is too high, 1/4 seems possible, but I think it's lower.\n\nWait, I think I remember that first cousins share about 12.5% of their genes, which would be 1/8.\n\nLooking at the options, 1/8 is option C.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 1/4. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the coefficients of relationship.\n\nThe coefficient of relationship between two individuals is equal to twice the coefficient of consanguinity.\n\nWait, that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of relationship between first cousins is 1/8.\n\nBut I need to confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of pathways of inheritance.\n\nEach generation introduces a reduction in the proportion of shared genes by a factor of 1/2.\n\nSo, siblings share 1/2, first cousins share 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with what I think I remember, which is that first cousins share 1/8.\n\nMaybe I need to look at it in terms of the common ancestors.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of relationship is sum over all paths from one individual to the other of (1/2)^length of the path.\n\nFor first cousins, there are two paths through the grandparents.\n\nEach path is of length 4 (C1 to P1 to G1 to P2 to C2), so (1/2)^4 = 1/16 per path.\n\nSince there are two paths (through G1 and through G2), total is 2*(1/16) = 1/8.\n\nAh, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 1/8, which is option C.\n\nI think I got it confused earlier when I thought it was 1/4, but that seems to be incorrect.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 1.0/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. } 1.0/8} \\]"
