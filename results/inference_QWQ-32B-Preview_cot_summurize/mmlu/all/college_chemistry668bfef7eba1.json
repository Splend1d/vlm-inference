                    "text": "To find the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of benzene and chloroform on a 600 MHz spectrometer, we need to understand how chemical shifts translate into frequency differences.\n\nFirst, let's recall that chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in parts per million (ppm), and they correspond to frequency differences relative to a reference standard. In NMR spectroscopy, the frequency difference between two signals is proportional to the difference in their chemical shifts and the operating frequency of the spectrometer.\n\nThe formula to calculate the frequency difference (\u0394\u03bd) in Hertz (Hz) between two signals is:\n\n\u0394\u03bd = (\u03b42 - \u03b41) \u00d7 (operating frequency)\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03b41 and \u03b42 are the chemical shifts of the two compounds in ppm.\n\n- Operating frequency is the NMR spectrometer frequency in Hz.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Chemical shift of benzene (\u03b41) = 128.4 ppm\n\n- Chemical shift of chloroform (\u03b42) = 77.2 ppm\n\n- Spectrometer frequency = 600 MHz\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in chemical shifts:\n\n\u03b4 difference = \u03b41 - \u03b42 = 128.4 ppm - 77.2 ppm = 51.2 ppm\n\nNow, convert the spectrometer frequency to Hz:\n\n600 MHz = 600 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nNow, calculate the frequency difference:\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 51.2 ppm \u00d7 600 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nBut, since 1 ppm = 1 \u00d7 10^-6, we can write:\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 51.2 \u00d7 10^-6 \u00d7 600 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 51.2 \u00d7 600 \u00d7 10^( -6 + 6 ) Hz\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 51.2 \u00d7 600 \u00d7 1 Hz\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 30720 Hz\n\nNow, convert Hz to kHz (since 1 kHz = 1000 Hz):\n\n\u0394\u03bd = 30720 Hz \u00f7 1000 = 30.72 kHz\n\nTherefore, the difference in the 13C NMR frequencies of benzene and chloroform on a 600 MHz spectrometer is approximately 30.7 kHz.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 30.7 kHz\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
