                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I picked up all the trash from the yard after the party.\n\n2. I tried a shirt on and put it back on the rack.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: picking up all the trash from the yard after a party. Normally, throwing away trash is a responsible thing to do. It keeps the environment clean and shows respect for public or private property. So, in this case, picking up trash seems like a positive action, not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: trying on a shirt and putting it back on the rack. This seems like a normal thing to do when shopping. You try on clothes to see if they fit or look good, and then you return them to where you found them, right? That's what most stores expect customers to do. So, this also appears to be a standard behavior, not morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's think deeper.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the party was at someone else's house, and you picked up their trash without being asked, maybe that's intrusive. But the scenario says \"my yard,\" so it's probably your own property. So, cleaning up your own yard seems fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the party was at a public place, and picking up trash there is volunteering, which is good. Either way, it doesn't seem wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, trying on a shirt and putting it back should be fine. But perhaps if the shirt is damaged or stained after trying it on, and you don't report it to the store, that could be a problem. But the scenario just says \"put it back on the rack,\" without any mention of damage. So, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shirt is still on your body, and you put it back without properly hanging it or folding it. But again, the scenario is pretty general.\n\nGiven that, both actions seem morally neutral or even positive. So, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any context where these actions could be wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe if you picked up someone else's trash without their permission, but again, it's specified as \"from the yard after the party,\" and using \"I\" suggests it's your yard.\n\nFor Scenario 2, maybe if you tried on the shirt in a way that violates store policies, like without using the fitting room, but again, the scenario doesn't indicate any such thing.\n\nSo, overall, both actions seem acceptable morally.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
