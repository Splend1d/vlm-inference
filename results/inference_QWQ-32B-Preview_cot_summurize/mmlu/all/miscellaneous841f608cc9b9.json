                    "text": "In military time, 4:00 pm is expressed as 1600. So the correct answer is A. 1600.\n\nHere's how it works: Military time uses a 24-hour clock, whereas standard time uses a 12-hour clock with am and pm designations. To convert standard time to military time, you add 12 to any hour from 1:00 pm to 11:00 pm. So, for 4:00 pm, you add 12 to 4, which gives you 16:00. The colon is often omitted, so it's written as 1600.\n\nLet me break it down further:\n\n- From 1:00 am to 12:00 pm, military time is the same as standard time, except that 12:00 pm is written as 1200 in military time.\n\n- From 1:00 pm to 11:00 pm, you add 12 to the standard time hour. For example:\n\n- 1:00 pm becomes 1300\n\n- 2:00 pm becomes 1400\n\n- 3:00 pm becomes 1500\n\n- 4:00 pm becomes 1600\n\n- And so on, up to 11:00 pm, which becomes 2300.\n\n- Midnight is represented as 0000 in military time.\n\nSo, for 4:00 pm, the military time is 1600. The other options are incorrect because:\n\n- B. 4: This doesn't make sense in the context of military time.\n\n- C. 400: This could be confused with 4:00 am, but actually, 4:00 am is 0400 in military time.\n\n- D. 4:00: This is just the standard time notation for 4:00 am or 4:00 pm, which isn't specific without the am/pm designation.\n\nRemembering this conversion can be helpful in various situations, such as in the military, aviation, navigation, and in some international contexts where the 24-hour clock is used.\n\n**Additional Tip:** A mnemonic to remember the conversion is to think of the military time starting at 0000 at midnight and counting up to 2359, with each hour incrementing by 100 (e.g., 0100, 0200, etc.), and minutes added accordingly.\n\n**Example Conversion:**\n\n- 1:00 am = 0100\n\n- 12:00 pm = 1200\n\n- 4:30 pm = 1630\n\n- 11:45 pm = 2345\n\nI hope this helps clarify how to convert standard time to military time!
