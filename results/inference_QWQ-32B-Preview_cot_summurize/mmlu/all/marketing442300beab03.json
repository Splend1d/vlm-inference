It involves talking to people who know about the problem and looking at data that already exists. We need to pick the right term from the options given: situation analysis, information investigation, exploratory research, or bottom-line analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nSituation analysis seems like it's about assessing a current situation, maybe in business or marketing, to understand what's going on. It might involve looking at the environment, competitors, and internal factors.\n\nInformation investigation sounds a bit vague, but it might be about gathering information to solve a problem or answer a question. It could be similar to situation analysis but more focused on the research aspect.\n\nExploratory research sounds interesting. From what I recall, exploratory research is done when you don't have a clear idea about the problem or the research question. It's like you're exploring to understand more about the issue before conducting more structured research.\n\nBottom-line analysis probably refers to focusing on the financial aspects or the ultimate outcome of a situation. It might be about evaluating the costs and benefits.\n\nNow, going back to the question, it mentions that this type of research is undertaken when little is known about the problem. It involves discussing the problem with informed sources and examining pre-existing data. That sounds a lot like exploratory research to me.\n\nExploratory research is often used in the early stages of understanding a problem. It helps to define the problem more clearly and to develop hypotheses that can be tested in later, more formal research studies. It's flexible and can involve various methods like interviews, reviews of literature, and analysis of available data.\n\nSituation analysis and information investigation might involve similar activities, but exploratory research seems more fitting for when you're trying to understand the cause of a problem with limited initial knowledge.\n\nBottom-line analysis appears to be more focused on financial outcomes, which doesn't directly align with the description provided.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Exploratory research.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nA. Situation analysis: This might involve assessing the current state of affairs, but it may not specifically focus on discovering the cause of a problem through discussions and data examination.\n\nB. Information investigation: This could be a broad term for any research that involves gathering information, but it's not a standard term in research methodology like exploratory research is.\n\nC. Exploratory research: This matches the description well, as it's used to gain insights and understanding of the problem when not much is known about it.\n\nD. Bottom-line analysis: This seems more related to financial analysis and may not involve the kinds of activities mentioned in the question.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Exploratory research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
