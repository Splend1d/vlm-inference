                    "text": "Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of certain proteins that are required for blood clotting. So, if there's a deficiency in vitamin K, it would affect the blood clotting process.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The plasma concentration of calcitonin: Calcitonin is a hormone that plays a role in regulating calcium levels in the body. It's produced by the thyroid gland. Vitamin K deficiency doesn't directly affect calcitonin levels, so this is unlikely.\n\nB. The plasma concentration of prothrombin: Prothrombin is a protein that's involved in blood clotting, and its synthesis requires vitamin K. So, in vitamin K deficiency, the production of prothrombin might be affected. However, the question is about what increases in vitamin K deficiency.\n\nC. The time for blood to clot: Since vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting, a deficiency would likely lead to longer clotting times. This seems plausible.\n\nD. Haemolysis due to oxidative damage to red cell membranes: Vitamin K has antioxidant properties, so a deficiency might increase oxidative damage. However, haemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells, which isn't directly related to vitamin K's primary function in blood clotting.\n\nConsidering these points, the most directly affected parameter in vitamin K deficiency would be the time for blood to clot, as vitamin K is crucial for the synthesis of clotting factors like prothrombin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
