                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a federal statute that's been enacted to address voting rights issues, particularly focusing on minorities being disenfranchised. The statute says that any law denying minorities the right to vote shall be deemed unconstitutional. Now, I need to figure out under which constitutional provision this federal statute will most likely be upheld.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nB. Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nC. Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nD. Twentieth Amendment.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these amendments is about.\n\nStarting with the Thirteenth Amendment: I know that this one abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. So, it's mainly about ending slavery. Does that relate directly to voting rights? Not really, although you could maybe make an argument that former slaves should have the right to vote, but that's not its primary focus.\n\nNext, the Fourteenth Amendment: This one is big and has several clauses. It includes the Citizenship Clause, which defines citizenship, and the Equal Protection Clause, which says that no state shall deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. This seems more relevant to voting rights because it's about equality and equal treatment under the law. So, maybe this is a candidate.\n\nThen, the Fifteenth Amendment: This one specifically addresses the right to vote. It states that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. That sounds directly on point for this issue of minorities being disenfranchised based on their race or color.\n\nFinally, the Twentieth Amendment: I think this one is about the terms of the President and Vice President, and the beginning and ending of their terms, maybe something about the start of congressional sessions. I don't think this has anything to do with voting rights or disenfranchisement.\n\nSo, comparing these, the Thirteenth Amendment is about ending slavery, the Fourteenth is about equal protection, the Fifteenth is about the right to vote without regard to race, and the Twentieth is about governmental terms and schedules.\n\nGiven that the statute is specifically targeting laws that deny minorities the right to vote, which is a voting rights issue related to race, the Fifteenth Amendment seems to be the most directly applicable constitutional provision here.\n\nBut let me think a bit more. The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause could also be used to challenge voting laws that discriminate based on race, as it guarantees equal treatment under the law. In fact, many voting rights cases have been brought under the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Fifteenth.\n\nHowever, the Fifteenth Amendment is more specific to voting rights and race, so it might be considered the primary provision relevant to this issue.\n\nAlso, the question mentions that there are residency laws in certain states that are restricting the right to vote, and that only 42% of eligible minority voters are registered in certain parts of the country. So, it seems like there are barriers being imposed that are preventing minorities from exercising their right to vote.\n\nCongress is enacting a statute to counteract these laws by declaring that any law denying minorities the right to vote is unconstitutional. This sounds like Congress is exercising its power to enforce the constitutional guarantees, particularly those related to voting rights.\n\nGiven that the Fifteenth Amendment specifically addresses the right to vote without discrimination based on race, it would make sense that Congress is acting under that amendment to pass this statute.\n\nMoreover, the Fifteenth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce its provisions through appropriate legislation. So, Congress has the authority to enact laws to prevent or remedy violations of the right to vote guaranteed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nSimilarly, the Fourteenth Amendment also has an enforcement clause, but again, the Fifteenth is more directly on point for voting rights based on race.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe there's a scenario where the Fourteenth Amendment could be the basis, but given the specific focus on race and voting, the Fifteenth Amendment seems more appropriate.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Fifteenth Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
