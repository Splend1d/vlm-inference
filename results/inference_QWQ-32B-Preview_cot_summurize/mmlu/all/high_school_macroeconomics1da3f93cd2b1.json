                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an economy that only produces cheese and crackers. I need to calculate the GDP for this economy based on the prices and quantities given. Let me see what I've got.\n\nFirst, cheese retails for $3 per pound, and they produce 10 pounds of it. So, the value of cheese produced would be the price per pound times the number of pounds produced. That should be $3 times 10, which is $30.\n\nNext, crackers sell for $2 per pound, and they produce 20 pounds of them. So, the value of crackers produced would be $2 times 20, which is $40.\n\nNow, GDP is the total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy within a certain period. In this case, since it's a very simple economy producing only cheese and crackers, the GDP should just be the sum of the value of cheese and the value of crackers.\n\nSo, GDP = value of cheese + value of crackers = $30 + $40 = $70.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $35\n\nB. $1,200\n\nC. $70\n\nD. $150\n\nIt seems like the correct answer should be C. $70.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs there any other factor I need to consider? Like, are there any intermediate goods or anything like that? Nope, in this scenario, it's just final goods: cheese and crackers.\n\nAlso, make sure that the units are consistent. Both prices are per pound, and both productions are in pounds, so that matches up.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any services being produced, but the problem says only cheese and crackers are produced, so no services to account for.\n\nSo, yeah, I think $70 is the correct GDP for this economy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
