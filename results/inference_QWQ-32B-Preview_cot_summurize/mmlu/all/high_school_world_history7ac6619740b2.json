The rehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to run their course. What can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we!

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Indonesian leader Sukarno's keynote address to the Bandung Conference in 1955. So, I need to recall what the Bandung Conference was about and how it relates to the options given.\n\nFirst off, the Bandung Conference was a meeting of Asian and African countries that aimed to promote economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism. It was a significant event during the Cold War era. So, considering that context, let's look at each option.\n\nOption A is about the formation of the non-aligned movement. I know that the non-aligned movement was a group of states that weren't aligned with either the Soviet Union or the United States during the Cold War. The Bandung Conference is often seen as a precursor to the non-aligned movement because it promoted independence from the superpowers' spheres of influence. So, this seems relevant.\n\nOption B mentions global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. While peace is a theme in the passage, the main focus seems to be on maintaining independence and promoting cooperation among Asian and African countries, rather than specifically on disarmament or nuclear issues.\n\nOption C is about the Green Revolution in agriculture. I don't recall any direct connection between the Bandung Conference and agricultural reforms or the Green Revolution.\n\nOption D talks about the mobilization of pan-Asian ideology. While the conference included Asian and African countries, it was more about solidarity among newly independent nations against colonialism, rather than specifically promoting pan-Asian ideology.\n\nConsidering these points, I think Option A, the formation of the non-aligned movement, is the most associated development with this passage. The emphasis on preserving peace, independence, and mobilizing the strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace aligns well with the principles of the non-aligned movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
