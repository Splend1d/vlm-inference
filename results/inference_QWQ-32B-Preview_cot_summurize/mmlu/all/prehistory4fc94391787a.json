                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out how Homo erectus differed from Homo habilis. I remember that both are early human species, but they had some distinct characteristics.\n\nOption A says that Erectus fossils are found only in Africa. I think that's not correct because I recall that Homo erectus actually spread beyond Africa into Asia and even to parts of Europe. So, they weren't limited to Africa only.\n\nOption B says that Erectus possessed a smaller brain. I think that's the opposite of what I remember. Homo habilis had a smaller brain compared to Homo erectus. Homo erectus had a larger brain size, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nOption C says that Erectus possessed a larger brain. That sounds right. Homo erectus had a bigger brain capacity than Homo habilis. I think Homo habilis had an average brain size of about 600 cubic centimeters, while Homo erectus had around 900 cubic centimeters or more.\n\nOption D says that Erectus was a relatively short-lived species. I don't think that's accurate. Homo erectus actually had one of the longest reigns in human evolution. They existed from about 1.9 million years ago to possibly as recent as 143,000 years ago. That's a really long time span in evolutionary terms.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Option C seems to be the correct answer. Homo erectus had a larger brain compared to Homo habilis.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about other differences between them. Homo erectus also had a different body structure. They were taller and more similar to modern humans in terms of their body proportions. They were also more efficient walkers and runners. Additionally, they used more advanced tools compared to Homo habilis.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking about how Homo erectus differed from Homo habilis, and among the options provided, Option C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
