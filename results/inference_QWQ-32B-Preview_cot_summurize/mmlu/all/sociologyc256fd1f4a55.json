An extended or consanguine family, including all the relatives by blood, marriage, or adoption.\n\nB. The government of a large city.\n\nC. A book club in which books are chosen by members who take turns alphabetically to lead discussion.\n\nD. The volunteers who gather annually to clean the neighborhood.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what bureaucracy means. I remember that bureaucracy is a type of organizational structure that's characterized by a hierarchy of authority, a set of rules and procedures, and specialized roles or jobs. It's often associated with government agencies or large organizations where there's a clear chain of command.\n\nOption A is about an extended family. Families can be complex, especially when including relatives by blood, marriage, or adoption. But do they have the characteristics of a bureaucracy? Probably not. Families are more based on personal relationships and emotions rather than formal rules and procedures. So, I don't think this fits.\n\nOption B is the government of a large city. That sounds like a classic example of a bureaucracy. Governments have hierarchies, with mayors, council members, department heads, and so on. There are established rules and procedures for how decisions are made and how services are delivered. It seems to match the definition of bureaucracy.\n\nOption C is a book club where members take turns alphabetically to lead discussions. That sounds more like a informal group. While they have a method for choosing who leads, it doesn't sound like there's a hierarchy or strict rules and procedures. It's probably more about shared interests and casual meetings. So, probably not a bureaucracy.\n\nOption D is about volunteers who gather annually to clean the neighborhood. Again, this sounds like a group that comes together for a specific purpose without a formal structure. They might have some organization, but it's likely not as rigid as a bureaucracy.\n\nComparing all these options, option B, the government of a large city, seems to fit the characteristics of a bureaucracy the most. It has a hierarchy, rules, and specialized roles, which are all key aspects of bureaucracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
