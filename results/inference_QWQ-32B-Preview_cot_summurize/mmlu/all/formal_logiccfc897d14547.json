                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to translate the sentence \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar, but neither Janet nor Latoya did\" into predicate logic. The options are:\n\nA. Lm \u2228 ~(Jl \u2228 Ll)\n\nB. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n\nC. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll)\n\nD. Lm \u2228 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll)\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence and understand what it's saying. \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar\" is one part, and \"neither Janet nor Latoya did\" is the other part. The word \"but\" connects these two parts, indicating that both are true, so I think I need to use the conjunction symbol, which is \"\u2022\" in predicate logic.\n\nSo, \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar\" can be represented as Lm, assuming Lx means \"x lent me some sugar,\" and m stands for Ms. Jackson.\n\nNow, \"neither Janet nor Latoya did\" means that both Janet and Latoya did not lend me sugar. In logic, \"neither...nor\" can be translated as \"not (Janet lent me sugar or Latoya lent me sugar),\" which is ~(Jl \u2228 Ll), where Jl is \"Janet lent me sugar\" and Ll is \"Latoya lent me sugar.\"\n\nSo, putting it all together, it should be Lm and not (Janet or Latoya lent me sugar), which is Lm \u2022 ~(Jl \u2228 Ll).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA has a disjunction symbol \"\u2228\" between Lm and the negation, which means \"or\" instead of \"and.\"\n\nB has Lm and not (Lj and Ll), which would mean that Ms. Jackson lent me sugar, and it's not the case that both Janet and Latoya lent me sugar. But the original sentence says neither Janet nor Latoya did, which is different.\n\nC has Lm and not (Lj or Ll), which matches what I thought it should be.\n\nD has a disjunction between Lm and not (Lj and Ll), which again is not matching the original sentence.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll).\n\nBut wait, in the options, it's Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll), which matches my reasoning.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider what each part means.\n\nLm is \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar.\"\n\n~(Lj \u2228 Ll) is \"neither Janet nor Latoya lent me some sugar.\"\n\nSo, combining them with \"\u2022\" means both of these are true, which matches the original sentence.\n\nOption A: Lm \u2228 ~(Jl \u2228 Ll) would mean \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar or neither Janet nor Latoya lent me some sugar,\" which is not the same as both happening.\n\nOption B: Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll) would mean \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar and it's not the case that both Janet and Latoya lent me some sugar.\" This doesn't capture the notion that neither Janet nor Latoya lent me sugar.\n\nOption D: Lm \u2228 ~(Lj \u2022 Ll) would mean \"Ms. Jackson lent me some sugar or it's not the case that both Janet and Latoya lent me some sugar,\" which again doesn't match the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option C: Lm \u2022 ~(Lj \u2228 Ll).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
