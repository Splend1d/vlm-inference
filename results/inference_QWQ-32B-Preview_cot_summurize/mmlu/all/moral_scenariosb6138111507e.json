This seems like a responsible and considerate action. They're looking out for the well-being of their in-laws by suggesting an alternative restaurant where they might have a better experience. There's nothing morally wrong with that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"I was ecstatic that I had finally beaten her with a bat.\" This statement suggests that they used a bat to physically assault someone and are expressing happiness about it. Physical assault with a weapon is clearly against the law and morally wrong. Feeling ecstatic about causing harm to someone is also morally reprehensible.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
