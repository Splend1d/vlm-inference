I need to figure out which one isn't a type of shoe.\n\nFirst, I know that espadrilles are a type of shoe. They're those casual, comfortable shoes often made with canvas or cotton uppers and a sole made of jute or a similar material. So, C is a shoe.\n\nNext, brogans sound familiar. I think they're a type of heavy shoe, maybe similar to work boots or something like that. So, B seems like a shoe too.\n\nDocksiders\u2014hmm, I've heard that term before. I believe docksiders are a type of shoe, maybe similar to boat shoes. They're often worn for casual occasions, especially near water. So, D seems to be a shoe as well.\n\nNow, gingham\u2014this one is trickier. I know gingham as a type of fabric, usually a lightweight cloth with a check or tartan pattern. It's often used for dresses, shirts, and aprons. I don't recall hearing about gingham as a type of shoe.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should think about it differently. Could gingham be a brand or a specific model of shoe? I don't think so. It's primarily known as a fabric pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a type of shoe called gingham, but given that it's a fabric, it's less likely to be a shoe style compared to the others.\n\nComparing all the options, brogan, espadrille, and docksider are all recognized shoe styles, while gingham is a fabric pattern not typically associated with shoes.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. gingham.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
