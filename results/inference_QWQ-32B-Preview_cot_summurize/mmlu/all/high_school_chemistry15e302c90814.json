                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to figure out how many half-lives it will take to reduce 10.0 kg of a radioactive substance down to 1.0 microgram. The options are A. 8, B. 13, C. 29, and D. 34. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a half-life is. A half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. So, after each half-life, the amount of the substance is halved.\n\nI start with 10.0 kg and need to get down to 1.0 microgram. I should probably convert both quantities to the same unit to make it easier to work with. Let's convert everything to grams.\n\n1 kg = 1000 grams, so 10.0 kg = 10,000 grams.\n\n1 microgram = 0.000001 grams.\n\nSo, I'm going from 10,000 grams to 0.000001 grams.\n\nNow, each half-life reduces the amount by half. So, the amount after n half-lives is given by:\n\nAmount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^n\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n0.000001 = 10,000 * (1/2)^n\n\nI need to solve for n.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 10,000:\n\n0.000001 / 10,000 = (1/2)^n\n\nThat's:\n\n1e-10 = (1/2)^n\n\nNow, to solve for n, I can take the logarithm of both sides. Let's use natural log for this.\n\nln(1e-10) = ln((1/2)^n)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nln(1e-10) = n * ln(1/2)\n\nNow, solve for n:\n\nn = ln(1e-10) / ln(1/2)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, ln(1e-10) is ln(0.0000000001) which is -23.02585.\n\nln(1/2) is ln(0.5) which is -0.69315.\n\nSo, n = -23.02585 / -0.69315 \u2248 33.22.\n\nSince the number of half-lives has to be a whole number, and we can't have a fraction of a half-life in this context, we'll round up to the next whole number, which is 34.\n\nSo, it would take 34 half-lives to reduce the substance from 10,000 grams to 0.000001 grams.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 34 is the correct choice. Looking back at the options, D. 34 is one of them.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to think about this without using logarithms. Maybe using exponents.\n\nWe know that:\n\nFinal Amount = Initial Amount * (1/2)^n\n\nSo, 0.000001 = 10,000 * (1/2)^n\n\nDivide both sides by 10,000:\n\n0.0000000001 = (1/2)^n\n\nWhich is the same as 1e-10 = (1/2)^n\n\nNow, 1/2 is 2^-1, so (1/2)^n = 2^-n\n\nSo, 1e-10 = 2^-n\n\nTaking log base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog2(1e-10) = -n\n\nSo, n = -log2(1e-10)\n\nNow, log2(1e-10) is log2(1)/log2(10^-10) = 0 - 10*log2(10)\n\nlog2(10) is approximately 3.32193\n\nSo, -10 * 3.32193 = -33.2193\n\nTherefore, n = -(-33.2193) = 33.2193, which rounds up to 34.\n\nSo, the answer should be 34 half-lives.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.\n\nLet's consider the ratio of initial to final amount:\n\n10,000 g / 0.000001 g = 10,000,000,000\n\nSo, the substance needs to be reduced by a factor of 10 billion.\n\nNow, each half-life reduces the amount by half. So, we need to find n such that (1/2)^n = 1/10,000,000,000\n\nWhich is the same as 2^n = 10,000,000,000\n\nNow, 2^33 = 8,589,934,592\n\n2^34 = 17,179,869,184\n\nSo, 2^33 is about 8.59 billion, and 2^34 is about 17.18 billion.\n\nSince 10 billion is between 2^33 and 2^34, n would be slightly more than 33, which, when rounded up, is 34.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 34.\n\nBut wait, let's check if 34 is indeed the correct choice. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial conversion.\n\nWait, 10 kg is 10,000 grams, and 1 microgram is 0.000001 grams, so the ratio is indeed 10,000,000,000.\n\nAnd 2^33 is approximately 8.59 billion, and 2^34 is approximately 17.18 billion.\n\nSince 10 billion is greater than 2^33 but less than 2^34, it means that after 33 half-lives, the amount would be reduced to about 10,000,000,000 / 8,589,934,592 \u2248 1.16, which is still more than 1, so we need one more half-life to get below 1.\n\nTherefore, 34 half-lives are needed.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n\nn = log2(initial/final) = log2(10,000,000,000) = log2(10^10) = 10 * log2(10) \u2248 10 * 3.32193 \u2248 33.2193\n\nWhich again suggests 34 half-lives.\n\nBut let's consider significant figures. The initial amount is given to three significant figures (10.0 kg), and the final amount is given to one significant figure (1.0 microgram). So, perhaps the answer should be reported with one significant figure, which would be 30, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, the options are specific: 8, 13, 29, 34.\n\nGiven that 33.2193 rounds to 33, but since 33 is not an option, and 34 is, perhaps the correct answer is 34.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the logarithm calculation.\n\nln(1e-10)/ln(0.5) = -23.02585 / -0.69315 \u2248 33.22\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using base-10 logarithms would be easier.\n\nWe have:\n\n(1/2)^n = 1e-10 / 1e4 = 1e-14\n\nWait, no, initial is 1e4 grams, final is 1e-6 grams, so ratio is 1e10.\n\nSo, (1/2)^n = 1e-10\n\nTaking log10 of both sides:\n\nn * log10(0.5) = -10\n\nn = -10 / log10(0.5)\n\nlog10(0.5) is -0.3010\n\nSo, n = -10 / -0.3010 \u2248 33.22\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 34 half-lives.\n\nBut let's consider if perhaps the initial and final amounts were misinterpreted.\n\nWait, 10.0 kg is 10,000 grams, and 1.0 microgram is 0.000001 grams.\n\nSo, the reduction factor is 10,000 / 0.000001 = 10,000,000,000, which is 10^10.\n\nSo, (1/2)^n = 10^-10\n\nTaking log10:\n\nn * log10(0.5) = -10\n\nn = -10 / log10(0.5) \u2248 33.22\n\nYes, consistently getting n \u2248 33.22, which rounds up to 34.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 34.\n\nBut the other options are quite different: 8, 13, 29.\n\nMaybe there's a different approach or a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substance is reduced by half each half-life, so after n half-lives, the remaining amount is (1/2)^n of the initial amount.\n\nWe need (1/2)^n * 10,000 g = 0.000001 g\n\nSo, (1/2)^n = 0.000001 / 10,000 = 1e-10\n\nTaking natural log:\n\nln((1/2)^n) = ln(1e-10)\n\nn * ln(0.5) = -23.02585\n\nn = -23.02585 / -0.69315 \u2248 33.22\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for exponential decay:\n\nN(t) = N0 * e^(-\u03bbt)\n\nBut since we're dealing with half-lives, it's easier to use (1/2)^(t/t_half)\n\nBut in this case, since we're solving for n half-lives, it's the same as (1/2)^n.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is indeed 34 half-lives.\n\nMaybe the options are misprinted or something, but based on the calculation, D. 34 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
