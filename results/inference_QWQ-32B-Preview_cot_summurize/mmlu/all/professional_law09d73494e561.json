                    "text": "Let's see. So, in this case, a nurse is on trial for murder, accused of putting something harmful in a resident's food at a nursing home. The prosecutor wants to show that this substance could cause death by reading from a medical textbook. The question is whether this evidence can be admitted.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the rules of evidence here. The prosecutor is trying to introduce parts of a medical treatise to prove that the substance is lethal. Now, treatises are usually considered hearsay because they're out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Hearsay is generally not admissible unless it falls under an exception.\n\nOne exception is the learned treatise exception, which allows certain authoritative works to be used in court under specific circumstances. But there are rules about how to introduce them. Typically, treatises need to be used through expert testimony. That is, an expert witness would refer to the treatise and rely on it in their testimony, but the treatise itself isn't usually read directly into the record without the expert's interpretation.\n\nIn this scenario, the prosecutor wants to read the treatise excerpts directly into evidence without first calling any witnesses. That seems problematic because it bypasses the normal procedure of having an expert testify about the treatise.\n\nOption A says no, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert. That makes sense to me. Usually, treatises are introduced through expert witnesses who can explain their relevance and interpret the information for the jury.\n\nOption B says no, because the treatise itself must be introduced as an exhibit. I'm not sure about that. While it's possible to introduce the treatise as an exhibit, the key issue is whether it's being used properly, which typically involves an expert's testimony.\n\nOption C says yes, although hearsay, under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule. But as I recall, the learned treatise exception usually applies when an expert witness is using the treatise to support their opinion. Simply reading excerpts into evidence without an expert seems like it might not qualify.\n\nOption D says yes, because the lethal nature of the substance is relevant to the defendant's state of mind and intent. Well, certainly, the lethality of the substance could be relevant to show that the defendant intended to cause harm, but that doesn't address the admissibility issue of the treatise excerpts.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the correct answer is A: No, because the treatise excerpts were not offered during the examination of a qualified expert. The prosecutor needs to have an expert witness testify about the treatise and its conclusions, rather than just reading the treatise directly into evidence.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check. Perhaps there's a way to introduce treatise material without an expert, but I think that's unlikely. In legal practice, treatises are generally considered secondary sources and are not admissible unless through the testimony of an expert who can vouch for their reliability and explain their significance.\n\nAlso, introducing the treatise as an exhibit might be possible, but again, it's typically done through an expert witness who references it in their testimony. Just reading pages from the treatise into evidence without any contextual explanation could confuse the jury and isn't in line with standard evidence rules.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer. The treatise excerpts should be offered during the examination of a qualified expert who can testify about their meaning and relevance to the case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
