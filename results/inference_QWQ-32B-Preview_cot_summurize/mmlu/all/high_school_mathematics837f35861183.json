                    "text": "So I have this problem here: express the reciprocal of \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) as a common fraction. The options are A) \\(\\frac{7}{2}\\), B) \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\), C) \\(\\frac{9}{2}\\), and D) \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) means. The notation \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) represents a repeating decimal where 7 repeats indefinitely, so it's 0.7777...\n\nI recall that to convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, I can set it equal to a variable and then manipulate it algebraically. Let's try that.\n\nLet \\(x = 0.\\overline{7}\\).\n\nThen, 10x would be 7.\\overline{7}\\), because multiplying by 10 shifts the decimal point one place to the right.\n\nSo, \\(10x = 7.\\overline{7}\\).\n\nNow, if I subtract the original \\(x = 0.\\overline{7}\\) from this equation, I get:\n\n\\(10x - x = 7.\\overline{7} - 0.\\overline{7}\\)\n\n\\(9x = 7\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(x = \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n\nSo, \\(0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the reciprocal of \\(0.\\overline{7}\\). The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number.\n\nSo, the reciprocal of \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{0.\\overline{7}}\\).\n\nSince \\(0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}\\), the reciprocal is \\(\\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{9}} = \\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\), which is option D.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) is an infinite geometric series.\n\nThe decimal \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) can be written as:\n\n\\(0.7 + 0.07 + 0.007 + \\dots\\)\n\nThis is a geometric series with the first term \\(a = 0.7\\) and common ratio \\(r = 0.1\\).\n\nThe sum \\(s\\) of an infinite geometric series is given by \\(s = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\(s = \\frac{0.7}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.7}{0.9} = \\frac{7}{9}\\)\n\nAgain, this confirms that \\(0.\\overline{7} = \\frac{7}{9}\\).\n\nTherefore, the reciprocal is \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the reciprocal directly.\n\nIf \\(x = 0.\\overline{7}\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is what I'm looking for.\n\nFrom earlier, \\(x = \\frac{7}{9}\\), so \\(\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nMaybe I can think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{7}{9}\\), then indeed, the reciprocal should be \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\nLet me see if this makes sense numerically.\n\nIf I take \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\), which is approximately 1.285714..., and take its reciprocal, I get approximately 0.777..., which is \\(0.\\overline{7}\\).\n\nThis checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the options provided:\n\nA) \\(\\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\\)\n\nB) \\(\\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.777...\\)\n\nC) \\(\\frac{9}{2} = 4.5\\)\n\nD) \\(\\frac{9}{7} \\approx 1.285714...\\)\n\nAnd since the reciprocal of \\(0.\\overline{7}\\) should be a number that, when multiplied by \\(0.\\overline{7}\\), gives 1, then:\n\n\\(0.\\overline{7} \\times \\frac{9}{7} = \\frac{7}{9} \\times \\frac{9}{7} = 1\\)\n\nThis confirms that the reciprocal is indeed \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7}} \\]"
