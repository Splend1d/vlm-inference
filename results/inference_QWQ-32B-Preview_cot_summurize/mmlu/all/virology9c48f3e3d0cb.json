                    "text": "Let's see which drugs among the options inhibit herpes viruses. I know that herpes viruses cause infections like cold sores and genital herpes, and there are specific antiviral medications used to treat these infections.\n\nOption A is Amantadine. I recall that Amantadine is primarily used against influenza A virus. It works by preventing the virus from uncoating once it enters the host cell. So, it's mainly for flu, not herpes.\n\nOption B is Acyclovir. This one rings a bell. Acyclovir is specifically designed to treat herpes\u75c5\u6bd2\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5355\u7eaf\u75b1\u75b9\u75c5\u6bd2\uff08HSV-1\u548cHSV-2\uff09\u548c\u6c34\u75d8\u5e26\u72b6\u75b1\u75b9\u75c5\u6bd2\uff08VZV\uff09\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u75c5\u6bd2DNA\u805a\u5408\u9176\u6765\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u6b62\u75c5\u6bd2\u590d\u5236\u3002\n\nOption C is Oseltamivir. I think this is better known as Tamiflu, and it's used for influenza treatment and prevention. It inhibits the neuraminidase enzyme of the flu virus, helping to reduce the spread of the virus in the body. So, again, this is for flu, not herpes.\n\nOption D is Azidothymidine, which I believe is AZT. AZT is an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV infection. It's a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that interferes with the reverse transcription process of HIV, preventing the virus from replicating.\n\nSo, among these options, Acyclovir is the one that inhibits herpes viruses. The others are targeted against different viruses: Amantadine and Oseltamivir for influenza, and AZT for HIV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
