But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.\n\u2014William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation\nSamoset and Squanto can most directly be compared to whom?\n\nA. Tecumseh\nB. Crazy Horse\nC. Sacagawea\nD. Geronimo\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Samoset and Squanto, and I need to compare them to someone from the options: Tecumseh, Crazy Horse, Sacagawea, or Geronimo. Let me see what I can remember about these historical figures.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Samoset and Squanto were. From the passage, it seems like they were Native Americans who interacted with the English settlers at Plymouth. Samoset spoke broken English and knew some English people from fishing ships, while Squanto was a local who had been to England and could speak better English. So, both of them acted as bridges between the settlers and the Native Americans, helping the settlers understand the local area and perhaps even teaching them how to survive.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Tecumseh - He was a Native American leader who tried to unite various tribes to resist American expansion in the early 19th century. He's known for his resistance against European-American encroachment.\n\nB. Crazy Horse - He was a war leader of the Oglala Lakota and fought against U.S. forces in the Great Sioux War of 1876. He's famous for his role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\n\nC. Sacagawea - She was a Shoshone woman who accompanied the Lewis and Clark Expedition and served as an interpreter and guide.\n\nD. Geronimo - He was a prominent leader of the Chiricahua Apache who resisted the U.S. government's efforts to relocate his people.\n\nComparing Samoset and Squanto to these figures, I need to see who among them had a similar role or characteristics.\n\nSamoset and Squanto helped the English settlers, acting as intermediaries and providing valuable information about the local area and people. Sacagawea also served as an interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, which was exploring new territories for the United States. So, both pairs\u2014Samoset and Squanto, and Sacagawea\u2014acted as cultural bridges and helpers for the European-Americans.\n\nOn the other hand, Tecumseh, Crazy Horse, and Geronimo are more known for their resistance against European-American expansion and policies. While they played significant roles in their respective tribes' histories, their approaches were different from those of Samoset and Squanto.\n\nTherefore, the most direct comparison would be with Sacagawea, as both she and Samoset and Squanto served as intermediaries between European-Americans and Native Americans, facilitating communication and understanding.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Sacagawea.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
