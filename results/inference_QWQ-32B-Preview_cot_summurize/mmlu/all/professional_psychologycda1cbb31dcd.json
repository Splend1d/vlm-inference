The miracle question is a technique where the therapist asks the client to imagine that one night while they are sleeping, a miracle happens, and all their problems are solved. Then, the therapist asks the client to describe what has changed because of this miracle, helping them to identify their goals and possibilities for change.\n\nI recall that solution-focused therapy is goal-oriented and focuses on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problem. It emphasizes strengths and resources that clients already have. The miracle question seems to align with this approach because it helps clients visualize their desired future and think about the steps needed to achieve it.\n\nLet me look at the other options to make sure. Transtheoretical model is about stages of change and often used in addiction treatment. Interpersonal therapy focuses on interpersonal relationships and social roles. REBT is Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, which is about identifying and challenging irrational beliefs.\n\nNone of these seem directly related to the miracle question, so I think the answer is D, solution-focused therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
