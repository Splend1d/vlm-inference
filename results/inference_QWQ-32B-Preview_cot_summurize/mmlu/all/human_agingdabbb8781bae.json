The lens becomes cloudy and opaque\n\nD. The central part of the retina no longer functions\n\nI think glaucoma has something to do with pressure in the eye, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.\n\nOption A says \"Fluid pressure in the eye is above normal.\" I've heard that high pressure in the eye can damage the optic nerve and lead to glaucoma. So, that sounds plausible.\n\nOption B says \"Inner and outer layers of the retina separate.\" Hmm, that sounds like retinal detachment, which is a different condition. Retinal detachment is when the retina pulls away from the back of the eye, and that's not glaucoma.\n\nOption C says \"The lens becomes cloudy and opaque.\" That sounds like cataracts. Cataracts are when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, which is different from glaucoma.\n\nOption D says \"The central part of the retina no longer functions.\" I think that might be age-related macular degeneration or something similar. The macula is the central part of the retina, and if it's not functioning, that affects central vision, but that's not glaucoma.\n\nSo, based on what I know, glaucoma is related to pressure in the eye. Maybe option A is correct.\n\nWait, but I should double-check. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, often associated with increased pressure in the eye. So, yes, it seems like option A is the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Fluid pressure in the eye is above normal. Yes, that's a key factor in glaucoma.\n\nOption B: Retinal detachment. That's a different condition.\n\nOption C: Cataracts. Again, different from glaucoma.\n\nOption D: Macular degeneration or similar conditions, not glaucoma.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Fluid pressure in the eye is above normal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
