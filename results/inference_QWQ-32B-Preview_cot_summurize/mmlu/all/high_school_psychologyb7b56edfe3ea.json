Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is the autokinetic effect. I think that has something to do with perceiving stationary lights as moving in the dark. Like, if you look at a single light in a dark room, it might seem to move a little. But in this case, Tina is looking at pictures of the space shuttle in different positions, not lights in the dark. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption B is dishabituation. Habituation is when you get used to a stimulus and pay less attention to it over time. Dishabituation is when something changes and you start paying attention again. Maybe if Tina was used to seeing the shuttle in one position and then saw it in another, she might dishabituate and notice the change. But the question is about her having difficulty recognizing it, not about noticing the change. So, I'm not sure if this is the best fit.\n\nOption C is summation. I think summation has to do with combining stimuli. In psychology, particularly in Pavlov's conditioning, summation refers to when multiple stimuli are presented together and their effects add up. But in this scenario, Tina is seeing different pictures of the space shuttle, not multiple stimuli at once. So, maybe not this one.\n\nOption D is shape constancy. That sounds promising. Shape constancy is the ability to recognize that an object's shape remains the same even when viewed from different angles or under different conditions. So, if Tina sees the space shuttle from different perspectives in different pictures, she should still recognize it as the same object. But according to the story, she had difficulty recognizing it when it was flying compared to when it was ready to launch. Maybe shape constancy is being challenged here.\n\nWait a minute, if shape constancy is the ability to recognize an object's shape remains constant despite different views, then difficulty with that would mean she's struggling with shape constancy. So, perhaps the concept that best explains her problem is shape constancy.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Autokinetic effect seems irrelevant here, as it's about perceiving movement in stationary lights. Dishabituation is about noticing changes after habituation, but it doesn't directly relate to recognition difficulties. Summation is about combining stimuli, which doesn't seem applicable to this scenario.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D, shape constancy. Tina is having trouble recognizing the space shuttle in different positions because her shape constancy is being challenged.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
