An informer is testifying that the defendant sold him a stolen stereo, and the defendant knew it was stolen. During direct examination, the informer says he's unemployed but sometimes works part-time as a substitute teacher. Then, on cross-examination, the defendant's attorney asks if the informer has recently applied to become a police officer, and the informer says yes.\n\nNext, the defendant's attorney asks the informer, \"Isn't it true that you hope that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook the fact that you had two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana?\" The prosecutor objects right away. Now, the question is, how should the trial judge rule on this line of questioning regarding the informer's hopes and his misdemeanor convictions?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\n\nB. Improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\n\nC. Proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\n\nD. Proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what's happening here. The defendant's attorney is cross-examining the informer, who is a witness for the prosecution. The attorney is trying to impeach the witness's credibility, perhaps by suggesting that the informer has a motive to lie or that his character for truthfulness is questionable.\n\nThe attorney asks whether the informer hopes that by acting as an undercover agent, the police department will overlook his two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana. So, there are a couple of things here: the informer's hopes or motivations, and his misdemeanor convictions.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"Improper, as evidence of conduct not related to truthfulness.\"\n\nThis suggests that the question is about conduct that doesn't bear on whether the witness is truthful or not. But in this case, the attorney is trying to show that the informer might have a bias or a motive to lie because he's hoping that his cooperation will help him get past his misdemeanor convictions when applying to be a police officer. So, it seems like the attorney is trying to show that the informer has something to gain by testifying favorably for the prosecution.\n\nTherefore, this might not be about the conduct itself but about the informer's motivation or bias. So, maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B says, \"Improper, as relating to convictions of crimes not punishable by imprisonment in excess of one year.\"\n\nThis seems to be referring to the rule about admitting evidence of criminal convictions to impeach a witness's credibility. Generally, in many jurisdictions, evidence of convictions for crimes that are considered misdemeanors, meaning they are punishable by imprisonment of one year or less, cannot be used to impeach a witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nIn this case, the informer has two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana. Since misdemeanors are typically punishable by less than a year in jail, this evidence might not be admissible to attack the witness's character for truthfulness.\n\nHowever, the attorney isn't directly offering evidence of the convictions; instead, he's asking the informer about his hopes that the police department will overlook these convictions. So, it's a bit different.\n\nStill, the underlying issue seems to be related to the convictions and whether they can be used to impeach the witness's credibility.\n\nOption C states, \"Proper, as tending to show the informer's bad character for truthfulness.\"\n\nThis suggests that the question is appropriate because it indicates that the informer has a bad character for truthfulness. But, as per option B, evidence of misdemeanor convictions might not be admissible for that purpose. So, this might not be the correct ruling.\n\nOption D says, \"Proper, as relevant to the informer's possible bias.\"\n\nThis seems plausible because the attorney is trying to show that the informer has a motive to lie or testify favorably for the prosecution in hopes that his misdemeanor convictions will be overlooked in his police officer application.\n\nShowing bias or motive to lie is a legitimate reason to impeach a witness's credibility, and it's not necessarily about the witness's character for truthfulness but about their potential biases in the case.\n\nGiven this, option D seems like the most appropriate choice.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n- The attorney is trying to show that the informer has a motive to lie or testify favorably for the prosecution because he's hoping that his misdemeanor convictions will be overlooked in his police officer application.\n\n- This goes to the informer's possible bias or motivation, not directly to his character for truthfulness.\n\n- Therefore, it's relevant to show bias, making option D the correct ruling.\n\nOptions A and B also touch on aspects of the issue, but option D directly addresses the relevance of the question to the informer's potential bias, which is a key consideration in cross-examination.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
