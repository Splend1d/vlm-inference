                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, you and three friends go to a concert, which means there are four of you in total. The total cost for four tickets is $112, and we need to find the cost of one ticket, which we'll call t.\n\nFirst, I need to set up an equation that relates the total cost to the cost of one ticket. Since there are four tickets, and each costs t dollars, the total cost should be 4 times t. So, the equation should be:\n\n4t = 112\n\nNow, I need to solve for t. To do that, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 4.\n\n4t / 4 = 112 / 4\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nt = 28\n\nSo, the cost of one ticket is $28.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B says \"4t = 112; $28\", which matches what I just found. Option A has the same equation but the wrong solution ($448), which is probably a mistake. Options C and D have the equation t over 4 equals 112, which doesn't make sense in this context because that would imply t is 112 times 4, which is $448, but we've already determined that's not correct.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. If t is the cost of one ticket, and four tickets cost $112, then 4t = 112 is the correct equation. Solving for t, it's indeed $28. So, option B is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what t over 4 equals 112 would mean. That would be t/4 = 112, which means t = 112 * 4 = $448. But that can't be right because if one ticket costs $448, then four tickets would cost $1792, which is way more than $112. So, options C and D don't make sense in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: 4t = 112; $28.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
