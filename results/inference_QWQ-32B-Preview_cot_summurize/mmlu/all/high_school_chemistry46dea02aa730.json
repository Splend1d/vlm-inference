                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"All of the following ions have the same electron configuration except A. Rb+ B. Se2- C. As5+ D. Sr2+.\" I need to figure out which one doesn't match the others in terms of electron configuration. Okay, let's start by understanding what electron configuration means. It's basically how the electrons are arranged in the orbitals around the nucleus of an atom.\n\nFirst, I need to know the atomic numbers of these elements because that tells me how many electrons they have in their neutral state.\n\n- Rubidium (Rb) is element 37.\n\n- Selenium (Se) is element 34.\n\n- Arsenic (As) is element 33.\n\n- Strontium (Sr) is element 38.\n\nNow, let's consider the ions:\n\n- Rb+ means rubidium has lost one electron, so it has 37 - 1 = 36 electrons.\n\n- Se2- means selenium has gained two electrons, so it has 34 + 2 = 36 electrons.\n\n- As5+ means arsenic has lost five electrons, so it has 33 - 5 = 28 electrons.\n\n- Sr2+ means strontium has lost two electrons, so it has 38 - 2 = 36 electrons.\n\nAlready, I can see that Rb+, Se2-, and Sr2+ all have 36 electrons, while As5+ has only 28 electrons. So, As5+ seems like it might be the odd one out.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"all of the following ions have the same electron configuration except...\" So, it's possible that some ions with the same number of electrons have different configurations due to differences in their atomic structures.\n\nLet me double-check the electron configurations.\n\nFirst, for the ions with 36 electrons: Rb+, Se2-, and Sr2+.\n\nElement 36 is krypton (Kr), which has a noble gas configuration: [Ar] 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076.\n\nSo, ions with 36 electrons should have this configuration.\n\nNow, As5+ has 28 electrons. Element 28 is nickel (Ni), which has a configuration of [Ar] 4s\u00b2 3d\u2078.\n\nBut arsenic is in period 4, group 15, so when it forms As5+, it loses five electrons. Let's see:\n\nNeutral arsenic: [Ar] 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u00b3.\n\nWhen it forms As5+, it loses five electrons. It would first lose the 4p electrons, then the 4s electrons.\n\nSo, losing 4p\u00b3 and 4s\u00b2, which totals five electrons, leaves it with [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070, which is 18 + 10 = 28 electrons.\n\nWait, but according to the periodic table, element 28 is nickel, which is [Ar] 4s\u00b2 3d\u2078, but As5+ has [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070.\n\nHmm, so even though both have 28 electrons, their configurations are different because of the difference in electron distribution in the orbitals.\n\nBut the main difference here is that As5+ has 28 electrons, while the others have 36.\n\nSo, the exception is As5+ because it has a different number of electrons.\n\nBut wait, the question might be trickier. It says \"have the same electron configuration except...\" So, perhaps some of the ions with 36 electrons have different configurations.\n\nLet's check the configurations of Rb+, Se2-, and Sr2+.\n\nRb+ is Rb losing one electron: neutral Rb is [Kr] 5s\u00b9, so Rb+ is [Kr], which is the noble gas configuration with 36 electrons.\n\nSe2- is Se gaining two electrons: neutral Se is [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 4s\u00b2 4p\u2074. Gaining two electrons makes it [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 4s\u00b2 4p\u2076, which is the same as krypton, [Kr].\n\nSr2+ is Sr losing two electrons: neutral Sr is [Kr] 5s\u00b2, so Sr2+ is [Kr].\n\nSo, all three ions have the noble gas configuration of krypton, [Kr].\n\nAs5+, however, has [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070, which is different.\n\nTherefore, the ion that does not have the same electron configuration as the others is As5+.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. As5+.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's make sure that all the ions with 36 electrons really do have the same configuration.\n\nRb+ is [Kr], which is [Ar] 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076.\n\nSe2- is [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070 4s\u00b2 4p\u2076, which is also [Kr].\n\nSr2+ is [Kr], same as above.\n\nSo, they all have the same configuration.\n\nAs5+ has [Ar] 3d\u00b9\u2070, which is different.\n\nTherefore, the exception is As5+.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
