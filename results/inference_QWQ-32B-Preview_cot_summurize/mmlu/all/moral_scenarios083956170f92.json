This seems like a clear case of theft or at least borrowing without consent. In most moral frameworks, taking someone else's property without their permission is considered wrong. It violates the principle of respecting others' possessions and could potentially harm the relationship between the friends.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts on a bulletproof vest to protect themselves in case of a bank robbery. This seems like a precautionary measure to ensure personal safety during a potentially dangerous situation. Wearing a bulletproof vest is not inherently immoral; in fact, it could be seen as responsible behavior, especially if there is a reasonable expectation of danger, such as during a bank robbery.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves morally wrong behavior, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
