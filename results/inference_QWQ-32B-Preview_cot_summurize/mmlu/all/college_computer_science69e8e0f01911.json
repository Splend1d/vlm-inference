One workstation accesses files from a file server, and the other accesses files from a local disk. I need to find the ratio of the total time required to compile a program on the diskless workstation to the time required on the workstation with the local disk. The compilation requires 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. Also, it's assumed that computation isn't overlapped with file access.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the differences between the two workstations:\n\n1. **Diskless workstation:**\n\n- Accesses file pages from a file server.\n\n- Average access time per page: 0.1 second.\n\n2. **Workstation with local disk:**\n\n- Accesses file pages from a local disk.\n\n- Average access time per page: 0.05 second.\n\nThe compilation process involves:\n\n- 30 seconds of computation.\n\n- 200 file page accesses.\n\nAnd computation isn't overlapped with file access, meaning that the processor has to wait for file accesses to complete before proceeding with computation, or vice versa. I need to figure out how to calculate the total time for each workstation based on these parameters.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the compilation process is sequential: first, all file pages are accessed, and then the computation is done. Or perhaps it's interleaved in some way. But the problem says that computation isn't overlapped with file access, which might mean that file accesses and computation are done one after the other, not in parallel.\n\nLet me consider two possible scenarios:\n\n**Scenario 1: All file accesses are done first, then computation.**\n\nIn this case, the total time would be the time for file accesses plus the time for computation.\n\nFor the diskless workstation:\n\n- File access time: 200 pages * 0.1 second/page = 20 seconds.\n\n- Computation time: 30 seconds.\n\n- Total time: 20 + 30 = 50 seconds.\n\nFor the workstation with local disk:\n\n- File access time: 200 pages * 0.05 second/page = 10 seconds.\n\n- Computation time: 30 seconds.\n\n- Total time: 10 + 30 = 40 seconds.\n\nThe ratio would be 50 / 40 = 1.25, which is 5/4.\n\n**Scenario 2: Computation and file accesses are interleaved, but not overlapped.**\n\nThis might mean that the processor alternates between computing and accessing file pages, but doesn't do both at the same time.\n\nHowever, without specific information on how the interleaving is done, it's hard to precise. Maybe it's safer to assume that all file accesses are done first, followed by computation, as in Scenario 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compilation process accesses file pages as needed during computation, but since computation isn't overlapped with file access, the processor has to wait for each file page access before proceeding with the next computation step.\n\nIn that case, the total time would be the computation time plus the time for 200 file page accesses, regardless of the order.\n\nWait, but if file pages are accessed during computation, and computation waits for each file page access, then the total time would still be computation time plus the time for file page accesses.\n\nSo, for the diskless workstation:\n\nTotal time = 30 seconds + (200 * 0.1 seconds) = 30 + 20 = 50 seconds.\n\nFor the workstation with local disk:\n\nTotal time = 30 seconds + (200 * 0.05 seconds) = 30 + 10 = 40 seconds.\n\nThus, the ratio is 50 / 40 = 1.25, which is 5/4.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1/1\n\nB. 5/4\n\nC. 5/3\n\nD. 10/5\n\nOption B seems to match.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different way to interpret the problem. Perhaps there are multiple file page accesses during computation, and the processor has to wait for each one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all file page accesses are done upfront, and then computation proceeds.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, the most straightforward approach is to add the total file access time to the computation time for each workstation and then compute the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compilation process is more complex, with file page accesses interleaved with computation in a specific pattern. But without specific information on that pattern, it's reasonable to assume that all file page accesses are done before computation begins, or that the total time is the sum of computation time and file access time.\n\nAnother angle to consider: perhaps the computation can only proceed in chunks between file page accesses, but again, without more details, it's hard to model this accurately.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information on how file page accesses and computation are interleaved, the initial approach seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 50 / 40 = 5/4.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 5/4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
