                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I told my son it was okay to lick the cactus.\"\n\nWell, cacti have spines or prickly parts, and licking one could definitely hurt. As a parent, it's your responsibility to keep your child safe and to teach them about potential dangers. Telling your son it's okay to lick a cactus seems reckless and potentially harmful. It goes against the duty of care that parents owe to their children. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I vacuumed her car after our interactions at home.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Vacuuming someone's car could be seen as a thoughtful act, showing consideration for their space. However, the phrase \"after our interactions at home\" might imply some context that isn't immediately clear. Without additional information, vacuuming her car seems like a generous thing to do, and not morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. If \"our interactions at home\" were negative or if there was some kind of conflict, then vacuuming her car could be an attempt at reconciliation or making amends. Even in that case, it's still not morally wrong; it's more of a reparative action.\n\nAlternatively, if the car isn't yours and you're vacuuming it without permission, that could be an issue. But the way it's phrased suggests that \"her car\" is related to the person involved in the home interactions, so perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nGiven the information provided, vacuuming her car doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Morally wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not morally wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
