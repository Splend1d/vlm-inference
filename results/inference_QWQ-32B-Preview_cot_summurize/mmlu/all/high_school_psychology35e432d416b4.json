It primarily affects adolescents and young adults, particularly females, although it can occur in males and at other ages as well. The condition can lead to severe health complications, including malnutrition, organ failure, and even death.\n\nWhen considering which individual is most likely to develop anorexia nervosa, it's important to look at several risk factors, including age, gender, personality traits, and environmental influences.\n\nOption A: Maria is a 16-year-old Caucasian female, an A student, and a talented musician who feels that her life is out of control. This description suggests that Maria is academically successful and musically gifted, but she may be experiencing stress or anxiety related to maintaining high standards in multiple areas of her life. The feeling that her life is out of control could be a significant factor, as anorexia nervosa often develops as a way for individuals to exert control over their bodies in the face of other areas of their lives that feel chaotic or uncontrollable.\n\nOption B: Leticia is a 15-year-old African American female, an A student, an exceptional athlete, and an avid reader. While Leticia has a lot on her plate with her academic, athletic, and personal interests, there is no indication in the description that she is experiencing stress or dissatisfaction with her body or weight. Exceptional athletes often have a healthy relationship with their bodies, as their performance depends on it. Therefore, unless there are additional stressors not mentioned, Leticia may not be as likely to develop anorexia nervosa as someone like Maria.\n\nOption C: Rosa is a 26-year-old Hispanic female who has just received her law degree, is struggling with debt from school, and is having difficulty finding employment. While Rosa is facing significant stress related to her career and financial situation, anorexia nervosa is more commonly diagnosed in adolescents and young adults. Additionally, her focus seems to be on her professional life rather than her body image. However, it's possible for eating disorders to develop at any age, but given the typical age of onset, Maria may be at higher risk.\n\nOption D: Virginia is a 14-year-old Caucasian female, a C student, sexually promiscuous, and experimenting with drugs. While Virginia is engaging in risky behaviors and may be experiencing emotional distress, there is no mention of concerns about her weight or body image. Anorexia nervosa is specifically related to an obsessive fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image, which are not indicated in Virginia's description. Therefore, she may not be as likely to develop anorexia nervosa compared to Maria.\n\nBased on the information provided, Maria seems to be the most likely to develop anorexia nervosa. She is in the typical age range, is female, and is experiencing feelings of being out of control, which could lead her to seek control through restrictive eating habits. Her high achiever status in academics and music could also contribute to perfectionistic tendencies, which are often associated with eating disorders.\n\nIt's important to note that eating disorders are complex and can affect anyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, or background. However, in this scenario, Maria's profile aligns most closely with the typical risk factors for anorexia nervosa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
