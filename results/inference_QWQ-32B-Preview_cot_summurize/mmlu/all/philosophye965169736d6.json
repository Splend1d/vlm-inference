                    "text": "I need to answer a question about Anscombe's criticism of Sidgwick. The question is:\n\n\"Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick on the grounds that:\n\nA. he does not distinguish between the foreseen and intended consequences of one\u2019s action.\n\nB. he endorses the divine law conception of ethics.\n\nC. he claims that there is a \u201cnatural balance\u201d to the universe.\n\nD. all of the above.\"\n\nI need to recall what Anscombe said about Sidgwick. I remember that Anscombe wrote a paper called \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" where she critiqued some aspects of moral philosophy, including utilitarianism and Kantian ethics.\n\nSidgwick was a utilitarian philosopher, so I think Anscombe would have had something to say about his views. Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A says that Sidgwick doesn't distinguish between foreseen and intended consequences. I think this is related to the concept of double effect, where an action can have both intended and foreseen but not intended consequences. Maybe Anscombe thought Sidgwick didn't make this distinction properly.\n\nOption B says that Sidgwick endorses the divine law conception of ethics. I don't recall Sidgwick being associated with divine law ethics. Sidgwick was more known for his utilitarianism and also considered Kantian ethics in his book \"The Methods of Ethics.\" So, I doubt this is correct.\n\nOption C mentions that Sidgwick claims there is a \"natural balance\" to the universe. I'm not sure what this refers to. Maybe it's about the idea that the universe naturally tends towards the greatest happiness or something like that. But I'm not certain.\n\nOption D says all of the above, but since I doubt option B is correct, I don't think D is the right answer.\n\nLet me think again. In \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe criticizes the separation of moral philosophy from theology and argues that the concept of \"ought\" makes sense only in relation to a law given by a lawgiver. She also criticizes the idea of consequentialism, which is related to utilitarianism.\n\nSidgwick was a utilitarian, so perhaps Anscombe would criticize him for not distinguishing properly between intended and foreseen consequences, which is a key issue in consequentialist ethics.\n\nI think option A is the most plausible. Maybe option C is also related, but I'm not sure what \"natural balance\" means in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps \"natural balance\" refers to the idea that the universe naturally tends towards equilibrium or maximum happiness, which is a utilitarian concept. But I'm not positive.\n\nGiven that, maybe both A and C are relevant, but B seems off because Sidgwick wasn't known for endorsing divine law ethics.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is D, all of the above, but since B seems incorrect, that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to see if students know that Anscombe criticized Sidgwick specifically for not distinguishing between foreseen and intended consequences.\n\nI need to check my notes or the text to be sure.\n\nLooking back at \"Modern Moral Philosophy,\" Anscombe does critique consequentialism for ignoring the distinction between acts themselves and their consequences, but I don't recall her specifically criticizing Sidgwick on this point.\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to Anscombe's influence on contemporary discussions of intentional action and double effect, which she wrote about in other works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is misremembered, and it's about Anscombe's criticism of Sidgwick in a specific context.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is A, as it relates to a key aspect of consequentialist ethics that Anscombe might have criticized.\n\nI'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
