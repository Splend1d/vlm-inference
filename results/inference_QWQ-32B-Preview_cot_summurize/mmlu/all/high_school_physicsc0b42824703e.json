                    "text": "So I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. There's a body moving in the positive x-direction, and it passes the origin at time t = 0. So, at t = 0, its position x is 0.\n\nFrom t = 0 to t = 1 second, it's moving with a constant speed of 24 meters per second. So, during this first second, it's just going straight ahead at 24 m/s without any acceleration.\n\nThen, at t = 1 second, it's given a constant acceleration of 6 meters per second squared in the negative x-direction. That means it starts slowing down and eventually might change direction.\n\nI need to find its position at t = 11 seconds.\n\nAlright, let's break this down into parts.\n\nFirst, what happens from t = 0 to t = 1 second?\n\nIt's moving with constant speed, so the position as a function of time during this interval is:\n\nx = x0 + v*t\n\nWhere x0 is the initial position (0), v is the velocity (24 m/s), and t is time.\n\nSo, at t = 1 second:\n\nx(1) = 0 + 24*1 = 24 meters.\n\nSo, at t = 1 second, it's at x = 24 meters.\n\nNow, at t = 1 second, it starts accelerating in the negative x-direction at 6 m/s\u00b2.\n\nSo, from t = 1 second to t = 11 seconds, it's accelerating at -6 m/s\u00b2.\n\nI need to find its position at t = 11 seconds.\n\nFirst, let's find out how its velocity changes during this acceleration phase.\n\nWe know that:\n\nv = v0 + a*(t - t0)\n\nWhere v0 is the initial velocity at t = 1 second, which is 24 m/s, a is the acceleration (-6 m/s\u00b2), and t - t0 is the time elapsed since t = 1 second.\n\nSo, v(t) = 24 + (-6)*(t - 1)\n\nSimplify that:\n\nv(t) = 24 - 6*(t - 1)\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nv(t) = 24 - 6t + 6 = 30 - 6t\n\nSo, v(t) = 30 - 6t m/s, for t \u2265 1 second.\n\nNow, to find the position as a function of time, I can integrate the velocity with respect to time.\n\nThe position function x(t) is the integral of v(t):\n\nx(t) = \u222b v(t) dt = \u222b (30 - 6t) dt = 30t - 3t\u00b2 + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nTo find C, I use the initial condition at t = 1 second, where x = 24 meters.\n\nSo:\n\n24 = 30*1 - 3*(1)\u00b2 + C\n\n24 = 30 - 3 + C\n\n24 = 27 + C\n\nTherefore, C = 24 - 27 = -3 meters.\n\nSo, the position function is:\n\nx(t) = 30t - 3t\u00b2 - 3 meters, for t \u2265 1 second.\n\nNow, I need to find x at t = 11 seconds.\n\nPlugging t = 11 into the equation:\n\nx(11) = 30*11 - 3*(11)\u00b2 - 3\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n30*11 = 330\n\n11\u00b2 = 121\n\n3*121 = 363\n\nSo, x(11) = 330 - 363 - 3 = -36 meters.\n\nWait, that's option C.\n\nBut let me double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nFirst part: from t=0 to t=1, x=24 meters. That seems right.\n\nThen, velocity function v(t)=30-6t for t\u22651.\n\nPosition function x(t)=30t - 3t\u00b2 + C, and C=-3.\n\nSo, x(t)=30t - 3t\u00b2 - 3.\n\nAt t=11, x=330 - 363 - 3 = -36 meters.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the motion in two parts: before and after t=1 second.\n\nFrom t=0 to t=1: x=24 m.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=11: t=10 seconds with initial velocity 24 m/s, acceleration -6 m/s\u00b2.\n\nUsing the equation:\n\nx = x0 + v0*t + (1/2)a*t\u00b2\n\nWhere x0=24 m, v0=24 m/s, a=-6 m/s\u00b2, t=10 s.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx = 24 + 24*10 + (1/2)*(-6)*10\u00b2\n\nCalculate:\n\n24 + 240 + (-3)*100 = 24 + 240 - 300 = -36 meters.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check when the body changes direction.\n\nThe velocity is v(t)=30-6t.\n\nSet v(t)=0 to find when it stops.\n\n30-6t=0 => t=5 seconds.\n\nSo, at t=5 seconds, it stops.\n\nBefore t=5, it's moving positive, after t=5, it's moving negative.\n\nFrom t=1 to t=5: it's moving positive.\n\nFrom t=5 to t=11: moving negative.\n\nLet's calculate the position at t=5 seconds.\n\nx(5)=30*5 - 3*25 - 3=150 - 75 - 3=72 meters.\n\nSo, at t=5, it's at x=72 meters.\n\nFrom t=5 to t=11, it moves back towards negative x.\n\nTime from t=5 to t=11 is 6 seconds.\n\nVelocity at t=5 is 0.\n\nVelocity at t=11 is v(11)=30-6*11=30-66=-36 m/s.\n\nAverage velocity from t=5 to t=11 is (0 + (-36))/2 = -18 m/s.\n\nDistance covered in 6 seconds at avg vel -18 m/s is -108 meters.\n\nSo, from x=72 at t=5, it moves back -108 meters by t=11.\n\n72 - 108 = -36 meters.\n\nAgain, same answer.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. -36m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
