Call us to reserve your table. \"The response to the promotion was more than the restaurant expected, and the restaurant was soon overbooked for the Mother's Day brunch. On the day before Mother's Day, the restaurant owner decided to double-check inventory to make sure the restaurant had enough food and supplies to handle the large Mother's Day crowd. To her horror, she discovered that the restaurant was almost out of eggs. Knowing that a large supply of eggs would be needed for the omelet station, the owner immediately sent the following e-mail to her egg supplier:\"Desperately need 20 flats of Grade AA eggs for tomorrow's brunch. Money is no object. The eggs must be delivered today. \"The supplier e-mailed back:\"No problem! I'll load them on the truck and deliver them within the hour. \"With respect to the agreement between the owner and the supplier, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the omittance of a fixed contract price?\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\nB. The contract is unenforceable, because of indefiniteness.\nC.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this restaurant that's doing a Mother's Day special, and they're expecting a big crowd. The owner realizes they're running low on eggs, which are crucial for the omelet station. She rushes to order 20 flats of Grade AA eggs from her supplier, saying that money is no object and that the eggs need to be delivered immediately.\n\nNow, the question is about the agreement between the owner and the supplier regarding the omission of a fixed contract price. So, they didn't specify how much the eggs are going to cost.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The contract is unenforceable as violative of the statute of frauds.\n\nB. The contract is unenforceable because of indefiniteness.\n\nC. The contract may be enforceable if it is later modified to include the price term.\n\nD. The contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at time of delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statute of frauds is. I think it's a law that requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, especially for contracts that can't be performed within one year or involve the transfer of interest in land.\n\nIn this case, it's a contract for the sale of eggs, which is probably something that can be performed pretty quickly. So, maybe the statute of frauds doesn't apply here. Therefore, option A might not be correct.\n\nOption B says the contract is unenforceable because of indefiniteness. Indefiniteness refers to a lack of clarity in the terms of the contract, making it unclear what the parties are agreeing to.\n\nIn this scenario, they specified the quantity (20 flats of Grade AA eggs) and the delivery time (within the hour). The only missing element is the price. So, is the lack of a price term enough to make the contract indefinite and therefore unenforceable?\n\nI'm not sure. Maybe there's a way to determine the price even if it wasn't specified in the agreement.\n\nOption C suggests that the contract may be enforceable if it's later modified to include the price term. That makes sense. If the parties can agree on a price later, then the contract could be enforced with that modification.\n\nOption D says the contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at the time of delivery. This seems similar to option C, but it implies that the court could impose a reasonable price if the parties don't agree on one.\n\nI need to think about what the law says about contracts with missing terms, like the price.\n\nI recall that for a contract to be enforceable, it needs to have certain elements, including mutual assent, consideration, and definite terms. If a term is missing, it might still be possible to enforce the contract if the missing term can be implied or determined based on certain standards.\n\nIn this case, the price of eggs is not specified, but eggs are a commodity, and their market price is probably known. So, it might be possible to determine a reasonable price even if it wasn't specified in the agreement.\n\nAlso, the owner said \"money is no object,\" which might indicate that she's willing to pay whatever the going rate is or even more, but it doesn't specify a exact price.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B says the contract is unenforceable because of indefiniteness. But if the price can be implied or determined based on market rates, maybe it's not indefinite.\n\nOption C suggests that the contract can be enforced if later modified to include the price term. That seems plausible, but it's not clear if that's necessary.\n\nOption D says the contract is enforceable with a reasonable price being fixed at the time of delivery. This seems like a reasonable approach, as the court could imply a price based on what would be considered reasonable at the time of delivery.\n\nOption A, about the statute of frauds, seems less relevant here because this is likely not the type of contract that requires a written agreement.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option D is the most accurate. The contract is enforceable, and a reasonable price can be fixed at the time of delivery based on market standards.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's think about why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A: Statute of frauds typically applies to specific types of contracts, like those that can't be performed within a year or involve the sale of land. This seems outside of that, so probably not applicable.\n\nOption B: Indefiniteness might be an issue if the terms are too vague, but here, the quantity and delivery time are specified, and the price can be determined based on market rates, so perhaps not indefinite.\n\nOption C: While it's true that contracts can be modified later, it might not be necessary if the price can be implied.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n$\\boxed{\\text{D}}$"
