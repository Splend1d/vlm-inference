                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about discrete probability distributions, and I need to pick the statement that's always true. The options are:\n\nA. The expected value of X = np.\n\nB. The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one.\n\nC. The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n\nD. The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric.\n\nOkay, first I need to recall what a discrete probability distribution is. It's a function that gives the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a discrete random variable, right? So, for a random variable X, which can take on specific, separate values, the distribution tells us the probability of each of those values occurring.\n\nLet's look at option A: The expected value of X = np. I know that in some distributions, like the binomial distribution, the expected value is indeed np, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success in each trial. But is this true for any discrete probability distribution? I don't think so. For example, in a Poisson distribution, the expected value is just \u03bb, and in a geometric distribution, it's 1/p. So, this seems too specific to binomial distributions, not general enough.\n\nOption B: The sum of all possible values of X is equal to one. Hmm. This sounds familiar, but I think it's misstated. In a probability distribution, it's the probabilities that must sum to one, not the values of X themselves. For example, if X can be 0 or 1, with probabilities 0.2 and 0.8, respectively, then the sum of the probabilities is 0.2 + 0.8 = 1, but the sum of the values of X is 0 + 1 = 1, which coincidentally is one, but that's not a general rule. If X could be 0, 1, or 2, with probabilities that add up to one, the sum of X values would be 0 + 1 + 2 = 3, which is not one. So, this can't be right.\n\nOption C: The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one. Yeah, that sounds right. One of the fundamental rules of probability distributions is that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal one. This ensures that all possible outcomes are accounted for, and nothing is left out. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n\nOption D: The probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric. I know that the normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric, but we're talking about discrete probability distributions here, and the normal distribution is continuous. Discrete distributions can take many forms; for example, the binomial distribution can be symmetric if p=0.5 but skewed otherwise, and the Poisson distribution is often skewed. So, it's not accurate to say that any discrete probability distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric.\n\nGiven these thoughts, it seems that option C is the correct statement about any discrete probability distribution of a random variable X. The probabilities of all possible values of X must add up to one.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
