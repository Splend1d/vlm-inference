                    "text": "I've got this law school exam question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer regarding the admissibility of the plaintiff's statement to his doctor about feeling pain after the accident. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario: There's a car accident where the defendant's car, driven negligently by his cousin, hits a telephone booth that the plaintiff was in, causing personal injuries to the plaintiff. The plaintiff is suing the defendant, and liability is based on a statute that makes the owner of an automobile liable for the negligent actions of those driving with the owner's consent.\n\nNow, the key part is the evidence being offered: The plaintiff's testimony to his doctor about feeling pain in his back immediately after the accident, and that the pain persisted. The plaintiff wants to introduce this testimony into evidence.\n\nThe question is asking how the trial court should rule on this testimony. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible as a spontaneous declaration.\n\nB. Admissible under the hearsay exception for declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nC. Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nD. Inadmissible as conclusions.\n\nAlright, so I need to think about hearsay and its exceptions here. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under a recognized exception. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff is offering his own statement to his doctor about feeling pain to prove that he indeed felt pain after the accident, which relates to the extent of his injuries.\n\nSo, is this hearsay? Well, the statement was made out of court (to the doctor), and it's being offered to prove that he felt pain, which is the matter asserted in the statement. So, yes, it seems like hearsay.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: Admissible as a spontaneous declaration.\n\nI think this might be referring to excited utterance, which is a hearsay exception for statements made spontaneously and under the stress of excitement caused by an event. In this case, the plaintiff is talking to his doctor about the pain immediately after the accident. It might qualify as an excited utterance because it's made shortly after the accident while the plaintiff is still under the stress of the event.\n\nOption B: Admissible under the hearsay exception for declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nThis is another hearsay exception. Declarations of present bodily condition allow statements about how a person is feeling at the time to be admitted into evidence. So, if the plaintiff is telling his doctor about his current symptoms, like pain in his back, that could fall under this exception.\n\nOption C: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.\n\nThis would be the default if none of the exceptions apply.\n\nOption D: Inadmissible as conclusions.\n\nThis might be referring to the rule that opinions or conclusions by lay witnesses are generally inadmissible, but in this case, the plaintiff is stating facts about his sensations, not offering an opinion or conclusion.\n\nNow, between options A and B, which one is more appropriate?\n\nOption A: Spontaneous declaration (excited utterance).\n\nOption B: Declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nBoth could potentially apply, but declaration of present bodily condition is more specific to statements about one's physical condition. Excited utterance is more about statements made spontaneously under the stress of excitement caused by an event.\n\nIn this case, since the statement is directly about the plaintiff's physical condition immediately after the accident, it seems that the declaration of present bodily condition is the more precise exception.\n\nAdditionally, in many jurisdictions, declarations of present sensory condition are admissible to prove the existence of the condition. So, the plaintiff's statement to his doctor about feeling pain in his back immediately after the accident could be admissible under this exception.\n\nOption A, spontaneous declaration, might be a bit too general, and excited utterance is a specific type of spontaneous declaration. But in some legal contexts, they might be used interchangeably.\n\nHowever, given that there is a specific hearsay exception for declarations of present bodily condition, it seems more accurate to go with option B.\n\nOption C says inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. But since there are exceptions that might apply, this doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption D says inadmissible as conclusions. But the plaintiff is stating facts about his sensations, not drawing conclusions. So, this doesn't seem applicable.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is option B: admissible under the hearsay exception of declaration of present bodily condition.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the purpose of this exception. The declaration of present bodily condition exception allows for statements about how a person is feeling at the time to be admitted into evidence because such statements are considered reliable indicators of the person's condition at that moment.\n\nIn medical contexts, patients' descriptions of their symptoms are crucial for diagnosis and treatment, and they are generally considered reliable.\n\nTherefore, allowing such statements into evidence helps to establish the plaintiff's condition at the time of the accident, which is relevant to proving the extent of his injuries.\n\nIn conclusion, the trial court should rule this testimony as admissible under the hearsay exception for declaration of present bodily condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
