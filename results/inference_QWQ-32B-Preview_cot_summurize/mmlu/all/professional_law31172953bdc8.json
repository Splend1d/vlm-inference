                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have an athlete who needs a ride and some expenses covered to go to a baseball tryout. He makes a deal with his friend: \"If you drive me to and from the tryout, pay for our housing and meals, I'll give you 10% of my first-year earnings if I make it.\" The friend agrees and takes him there. After the tryout, the athlete gets a contract for $100,000 a year. When the friend asks for his 10%, the athlete says that's too much and offers only $1,000. The friend sues to enforce the assignment.\n\nNow, the question is, if the court holds the assignment unenforceable, what's the most applicable legal principle? We have four options:\n\nA. A purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.\n\nB. A contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\n\nC. The friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.\n\nD. A gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.\n\nLet's break these down one by one.\n\nOption A says that assigning a right that hasn't arisen yet and isn't under an existing contract only works as a promise to assign it when it does arise and gives the power to enforce it. In this case, the assignment was made before the contract with the baseball team existed. So, it might fit, but let's see the other options.\n\nOption B states that a contract to make a future assignment isn't a valid assignment. This seems similar to A but more straightforward. It suggests that promising to assign something in the future isn't the same as actually assigning it now.\n\nOption C brings in the concept of detrimental reliance. It suggests that for the assignment to be enforceable, the friend needed to rely on it to his detriment before the athlete tried to revoke it. If the friend didn't rely on the assignment in some way, maybe the assignment isn't enforceable.\n\nOption D talks about gratuitous assignments being revocable. A gratuitous assignment is one where there's no consideration, meaning nothing is exchanged except the assignment itself. If the assignment is gratuitous, the assignor can revoke it.\n\nIn this scenario, the friend provided something of value: transportation and paying for housing and meals. So, it's not a gratuitous assignment because there was consideration involved. Therefore, option D might not apply here.\n\nLet's consider options A, B, and C more closely.\n\nFirst, the assignment was made before the contract with the baseball team existed. So, the right to the earnings didn't exist at the time of the assignment. This aligns with option A, where assigning a right that hasn't arisen yet operates only as a promise to assign it when it does arise.\n\nOption B says that a contract to make a future assignment isn't validly enforceable. This seems similar to A but more direct. It questions the enforceability of the promise to assign in the future.\n\nOption C introduces the idea of detrimental reliance. For the assignment to be enforceable, the friend would need to have relied on the assignment to his detriment before the athlete tried to revoke it. In this case, the friend did act on the assignment by driving the athlete and paying for expenses. So, he did rely on the assignment by taking action based on the promise.\n\nGiven that, option C seems relevant. If the friend relied on the assignment to his detriment, that might make the assignment enforceable. Conversely, if he didn't rely on it, the assignment could be revoked.\n\nBut in this scenario, the friend did rely on the assignment by providing the transportation and paying for housing and meals. So, if the court considers this detrimental reliance, the assignment should be enforceable.\n\nHowever, the question states that if the court holds the assignment unenforceable, which principle would apply. So, perhaps the court finds that the friend didn't rely on the assignment to his detriment before the revocation.\n\nWait, but the friend already provided the transportation and paid for the expenses. So, he did rely on it before any revocation occurred. The athlete then tried to renege on the assignment after the fact.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the court considers that the friend's reliance wasn't detrimental enough or that the assignment wasn't formal enough to be enforceable.\n\nOption A seems to touch on the issue of assigning a right that doesn't yet exist. Since the contract with the baseball team didn't exist at the time of the assignment, the right to earnings wasn't yet in place. Therefore, the assignment might be considered void or only a promise to assign in the future.\n\nOption B directly states that a contract to make a future assignment isn't validly enforceable. This could be the reason the court holds the assignment unenforceable.\n\nOption C might not apply here because the friend did rely on the assignment by providing the transportation and paying for expenses. So, if the court holds the assignment unenforceable despite this reliance, perhaps another principle is at play.\n\nOption D doesn't apply because the assignment wasn't gratuitous; there was consideration involved.\n\nBetween options A and B, they seem quite similar. Assigning a right that doesn't yet exist might fall under both categories.\n\nOption A specifies that it operates as a promise to assign when the right arises and gives the power to enforce it. So, perhaps the assignment is enforceable once the right arises, but not before.\n\nHowever, in this case, the right has arisen\u2014the athlete has signed the contract with the baseball team. So, perhaps the assignment should be enforceable at this point.\n\nBut the athlete is trying to revoke the assignment, and the friend is suing to enforce it.\n\nIf the court holds it unenforceable, it might be because the original assignment was not validly made due to the non-existence of the right at the time of assignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the court finds that the assignment is enforceable, and the athlete can't revoke it after the right has arisen.\n\nBut the question assumes that the court holds the assignment unenforceable, so we need to choose the principle that justifies that decision.\n\nOption A could be the reason: the assignment was only a promise to assign when the right arises, and perhaps the friend doesn't have the power to enforce it.\n\nOption B says that a contract to make a future assignment isn't validly enforceable. This could also justify the unenforceability.\n\nOption C might not apply because the friend did rely on the assignment to his detriment.\n\nOption D doesn't apply since it's not a gratuitous assignment.\n\nBetween A and B, I think option B is more directly applicable. It clearly states that a contract to make a future assignment isn't a valid assignment. Therefore, the promise to assign 10% of future earnings is not enforceable as an assignment; it's just a promise to assign in the future.\n\nOption A is more about how such a purported assignment operates, but option B directly questions its enforceability.\n\nTherefore, the most applicable legal principle would be option B: a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
