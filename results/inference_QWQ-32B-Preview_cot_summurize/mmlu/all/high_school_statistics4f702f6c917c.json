                    "text": "So I've got this problem about roulette in a casino. There's a wheel with 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green. The question is, if I'm betting on red every time, what's the probability that the first time I win is on the 8th trial. In other words, I lose the first 7 times and win on the 8th.\n\nOkay, first things first. I need to understand what's going on here. Each spin of the wheel is an independent event, right? That means the outcome of one spin doesn't affect the next one. So, the probability of winning on any single spin should be the same every time.\n\nNow, betting on red means I win if the ball drops into one of the 18 red slots out of the total 38 slots. So, the probability of winning on any single spin is 18/38, which simplifies to 9/19. Similarly, the probability of losing on any single spin is 20/38, which simplifies to 10/19.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the first win happening on the 8th trial. That means I have to lose the first 7 trials and then win on the 8th one.\n\nSo, since each spin is independent, the probability of a sequence of outcomes is the product of the probabilities of each individual outcome.\n\nTherefore, the probability of losing 7 times in a row and then winning on the 8th trial would be:\n\n(P(loss))^7 * P(win)\n\nWhere P(loss) is 10/19 and P(win) is 9/19.\n\nSo, that would be (10/19)^7 * (9/19)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate (10/19)^7.\n\n10 divided by 19 is approximately 0.5263.\n\nRaising that to the 7th power:\n\n0.5263^7 \u2248 0.00432\n\nThen, multiply that by 9/19.\n\n9 divided by 19 is approximately 0.4737.\n\nSo, 0.00432 * 0.4737 \u2248 0.00205\n\nWait, that's not matching any of the options. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nThe probability of the first success (winning on red) on the nth trial in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials is given by the geometric distribution.\n\nThe probability mass function for the geometric distribution is:\n\nP(X = n) = (1 - p)^(n-1) * p\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the trial number of the first success.\n\n- n is the trial number.\n\n- p is the probability of success on any given trial.\n\nIn this case, n = 8, and p = 18/38 = 9/19.\n\nSo, P(X = 8) = (1 - 9/19)^7 * (9/19)\n\nWhich is the same as (10/19)^7 * (9/19)\n\nLet me calculate (10/19)^7.\n\n10^7 = 10,000,000\n\n19^7 = ?\n\nWait, calculating 19 to the power of 7 might be tedious. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, find (10/19)^7.\n\nThen multiply by 9/19.\n\nBut maybe I can leave it in fractions to avoid rounding errors.\n\nSo, (10/19)^7 = 10^7 / 19^7\n\nAnd 9/19 is 9/19.\n\nSo, P(X=8) = (10^7 / 19^7) * (9/19) = (10^7 * 9) / (19^8)\n\nNow, let's calculate 10^7 * 9 = 90,000,000\n\nAnd 19^8:\n\nFirst, find 19^2 = 361\n\nThen, 19^4 = (19^2)^2 = 361^2 = 130,321\n\nThen, 19^8 = (19^4)^2 = 130,321^2\n\nCalculating 130,321 squared:\n\n130,000 squared is 16,900,000,000\n\nPlus 321 squared is 103,041\n\nPlus 2*130,000*321 = 2*130,000*300 = 78,000,000 + 2*130,000*21 = 2*130,000*20 = 5,200,000 + 2*130,000*1 = 260,000\n\nSo total is 16,900,000,000 + 78,000,000 = 17,000,000,000\n\nPlus 5,200,000 = 17,005,200,000\n\nPlus 260,000 = 17,005,460,000\n\nPlus 103,041 = 17,005,563,041\n\nSo, 19^8 = 17,005,563,041\n\nTherefore, P(X=8) = 90,000,000 / 17,005,563,041\n\nDividing, that's approximately 0.00529\n\nWait, that seems close to option C, which is 0.0053\n\nBut earlier I got 0.00205, which was wrong. So, now it's 0.00529, which rounds to 0.0053.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.0053\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 19^8.\n\nLet me verify 19^4.\n\n19^2 = 361\n\n19^4 = 361^2\n\n360^2 = 129,600\n\nPlus 361*2*1 = 722\n\nSo, 129,600 + 722 = 130,322\n\nWait, earlier I had 130,321. Maybe a slight miscalculation.\n\nThen, 19^8 = 130,322^2\n\nCalculating 130,000 squared is 16,900,000,000\n\n322 squared is 103,684\n\n2*130,000*322 = 2*130,000*300 = 78,000,000 + 2*130,000*22 = 2*130,000*20 = 5,200,000 + 2*130,000*2 = 5,200,000 + 520,000 = 5,720,000\n\nSo, total is 16,900,000,000 + 78,000,000 = 17,000,000,000\n\nPlus 5,720,000 = 17,005,720,000\n\nPlus 103,684 = 17,005,823,684\n\nSo, 19^8 = 17,005,823,684\n\nTherefore, P(X=8) = 90,000,000 / 17,005,823,684 \u2248 0.00529\n\nYes, that's approximately 0.0053\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 0.0053\n\nBut wait, the options are:\n\nA. 0.0278\n\nB. 0.0112\n\nC. 0.0053\n\nD. 0.0101\n\nSo, C is indeed 0.0053\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the European roulette wheel, which has only one green zero, making it 37 slots: 18 red, 18 black, and 1 green.\n\nIn that case, P(win) = 18/37\n\nP(loss) = 19/37\n\nThen, P(X=8) = (19/37)^7 * (18/37)\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 19/37 \u2248 0.5135\n\n(0.5135)^7 \u2248 0.00442\n\nThen, 18/37 \u2248 0.4865\n\nSo, 0.00442 * 0.4865 \u2248 0.00215\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate it in fractions.\n\n(19^7 * 18) / 37^8\n\nCalculate 19^7 and 37^8.\n\n19^2 = 361\n\n19^4 = 361^2 = 130,321\n\n19^6 = 19^4 * 19^2 = 130,321 * 361\n\nCalculate 130,321 * 361:\n\n130,321 * 300 = 39,096,300\n\n130,321 * 60 = 7,819,260\n\n130,321 * 1 = 130,321\n\nTotal: 39,096,300 + 7,819,260 = 46,915,560 + 130,321 = 47,045,881\n\nThen, 19^7 = 19^6 * 19 = 47,045,881 * 19\n\n47,045,881 * 10 = 470,458,810\n\n47,045,881 * 9 = 423,412,929\n\nTotal: 470,458,810 + 423,412,929 = 893,871,739\n\nThen, 18 * 893,871,739 = 16,089,691,302\n\nNow, 37^2 = 1,369\n\n37^4 = 1,369^2 = 1,874,161\n\n37^6 = 1,874,161 * 1,369\n\nCalculate 1,874,161 * 1,000 = 1,874,161,000\n\n1,874,161 * 300 = 562,248,300\n\n1,874,161 * 69 = ?\n\n1,874,161 * 70 = 131,191,270\n\nMinus 1,874,161 * 1 = 131,191,270 - 1,874,161 = 129,317,109\n\nSo, total is 1,874,161,000 + 562,248,300 = 2,436,409,300 + 129,317,109 = 2,565,726,409\n\nThen, 37^8 = 37^6 * 37^2 = 2,565,726,409 * 1,369\n\nCalculate 2,565,726,409 * 1,000 = 2,565,726,409,000\n\n2,565,726,409 * 300 = 769,717,922,700\n\n2,565,726,409 * 69 = ?\n\n2,565,726,409 * 70 = 179,599,848,630\n\nMinus 2,565,726,409 * 1 = 179,599,848,630 - 2,565,726,409 = 177,034,122,221\n\nTotal: 2,565,726,409,000 + 769,717,922,700 = 3,335,444,331,700 + 177,034,122,221 = 3,512,478,453,921\n\nSo, P(X=8) = 16,089,691,302 / 3,512,478,453,921 \u2248 0.00458\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0046, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering American roulette, which has two green zeros, totaling 38 slots: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green.\n\nIn that case, P(win) = 18/38 = 9/19\n\nP(loss) = 20/38 = 10/19\n\nThen, P(X=8) = (10/19)^7 * (9/19)\n\nAs I calculated earlier, that's approximately 0.0053\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for the geometric distribution.\n\nThe geometric distribution gives the probability that the first success will occur on the nth trial.\n\nThe formula is P(X=n) = (1 - p)^(n-1) * p\n\nWhere p is the probability of success on a single trial.\n\nIn this case, p = 18/38 = 9/19\n\nSo, P(X=8) = (1 - 9/19)^7 * (9/19) = (10/19)^7 * (9/19)\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is C. 0.0053\n\nMaybe the other options correspond to different scenarios or different numbers of trials.\n\nFor example, if it were the probability of winning for the first time on the 7th trial, or something like that.\n\nBut based on the problem statement, the answer should be C. 0.0053\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 0.0053} \\]"
