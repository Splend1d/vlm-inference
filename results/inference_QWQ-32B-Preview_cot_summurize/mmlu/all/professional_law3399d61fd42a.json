Apparently, the co-defendants' investments had not been performing well in the economic downturn. The co-defendants, upset and humiliated by their firing, vowed to get back at the bank. As their revenge, they decided to plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2,000,000. After receiving the money, they would then reveal the location of the bomb and provide details for defusing it. The co-defendants agreed that the bank should be given adequate warning so that nobody would be injured. In accordance with their plan, the co-defendants consulted the Internet, where they found all the information they needed on how to build a bomb. They built the bomb and placed it in a supply closet. Shortly thereafter, they phoned the bank and made a demand for the money. They said a bomb was in the bank and that it would explode in 24 hours unless the money was paid. The bank refused to pay the money. Realizing that their plan had gone awry, they drove to the bank to attempt to defuse the bomb. As they were driving back to the bank, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people. If the co-defendants are charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.\nB. Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\nC.

                    "text": "This is a tricky legal scenario involving murder charges and conspiracy. Let's break it down step by step to understand who's responsible for what.\n\nFirst, the two co-defendants were investment brokers at a bank for ten years but were fired by a new manager due to poor investment performance. They were upset and humiliated, so they hatched a revenge plan: plant a bomb in the bank and demand $2 million. Their plan was to reveal the bomb's location and defusing instructions after receiving the money, ensuring no one would be hurt.\n\nThey researched bomb-making online, constructed a bomb, placed it in a supply closet, and called the bank to make their demand, stating that the bomb would explode in 24 hours unless paid. The bank refused to pay, and the co-defendants decided to go back to the bank to defuse the bomb. However, while they were en route, the bomb exploded, killing 30 people.\n\nNow, they're being charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. We need to determine which statement is correct among the options provided.\n\nLet's start by understanding the charges:\n\n1. **Murder**: This generally refers to the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought. There are different degrees of murder, but in this context, we'll consider it as intentional killing.\n\n2. **Felony Murder**: This is a legal doctrine that holds individuals liable for murder if someone dies during the commission of a dangerous felony, even if the death was unintentional.\n\n3. **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: This is an agreement between two or more persons to commit murder, coupled with an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\nGiven the scenario, let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder.**\n\n- **Felony Murder**: The co-defendants planted a bomb in the bank, which exploded and killed 30 people. Planting a bomb is a dangerous felony, and deaths occurred during its commission. Therefore, under the felony murder rule, both could be guilty of felony murder.\n\n- **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: For conspiracy, there needs to be an agreement to commit murder and an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. Here, their initial plan was to plant a bomb and demand money, ensuring no one would be hurt. They intended to defuse the bomb after receiving the money. Their plan didn't include intending to kill anyone; rather, they wanted to scare the bank into paying without harming anyone. Therefore, it seems they didn't conspire to commit murder but to commit extortion or some other felony.\n\n**Option B: Both co-defendants are guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.**\n\n- **Murder**: As per above, they could be guilty of felony murder.\n\n- **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: As discussed, their intent was not to kill but to extort money. Therefore, this option might not be correct because they didn't conspire to commit murder.\n\n**Option C: Both co-defendants are guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but not murder.**\n\n- **Conspiracy to Commit Murder**: Again, their plan wasn't to kill; it was to extort money using a bomb as leverage. Therefore, conspiracy to commit murder might not apply.\n\n- **Not guilty of murder**: However, given that 30 people died due to the bomb explosion, they could still be liable for murder under the felony murder rule.\n\n**Option D: Both co-defendants are not guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.**\n\n- This seems unlikely because the deaths occurred during the commission of a felony (planting a bomb), which could trigger felony murder liability.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, Option A seems the most plausible: both co-defendants are guilty of felony murder, but neither is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. Their initial intent was not to kill but to extort money, and they took steps to avoid harming anyone, such as giving the bank time to evacuate or defuse the bomb. However, since deaths occurred during the commission of a dangerous felony, they could still be held liable for felony murder.\n\nIt's also worth noting that their attempt to defuse the bomb after the bank refused to pay might be seen as mitigating evidence, showing their intent was not to cause harm, but in legal terms, the outcome might still hold them responsible for the deaths under the felony murder rule.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A appears to be the correct statement given the circumstances described.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
