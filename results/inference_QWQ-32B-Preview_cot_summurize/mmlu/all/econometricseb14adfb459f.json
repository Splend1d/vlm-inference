                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an MA (Moving Average) process defined by the equation:\n\n\\[ y_t = -3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} + u_t \\]\n\nAnd we need to find its characteristic roots. The options are:\n\nA. 1 and 2\n\nB. 1 and 0.5\n\nC. 2 and -0.5\n\nD. 1 and -3\n\nFirst, I need to recall what characteristic roots are in the context of MA processes. I think they are related to the roots of the characteristic equation associated with the MA process.\n\nFor an MA(q) process, the general form is:\n\n\\[ y_t = u_t + \\theta_1 u_{t-1} + \\theta_2 u_{t-2} + \\dots + \\theta_q u_{t-q} \\]\n\nIn this case, our process is:\n\n\\[ y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \\]\n\nSo, comparing to the general form, we have:\n\n\\[ \\theta_1 = -3, \\quad \\theta_2 = 1 \\]\n\nNow, the characteristic equation for an MA(q) process is:\n\n\\[ 1 + \\theta_1 z + \\theta_2 z^2 + \\dots + \\theta_q z^q = 0 \\]\n\nSo, for our MA(2) process, the characteristic equation is:\n\n\\[ 1 - 3z + z^2 = 0 \\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, the characteristic equation for MA processes is often written in terms of lag operators or as a polynomial in z, but I need to make sure about the exact form.\n\nLet me check some references. Hmm, I recall that for MA processes, the invertibility condition involves the roots of the characteristic equation being outside the unit circle.\n\nSo, for our process:\n\n\\[ y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \\]\n\nThe characteristic equation should be:\n\n\\[ 1 - 3z + z^2 = 0 \\]\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation to find the roots.\n\nSo, solving:\n\n\\[ z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\nSo, the roots are:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\nNow, I need to see which of the options matches these roots.\n\nLet me calculate the numerical values:\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), which is approximately 2.236.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ z_1 = \\frac{3 + 2.236}{2} = \\frac{5.236}{2} = 2.618 \\]\n\n\\[ z_2 = \\frac{3 - 2.236}{2} = \\frac{0.764}{2} = 0.382 \\]\n\nSo, the roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 and 2\n\nB. 1 and 0.5\n\nC. 2 and -0.5\n\nD. 1 and -3\n\nNone of these options match 2.618 and 0.382. Wait, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check the characteristic equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic equation for MA processes is different.\n\nLet me recall that for MA processes, the invertibility condition is related to the roots of the polynomial 1 + \u03b81 z + \u03b82 z^2 + ... + \u03b8q z^q \u2260 0 for |z| < 1.\n\nIn our case, it's 1 - 3z + z^2.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's written as z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0, which is the same.\n\nBut perhaps the question is expecting something different.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about the AR representation of this MA process.\n\nWait, no. The question clearly states \"the characteristic roots of the MA process\".\n\nSo, I think I have to stick with finding the roots of the characteristic equation 1 - 3z + z^2 = 0.\n\nBut according to my calculations, the roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382, which don't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I need to rationalize the roots differently.\n\nLet me see:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\nIs there a way to express these roots in terms of the options provided?\n\nOption C has 2 and -0.5.\n\nLet me check if these are close to my calculated roots.\n\n2 is close to 2.618, but -0.5 is not close to 0.382.\n\nOption A has 1 and 2.\n\n1 is not close to 0.382.\n\nOption B has 1 and 0.5.\n\nAgain, 1 is not close to 0.382.\n\nOption D has 1 and -3.\n\nEven worse.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the reciprocal roots.\n\nIn time series, sometimes we consider the reciprocal roots for invertibility.\n\nSo, if z is a root, then 1/z is also considered.\n\nLet me calculate the reciprocals of my roots.\n\nFor z = 2.618, 1/z \u2248 0.382\n\nFor z = 0.382, 1/z \u2248 2.618\n\nSo, the reciprocals are the same as the original roots.\n\nBut that doesn't help match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the sign.\n\nLet me re-examine the characteristic equation.\n\nIs it 1 - 3z + z^2 = 0 or z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0?\n\nYes, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic equation should be 1 + 3z + z^2 = 0?\n\nWait, no. In the MA process, y_t = u_t - 3u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}, so the coefficients are \u03b80 = 1, \u03b81 = -3, \u03b82 = 1.\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is 1 - 3z + z^2 = 0.\n\nI think I'm confident about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misstated, and it's actually an AR process.\n\nBut the question clearly says MA process.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the invertibility condition differently.\n\nThe invertibility condition requires that all roots lie outside the unit circle.\n\nMy calculated roots are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.\n\nThe root 2.618 is outside the unit circle, but 0.382 is inside.\n\nWait, but for invertibility, all roots need to be outside the unit circle.\n\nSo, does this imply that the process is not invertible?\n\nBut the question is just about finding the characteristic roots.\n\nPerhaps the options provided are incorrect, or perhaps I need to consider something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the roots of the autoregressive polynomial.\n\nWait, no. For MA processes, it's the moving average polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nLet me try to factor the equation.\n\nWe have z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0.\n\nLet me see if this can be factored into (z - a)(z - b) = 0, where a and b are the roots.\n\nBut I already solved it using the quadratic formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can complete the square.\n\nz^2 - 3z + 1 = 0\n\nz^2 - 3z = -1\n\nAdd (3/2)^2 to both sides:\n\nz^2 - 3z + (9/4) = -1 + 9/4 = 5/4\n\n(z - 3/2)^2 = 5/4\n\nz - 3/2 = \u00b1\u221a(5/4) = \u00b1(\u221a5)/2\n\nSo, z = 3/2 \u00b1 (\u221a5)/2\n\nWhich matches what I had before.\n\nSo, the roots are (3 + \u221a5)/2 and (3 - \u221a5)/2.\n\nNumerically, approximately 2.618 and 0.382.\n\nBut none of the options match these values.\n\nWait, maybe the options are approximations.\n\nOption C has 2 and -0.5.\n\n2 is close to 2.618, but -0.5 is not close to 0.382.\n\nOption B has 1 and 0.5.\n\nOption D has 1 and -3.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nOption A has 1 and 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the characteristic equation differently.\n\nWait, perhaps for MA processes, the characteristic roots are defined as the roots of the equation 1 + \u03b81 z + \u03b82 z^2 + ... = 0.\n\nWait, in my earlier calculation, I used 1 - 3z + z^2 = 0.\n\nBut maybe the correct form is 1 + \u03b81 z + \u03b82 z^2 = 0.\n\nGiven \u03b81 = -3 and \u03b82 = 1, then 1 + (-3)z + (1)z^2 = 0 \u2192 z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0.\n\nThat's what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 1 + \u03b81 z^{-1} + \u03b82 z^{-2} = 0.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf I let z^{-1} = 1/z, then the equation becomes:\n\n1 + (-3)(1/z) + (1)(1/z^2) = 0 \u2192 1 - 3/z + 1/z^2 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by z^2: z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, still the same roots.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to find the characteristic roots of an MA process.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the MA process in terms of the lag operator L.\n\nSo, y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2} \u2192 y_t = (1 - 3L + L^2) u_t.\n\nThe characteristic equation would then be 1 - 3L + L^2 = 0.\n\nWhich is the same as before, with L\u4ee3\u66ffz.\n\nSo, again, the roots are the same.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the zeros of the MA polynomial.\n\nWait, in MA processes, it's about the invertibility, which relates to the roots of the MA polynomial lying outside the unit circle.\n\nBut the question is just asking for the characteristic roots.\n\nI think I've consistently arrived at the roots being (3 \u00b1 \u221a5)/2, which are approximately 2.618 and 0.382.\n\nGiven that none of the options match these values exactly or even closely for both roots, I'm inclined to think that there might be a mistake in the options provided.\n\nHowever, considering that 2 is close to 2.618 and -0.5 is not close to 0.382, perhaps option C is the closest, but it's not a good match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to rationalize the roots differently.\n\nLet me see:\n\n(3 + \u221a5)/2 and (3 - \u221a5)/2.\n\nThese are exact forms, but they don't correspond to any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the roots in terms of their exact forms, not numerical approximations.\n\nBut the options are given in decimal form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that \u221a5 is approximately 2.236, so (3 + 2.236)/2 = 2.618 and (3 - 2.236)/2 = 0.382, as I calculated before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are reciprocals, but as I saw earlier, the reciprocals are the same as the original roots in this case.\n\nWait, no, that's not true.\n\nIf z is a root, then 1/z is the reciprocal.\n\nSo, for z = (3 + \u221a5)/2, 1/z = 2 / (3 + \u221a5) = (2 / (3 + \u221a5)) * (3 - \u221a5)/(3 - \u221a5) = (6 - 2\u221a5)/(9 - 5) = (6 - 2\u221a5)/4 = (3 - \u221a5)/2.\n\nWhich is the other root.\n\nSo, the roots are indeed reciprocals of each other.\n\nBut that doesn't help me match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the sign of the coefficients.\n\nLet me double-check the general form.\n\nFor an MA(q) process:\n\ny_t = u_t + \u03b81 u_{t-1} + \u03b82 u_{t-2} + ... + \u03b8q u_{t-q}\n\nThe characteristic equation is:\n\n1 + \u03b81 z + \u03b82 z^2 + ... + \u03b8q z^q = 0\n\nIn our case, y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}\n\nSo, \u03b81 = -3, \u03b82 = 1\n\nThus, the characteristic equation is:\n\n1 + (-3)z + (1)z^2 = 0 \u2192 z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are defined differently in this context.\n\nWait, maybe for MA processes, the characteristic roots are the roots of the equation 1 + \u03b81 z + \u03b82 z^2 + ... + \u03b8q z^q = 0, but considered as a function of z^{-1}.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf I set z = 1/w, then the equation becomes:\n\n1 + \u03b81 (1/w) + \u03b82 (1/w)^2 = 0 \u2192 w^2 + \u03b81 w + \u03b82 = 0\n\nSo, w^2 - 3w + 1 = 0\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo, same roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are defined as the roots of the auxiliary equation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven that my calculations consistently lead to roots that don't match any of the options, perhaps I should consider that the question has a mistake or the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to find the characteristic roots of an MA process that I'm not aware of.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up the definition of characteristic roots for MA processes.\n\nUpon looking it up, for an MA(q) process, the characteristic equation is indeed 1 + \u03b81 z + \u03b82 z^2 + ... + \u03b8q z^q = 0.\n\nSo, in this case, it's z^2 - 3z + 1 = 0, which gives the roots I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the AR representation of this MA process.\n\nWait, but the process is already given as an MA process, and we're asked for its characteristic roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the characteristic roots are related to the AR representation.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I have an MA process, I can write it as y_t = u_t - 3 u_{t-1} + u_{t-2}\n\nTo find the AR representation, I would need to express y_t in terms of its own past values.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and it's not directly related to finding the characteristic roots of the MA process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the characteristic roots are related to the autocorrelation function or something else.\n\nBut I think the standard definition is the one I used.\n\nGiven that, and the fact that my calculations are consistent, I think there might be an error in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the roots in a different form.\n\nWait, let me check if any of the options satisfy the characteristic equation.\n\nTake option C: 2 and -0.5\n\nPlug z = 2 into the equation:\n\n(2)^2 - 3*(2) + 1 = 4 - 6 + 1 = -1 \u2260 0\n\nSo, z = 2 is not a root.\n\nz = -0.5:\n\n(-0.5)^2 - 3*(-0.5) + 1 = 0.25 + 1.5 + 1 = 2.75 \u2260 0\n\nSo, not a root.\n\nOption A: 1 and 2\n\nz = 1:\n\n(1)^2 - 3*(1) + 1 = 1 - 3 + 1 = -1 \u2260 0\n\nz = 2: as above, not a root.\n\nOption B: 1 and 0.5\n\nz = 1: as above, not a root.\n\nz = 0.5:\n\n(0.5)^2 - 3*(0.5) + 1 = 0.25 - 1.5 + 1 = -0.25 \u2260 0\n\nOption D: 1 and -3\n\nz = 1: as above, not a root.\n\nz = -3:\n\n(-3)^2 - 3*(-3) + 1 = 9 + 9 + 1 = 19 \u2260 0\n\nSo, none of the options satisfy the characteristic equation.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there might be a mistake in the question or the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I would recommend double-checking the problem statement or considering that the correct answer is not among the options.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose the closest option, it would be C. 2 and -0.5, since 2 is close to one of the roots, but even that is not accurate.\n\nBut in reality, based on my calculations, none of the options are correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the above}} \\]"
