Initially, the full retirement age was 65, but changes in the law have gradually raised this age. For example, for people born in 1937 or earlier, the full retirement age remains 65, but for those born in 1960 or later, it is 67. This trend indicates that the full retirement age has been increasing to account for increased life expectancy and to ensure the sustainability of the Social Security system."
