                    "text": "I think the correct answer is B. When the catheter is blocked. So, let me try to understand this. A bladder washout is a procedure done to clear a blocked catheter. A catheter is a tube that's inserted into the bladder to drain urine, right? Sometimes, the catheter can get clogged with things like blood clots, sediment, or crystals in the urine, which prevents urine from flowing through it properly. That's when a bladder washout might be needed to clean out the catheter and restore the flow of urine.\n\nOption A says \"when their urine is clear.\" That doesn't make sense because clear urine usually indicates that the catheter is working fine and there's no blockage. So, there wouldn't be a need for a washout in that case.\n\nOption C mentions \"when the catheter is bypassing.\" I'm not sure what \"bypassing\" means in this context. Maybe it's referring to the catheter not functioning properly or urine leaking around it. But I think \"blocked\" is more accurate for needing a washout.\n\nOption D says \"when the catheter is dirty.\" While it's important to keep the catheter clean to prevent infections, a dirty catheter doesn't necessarily require a washout. Cleaning the outside of the catheter and the area around it is part of general care, but a washout is specifically for clearing a blockage inside the catheter.\n\nSo, overall, I believe B is the correct answer because a bladder washout is performed when the catheter is blocked to restore urine flow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
