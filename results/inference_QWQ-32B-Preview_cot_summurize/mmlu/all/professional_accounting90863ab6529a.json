Given that the taxpayer died on May 15, year 2, we need to calculate nine months from that date.\n\nStarting from May 15, year 2:\n\n- June 15, year 2 (1 month)\n\n- July 15, year 2 (2 months)\n\n- August 15, year 2 (3 months)\n\n- September 15, year 2 (4 months)\n\n- October 15, year 2 (5 months)\n\n- November 15, year 2 (6 months)\n\n- December 15, year 2 (7 months)\n\n- January 15, year 3 (8 months)\n\n- February 15, year 3 (9 months)\n\nTherefore, the due date for filing Form 706 would be February 15, year 3, assuming no extension is requested.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual due date might be affected by other factors, such as the date the estate is required to pay any tax due, which is generally four months after the date of death. But for the purpose of this question, which specifically asks about the due date for filing Form 706, the answer should be February 15, year 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. February 15, year 3.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- IRS Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators\n\n- IRS Form 706 instructions\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- Estate tax return (Form 706) is due nine months after the date of death.\n\n- No extension is filed in this scenario.\n\n- Calculate nine months from May 15, year 2, to find the due date.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n- May 15, year 2, plus nine months:\n\n- June 15, year 2\n\n- July 15, year 2\n\n- August 15, year 2\n\n- September 15, year 2\n\n- October 15, year 2\n\n- November 15, year 2\n\n- December 15, year 2\n\n- January 15, year 3\n\n- February 15, year 3\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe due date for filing Form 706 is February 15, year 3.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- Estates can request a six-month extension by filing Form 4768.\n\n- Even with an extension, tax payments are still due four months after the date of death.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
