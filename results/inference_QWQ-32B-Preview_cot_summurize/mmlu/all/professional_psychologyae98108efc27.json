                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about concurrent individual and group therapy. So, the scenario is that sometimes patients might be in both individual therapy and group therapy at the same time. But many therapists aren't too keen on this approach. The question is asking about one of the major concerns therapists have when patients are doing both types of therapy simultaneously.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Patients starting in a group find extra support and might quit individual therapy too soon.\n\nB. Patients hold off on reacting to what happens in group therapy until their individual sessions.\n\nC. Screening processes for patients might be skipped because the therapist is suggesting group therapy.\n\nD. Patients use their two therapists' opinions to contradict what group members suggest for behavior change.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that patients might terminate individual therapy prematurely because they find additional support in group therapy. That could be a possibility. Group therapy can provide a sense of community and support that some patients might find sufficient, leading them to think they don't need individual therapy anymore. But is this necessarily a bad thing? Well, it might be if the individual therapy is addressing specific issues that aren't being fully tackled in group settings. So, therapists might worry that patients are stopping individual therapy too early, before those specific issues are resolved.\n\nOption B says that patients wait to react to group therapy in their individual sessions. This might be seen as a way for patients to process their group experiences in a safer, one-on-one setting. But could this be a problem? Maybe, if it means that patients aren't fully engaging in the group dynamic or aren't providing feedback in the moment during group sessions. Therapists might worry that this hinders the group process or that patients aren't learning to handle group interactions in real time.\n\nOption C mentions that screening procedures might be ignored because a therapist is recommending group experience. Screening is important to ensure that group therapy is appropriate for a patient's needs and to create a compatible group composition. If screening is bypassed because the therapist is pushing for group therapy, that could lead to mismatched groups or patients being placed in inappropriate settings, which could be detrimental to their treatment.\n\nOption D suggests that patients might use discrepancies between their individual and group therapists' advice to refute group members' suggestions for behavior change. This could create confusion or allow patients to pick and choose which advice to follow, possibly undermining the group therapy process. It might also lead to triangulation, where the patient plays one therapist against the other, which can be counterproductive.\n\nNow, considering these points, which one is likely the major concern for therapists?\n\nOption A seems like a valid point, but it's more about patients potentially abandoning individual therapy too soon rather than an issue with the therapy formats themselves interacting poorly.\n\nOption B is about patients processing group therapy in individual sessions, which could be seen as a way to enhance understanding but might also detract from the group dynamic.\n\nOption C raises a significant concern about proper screening being ignored, which could lead to ineffective or even harmful group therapy experiences.\n\nOption D highlights the potential for patients to exploit differences between therapists to resist change, which could undermine the group's efforts.\n\nBetween these, I think option C stands out as a major concern because it touches on the fundamental aspect of appropriate patient placement in group therapy. If screening is not properly conducted, it could lead to groups that don't function well, patients who aren't suitable for group therapy being enrolled, or even harm to group members.\n\nMoreover, proper screening is crucial for group therapy to be effective. It helps ensure that the group composition is appropriate, that patients are ready for group work, and that there are no contraindications for group participation. If therapists are recommending group therapy without thorough screening, it could reflect poorly on their judgment and potentially harm their patients.\n\nIn contrast, while options A, B, and D present challenges, they seem more manageable compared to the risks associated with improper screening. Therapists can address patients terminating individual therapy prematurely by discussing their reasons and ensuring that they understand the benefits of continuing both therapies if necessary. They can also encourage patients to process group experiences in the moment during group sessions and use individual sessions to delve deeper into personal issues. As for option D, therapists can work collaboratively to present a unified front or at least be aware of each other's approaches to avoid confusing the patient.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option C\u2014screening procedures for patients may be ignored because a therapist is recommending the group experience\u2014is likely the major concern for therapists regarding concurrent individual and group therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
