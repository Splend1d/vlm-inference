                    "text": "So I've got this song from the 17th century about the \"Poor Winter King.\" It seems like it's commenting on something he did that was considered naughty, maybe taking something that wasn't his. Let's see what it's all about.\n\nFirst lines: \"Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King! What's this that you have done? Is 't not a very naughty thing to snatch the Kaiser's crown?\" So, it sounds like the Winter King did something naughty by snatching the Kaiser's crown. The Kaiser is like the Holy Roman Emperor, right? So, he took something that belonged to the Emperor.\n\nThen it says: \"Now you will have to stay away Alike from Rhine and Prague, And more than that\u2014shame and dismay Your days and nights will plague.\" So, because of what he did, he has to leave certain places and will be plagued by shame and dismay. Sounds like he's in trouble.\n\nNext: \"Right well you knew, and all the world, Right well they know this thing, That Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king.\" So, everyone knows that Ferdinand is the lawful king of Bohemia. The Winter King must have tried to take that position, which wasn't his.\n\nThen: \"So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go To Ferdinand, your king, And beg him graciously to show Full pardon for your sin.\" It's advising the Winter King, perhaps called Fritz, to go to Ferdinand and ask for pardon for his sin, which was trying to take the crown.\n\nSo, based on this, what did the Winter King do? Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand\n\nWell, that doesn't seem right. From the song, it sounds like he took something that wasn't his, not gave something over.\n\nB. Successfully defended his land from the Holy Roman Empire\n\nNo, the song is chastising him for snatching the Kaiser's crown, which would be against the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nC. Rebelled against King Ferdinand\n\nThat seems plausible. If Ferdinand is the lawful king and the Winter King snatched the crown, that would be rebelling against him.\n\nD. Claimed the lands of Bohemia for the Catholic Church\n\nThe song mentions Bohemia and Ferdinand as the lawful king, but it doesn't specify anything about claiming lands for the Catholic Church.\n\nSo, option C seems the most fitting based on the song's content. The Winter King rebelled against King Ferdinand by trying to take the crown that belonged to him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
