                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best explains how mutations in DNA can lead to a new phenotype. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"A different polypeptide is produced.\" I know that DNA codes for proteins, which are made up of polypeptides. If there's a mutation in the DNA, it could change the sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide, leading to a different protein. This could affect how the protein functions, which in turn could change the organism's traits or characteristics\u2014that is, its phenotype. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B: \"The polarity of tRNA becomes the opposite of that of DNA.\" Hmm, tRNA is transfer RNA, which helps bring amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. DNA has a specific polarity, with a 5' end and a 3' end. tRNA has its own structure, but I don't think its polarity changes in response to DNA mutations. This option seems a bit off.\n\nOption C: \"Nucleic acids are methylated.\" Methylation is when a methyl group is added to DNA, which can affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. This is an epigenetic modification. While methylation can influence whether a gene is expressed or not, it's not directly about producing a new polypeptide. So, it might affect phenotype, but it's not directly due to a change in the protein sequence.\n\nOption D: \"The gene is now read in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction.\" DNA is typically read in the 5' to 3' direction during transcription. If a mutation caused the gene to be read in the opposite direction, that would be a significant change. However, I'm not sure if mutations can actually cause the direction of reading to reverse. Also, this seems more about the process of reading the gene rather than the outcome in terms of phenotype.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems the most directly related to how a mutation in DNA can lead to a new phenotype. It directly connects the change in DNA sequence to a change in the protein produced, which can alter the organism's traits.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A. A different polypeptide is produced.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
