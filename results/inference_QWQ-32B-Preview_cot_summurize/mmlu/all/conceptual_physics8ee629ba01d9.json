So, opaque materials don't let light pass through them, right? That's why they're called opaque. Now, if light isn't transmitted, what happens to it?\n\nOption A says, \"reflected or converted to internal energy in the material.\" That sounds plausible. When light hits an opaque object, some of it bounces back, which is reflection, and some might be absorbed by the material, turning into heat or internal energy.\n\nOption B says, \"mainly reflected.\" That could be true for some materials, like mirrors, but not all opaque materials reflect most of the light. For example, a black cloth absorbs most of the light and doesn't reflect much.\n\nOption C says, \"mainly refracted.\" Refraction is when light passes through a material and bends, like in transparent objects. But the question is about opaque materials, which don't transmit light. So, refracted doesn't make much sense here.\n\nOption D says, \"transmitted at a lower frequency.\" But opaque materials don't transmit light at all, so this seems incorrect.\n\nThinking about it, when light hits an opaque material, it can either be reflected or absorbed. If it's absorbed, it increases the internal energy of the material, often causing it to heat up. So, option A seems to cover both possibilities.\n\nOption B only mentions reflection, which isn't always the main thing that happens. Sometimes more light is absorbed than reflected, like with dark-colored objects.\n\nOption C is about refraction, which, as I said, doesn't apply to opaque materials because they don't transmit light.\n\nOption D talks about transmitting light at a lower frequency, but again, opaque materials don't transmit light, so this can't be right.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be A: reflected or converted to internal energy in the material.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
