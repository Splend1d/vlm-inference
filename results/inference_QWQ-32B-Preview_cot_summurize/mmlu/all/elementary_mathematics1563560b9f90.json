                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out how many packages of balloons to buy if each package contains 8 balloons and I need a total of 42 balloons. The options are 5, 6, 8, or 42 packages.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. I need enough balloons to reach at least 42, and since balloons come in packages of 8, I have to buy whole packages, not individual balloons. So, I need to find the smallest number of packages that will give me at least 42 balloons.\n\nTo do this, I can divide the total number of balloons needed by the number of balloons per package. That is, 42 divided by 8.\n\nLet me do the division: 42 \u00f7 8 equals 5.25. Hmm, but I can't buy a fraction of a package, so I need to round up to the next whole number because even if I have a remainder, I still need those extra balloons.\n\nSo, rounding up 5.25 gives me 6 packages. But wait, let me check if 5 packages are enough.\n\n5 packages times 8 balloons per package equals 40 balloons. But I need 42 balloons, so 40 is not enough. I'm short by 2 balloons.\n\nTherefore, I need to buy more than 5 packages. Let's try 6 packages: 6 times 8 equals 48 balloons. That's more than 42, but since I can't buy a fraction of a package, and 5 packages aren't enough, 6 packages are the minimum I need to meet the requirement.\n\nLet me check the other options. 8 packages would give me 64 balloons, which is way more than I need and not the smallest number of packages. 42 packages would be 336 balloons, which is way too many. So, 6 packages seem to be the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check my division. 42 divided by 8 is indeed 5.25, and since I can't have a fraction of a package, I have to round up to 6.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of remainders. If I buy 5 packages, that's 40 balloons, with a remainder of 2 balloons needed. So, I need an additional package to cover those 2 balloons, bringing the total to 6 packages.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the ceiling function in mathematics, which rounds up to the nearest whole number. So, ceiling of 42 divided by 8 is 6.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to set up an inequality. Let p be the number of packages. Then, 8p \u2265 42. Solving for p, p \u2265 42/8, which is p \u2265 5.25. Since p has to be a whole number, p must be at least 6.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6 packages.\n\nBut let's make sure that 6 packages give me at least 42 balloons. 6 times 8 is 48, which is greater than 42. And 5 packages give only 40, which is less than 42. Therefore, 6 is the smallest number of packages I need to buy.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6} \\]"
