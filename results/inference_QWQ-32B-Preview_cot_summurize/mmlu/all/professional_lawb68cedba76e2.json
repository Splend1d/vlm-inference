                    "text": "Let's see. There's this new state statute that says aliens can't own commercial real estate in the state. Aliens here probably mean foreign nationals, not extraterrestrials, right? So, two lawful resident aliens enter into a contract to buy an office building, and they both join in a declaratory judgment action to test if this statute is valid. They're suing in federal court to figure out if the statute is legal or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who has standing in this case. Standing is about whether the parties bringing the lawsuit have a real interest in the case and are affected by the law in question. Since both are resident aliens and the statute affects their ability to own commercial real estate, it seems like they both have a direct interest. So, option C says they don't have standing, but that doesn't seem right because they are directly affected by the statute.\n\nOption D says that either resident alien has standing, but not both. Well, if both are affected similarly, maybe both have standing. But I'm not sure about the \"not both\" part. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nNow, about the burden of proof. In legal terms, the burden of proof is on the party that needs to prove their case. In this scenario, the state has enacted a statute, and the aliens are challenging it. Generally, when someone challenges a law, they need to show that the law is unconstitutional or invalid for some reason.\n\nBut in cases involving suspect classifications or fundamental rights, the burden shifts. Suspect classifications are things like race, national origin, and sometimes alienage. If a law discriminates based on a suspect classification, it's subject to strict scrutiny, which means the state has to show a compelling state interest and that the law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\n\nHere, the statute prohibits aliens from owning commercial real estate. Alienage can be a suspect classification, especially when it comes to fundamental rights. So, if the court determines that this is a suspect classification, then the state would have the burden of proving a compelling state interest.\n\nOption A says that the state has the burden of proof to show a compelling state interest. That sounds plausible.\n\nOption B says the burden is on the resident aliens to show there's no compelling state interest. That would be the case under a lower standard of review, like rational basis review, but if it's a suspect classification, it should be strict scrutiny.\n\nOption C, as I thought earlier, seems incorrect because they do have standing.\n\nOption D says either resident alien has standing, but not both. I don't see why only one would have standing. If both are parties to the contract and both are affected by the statute, both should have standing.\n\nSo, between A and B, I think A is correct because of the suspect classification involving alienage. The state should have the burden to show a compelling interest when a law discriminates based on such classifications.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider more. Is alienage always a suspect classification? I think it depends on the context. In some cases, like voting or running for public office, alienage restrictions might be allowed because those are privileges of citizenship. But when it comes to property ownership, which is an economic right, perhaps it's a quasi-suspect classification, subject to intermediate scrutiny.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. In the case of alienage, the level of scrutiny is usually intermediate scrutiny, not always strict scrutiny. So, perhaps it's not compelling state interest but an important state interest that the state needs to show.\n\nBut to keep it simple, given the options provided, I think A is the best answer because it places the burden on the state to show a compelling interest, which aligns with a higher standard of review that might be applicable in this case.\n\nAlso, regarding standing, since both are directly affected by the statute, they both have standing. So, C and D are incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule that the state has the burden of proof to show that there is a compelling state interest to support the statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
