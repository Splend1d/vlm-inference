                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which quotation best describes the central thesis of difference feminism. Let's see what difference feminism is all about first. Difference feminism, also known as equity feminism, is a theory that acknowledges and values the differences between men and women. It suggests that these differences should be recognized and accommodated in society, rather than ignoring them or trying to make everyone the same.\n\nSo, the core idea is that there are important differences between men and women, and these differences should be respected and incorporated into social policies and structures.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. \"There are fundamental differences between individual women.\"\n\nThis seems a bit off. Difference feminism talks about differences between men and women, not necessarily differences between individual women. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nB. \"Men and women have different conceptions of the feminist project.\"\n\nThis could be relevant because difference feminism might suggest that men and women have different perspectives on feminism due to their different experiences and roles in society.\n\nC. \"Women look to context, whereas men appeal to neutral, abstract notions of justice.\"\n\nThis seems to highlight a difference in approach between men and women, with women considering specific contexts and men favoring abstract principles. This aligns with difference feminism's emphasis on recognizing different perspectives based on gender.\n\nD. \"Men are unable to comprehend their differences from women.\"\n\nThis seems a bit absolute and negative towards men. Difference feminism might acknowledge differences in understanding, but it doesn't necessarily claim that men are unable to comprehend differences.\n\nComparing these, option C seems to best capture the essence of difference feminism by highlighting distinct approaches between men and women, which is in line with valuing and recognizing gender differences.\n\nLet me double-check. Difference feminism is about valuing differences and recognizing that these differences should influence how we structure society and approach issues.\n\nOption A is too narrow, focusing only on differences among women, not between men and women.\n\nOption B is relevant but perhaps too specific to the feminist project itself.\n\nOption C directly addresses different approaches based on gender, which aligns well with difference feminism's core thesis.\n\nOption D is too broad and negative, implying men are incapable of understanding, which isn't necessarily the position of difference feminism.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the best choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
