                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about suicide rates in Greenland as of 2017. The options are A. 0.90%, B. 1.80%, C. 3.60%, and D. 7.20%. I need to find out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the question is asking. It's about the \"share of deaths by suicide,\" which I believe means the percentage of total deaths in Greenland that were due to suicide in 2017.\n\nI don't remember the exact statistics for Greenland's suicide rates, so I need to recall some general information about suicide rates in different countries. I know that some countries have higher suicide rates than others, and I think Greenland might have a relatively high rate compared to some other places.\n\nLet me think about what I know about Greenland. It's an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. It has a small population, mostly Inuit people. I've heard that indigenous populations in Arctic regions sometimes face higher rates of mental health issues and suicide.\n\nI recall that in some indigenous populations, suicide rates can be significantly higher than national averages. For example, in Canada, Inuit populations have much higher suicide rates compared to the general Canadian population.\n\nSo, if that's the case in Greenland as well, then perhaps the share of deaths by suicide is\u8f83\u9ad8 compared to other countries. But I need to pick from these options: 0.90%, 1.80%, 3.60%, or 7.20%.\n\nLet me consider what these percentages mean. If the share is 7.20%, that means that 7.20% of all deaths in Greenland in 2017 were due to suicide. That seems quite high, but if the suicide rate is indeed very high in Greenland, it could be possible.\n\nOn the other hand, 0.90% seems quite low. In many countries, the suicide rate is higher than that. For example, in Japan, the suicide rate is around 19 per 100,000 people, which would correspond to a higher percentage of total deaths.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of rates per 100,000 population and then convert that to a percentage of total deaths. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nPerhaps I should look for the actual statistics from 2017 for Greenland's suicide rates. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the internet right now, so I need to rely on what I know.\n\nI seem to remember that Greenland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. In fact, I think it's among the top countries or territories in terms of suicide rates.\n\nIf that's the case, then a share of 7.20% of all deaths being suicides seems plausible. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider the options again:\n\nA. 0.90% - This seems too low for a country with high suicide rates.\n\nB. 1.80% - Still seems low.\n\nC. 3.60% - This could be possible, but if Greenland has very high suicide rates, maybe it's higher.\n\nD. 7.20% - This seems high, but given what I've heard about Greenland's suicide rates, it might be plausible.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here. Based on my knowledge that Greenland has high suicide rates, I'm going to guess that the share of deaths by suicide is relatively high.\n\nTherefore, I'm going to choose option D. 7.20%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
