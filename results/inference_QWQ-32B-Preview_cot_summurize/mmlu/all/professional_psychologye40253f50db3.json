In the context of psychology, this could apply when a psychologist is responsible for the actions of someone under their supervision or control.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Faculty member: As a faculty member, a psychologist might be responsible for students or trainees. If a student causes harm or engages in misconduct, the faculty member could potentially be held vicariously liable if they failed to properly supervise or train the student.\n\nB. Supervisor: In a supervisory role, a psychologist is directly responsible for the actions of those they supervise. This could include interns, trainees, or other professionals. If someone under their supervision causes harm, the supervisor could be held vicariously liable for not providing adequate oversight or intervention.\n\nC. Mentor: A mentor provides guidance and support to less experienced professionals. While there is an element of responsibility, it may not be as direct as in a supervisory role. Vicarious liability might be less likely in this context, unless the mentor had specific control over the mentee's actions.\n\nD. Therapist: As a therapist, the psychologist has a direct relationship with clients but is not typically responsible for the actions of others. Therefore, vicarious liability is less likely to be an issue in this capacity.\n\nComparing these options, being a supervisor (option B) likely presents the highest risk for vicarious liability because of the direct responsibility for the actions of those being supervised.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
