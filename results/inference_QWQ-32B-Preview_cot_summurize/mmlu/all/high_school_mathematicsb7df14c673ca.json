                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on probability, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the meteorologist says there's a 30% probability of rain and no sun. So, P(Rain and No Sun) = 30%.\n\nNext, there's a 40% probability of no rain. So, P(No Rain) = 40%.\n\nI need to find the probability of both rain and sun, which is P(Rain and Sun).\n\nLet me recall some probability rules. I know that the probability of rain, P(Rain), can be broken down into two parts: the probability of rain and sun, and the probability of rain and no sun. So, P(Rain) = P(Rain and Sun) + P(Rain and No Sun).\n\nI already know P(Rain and No Sun) is 30%, but I don't know P(Rain and Sun). I need to find P(Rain).\n\nI also know that P(No Rain) is 40%, so the probability of rain should be P(Rain) = 1 - P(No Rain) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. So, P(Rain) = 60%.\n\nNow, using the earlier equation: P(Rain) = P(Rain and Sun) + P(Rain and No Sun).\n\nPlugging in the known values: 0.6 = P(Rain and Sun) + 0.3.\n\nSo, P(Rain and Sun) = 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3 or 30%.\n\nBut look at the options:\n\nA. 0.16\n\nB. 0.24\n\nC. 0.3\n\nD. 0.5\n\nOption C is 0.3, which matches my calculation. But wait, let me double-check because it seems too straightforward.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something? Maybe the events aren't mutually exclusive or independent in a certain way.\n\nLet me consider the sample space. There are four possible scenarios:\n\n1. Rain and Sun\n\n2. Rain and No Sun\n\n3. No Rain and Sun\n\n4. No Rain and No Sun\n\nI know P(Rain and No Sun) = 0.3\n\nP(No Rain) = 0.4, which includes both No Rain and Sun and No Rain and No Sun.\n\nBut in the options, 0.3 is one of the choices, and my calculation leads to that. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between rain and sun that I'm not considering.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the probability of sun or no sun.\n\nBut the question only gives me information about rain and no sun, and no rain.\n\nI need to find the probability of rain and sun.\n\nGiven that P(Rain) = 0.6 and P(Rain and No Sun) = 0.3, then P(Rain and Sun) = 0.3, as I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I denote:\n\nP(R) = P(Rain) = 0.6\n\nP(R and No Sun) = 0.3\n\nTherefore, P(R and Sun) = P(R) - P(R and No Sun) = 0.6 - 0.3 = 0.3\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the probability of no rain, which is 0.4, and see if that helps.\n\nBut I don't have information about P(Sun) or P(No Sun) directly.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"no sun,\" which might be relevant.\n\nBut in the context of rain and sun, I think I've covered it.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps using a probability table or Venn diagram.\n\nImagine two circles: one for rain and one for sun.\n\nThe overlap would be rain and sun.\n\nThe part of the rain circle outside the sun circle is rain and no sun.\n\nSimilarly, the part of the sun circle outside the rain circle is no rain and sun.\n\nAnd the area outside both circles is no rain and no sun.\n\nI know P(Rain and No Sun) = 0.3\n\nP(No Rain) = 0.4, which includes No Rain and Sun and No Rain and No Sun.\n\nBut without knowing P(Sun), I can't determine P(No Rain and Sun) or P(No Rain and No Sun) separately.\n\nBut I don't need that information to find P(Rain and Sun), as I've already calculated it directly from P(Rain) and P(Rain and No Sun).\n\nI think my initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability of both rain and sun is 0.3.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 0.3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.3} \\]"
