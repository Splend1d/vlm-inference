                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the money supply. I need to figure out which of these options would lead to an increase in the money supply. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"A decrease in the required reserve ratio.\" Hmm, the required reserve ratio is the amount of money that banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. If this ratio decreases, that means banks can lend out more money. When banks lend more, it leads to an increase in the money supply because the lent money gets deposited in other banks, which in turn can lend out more, and this process continues. So, a decrease in the required reserve ratio should increase the money supply.\n\nOption B says: \"An increase in the discount rate.\" The discount rate is the interest rate that banks pay when they borrow money from the Federal Reserve. If the discount rate increases, borrowing from the Fed becomes more expensive, so banks might borrow less. Less borrowing by banks means less money injected into the economy, which should decrease the money supply.\n\nOption C says: \"The selling of bonds by the Federal Reserve.\" When the Federal Reserve sells bonds, it's essentially asking people to give them money in exchange for bonds. So, money flows from the public to the Fed, which reduces the amount of money in circulation. Therefore, selling bonds by the Fed should decrease the money supply.\n\nOption D says: \"An increase in the fraction of deposits that must be held by banks.\" This sounds similar to the required reserve ratio. If the fraction of deposits that must be held increases, that means banks have to hold more money in reserve and can lend out less. Less lending means less money creation through the banking system, so this should decrease the money supply.\n\nSo, looking back at all the options, only Option A\u2014 a decrease in the required reserve ratio\u2014 leads to an increase in the money supply. The other options either increase the reserve requirements or make borrowing more expensive or reduce the money in circulation by selling bonds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any chance that selling bonds could increase the money supply? No, selling bonds absorbs money from the economy, so that's a decrease. Increasing the discount rate makes borrowing from the Fed less attractive, so that should also decrease the money supply. And increasing the fraction of deposits that must be held means higher reserves, less lending, which again decreases the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option A: A decrease in the required reserve ratio.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
