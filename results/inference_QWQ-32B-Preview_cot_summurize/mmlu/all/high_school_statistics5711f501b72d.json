                    "text": "To find the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days, we need to determine the interval that contains the central 50% of the data in a normal distribution. This means we're looking for the two points that cut off the bottom 25% and the top 25% of the distribution, leaving the middle 50%.\n\nGiven that the number of customers served per day is normally distributed with a mean (\u03bc) of 3,250 and a standard deviation (\u03c3) of 320, we can use the properties of the normal distribution and z-scores to find these points.\n\nFirst, we need to find the z-scores that correspond to the 25th and 75th percentiles of the standard normal distribution because the middle 50% lies between these two percentiles.\n\nFrom standard normal distribution tables or using a calculator, we find that:\n\n- The z-score for the 25th percentile (Z_{0.25}) is approximately -0.6745.\n\n- The z-score for the 75th percentile (Z_{0.75}) is approximately 0.6745.\n\nNext, we'll convert these z-scores back to the original scale of the data (number of customers) using the formula:\n\nX = \u03bc + Z * \u03c3\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the value on the original scale.\n\n- \u03bc is the mean.\n\n- Z is the z-score.\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nLet's calculate the lower bound (X_{lower}):\n\nX_{lower} = \u03bc + Z_{0.25} * \u03c3\n\nX_{lower} = 3,250 + (-0.6745) * 320\n\nFirst, calculate (-0.6745) * 320:\n\n-0.6745 * 320 = -215.84\n\nThen:\n\nX_{lower} = 3,250 - 215.84 = 3,034.16\n\nNow, calculate the upper bound (X_{upper}):\n\nX_{upper} = \u03bc + Z_{0.75} * \u03c3\n\nX_{upper} = 3,250 + 0.6745 * 320\n\nFirst, calculate 0.6745 * 320:\n\n0.6745 * 320 = 215.84\n\nThen:\n\nX_{upper} = 3,250 + 215.84 = 3,465.84\n\nTherefore, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is approximately from 3,034 to 3,466 customers.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. (3,034, 3,466)\n\nB. (2,930, 3,570)\n\nC. (2,610, 3,890)\n\nD. (2,450, 4,050)\n\nOption A matches our calculated range.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
