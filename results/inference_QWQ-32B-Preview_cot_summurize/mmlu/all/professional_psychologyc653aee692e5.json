                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what ethnic identity means. There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best defines it. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"cultural practices and beliefs that are non-Western in orientation and perspective.\" This seems to be focusing on practices that are not from Western cultures. But ethnic identity is broader than that, right? It shouldn't just be about non-Western cultures because even Western cultures have ethnic identities. So, maybe this isn't the best definition.\n\nOption B says: \"the collective cultural practices, traditions, and orientations of ethnic minority communities.\" This seems more inclusive, as it talks about ethnic minority communities. But does ethnic identity only apply to minorities? What about ethnic majorities? Don't they have an ethnic identity too? I think this option is a bit limiting.\n\nOption C says: \"a rejection of Caucasian social, cultural, and institutional standards.\" This seems to suggest that ethnic identity is about opposing Caucasian norms. But that can't be right. Ethnic identity is about one's own cultural heritage and affiliation, not necessarily about rejecting another group's standards. This seems too narrow and potentially biased.\n\nOption D says: \"the extent to which an individual endorses and practices the ethnocultural traditions of a given group.\" This sounds more comprehensive. It talks about an individual's endorsement and practice of their group's traditions, regardless of whether that group is a minority or majority, Western or non-Western. It seems to capture the personal aspect of ethnic identity.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Ethnic identity is about how people identify with a particular ethnic group based on shared cultural traits, language, history, and ancestry. It's a part of one's self-concept based on ethnic membership.\n\nOption A is too restrictive by focusing only on non-Western orientations. Option B limits it to minority communities, which might not always be the case. Option C seems to introduce an element of opposition that may not be universal to all ethnic identities. Option D, however, seems to accurately describe the personal acceptance and expression of one's ethnic group's cultural practices and beliefs.\n\nI think the best answer is D because it encompasses the individual's relationship with their ethnic group's traditions without imposing limitations based on geographical orientation or minority status.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
