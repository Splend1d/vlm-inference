Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the group of permutations of 5 objects is. I think it's the symmetric group S5, which consists of all possible permutations of 5 elements. The order of this group is 5 factorial, which is 120. So, |S5| = 120.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the largest order of an element in this group. The order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power of n equals the identity element. In the context of permutations, the order of a permutation is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its disjoint cycles.\n\nSo, to find the largest possible order of an element in S5, I need to consider all possible ways to partition the number 5 into a sum of positive integers (since permutations can be decomposed into disjoint cycles), and then find the LCM of those integers for each partition. The maximum LCM among all partitions will be the largest order of an element in S5.\n\nLet me list all possible cycle structures for permutations in S5:\n\n1. A single 5-cycle: (abcde). The order is 5.\n\n2. A 4-cycle and a 1-cycle: (abcd)(e). The order is LCM(4,1) = 4.\n\n3. A 3-cycle and a 2-cycle: (abc)(de). The order is LCM(3,2) = 6.\n\n4. A 3-cycle and two 1-cycles: (abc)(d)(e). The order is LCM(3,1,1) = 3.\n\n5. Two 2-cycles and a 1-cycle: (ab)(cd)(e). The order is LCM(2,2,1) = 2.\n\n6. A 2-cycle and three 1-cycles: (ab)(c)(d)(e). The order is LCM(2,1,1,1) = 2.\n\n7. Five 1-cycles: (a)(b)(c)(d)(e). The order is LCM(1,1,1,1,1) = 1.\n\nFrom these, the possible orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the largest order among these is 6.\n\nWait a minute, but let me check if there's a way to get a higher order. Maybe I missed some partitions or miscalculated the LCM.\n\nLet me double-check the partitions:\n\n- 5: corresponds to a single 5-cycle, order 5.\n\n- 4+1: 4-cycle and 1-cycle, order 4.\n\n- 3+2: 3-cycle and 2-cycle, order 6.\n\n- 3+1+1: 3-cycle and two 1-cycles, order 3.\n\n- 2+2+1: two 2-cycles and one 1-cycle, order 2.\n\n- 2+1+1+1: one 2-cycle and three 1-cycles, order 2.\n\n- 1+1+1+1+1: five 1-cycles, order 1.\n\nSeems like I've covered all possible partitions of 5, and the maximum order is indeed 6.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to have cycles whose lengths have an LCM greater than 6? For example, if I had a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, that's LCM(3,2)=6. Is there a combination that gives LCM bigger than 6?\n\nIn S5, the maximum sum of cycle lengths is 5, so the possible combinations are limited to those I've listed. I don't think there's a way to get an LCM larger than 6 with partitions of 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the formula for the maximum order in Sn, the symmetric group on n elements. I recall there's a concept called the Landau function, which gives the maximum order of an element in Sn. For S5, the Landau function g(5) is 6, which matches what I've found.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be 6, which is option B.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it. Suppose I consider a permutation that is a product of disjoint cycles, and I want the smallest n such that applying this permutation n times gives the identity. That n is the LCM of the lengths of the cycles.\n\nSo, for S5, the possible cycle structures and their orders are as I've listed, and 6 is indeed the highest.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that S5 has a subgroup isomorphic to A5, the alternating group on 5 elements, which has elements of order up to 5, but in S5, we have transpositions and other permutations that can give higher orders.\n\nBut according to the cycle structure analysis, the highest order is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of a specific permutation in S5 of order 6. For example, consider the permutation \u03c3 = (123)(45). This is a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, disjoint, so the order should be LCM(3,2)=6. Yes, that confirms it.\n\nIs there a permutation in S5 with order greater than 6? If I try a 5-cycle, like (12345), its order is 5. Not higher than 6.\n\nAlternatively, if I have a 4-cycle and a 1-cycle, like (1234)(5), the order is 4.\n\nOr a 3-cycle and two 1-cycles, order 3.\n\nTwo 2-cycles and a 1-cycle, order 2.\n\nSo, no, 6 is indeed the highest order.\n\nWait, but the options include 12 and 15. How can that be? In S5, is there a permutation of order 12 or 15?\n\nLet me check for order 12: to have LCM of cycle lengths equal to 12, possible cycle structures could be:\n\n- A 4-cycle and a 3-cycle: but 4+3=7, which is greater than 5. So, not possible in S5.\n\n- A 6-cycle: but 6>5, so not in S5.\n\nSimilarly, for order 15: LCM of cycle lengths equal to 15 would require cycles of lengths whose LCM is 15, like a 3-cycle and a 5-cycle, but 3+5=8>5, so not possible in S5.\n\nTherefore, in S5, the maximum order of an element is 6.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 6.\n\nBut the question says \"the largest order of an element in the group of permutations of 5 objects,\" and according to my reasoning, it's 6.\n\nHowever, the options include 12 and 15, which are higher than 6, but as I've seen, they are not achievable in S5.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the options, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the group is not S5, but a different group of permutations of 5 objects. For example, if it's a subgroup of S5, the orders could be different, but the question says \"the group of permutations of 5 objects,\" which should be S5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the alternating group A5, but A5 consists of even permutations only, and in A5, the maximum order is 5, from 5-cycles.\n\nBut the question specifies \"permutations,\" which typically means the symmetric group S5.\n\nSo, I think the answer should be 6, which is option B.\n\nPerhaps the options include 12 and 15 to mislead, but based on the analysis, 6 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
