The nearest store is placed at (-5, 7). I need to figure out in which quadrant this point is located.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how the coordinate plane is divided into quadrants. I think Quadrant I is where both x and y are positive, Quadrant II is where x is negative and y is positive, Quadrant III is where both x and y are negative, and Quadrant IV is where x is positive and y is negative.\n\nSo, looking at the point (-5, 7), the x-coordinate is -5, which is negative, and the y-coordinate is 7, which is positive. That should put it in Quadrant II.\n\nBut let me double-check. I can imagine the coordinate plane: the x-axis runs horizontally, with positive to the right and negative to the left; the y-axis runs vertically, with positive upwards and negative downwards.\n\nSo, starting from the origin (0, 0), if I move 5 units to the left (because x is -5) and then 7 units up (because y is 7), where do I end up? That should be in the upper left quadrant, which is Quadrant II.\n\nI think another way to look at it is to consider the signs of the coordinates. Since x is negative and y is positive, it must be in Quadrant II.\n\nLet me see if there's any chance it could be in another quadrant. If x were positive and y positive, it would be Quadrant I. If both were negative, it would be Quadrant III. If x were positive and y negative, it would be Quadrant IV. But here, x is negative and y is positive, so definitely Quadrant II.\n\nI think the answer is B. Quadrant II.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
