                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about electrons diffracting off a crystal surface, and I need to figure out the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons to see a diffraction pattern. The lattice spacing is given as 0.4 nm. The options are 0.1 eV, 1 eV, 10 eV, or 100 eV. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that diffraction occurs when the wavelength of a particle is comparable to the spacing of the lattice points in the crystal. So, for electrons to diffract off the crystal, their de Broglie wavelength should be similar to the lattice spacing.\n\nThe de Broglie wavelength is given by \u03bb = h/p, where h is Planck's constant and p is the momentum of the electron. Momentum p is related to the kinetic energy E by p = sqrt(2*m*E), where m is the mass of the electron.\n\nWait, actually, it might be easier to use the relationship between kinetic energy and wavelength directly. I think there's a formula that relates the kinetic energy of an electron to its wavelength.\n\nLet me look that up. Oh, yes, the kinetic energy of an electron is related to its wavelength by the equation:\n\nE = (h^2)/(2*m*\u03bb^2)\n\nBut I think I saw another form of this equation. Maybe E = (p^2)/(2*m), and since p = h/\u03bb, substituting gives E = (h^2)/(2*m*\u03bb^2). Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nBut perhaps it's more straightforward to use the de Broglie wavelength equation and the kinetic energy equation and solve for E.\n\nGiven that \u03bb \u2248 0.4 nm, which is 0.4 x 10^-9 m.\n\nI need to find E such that \u03bb = h/p, and p = sqrt(2*m*E).\n\nSo, \u03bb = h / sqrt(2*m*E)\n\nRearranging for E:\n\nE = (h^2)/(2*m*\u03bb^2)\n\nOkay, now I need to plug in the values.\n\nPlanck's constant, h = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js\n\nMass of an electron, m = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg\n\n\u03bb = 0.4 x 10^-9 m\n\nPlugging these in:\n\nE = (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 / (2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 * (0.4 x 10^-9)^2)\n\nLet me calculate the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 = 4.39 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2\n\nDenominator: 2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 = 18.218 x 10^-31 kg\n\nThen, (0.4 x 10^-9)^2 = 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2\n\nSo, denominator becomes: 18.218 x 10^-31 * 0.16 x 10^-18 = 2.915 x 10^-49 kg m^2\n\nNow, E = 4.39 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2 / 2.915 x 10^-49 kg m^2\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The units don't match up. Oh, I see, Planck's constant is in Js, and momentum is in kg m/s, so the energy should come out in Joules. But I need to convert it to electron volts (eV).\n\nLet me double-check the formula. I think I might have missed something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the kinetic energy of an electron in terms of its wavelength:\n\nE = (h^2)/(2*m*\u03bb^2)\n\nYes, that's the correct formula.\n\nLet me calculate it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03bb^2:\n\n\u03bb = 0.4 nm = 0.4 x 10^-9 m\n\n\u03bb^2 = (0.4 x 10^-9)^2 = 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2\n\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n\n2 * m * \u03bb^2 = 2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2 = 2.915 x 10^-49 kg m^2\n\nNow, numerator is h^2 = (6.626 x 10^-34 Js)^2 = 4.39 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2\n\nSo, E = 4.39 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2 / 2.915 x 10^-49 kg m^2\n\nWait, that gives energy in Joules, but I need to convert it to electron volts.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerical value:\n\nE = 4.39 x 10^-67 / 2.915 x 10^-49 = 1.506 x 10^-18 Joules\n\nNow, to convert Joules to electron volts, I use the conversion factor: 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 Joules.\n\nSo, E (in eV) = 1.506 x 10^-18 J / 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV \u2248 9.4 eV\n\nHmm, that's approximately 9.4 eV, which is closest to 10 eV.\n\nBut let me check if I've made any calculation errors.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03bb^2:\n\n0.4 nm = 0.4 x 10^-9 m\n\n\u03bb^2 = (0.4 x 10^-9)^2 = 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2 = 1.6 x 10^-20 m^2\n\nWait, 0.4 squared is 0.16, and 10^-9 squared is 10^-18, so \u03bb^2 = 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2 = 1.6 x 10^-20 m^2\n\nNow, 2 * m * \u03bb^2 = 2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 1.6 x 10^-20 m^2 = 29.149 x 10^-51 kg m^2\n\nWait, no, 2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 = 18.218 x 10^-31\n\nThen, 18.218 x 10^-31 * 1.6 x 10^-20 = 29.1488 x 10^-51 kg m^2\n\nBut actually, 18.218 x 10^-31 * 1.6 x 10^-20 = 29.1488 x 10^-51, which is 2.91488 x 10^-50 kg m^2\n\nNow, h^2 = (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 = 43.903876 x 10^-68 J^2 s^2 = 4.390 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2\n\nSo, E = 4.390 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2 / 2.91488 x 10^-50 kg m^2 \u2248 1.506 x 10^-17 J\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, 4.390 x 10^-67 / 2.91488 x 10^-50 = 4.390 / 2.91488 x 10^-17 \u2248 1.506 x 10^-17 J\n\nNow, converting to eV: 1.506 x 10^-17 J / 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV \u2248 94 eV\n\nWait, that's 94 eV, which is closer to 100 eV.\n\nBut earlier I got 9.4 eV. Did I make a mistake in the exponent?\n\nLet me double-check \u03bb^2.\n\n\u03bb = 0.4 nm = 0.4 x 10^-9 m\n\n\u03bb^2 = (0.4)^2 x (10^-9)^2 = 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2 = 1.6 x 10^-20 m^2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 2 * m * \u03bb^2 = 2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 kg * 1.6 x 10^-20 m^2 = 29.149 x 10^-51 kg m^2 = 2.9149 x 10^-50 kg m^2\n\nh^2 = (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 = 43.903876 x 10^-68 J^2 s^2 = 4.390 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2\n\nSo, E = 4.390 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2 / 2.9149 x 10^-50 kg m^2 \u2248 1.506 x 10^-17 J\n\nConverting to eV: 1.506 x 10^-17 J / 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV \u2248 94 eV\n\nSo, approximately 94 eV, which is closest to 100 eV.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 100 eV.\n\nBut wait, in my initial calculation, I got 9.4 eV, but that was because I miscounted the exponents. In the correct calculation, it's 94 eV, which is closest to 100 eV.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem using the diffraction condition, like Bragg's law.\n\nBragg's law is n\u03bb = 2*d*sin\u03b8, where d is the lattice spacing, and \u03b8 is the angle of incidence.\n\nFor diffraction to occur, the wavelength should be comparable to the lattice spacing, so \u03bb \u2248 d.\n\nGiven that d = 0.4 nm, then \u03bb should be around 0.4 nm for diffraction to be observable.\n\nSo, if \u03bb \u2248 0.4 nm, then we can use the de Broglie wavelength equation to find the kinetic energy.\n\n\u03bb = h / sqrt(2*m*E)\n\nSolving for E:\n\nE = (h^2)/(2*m*\u03bb^2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nh = 6.626 x 10^-34 Js\n\nm = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg\n\n\u03bb = 0.4 x 10^-9 m\n\nSo, E = (6.626 x 10^-34)^2 / (2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 * (0.4 x 10^-9)^2)\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n(6.626 x 10^-34)^2 = 43.903876 x 10^-68 J^2 s^2 = 4.390 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2\n\nDenominator:\n\n2 * 9.109 x 10^-31 = 18.218 x 10^-31 kg\n\n(0.4 x 10^-9)^2 = 0.16 x 10^-18 m^2 = 1.6 x 10^-20 m^2\n\nSo, 18.218 x 10^-31 * 1.6 x 10^-20 = 29.1488 x 10^-51 kg m^2 = 2.91488 x 10^-50 kg m^2\n\nTherefore, E = 4.390 x 10^-67 J^2 s^2 / 2.91488 x 10^-50 kg m^2 \u2248 1.506 x 10^-17 J\n\nConverting to eV:\n\n1.506 x 10^-17 J / 1.602 x 10^-19 J/eV \u2248 94 eV\n\nSo, approximately 94 eV, which is closest to 100 eV.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 100 eV.\n\nAlternatively, another way to look at this is to use the formula for the kinetic energy of an electron in terms of its wavelength:\n\nE = (h^2)/(2*m*\u03bb^2)\n\nOr, equivalently, E = (p^2)/(2*m), where p = h/\u03bb.\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the approximate kinetic energy needed for the electrons to see a diffraction pattern from a crystal with lattice spacing 0.4 nm is around 94 eV, which is closest to 100 eV.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 100 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
