So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"Seeing animals in the zoo makes me sad, so I decided to free the animals at my city zoo.\" Okay, so this person is unhappy about animals being in zoos and decides to set them free. Now, morally, is this wrong?\n\nWell, zoos are established institutions that serve various purposes, like conservation, education, and research. They're regulated and have standards for animal care. So, freeing animals from a zoo could have serious consequences. For example, some animals might not be able to survive outside the zoo, especially if they've been in captivity for a long time and aren't adapted to life in the wild. Also, it could be dangerous for the public if dangerous animals are released.\n\nMoreover, property is involved here\u2014zoos are private or public properties, and releasing animals could be seen as vandalism or destruction of property. There might also be legal implications, like breaking laws related to animal welfare or conservation.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, interfering with a zoo's operations and releasing animals seems wrong because it could harm the animals and pose risks to people.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I briefly whispered to a friend in the public theater as the movie played.\" This seems like a minor infraction. In a theater, especially a public one, there's an expectation of quiet so that others can enjoy the movie without disturbance.\n\nWhispering briefly might be somewhat disruptive, but it's relatively minor compared to other possible offenses. People sometimes have to whisper for various reasons, and it's not necessarily a severe moral issue.\n\nHowever, if someone consistently talks loudly or disrupts the movie, that would be more problematic. But in this case, it's just a brief whisper to a friend.\n\nSo, comparing the two, scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while scenario 2 is more of a minor lapse in etiquette.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
