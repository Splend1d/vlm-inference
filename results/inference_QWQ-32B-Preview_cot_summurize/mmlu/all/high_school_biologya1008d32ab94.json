However, it is the individuals who possess these alleles who survive and reproduce more successfully, passing on their advantageous alleles to the next generation. Therefore, natural selection changes allele frequencies in populations because some individuals survive and reproduce more successfully than others.\n\nTo elaborate:\n\n- **Alleles** are different forms of a gene that can exist at a specific locus on a chromosome. They are the variants that contribute to genetic diversity.\n\n- **Loci** (plural of locus) are the specific positions of genes on chromosomes. Each gene occupies a particular locus.\n\n- **Gene pools** refer to the complete set of genes in a population. It includes all the alleles at all the loci in all the individuals of the population.\n\n- **Individuals** are the organisms that make up the population. They carry combinations of alleles and it is their survival and reproductive success that affects the allele frequencies in the gene pool.\n\nNatural selection operates at the level of individuals because it is the individuals who interact with their environment and face selective pressures. Those individuals with traits (phenotypes) that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, thereby passing their alleles to the next generation. Over time, this leads to changes in the allele frequencies within the population, which is the basis of evolution by natural selection.\n\nFor example, consider a population of beetles where some are green and some are brown. If the environment changes such that brown beetles are better camouflaged from predators, they are more likely to survive and reproduce. As a result, the alleles for brown coloration become more common in the population over time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. individuals."
