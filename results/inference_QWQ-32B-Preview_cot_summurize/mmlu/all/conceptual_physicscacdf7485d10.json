                    "text": "So I've got this question about refraction, and I need to figure out what happens when a wave crosses a boundary and changes. The options are:\n\nA. speed and direction\n\nB. intensity\n\nC. frequency\n\nD. amplitude\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what refraction is. I think it's when a wave bends as it goes from one medium to another, like when you see a straw in a glass of water and it looks bent. So, it's definitely about the direction changing.\n\nBut the question says \"changes,\" and it mentions \"when a wave crosses a boundary.\" So, it's not just about direction; there might be other properties that change.\n\nLet me think about the properties of a wave. There's speed, direction, intensity, frequency, and amplitude. So, these are the options given.\n\nOption A is speed and direction. I know that when a wave refracts, it changes direction, but does it also change speed? I think so, because different media have different speeds for wave propagation. For example, light travels slower in water than in air, that's why it bends.\n\nOption B is intensity. Hmm, intensity is related to the energy of the wave. Does refraction affect the energy? Well, in some cases, maybe some energy is lost due to absorption or reflection, but I'm not sure if that's a direct consequence of refraction.\n\nOption C is frequency. I think frequency is related to the source of the wave and doesn't change as the wave moves through different media. So, perhaps frequency remains the same during refraction.\n\nOption D is amplitude. Amplitude has to do with the height of the wave or the extent of its oscillation. Does refraction affect amplitude? I don't think so directly; amplitude might change due to energy loss over distance or other factors, but not because of refraction itself.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should recall Snell's law, which relates to refraction. Snell's law involves the angles of incidence and refraction and the indices of refraction of the two media. The law is n1 sin\u03b81 = n2 sin\u03b82, where n is the index of refraction and \u03b8 is the angle.\n\nI think the index of refraction is related to the speed of the wave in that medium. In fact, n = c / v, where c is the speed in vacuum and v is the speed in the medium.\n\nSo, if the speed changes as the wave enters a new medium, and according to Snell's law, the direction also changes. So, speed and direction are both affected.\n\nNow, about frequency. I think frequency remains constant because it's a property of the wave source, and it doesn't change as the wave moves through different media. Only the wavelength changes, which is related to the speed and frequency by the equation v = f\u03bb.\n\nSo, if frequency stays the same and speed changes, then wavelength must change to keep the equation balanced.\n\nIntensity might change due to absorption or other losses, but I don't think that's directly related to refraction.\n\nAmplitude is related to the energy of the wave, and while some energy might be lost, it's not a direct consequence of refraction.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be A: speed and direction.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where refraction doesn't change both speed and direction? Maybe if the wave hits the boundary head-on, at a perpendicular angle. In that case, the direction doesn't change, but the speed still does. So, in that case, only speed changes.\n\nWait, but the question says \"when a wave crosses a boundary and changes.\" So, if it crosses the boundary but doesn't change direction, does it still count as refraction? I think refraction typically implies a change in direction, except when entering perpendicular to the boundary.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look up the definition of refraction.\n\nUpon looking it up, refraction is the bending of wave direction as it passes from one medium to another due to a change in speed. So, it's specifically about the change in direction due to change in speed.\n\nBut in the case where the wave hits perpendicular to the boundary, the direction doesn't change, even though the speed does. So, in that case, is it still considered refraction? Maybe not, because there's no bending of the wave.\n\nTherefore, perhaps in general, refraction implies both a change in speed and direction.\n\nBut then, in the perpendicular case, only speed changes, but not direction.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is A: speed and direction, but with the caveat that sometimes only speed changes.\n\nBut since the question is about what changes when a wave crosses a boundary and refracts, and refraction typically implies a change in direction, then speed and direction both change.\n\nFrequency remains the same, and amplitude doesn't necessarily change.\n\nIntensity might change due to various factors, but it's not directly related to refraction.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: speed and direction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
