For a zero-order reaction, the rate should be independent of the concentration of the reactant. Let me think about this.\n\nOption A has r = k ln[A]. That looks like it involves the natural logarithm of the concentration, which I don't think is related to zero-order reactions.\n\nOption B has r = k [A]^2. That seems like a second-order reaction, where the rate depends on the square of the concentration of A.\n\nOption C has r = k [A], which is typical for a first-order reaction, where the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of A.\n\nOption D has r = k, meaning the rate is constant and independent of the concentration. That sounds like a zero-order reaction to me.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In zero-order reactions, the rate of reaction is constant and doesn't change with the concentration of the reactant. So, the rate should not depend on [A] at all.\n\nYes, that matches with option D. So, I think the correct answer is D. r = k.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where a zero-order reaction might involve logarithms or other functions.\n\nI don't recall any such cases. Zero-order reactions are defined by their rate being independent of the reactant concentration, hence the rate law is just a constant, k.\n\nAlso, in the context of integrated rate laws, for zero-order reactions, the concentration of A decreases linearly with time, leading to [A] = [A]0 - kt. But that's different from the rate expression.\n\nThe rate itself is constant, so r = k makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. r = k.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
