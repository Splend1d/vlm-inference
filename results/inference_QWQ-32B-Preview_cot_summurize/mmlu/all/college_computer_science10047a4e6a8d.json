                    "text": "Let's see which sorting algorithm among the options has both average-case and worst-case running times of O(n log n). So, I need to recall the time complexities of each of these algorithms.\n\nFirst up, Bubble sort. I know that Bubble sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order, repeating this process until the list is sorted. Now, in the worst case, when the array is reverse sorted, Bubble sort has to make n passes through the list, each time comparing and swapping elements. This leads to a time complexity of O(n^2). Even in the average case, it's still O(n^2). So, Bubble sort doesn't match the criteria of O(n log n) for average and worst cases.\n\nNext, Insertion sort. This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's efficient for small data sets and mostly sorted lists. In the worst case, which is when the array is reverse sorted, Insertion sort has to shift elements one by one to insert the next element in its correct position. This results in a time complexity of O(n^2). On average, it's also O(n^2). So, again, not meeting the O(n log n) requirement.\n\nNow, Merge sort. This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It splits the array into two halves, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together. The key here is the divide step, which reduces the problem size, and the conquer step, which combines the solutions. The time complexity for Merge sort is O(n log n) in all cases: best, average, and worst. This is because the division always happens, and the merging always takes linear time. So, Merge sort seems to be a candidate that matches the required time complexities.\n\nLastly, Quicksort. This is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. Then, it recursively sorts the sub-arrays. The average-case time complexity of Quicksort is O(n log n), which is great. However, in the worst case, which occurs when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot, the time complexity degenerates to O(n^2). So, while it's O(n log n) on average, it's not O(n log n) in the worst case.\n\nGiven this analysis, the only algorithm that has both average-case and worst-case running times of O(n log n) is Merge sort.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
