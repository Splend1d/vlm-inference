The question is: \"What kind of damages put the nonbreaching party into as good a position as if the other party had fully performed?\" And the options are nominal, punitive, rescission, and compensatory damages. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each type of damage is and how it affects the nonbreaching party.\n\nStarting with nominal damages: These are symbolic damages awarded when there is a technical breach of contract, but no actual loss or harm was suffered by the nonbreaching party. So, it's like a recognition that a breach occurred, but the nonbreaching party wasn't really hurt by it. That doesn't sound like it puts them in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed because they still didn't get what they were entitled to.\n\nNext, punitive damages: These are meant to punish the breaching party for particularly egregious behavior. They go beyond compensating the nonbreaching party and are intended to set an example or deter similar conduct in the future. But again, this isn't about putting the nonbreaching party in the position they would have been in had there been full performance; it's more about punishing the breacher.\n\nRescission is actually not a type of damage; it's a remedy that allows the nonbreaching party to cancel the contract and be restored to their pre-contract position. So, it's about undoing the contract rather than compensating for the breach. Therefore, it doesn't put the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed; instead, it returns them to where they were before the contract.\n\nFinally, compensatory damages: These are designed to compensate the nonbreaching party for the actual losses they suffered due to the breach. The idea is to make them whole, as if the breach had not occurred, by reimbursing them for their direct losses and sometimes including consequential losses. This seems to align with putting the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, compensatory damages appear to be the answer because they aim to restore the nonbreaching party to the position they would have been in had there been no breach, which is essentially the same as being in the position they would have been in if the other party had fully performed.\n\nI think the correct answer is D. Compensatory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
