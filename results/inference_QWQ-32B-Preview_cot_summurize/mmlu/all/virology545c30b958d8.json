So, contingency management is a type of behavioral therapy that uses positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones. It's often used in substance abuse treatment and other areas where changing risky behaviors is crucial.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. A strategy of last resort for reducing high-risk behaviors\n\nThis seems a bit vague. While contingency management can be used to reduce high-risk behaviors, calling it a \"strategy of last resort\" might not accurately represent its role. It's actually a well-established and effective approach, not necessarily a last resort.\n\nB. Paying drug users for negative urine specimens\n\nThis sounds familiar. In contingency management, especially in substance abuse treatment, patients might receive vouchers or cash rewards for providing drug-free urine samples. This positive reinforcement helps motivate continued abstinence.\n\nC. Paying sex workers to use condoms\n\nThis could be a form of contingency management aimed at promoting safer sexual practices among sex workers. By providing incentives for using condoms, the strategy aims to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nD. Paying drug users to use condoms\n\nThis option combines elements of substance abuse and sexual health. While it's possible to have a program that pays drug users to use condoms, it might not be the primary focus of contingency management in substance abuse treatment.\n\nConsidering these options, I think B is the most accurate description of contingency management, specifically in the context of substance abuse treatment. Paying drug users for negative urine specimens is a direct application of positive reinforcement to encourage abstinence.\n\nHowever, options C and D also involve contingency management principles by using incentives to promote safer behaviors in different contexts. But since contingency management is most prominently associated with substance abuse treatment, option B seems the best fit.\n\nOption A is too vague and suggests that it's a last resort, which isn't necessarily the case. Contingency management is a proactive and evidence-based approach.\n\nSo, my answer is B. Paying drug users for negative urine specimens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
