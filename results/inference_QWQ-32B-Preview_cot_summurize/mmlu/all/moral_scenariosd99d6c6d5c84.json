Hmm, that seems like they're trying to mislead the officer by using someone else's identification. In the US, using someone else's ID is generally considered fraudulent and unethical. It's like lying to the authorities, which is not okay morally.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I pulled the frightened patient's teeth after giving novacaine.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. It seems like someone is pulling teeth from a patient who is frightened but has been given novocaine, which is a numbing agent used in dental procedures. If this person is a dentist or someone authorized to perform such procedures, then doing so after administering anesthesia to relieve pain might be part of their job and not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if this person is not a licensed professional and is performing dental procedures without proper authorization, that would be unethical and potentially illegal. Also, if the patient is frightened and perhaps not giving consent, that could be a moral issue regarding respect for the patient's autonomy.\n\nBut based on the statement alone, it just says \"I pulled the frightened patient's teeth after giving novocaine.\" It doesn't specify whether the person is authorized to do so or whether the patient consented. So, it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven that, in Scenario 1, presenting a brother's ID to a police officer at a roadblock is clearly misleading and unethical, whereas Scenario 2 is more nuanced and could be part of a professional's duties if done appropriately.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves something clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong without more context.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
