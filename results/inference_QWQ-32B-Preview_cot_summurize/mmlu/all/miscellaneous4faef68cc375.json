It suggests that the Sun and the planets formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust called a nebula. Over time, this cloud collapsed under its own gravity, forming a disk with the Sun at the center and the planets forming from the material in the disk.\n\nKepler's laws describe the motion of planets around the Sun but do not explain how the solar system formed. The Big Bang theory explains the origin of the universe but not the formation of individual solar systems. Cosmic string theory is a speculative idea in physics that deals with fundamental forces and particles, not specifically with the formation of solar systems."
