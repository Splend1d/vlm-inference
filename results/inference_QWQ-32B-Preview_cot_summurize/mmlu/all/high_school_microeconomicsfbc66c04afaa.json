                    "text": "Let's see. So, we have the market for roses, and it's currently in equilibrium. That means the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price. Now, two things happen at the same time: the supply of roses falls, and the demand for roses rises. I need to figure out what happens to the price and the quantity of roses in this situation.\n\nFirst, let's recall what happens when only one of these changes occurs.\n\nIf only the supply falls, with demand unchanged, the supply curve shifts to the left. This leads to a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity.\n\nIf only the demand rises, with supply unchanged, the demand curve shifts to the right. This also leads to a higher equilibrium price, but in this case, the equilibrium quantity increases.\n\nBut here, both things are happening simultaneously: supply is falling and demand is rising. So, the supply curve shifts left, and the demand curve shifts right.\n\nNow, what does this do to the equilibrium price and quantity?\n\nWell, since both shifts would tend to increase the price, I can say with confidence that the price will rise.\n\nBut what about the quantity? That's trickier because one shift (falling supply) decreases quantity, and the other (rising demand) increases it. So, the net effect on quantity is ambiguous; it depends on which shift is stronger.\n\nTherefore, I can say that the price will rise, but the change in quantity is uncertain without knowing the relative magnitudes of the shifts in supply and demand.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Price and quantity both rise.\n\nB. Price rises, but the change in quantity is ambiguous.\n\nC. Price and quantity both fall.\n\nD. Quantity rises, but the change in price is ambiguous.\n\nOption B seems to match my analysis: price rises, and the change in quantity is ambiguous.\n\nI should make sure that none of the other options fit better. Option A says both price and quantity rise, but as I thought, quantity could either rise or fall depending on the shifts. Option C says both fall, which contradicts my conclusion that price rises. Option D says quantity rises but price change is ambiguous, which also doesn't align with my analysis that price will definitely rise.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I'm missing something. Let me draw a quick graph in my mind.\n\nInitially, supply and demand intersect at equilibrium point E, with price P and quantity Q.\n\nNow, supply falls: supply curve shifts left to S'. This would lead to a new equilibrium E1 with higher price P1 and lower quantity Q1.\n\nBut simultaneously, demand rises: demand curve shifts right to D'. If supply was constant, this would lead to a higher price P2 and higher quantity Q2.\n\nBut since both shifts happen at the same time, the actual new equilibrium will be somewhere in between.\n\nThe price will definitely be higher than P, but whether the quantity is higher or lower than Q depends on the relative magnitudes of the shifts.\n\nSo, yes, price rises, and quantity change is ambiguous.\n\nI think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
