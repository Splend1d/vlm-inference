Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement best explains how mosquitoes became resistant to DDT. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant, and then their population expanded because they had no competition. Hmm, this sounds plausible because mutations can lead to resistance. But I think I remember that mutations can happen before exposure too, and that's important.\n\nOption B says that some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when it was first sprayed, and their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes were exterminated. This also makes sense because if there were already resistant individuals in the population, they would survive and reproduce more once the susceptible ones are eliminated.\n\nOption C suggests that DDT was manufactured improperly. But if DDT was ineffective due to manufacturing issues, wouldn't all mosquitoes be resistant, not just some?\n\nOption D says that DDT is not effective against mosquitoes in general, but that contradicts the fact that it was widely used and effective initially, with only some mosquitoes becoming resistant later.\n\nBetween options A and B, I think B is better because it aligns with what I know about evolution and resistance. Resistance often arises from pre-existing genetic variations in a population. So, some mosquitoes probably had a natural resistance due to genetic mutations before DDT was even used. When DDT was sprayed, it killed the susceptible mosquitoes, leaving behind those with resistance, who then reproduced and passed on their resistant genes, leading to a population mostly composed of resistant mosquitoes.\n\nOption A suggests that mutations happened after exposure, which could also be possible, but it's more accurate to say that resistance mutations likely occurred before exposure, and then were selected for once DDT was used.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B: Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when it was first sprayed, and their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
