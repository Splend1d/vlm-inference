                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect formula for sound, which describes how the frequency of a wave changes for an observer moving relative to the wave source. In this case, both the source (the actor in the car) and the observer (the camera on the platform) are moving in the same direction.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given information:\n\n- Speed of the car (source): 108 km/h\n\n- Speed of the platform (observer): 72 km/h\n\n- Distance between the car and the platform: 200 meters\n\n- Original frequency of the gunshot: 800 Hz\n\nWe need to find the perceived frequency by the camera.\n\nStep 1: Convert speeds from km/h to m/s.\n\n- Speed of car: 108 km/h = (108 \u00d7 1000) / 3600 = 30 m/s\n\n- Speed of platform: 72 km/h = (72 \u00d7 1000) / 3600 = 20 m/s\n\nStep 2: Determine the relative velocity between the source and the observer.\n\nSince both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity (v_rel) is the difference between their speeds:\n\nv_rel = v_source - v_observer = 30 m/s - 20 m/s = 10 m/s\n\nStep 3: Use the Doppler effect formula for sound.\n\nThe general formula for the observed frequency (f') when both the source and observer are moving is:\n\nf' = f \u00d7 ( (v + v_o) / (v + v_s) )\n\nWhere:\n\n- f is the original frequency\n\n- v is the speed of sound in air (approximately 343 m/s)\n\n- v_o is the velocity of the observer (positive if moving towards the source)\n\n- v_s is the velocity of the source (positive if moving away from the observer)\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- The observer (camera) is moving towards the source (car), so v_o = +20 m/s\n\n- The source (car) is moving towards the observer (camera), so v_s = -30 m/s\n\nHowever, since both are moving in the same direction, we need to consider their relative motion correctly.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the relative velocity directly:\n\nf' = f \u00d7 ( (v + v_o) / (v - v_s) )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nf' = 800 \u00d7 ( (343 + 20) / (343 - 30) )\n\nCalculate the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 343 + 20 = 363 m/s\n\nDenominator: 343 - 30 = 313 m/s\n\nSo,\n\nf' = 800 \u00d7 (363 / 313) \u2248 800 \u00d7 1.16 \u2248 928 Hz\n\nWait, but let's double-check the formula.\n\nAlternatively, using the relative velocity approach:\n\nf' = f \u00d7 (v / (v - v_rel))\n\nSince the source and observer are moving in the same direction, and the source is ahead, the relative velocity is v_rel = v_source - v_observer = 10 m/s (source moving faster than observer).\n\nSo,\n\nf' = 800 \u00d7 (343 / (343 - 10)) = 800 \u00d7 (343 / 333) \u2248 800 \u00d7 1.03 \u2248 824 Hz\n\nHmm, this differs from the previous calculation. There might be confusion in the application of the formula.\n\nLet's refer to the standard Doppler effect formula for moving source and moving observer:\n\nf' = f \u00d7 ( (v + v_o) / (v - v_s) )\n\nGiven that:\n\n- v_o = +20 m/s (observer moving towards the source)\n\n- v_s = +30 m/s (source moving away from the observer)\n\nWait, but since both are moving in the same direction, and the source is moving faster, the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nWait, actually, if both are moving in the same direction, and the source is moving faster, then the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nBut in this case, the source is moving towards the observer because the car is ahead and moving faster, so the gunshot sound reaches the camera before it would if the car were stationary.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps it's better to calculate the relative speed between the source and the observer.\n\nIf both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference in their speeds.\n\nIn this case, the source is moving faster than the observer, so the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nBut for sound waves, if the source is moving away, the observed frequency should be lower than the actual frequency.\n\nBut in this scenario, the car is moving towards the camera because it's ahead and moving faster, so the sound should have a higher frequency.\n\nWait, no. If the car is moving faster than the camera in the same direction, the car is moving away from the camera.\n\nLet me try to visualize:\n\n- Car is ahead, moving at 30 m/s\n\n- Camera is behind, moving at 20 m/s\n\n- The car is moving away from the camera at a relative speed of 10 m/s\n\nTherefore, the source is moving away from the observer.\n\nSo, the observed frequency should be lower than the actual frequency.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nf' = f \u00d7 (v / (v + v_s))\n\nWhere v_s is positive because the source is moving away.\n\nf' = 800 \u00d7 (343 / (343 + 10)) = 800 \u00d7 (343 / 353) \u2248 800 \u00d7 0.9717 \u2248 777 Hz\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 928 Hz and 824 Hz, which also don't match.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the motion of the observer as well.\n\nLet's use the full formula:\n\nf' = f \u00d7 ( (v + v_o) / (v - v_s) )\n\nWith:\n\n- v_o = +20 m/s (observer moving towards the source)\n\n- v_s = +30 m/s (source moving away from the observer)\n\nf' = 800 \u00d7 ( (343 + 20) / (343 - 30) ) = 800 \u00d7 (363 / 313) \u2248 800 \u00d7 1.16 \u2248 928 Hz\n\nThis matches one of the options.\n\nBut according to the relative velocity approach, it should be f' = f \u00d7 (v / (v + v_s)) = 800 \u00d7 (343 / 353) \u2248 777 Hz\n\nThere's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think the full formula should be used when both source and observer are moving.\n\nSo, f' = f \u00d7 ( (v + v_o) / (v - v_s) )\n\nWith v_o positive when moving towards the source, and v_s positive when moving away from the observer.\n\nSo, f' = 800 \u00d7 (363 / 313) \u2248 928 Hz\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 941 Hz\n\nB. 787 Hz\n\nC. 924 Hz\n\nD. 912 Hz\n\nThe closest option is C. 924 Hz.\n\nTherefore, the perceived frequency is approximately 924 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{924 \\text{ Hz}} \\]"
