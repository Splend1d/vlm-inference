                    "text": "So I've got this question here in mobster lingo: if you 'sing like a canary,' what are you doing? And there are four options: A) impersonating Sinatra, B) talking to the cops, C) killing an enemy, or D) betting on horses. Hmm, mobster lingo, that sounds pretty specific. I don't hang out with mobsters, but I've heard expressions here and there.\n\nFirst off, 'sing like a canary.' Okay, so canaries are birds, right? And they sing beautifully, but in mobster terms, it probably doesn't mean singing like a bird literally. So maybe it's a metaphor for something. In regular English, if someone 'sings like a canary,' it might mean they're giving away information freely, like a bird chirping a lot. But in mobster slang, it might have a different meaning.\n\nLet me think about option A: impersonating Sinatra. Frank Sinatra was a famous singer, and some mobsters liked him, but does 'sing like a canary' mean impersonating him? Maybe not directly. It's possible that in mobster circles, singing like Sinatra could be akin to singing like a canary, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should look at other options first.\n\nOption B: talking to the cops. Now, this sounds plausible. If a mobster 'sings like a canary,' maybe they're snitching or informing on their colleagues to the police. That makes sense because giving information to the authorities is often frowned upon in criminal circles, and it could be compared to a bird singing and giving away secrets.\n\nOption C: killing an enemy. Hmm, killing someone is more like 'taking someone for a ride' or 'whacking them,' at least in movies and TV shows. I don't think 'sing like a canary' would mean killing someone; that seems unrelated.\n\nOption D: betting on horses. Betting is common in mobster culture, but 'sing like a canary' doesn't sound like it relates to gambling. Maybe if they're singing about their bets or something, but that seems stretch.\n\nSo, between these options, B) talking to the cops seems the most likely. Let me see if I can find any confirmation in my head. I recall that in criminal jargon, 'to sing' can mean to talk or inform, and 'canary' is often used to refer to a person who betrays their group by giving information to the authorities. So, 'sing like a canary' would indeed mean to betray one's associates by talking to the police.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider option A again: impersonating Sinatra. While Sinatra was a singer, and 'sing like a canary' involves singing, it's unlikely that in mobster lingo, it would refer to impersonating him specifically. Unless there's some inside joke or reference I'm not aware of, this seems less likely.\n\nOption C, killing an enemy, doesn't align with the idea of singing or talking. Killing is more of an action, whereas 'sing like a canary' sounds more verbal.\n\nOption D, betting on horses, might involve talking or singing about bets, but it's still not directly related to the expression.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B) talking to the cops. It makes the most sense in the context of mobster lingo and the metaphor of singing like a canary, which implies giving away information, potentially incriminating others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
