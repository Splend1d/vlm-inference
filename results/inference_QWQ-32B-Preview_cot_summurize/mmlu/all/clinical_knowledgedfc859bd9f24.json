Each nucleotide has three parts: a phosphate group, a sugar called deoxyribose, and a nitrogenous base.\n\nThe nitrogenous bases in DNA are of two types: purines and pyrimidines. Purines include adenine (A) and guanine (G), while pyrimidines include cytosine (C) and thymine (T). So, purines and pyrimidines are both part of DNA as they are the bases that pair up in the double helix.\n\nDeoxyribose is the sugar component of DNA, so that's definitely part of it.\n\nNow, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. DNA codes for proteins, but amino acids themselves are not part of the DNA molecule.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer should be D. Amino acid, because they are not a direct component of DNA; instead, they are what DNA helps to make through transcription and translation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is there any way that amino acids are part of DNA? I don't think so. DNA is made up of nucleotides, which have phosphate, sugar, and base. Amino acids are different molecules altogether.\n\nYes, I'm confident with D as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
