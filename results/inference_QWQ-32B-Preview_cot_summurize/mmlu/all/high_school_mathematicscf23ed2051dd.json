We need to find the area of the rectangle.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length, and they bisect each other. Also, the area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width.\n\nLet's denote the width of the rectangle as \\(w\\) and the length as \\(l\\). According to the problem, the length is twice the width, so we can write:\n\n\\[ l = 2w \\]\n\nNext, we know that the diagonal of the rectangle forms a right triangle with the length and width, so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ d^2 = l^2 + w^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\(d\\) is the length of the diagonal. Given that \\(d = 5\\sqrt{5}\\), we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n\\[ (5\\sqrt{5})^2 = l^2 + w^2 \\]\n\nLet's calculate \\((5\\sqrt{5})^2\\):\n\n\\[ (5\\sqrt{5})^2 = 25 \\times 5 = 125 \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 125 = l^2 + w^2 \\]\n\nNow, since \\(l = 2w\\), we can substitute \\(2w\\) for \\(l\\) in the equation:\n\n\\[ 125 = (2w)^2 + w^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 125 = 4w^2 + w^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 125 = 5w^2 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(w^2\\):\n\n\\[ w^2 = \\frac{125}{5} = 25 \\]\n\nSo, \\(w = \\sqrt{25} = 5\\)\n\nNow, since \\(l = 2w\\), then \\(l = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n\nFinally, the area \\(a\\) of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[ a = l \\times w = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 50\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
