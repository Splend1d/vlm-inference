                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about an object falling from rest. It says that the object falls a distance h during the first second of time, and I need to find out how far it will fall during the next second. The options are A. h, B. 2h, C. 3h, or D. 4h.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the equations of motion for an object in free fall. Since the object is released from rest, its initial velocity is zero. The acceleration is due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2, but since we're dealing with variables, I'll use 'g' for gravity.\n\nThe equation for the distance fallen under constant acceleration is:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- h is the distance fallen,\n\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity,\n\n- t is the time.\n\nGiven that the object falls a distance h in the first second (t = 1 s), I can write:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{1}{2} g (1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\]\n\nNow, I need to find the distance it falls in the next second, which is from t = 1 s to t = 2 s.\n\nFirst, I'll find the total distance fallen in 2 seconds:\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} g (2)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g \\times 4 = 2 g \\]\n\nSince I already know that in the first second it fell h = \\(\\frac{1}{2} g\\), the distance fallen during the next second (from t=1 to t=2) is:\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{next}} = h_{\\text{total}} - h = 2 g - \\frac{1}{2} g = \\frac{4}{2} g - \\frac{1}{2} g = \\frac{3}{2} g \\]\n\nBut earlier, I have h = \\(\\frac{1}{2} g\\), so:\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{next}} = 3 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g \\right) = 3 h \\]\n\nWait, that seems to suggest the answer is C. 3h.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the velocity at t=1 s and then find the distance traveled in the next second.\n\nThe velocity at time t is given by:\n\n\\[ v = g t \\]\n\nAt t=1 s, v = g \u00d7 1 = g m/s\n\nThen, the distance traveled in the next second (from t=1 to t=2) can be found using the equation:\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{next}} = v_{\\text{initial}} t + \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\]\n\nHere, t=1 s (the next second), and v_{\\text{initial}} = g.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ h_{\\text{next}} = g \\times 1 + \\frac{1}{2} g (1)^2 = g + \\frac{1}{2} g = \\frac{3}{2} g \\]\n\nAgain, since h = \\(\\frac{1}{2} g\\), then h_{\\text{next}} = 3 h.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 3h.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing. Is there anything else I should take into account?\n\nI think this makes sense because the distance fallen increases with time squared. So, in the first second, it falls h, and in the next second, it falls more because it's falling faster.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the average velocity during the second second.\n\nThe velocity at t=1 s is g, and at t=2 s is 2g. The average velocity during that second is (g + 2g)/2 = 1.5g.\n\nThen, distance = average velocity \u00d7 time = 1.5g \u00d7 1 s = 1.5g, which is again 3h, since h = 0.5g.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to the same conclusion that the distance fallen in the next second is 3h.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 3h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
