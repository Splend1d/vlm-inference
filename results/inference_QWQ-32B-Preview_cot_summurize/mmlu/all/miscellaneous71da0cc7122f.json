I know that hockey has a lot of rules to keep the game fair and safe, so penalties are called when players break those rules.\n\nFirst, I have \"hooking.\" I'm pretty sure hooking is when a player uses his stick to hold onto another player, kind of like hooking them to slow them down or prevent them from moving. That sounds like it would be a penalty because it's not fair play.\n\nNext is \"charging.\" Charging, as I understand it, is when a player takes more than two steps before hitting another player. It's about making sure that players don't build up too much speed and then hit someone, which could be dangerous. So, that\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e2a\u5904\u7f5a\u3002\n\nThen there's \"carving.\" Hmm, I'm not sure what \"carving\" means in the context of ice hockey. I know that in skiing, carving means making clean turns, but in hockey, I'm not sure. Maybe it's related to how a player moves on the ice, but I don't think it's a penalty. Maybe it's just a way of describing a player's skating style.\n\nLastly, \"butt-ending.\" I think that refers to hitting someone with the end of your stick, the butt end. That sounds very dangerous and probably is a penalty to prevent injuries.\n\nSo, looking at these options, A is hooking, which is a penalty; B is charging, which is also a penalty; C is carving, which I don't think is a penalty; and D is butt-ending, which is definitely a penalty.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. carving, because it's not a penalty in ice hockey.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
