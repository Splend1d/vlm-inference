                    "text": "So I've got this question about preparing a statement of cash flows using the indirect method. It's asking which of these options Sokro needs to add back to the change in net assets. Let's see what each option is:\n\nA. Purchase of equipment.\n\nB. Payment on long-term debt.\n\nC. Depreciation.\n\nD. Decrease in accounts payable.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how the indirect method works. It starts with net income and adjusts it to figure out the cash flow from operating activities. So, it's about converting accrual basis net income to cash basis cash flow.\n\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense, meaning it doesn't involve actual cash moving in or out. So, in the indirect method, you add it back to net income because it was subtracted as an expense but didn't use up any cash.\n\nPurchase of equipment is a capital expenditure, which is typically a investing activity, not an operating one. So, that probably doesn't get added back to operating activities.\n\nPayment on long-term debt would be a financing activity, since it's related to debt repayment. Again, not part of operating activities.\n\nA decrease in accounts payable would mean that the company paid some of its suppliers, which is a use of cash. So, in the indirect method, you'd need to subtract that decrease from net income because it represents cash that was used in operations.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If accounts payable decreases, it means the company paid off some of its liabilities, which is a use of cash. In the indirect method, to adjust net income to cash flow from operations, you would subtract that decrease because it's an outflow of cash.\n\nBut the question is asking which of these to add back to the change in net assets. Hmm.\n\nWait, change in net assets is similar to net income, I think. Net assets are assets minus liabilities, so changes in them would relate to net income and comprehensive income.\n\nIn the indirect method, you start with net income and then adjust it for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at cash flow from operating activities.\n\nSo, to answer the question, Sokro must add back depreciation to the change in net assets because depreciation is a non-cash charge that reduced net income but didn't affect cash.\n\nLet me check the other options again to make sure.\n\nA. Purchase of equipment: This is an investing activity and would be reported separately, not added back to operating activities.\n\nB. Payment on long-term debt: This is a financing activity, again reported separately.\n\nC. Depreciation: Non-cash expense, needs to be added back to net income to find cash flow from operations.\n\nD. Decrease in accounts payable: This is a use of cash in operations, so it should be subtracted from net income, not added back.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Depreciation.\n\nBut let's make sure. The question says \"add back to the change in net assets.\" Net assets are similar to shareholders' equity, which is affected by net income. So, starting with the change in net assets (net income), you adjust for non-cash items and changes in working capital to get to cash flow from operations.\n\nAdding back depreciation makes sense because it was a expense that reduced net income but didn't use cash.\n\nSimilarly, a decrease in accounts payable should be subtracted because it represents a use of cash.\n\nSo, yes, depreciation is the one to add back.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
