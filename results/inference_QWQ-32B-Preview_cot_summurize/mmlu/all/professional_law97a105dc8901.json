                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about disclaiming the implied warranty of merchantability in the context of a used car sale. The question is asking which option is NOT considered an effective way to make a full disclaimer of the implied warranty. So, we need to identify which of the given choices doesn't properly accomplish this disclaimer.\n\nFirst, a bit of background: The implied warranty of merchantability is a legal concept that ensures goods sold are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. In simpler terms, when you buy a product, you expect it to work as a normal, functional item of its kind. This warranty is automatic unless it's properly disclaimed by the seller.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\n**Option A: By stating in the contract that there is no \"implied warranty of merchantability.\"**\n\nThis seems straightforward. If the contract explicitly says that there's no implied warranty of merchantability, that should be effective, right? Well, in many jurisdictions, for a disclaimer to be effective, it needs to meet certain criteria, such as being conspicuous and clear. So, just stating it in the contract might not be enough if it's not presented prominently or in a way that the buyer can easily understand.\n\n**Option B: By stating in writing that the vehicle is sold \"as is.\"**\n\nSelling something \"as is\" generally means that the item is being sold in its current condition without any warranties. This is a common practice in used car sales. However, the effectiveness of an \"as is\" disclaimer can vary depending on the jurisdiction and how it's presented. Some places require specific language or procedures for an \"as is\" sale to be enforceable.\n\n**Option C: By setting forth an express disclaimer that is clear, on the point, and conspicuous.**\n\nThis option seems to cover all the bases. An express disclaimer that is clear, directly addresses the warranty, and is conspicuous (meaning it's noticeable and hard to miss) should be effective. This aligns with many legal requirements for disclaiming warranties.\n\n**Option D: By limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold.**\n\nThis one is a bit different. Limiting the liability to the value of the vehicle might be a way to limit damages, but it's not directly disclaiming the warranty. A disclaimer is about eliminating the warranty altogether, not just limiting the remedy if the warranty is breached.\n\nConsidering these points, option D seems like it might not be an effective way to make a full disclaimer of the implied warranty. Instead, it appears to be a way to limit the remedy in case of a breach, which is different from disclaiming the warranty itself.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about what a disclaimer is supposed to do. A disclaimer is intended to inform the buyer that they are not entitled to any warranty, implied or otherwise, for the product they're purchasing. Limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold doesn't directly address the existence of the warranty; it just limits the potential recovery if something goes wrong.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, option D\u2014by limiting the amount to the value of the vehicle sold\u2014is not considered an effective way of making a full disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
