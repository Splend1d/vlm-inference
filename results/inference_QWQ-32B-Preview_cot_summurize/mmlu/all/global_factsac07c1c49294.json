It's asking for the percentage of people who think that having an increasing number of people from different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes their country better. The options are 24%, 39%, 54%, and 69%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or find information about Tunisia's attitude towards diversity around that time. I remember that Tunisia is known for being relatively open and tolerant, but I'm not sure about specific statistics.\n\nMaybe I can think about global trends. In many Western countries, there's been an increase in support for diversity and multiculturalism, but I don't know if that applies to Tunisia.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the demographic makeup of Tunisia. Tunisia is predominantly Arab and Muslim, with some European influences due to its history. I wonder if this homogeneity affects attitudes towards diversity.\n\nI also recall that Tunisia has been through political changes, like the Arab Spring, which might have influenced public opinions on various social issues.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\n- 24% seems quite low. If only a quarter of the population thinks diversity makes the country better, that suggests a majority might not be in favor.\n\n- 39% is still a minority, but closer to 50%.\n\n- 54% is just over half, indicating a majority.\n\n- 69% is a strong majority.\n\nGiven that Tunisia is considered somewhat progressive in North Africa, perhaps the percentage is higher.\n\nBut I'm just guessing here. Maybe I should look for actual data from around 2018.\n\nI recall that organizations like Pew Research Center conduct surveys on global attitudes towards diversity. Maybe they have data for Tunisia.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center data from 2017, about 47% of Tunisians said that having people of many different nationalities, races, and ethnic groups in their country makes their country a better place to live. That's closest to 54%.\n\nHowever, I need to confirm if this is accurate for 2018.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps other sources have different data.\n\nWait, the question is about 2018, but Pew's data might be from 2017. Maybe there wasn't a significant change between 2017 and 2018.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that attitudes towards diversity might have been more positive, making 69% a possible answer.\n\nBut I think 54% is a reasonable estimate based on available data.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with C. 54%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
