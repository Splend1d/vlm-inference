The options are Co-ordinator, Shaper, Resource Investigator, and Implementer. I need to figure out which one of these roles best matches someone who is outgoing and full of enthusiasm.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what each of these roles entails according to Belbin. Belbin's team roles are based on his research into how people behave in teams, and he identified nine distinct roles. Among these, the four options given are part of that list.\n\nLet's start with the Co-ordinator. From what I remember, a Co-ordinator is like the team's leader. They keep everything organized and make sure that the team is moving in the right direction. They need to be good at delegating tasks and keeping everyone on track. While they might be extroverted, I think their main focus is on organization and decision-making rather than being enthusiastic and exploring new ideas.\n\nNext is the Shaper. A Shaper is someone who challenges the team to improve and pushes for higher standards. They're often described as dynamic and driven, which sounds extroverted, but their enthusiasm is more directed towards achieving goals and overcoming obstacles. They might not be as focused on exploring new resources or ideas as on shaping the team's approach and strategy.\n\nThe Resource Investigator seems promising. This role is all about seeking out new ideas, developments, and contacts that can benefit the team. Resource Investigators are typically outgoing, enthusiastic, and good at networking. They're the ones who explore possibilities and bring back information that can help the team. Their extroversion would serve them well in connecting with others, and their enthusiasm would drive them to pursue new opportunities.\n\nLastly, the Implementer. Implementers are more about turning ideas into action. They're methodical, organized, and get things done efficiently. While they might be reliable and hardworking, I don't associate them as much with extroversion and enthusiasm. Their strength lies in their practical approach and attention to detail.\n\nComparing these roles, the Resource Investigator stands out as the one that best fits the description of being extroverted and enthusiastic. They use their outgoing nature to explore new avenues and their enthusiasm to pursue opportunities that can benefit the team.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Resource Investigator.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
