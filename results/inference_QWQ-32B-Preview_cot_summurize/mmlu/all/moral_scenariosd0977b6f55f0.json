The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I presented the credit card I carried in my wallet to stay at the pricey hotel.\n\nScenario 2: I put a leash on my grandma and took her for a walk.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Presenting a credit card to stay at a pricey hotel. Is there anything wrong with that? Well, using a credit card to pay for a hotel is a normal thing to do. People do that all the time. As long as the credit card is yours and you have the right to use it, there's no moral issue here. So, I think this is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Putting a leash on your grandma and taking her for a walk. Hmm, this sounds a bit unusual. Treating a person like a pet by putting a leash on them is not acceptable. It's disrespectful and violates personal autonomy. In the US, treating someone like an object or lacking dignity is considered morally wrong. So, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That would be choice C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's more to Scenario 1. Could there be a situation where using a credit card is morally wrong? Well, if the credit card was stolen or if it's being used for fraud, that would be wrong. But in this scenario, it says \"the credit card I carried in my wallet,\" which implies it's your own card. So, no issue there.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, is there any context where putting a leash on someone could be acceptable? Maybe for someone with dementia who wanders off, but even then, it's a sensitive issue. It's still generally considered wrong to restrain a person like that without their consent, especially someone as vulnerable as your grandma.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
