                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the oral phase of digestion. I need to identify which statement is incorrect among options A, B, C, and D. I'll go through each one step by step to make sure I understand them correctly.\n\nStarting with option A: \"About 2% of the energy content of food is expended during the action of chewing and swallowing it.\" Hmm, I know that digestion requires energy, and chewing and swallowing are part of that process. But I'm not sure exactly what percentage of energy is used for these actions. Maybe I should recall that the body uses energy for various processes, including digestion, which is often referred to as the thermic effect of food. I think that overall, digestion uses around 5-10% of the energy from food, but chewing and swallowing might be a smaller part of that. So, 2% seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Swallowing involves contraction and relaxation of at least 14 groups of muscles in about 10 seconds in healthy subjects.\" This sounds reasonable because swallowing is a complex process that involves coordinated actions of many muscles. I recall that swallowing is divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal, each involving different muscle groups. So, involving at least 14 groups of muscles over 10 seconds makes sense, but again, I'm not positive about the exact number.\n\nOption C: \"The biofilm covering tooth enamel contains several salivary and bacterial enzymes.\" I know that a biofilm, also known as dental plaque, forms on teeth and is composed of bacteria and saliva components. Salivary enzymes like amylase are present in saliva, and bacterial enzymes are produced by the microbes in the biofilm. So, this statement seems accurate.\n\nFinally, option D: \"Salivary amylase digests the dextran film on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose.\" I need to think carefully about this one. Salivary amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into smaller sugars like maltose. Dextran is a type of polysaccharide produced by bacteria in the mouth, using sucrose as a substrate. So, dextran is part of the biofilm and is not directly digested by salivary amylase, which acts on starches, not bacterial polysaccharides. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Option A: Plausible, but unsure about the exact percentage.\n\n- Option B: Sounds reasonable, but not certain about the number of muscle groups.\n\n- Option C: Seems accurate.\n\n- Option D: Likely incorrect, as salivary amylase does not digest dextran.\n\nGiven that I need to choose the incorrect statement, and based on my analysis, I think option D is the incorrect one. However, to be thorough, I should double-check my understanding of salivary amylase and dextran.\n\nSalivary amylase, also known as ptyalin, targets starches, which are composed of glucose molecules. Dextran, on the other hand, is a polymer of glucose but is synthesized by bacteria in the mouth, such as Streptococcus mutans, using sucrose. Salivary amylase does not have the ability to break down dextran; instead, bacterial enzymes like dextranase can degrade dextran.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that salivary amylase does not digest the dextran film on tooth enamel. So, option D is indeed incorrect.\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly revisit the other options:\n\n- Option A: While I'm not entirely sure about the 2% figure, it seems plausible that chewing and swallowing would use a small percentage of the energy from food.\n\n- Option B: Swallowing is a complex process involving multiple muscle groups, so the description seems accurate.\n\n- Option C: The biofilm does contain salivary and bacterial enzymes, so this is correct.\n\nThus, the incorrect statement is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
