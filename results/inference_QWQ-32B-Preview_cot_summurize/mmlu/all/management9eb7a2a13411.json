IT and computing skills D. Communication skills\"\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these skills isn't considered a key management skill for planning. First, I should probably understand what each of these skills entails and how they relate to management planning.\n\nStarting with A, conceptual skills. I know that conceptual skills are about being able to think strategically, to see the big picture, and to understand complex situations. Managers with strong conceptual skills can visualize how different parts of an organization fit together and anticipate future trends. This seems really important for planning because planning often involves looking ahead and making strategic decisions.\n\nNext, B, analytical skills. Analytical skills involve the ability to analyze information, data, and situations to make informed decisions. Managers need to be able to evaluate different options, assess risks, and choose the best course of action. This is crucial for planning because planning requires assessing current conditions, forecasting future needs, and developing strategies accordingly.\n\nNow, C, IT and computing skills. IT stands for information technology, so this refers to skills related to using technology, software, and data management systems. While these skills are increasingly important in today's digital world, I'm not sure if they are considered core management skills for planning. Planning has always been a fundamental management function, even before the advent of modern IT systems. So, maybe IT and computing skills are more supportive or specialized skills rather than key management skills for planning.\n\nFinally, D, communication skills. Communication is essential for managers to convey their plans, ideas, and expectations to their team members and stakeholders. Effective communication ensures that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals. In planning, managers need to communicate the vision, objectives, and strategies clearly so that the team can execute them effectively.\n\nComparing all these options, conceptual skills, analytical skills, and communication skills all seem directly related to management planning. IT and computing skills, while valuable and necessary in many organizations, might not be considered a key management skill specifically for planning, as planning can be done with or without advanced IT skills, depending on the context.\n\nTherefore, I would say that the answer is C. IT and computing skills.\n\nBut to double-check, maybe I should consider if IT and computing skills are sometimes considered essential for planning in certain industries or roles. For example, in tech companies or data-driven organizations, IT skills might be crucial for planning. However, in a more traditional setting, planning could still be done effectively without advanced IT skills, perhaps using more conventional methods.\n\nMoreover, IT and computing skills are more about technical proficiency, whereas the other options are about managerial competencies that are broadly applicable across different industries and roles.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I believe that IT and computing skills are the least likely to be considered a key management skill in planning compared to conceptual, analytical, and communication skills.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
