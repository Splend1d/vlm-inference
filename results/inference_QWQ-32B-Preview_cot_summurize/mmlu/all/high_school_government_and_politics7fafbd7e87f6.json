The options are:\n\nA. will review a lower court decision\n\nB. has rendered a decision on a case\n\nC. has decided not to hear an appeal\n\nD. will recess until the end of the calendar year\n\nI think I remember something about certiorari from my government class, but I need to recall exactly what it is.\n\nSo, certiorari is a Latin term, right? I think it means \"to be certified\" or something like that. In the context of the Supreme Court, it must have a specific legal meaning.\n\nI believe that when the Supreme Court issues a writ of certiorari, it's agreeing to hear a case that has been appealed from a lower court. So, it's like saying, \"yes, we'll review this case.\"\n\nLet me think about option A: \"will review a lower court decision.\" That seems plausible because if the Supreme Court grants certiorari, it means they'll look at the decision made by a lower court to see if there were any legal errors.\n\nOption B says, \"has rendered a decision on a case.\" But isn't that what happens after the Supreme Court hears the case, not when they issue certiorari?\n\nOption C is \"has decided not to hear an appeal.\" Wait, no, that would be the opposite of granting certiorari. If they grant certiorari, they are agreeing to hear the appeal.\n\nOption D is \"will recess until the end of the calendar year.\" I don't think certiorari has anything to do with the Court's schedule or recesses.\n\nSo, based on what I'm remembering, option A seems correct. The Supreme Court issuing a writ of certiorari indicates that they will review a lower court decision.\n\nBut let me double-check. I think sometimes the Supreme Court has a lot of cases brought before it, and they can choose which ones to hear. Granting certiorari is their way of selecting cases for review.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, when they grant certiorari, they're basically saying, \"we'll take a look at this case.\"\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is A: will review a lower court decision.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
