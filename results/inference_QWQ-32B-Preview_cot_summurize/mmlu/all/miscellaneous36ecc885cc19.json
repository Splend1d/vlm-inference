                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about a monopoly. Let me recall what I know about monopolies.\n\nFirst off, a monopoly is a market structure where there's only one seller or producer of a good or service. That means there are no close substitutes, and the monopolist is the sole provider. So, option A says that a monopoly competes with many firms selling the same product in the market. That can't be right because if there are many firms selling the same product, that's more like perfect competition, not a monopoly.\n\nOkay, moving on to option B: \"It has to lower its price on all units to sell more output.\" Hmm, in a monopoly, the firm faces the entire market demand curve, which is downward sloping. That means to sell more units, the monopolist has to lower the price on all units, not just the additional one. This is different from perfect competition, where firms can sell more without lowering the price because they're price takers. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C says, \"Its marginal revenue increases as output sold increases.\" I think this is incorrect. In most cases, marginal revenue decreases as output increases for a monopolist because to sell more, they have to lower the price, which affects the revenue of all units sold. So, marginal revenue should be less than the price and decrease as output increases.\n\nLastly, option D: \"It sets a price below average variable cost to drive its competitors out of the market.\" Wait, in a monopoly, there are no competitors to drive out because the monopolist is the only seller. So, this doesn't make sense in the context of a monopoly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems like option B is the correct statement about a monopoly. The monopolist has to lower its price on all units to sell more output due to the downward-sloping demand curve it faces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
