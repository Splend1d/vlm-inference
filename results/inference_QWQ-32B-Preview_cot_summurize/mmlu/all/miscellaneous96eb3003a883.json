Let's see, the options are:\n\nA. \"Humpty Dumpty\"\n\nB. \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\"\n\nC. \"Jack Be Nimble\"\n\nD. \"Home Sweet Home\"\n\nI think \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" might be the answer. I've heard somewhere that Thomas Edison was involved in the first sound recording, and I think he recorded a poem or something like that. Maybe \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" was the first recording. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think about this. Thomas Edison is famous for inventing the phonograph, which was the first device to both record and reproduce sound. I believe he demonstrated it in 1877, and the first words he recorded were from the poem \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\" So, that might be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, I'm not completely sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should look into the history of sound recording a bit more.\n\nSo, sound recording began in the late 19th century with devices like the phonograph and the graphophone. Thomas Edison did indeed invent the phonograph in 1877, and he used tinfoil as the recording medium. According to many sources, the first recording he made with his phonograph was of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\nThe story goes that Edison was testing his new invention and recited the poem \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" into the phonograph, and it was successfully reproduced. This was a groundbreaking achievement at the time, as it was the first time sound had been recorded and played back.\n\nBut, I've also heard that there were earlier experiments in sound recording, perhaps by other inventors, but I think Edison's phonograph was the first practical device to both record and reproduce sound.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is B. \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nA. \"Humpty Dumpty\" - I don't recall any connection between this nursery rhyme and early sound recordings. It's possible, but less likely.\n\nC. \"Jack Be Nimble\" - Again, no specific connection comes to mind.\n\nD. \"Home Sweet Home\" - This is an older song, but I don't think it was the first recording. It might have been recorded early on, but not the very first.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
