                    "text": "So I've got this legal question here, and I need to figure out what the burden of persuasion is in this case. Let me read the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe city wants to improve rental housing quality, so they proposed an ordinance that requires all new and existing rental units to have at least one full bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. Now, most owners of existing rental housing don't like this idea because they think it will hurt low-income rental units. They argue that they can't raise rents enough to cover the costs of these improvements, which would likely lead to a decrease in low-income housing units.\n\nThe city acknowledges these points but goes ahead and enacts the ordinance anyway. Then, a plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing sues the city, claiming that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. So, the question is: which option best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\n\nOkay, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\"\n\nHmm, this seems to be talking about a high level of scrutiny, specifically strict scrutiny, which is applied when a law affects a fundamental right or a suspect class. So, is there a fundamental right here? Well, property owners do have rights related to their property, but is the right to use property in the most economically efficient manner a fundamental right? I'm not sure about that. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nOption B says: \"The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\"\n\nThis seems similar to option A but focuses on the impact on low-income persons. Maybe it's related to equal protection and the idea that laws affecting certain groups get higher scrutiny. But low-income persons aren't a suspect class, are they? I think racial minorities and certain other groups are suspect classes that trigger strict scrutiny, but not low-income individuals. So perhaps this isn't the best option.\n\nOption C: \"The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\"\n\nThis sounds like intermediate scrutiny, where the court asks if the law is substantially related to an important government interest. But in constitutional law, for economic regulations, the standard is typically rational basis review, which is a lower level of scrutiny.\n\nOption D: \"The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.\"\n\nThis seems to be talking about rational basis review, which is the standard level of scrutiny for economic regulations and non-suspect classifications. Under rational basis review, the court presumes the law is constitutional, and the burden is on the plaintiff to show that it's not rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\nGiven that this is an economic regulation, and there's no suspect class or fundamental right at issue, it's likely that rational basis review applies. So, the plaintiff would need to show that there's no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest.\n\nBut wait, in option C, it says the plaintiff must show that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest. That sounds more like intermediate scrutiny, which is higher than rational basis review.\n\nI think there's a difference between rational basis review and intermediate scrutiny. Rational basis review requires only that the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, whereas intermediate scrutiny requires that the law is substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nGiven that this is an economic regulation, I believe rational basis review applies, which means the plaintiff would need to show that there's no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest.\n\nSo, option D seems to align with that.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any argument that this ordinance affects a fundamental right or a suspect class? The owners are complaining about their property rights, but regulatory takings cases usually don't involve fundamental rights unless it's something like the right to build an accessory dwelling unit or something like that, which I don't think qualifies as a fundamental right.\n\nAlso, the impact on low-income persons might be a consideration, but as I recall, low-income status isn't a suspect classification. So, unless there's something else, it seems like rational basis review applies.\n\nTherefore, the burden should be on the plaintiff to show that there's no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: This seems to impose strict scrutiny on the city, which may not be appropriate for this type of regulation.\n\nB: Again, strict scrutiny, which might not apply here.\n\nC: Intermediate scrutiny, which may not be the standard for economic regulations.\n\nD: Rational basis review, which seems most appropriate for this scenario.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other angle.\n\nIs there perhaps an argument that the ordinance affects fundamental rights, such as the right to housing or something like that? I don't think so. Housing is not a fundamental right in the constitutional sense, at least not in the way that speech or religion is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a taking involved, and thus, the ordinance needs to satisfy some level of scrutiny related to regulatory takings. But typically, regulatory takings analysis involves whether the regulation goes too far in restricting the use of property, and if so, whether just compensation is due.\n\nHowever, in this case, the plaintiff is challenging the ordinance on constitutional grounds, specifically that it's unconstitutional on its face. So, it seems like we're dealing with a due process or equal protection challenge, which would typically be subject to rational basis review in the context of economic regulations.\n\nTherefore, I believe option D correctly states the burden of persuasion in this action.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
