                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which two numbers both round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred. The options are:\n\nA. 1,399 and 1,599\n\nB. 1,449 and 1,549\n\nC. 1,457 and 1,547\n\nD. 1,489 and 1,589\n\nFirst, I need to remember how rounding works. When rounding to the nearest hundred, I look at the tens digit. If it's 5 or higher, I round up. If it's 4 or lower, I round down.\n\nSo, for a number to round to 1,500, it must be closer to 1,500 than to 1,400 or 1,600. That means it has to be at least 1,450 (since 1,450 is exactly halfway between 1,400 and 1,500) and less than 1,550 (since 1,550 is halfway between 1,500 and 1,600).\n\nWait, but actually, the rule is to round up when the digit is 5 or higher. So, any number from 1,450 to 1,549 inclusive will round to 1,500 when rounding to the nearest hundred.\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nOption A: 1,399 and 1,599\n\n- 1,399: The hundreds digit is 3, tens digit is 9. Since 9 is greater than or equal to 5, it rounds up to 1,400.\n\n- 1,599: The hundreds digit is 5, tens digit is 9. Since 9 is greater than or equal to 5, it rounds up to 1,600.\n\nSo neither of these rounds to 1,500.\n\nOption B: 1,449 and 1,549\n\n- 1,449: The hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, it rounds down to 1,400.\n\n- 1,549: The hundreds digit is 5, tens digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, it rounds down to 1,500.\n\nOnly one of these rounds to 1,500.\n\nOption C: 1,457 and 1,547\n\n- 1,457: The hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 5. Since 5 is equal to 5, it rounds up to 1,500.\n\n- 1,547: The hundreds digit is 5, tens digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, it rounds down to 1,500.\n\nBoth of these round to 1,500.\n\nOption D: 1,489 and 1,589\n\n- 1,489: The hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, it rounds up to 1,500.\n\n- 1,589: The hundreds digit is 5, tens digit is 8. Since 8 is greater than or equal to 5, it rounds up to 1,600.\n\nOnly one of these rounds to 1,500.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C, because both 1,457 and 1,547 round to 1,500 when rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
