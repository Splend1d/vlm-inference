I remember Underdog is a cartoon superhero who's always helping people and fighting villains. I think OverCat might be his main opponent because they are both animals, and it makes sense for them to be rivals. Muttley is from Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, I think, so maybe not. Mr. Whoopie sounds familiar, maybe from Huckleberry Hound or something like that. And Dick Dastardly is from Wacky Races. So, I'm going to guess it's OverCat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
