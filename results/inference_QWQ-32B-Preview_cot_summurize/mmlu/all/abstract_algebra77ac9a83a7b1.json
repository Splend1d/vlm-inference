                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. The options are 0, 4, 2, and 6. Okay, first things first, I need to understand what a field extension is and how to find its degree.\n\nI know that a field extension is when you take a base field, in this case, Q (the rational numbers), and you add some elements to it, like square roots, to create a larger field. The degree of the extension is basically the dimension of this larger field when thought of as a vector space over the base field.\n\nSo, here, we're adding sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18) to Q. But wait, sqrt(18) can be simplified. Let's see: sqrt(18) = sqrt(9*2) = 3*sqrt(2). So, sqrt(18) is just 3 times sqrt(2). That means that Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is actually the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3*sqrt(2)), which is just Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), because 3*sqrt(2) is already in Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, the extension is really Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q. Now, to find the degree of this extension, I can use the tower law. The tower law says that if you have fields K contained in L contained in M, then [M:K] = [M:L] * [L:K].\n\nIn this case, I can let K = Q, L = Q(sqrt(2)), and M = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). So, [M:K] = [M:L] * [L:K].\n\nFirst, I need to find [L:K], which is [Q(sqrt(2)):Q]. I know that sqrt(2) is a root of the polynomial x^2 - 2 = 0, which is irreducible over Q (by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2). Therefore, the degree [Q(sqrt(2)):Q] is 2.\n\nNext, I need to find [M:L], which is [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))]. This is the degree of the extension obtained by adding sqrt(3) to Q(sqrt(2)). So, I need to find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nLet me see: sqrt(3) is a root of x^2 - 3 = 0. Is this polynomial irreducible over Q(sqrt(2))? Well, does sqrt(3) belong to Q(sqrt(2))? If it does, then x^2 - 3 would factor into linear factors over Q(sqrt(2)), and the degree would be 1. If not, then x^2 - 3 is irreducible, and the degree is 2.\n\nSo, does sqrt(3) belong to Q(sqrt(2))? Suppose sqrt(3) = a + b*sqrt(2), where a and b are rational numbers. Then, squaring both sides, 3 = a^2 + 2ab*sqrt(2) + 2b^2. So, 3 = (a^2 + 2b^2) + 2ab*sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is irrational, the coefficient of sqrt(2) must be zero, and the rational part must be 3. Therefore, 2ab = 0 and a^2 + 2b^2 = 3.\n\nFrom 2ab = 0, either a=0 or b=0.\n\nIf a=0, then 2b^2 = 3, so b^2 = 3/2, and b = sqrt(6)/2, which is not rational.\n\nIf b=0, then a^2 = 3, and a = sqrt(3), which is also not rational.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), so x^2 - 3 is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)), and [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))] = 2.\n\nNow, by the tower law, [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)):Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)):Q] = 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSo, the degree of the extension is 4.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any possibility that adding sqrt(3) to Q(sqrt(2)) doesn't increase the degree by 2? Maybe there's some relation between sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), which is already what I have.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over Q and see what its degree is.\n\nLet me compute that. Let x = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3). Then, x^2 = 2 + 2*sqrt(6) + 3 = 5 + 2*sqrt(6). So, x^2 - 5 = 2*sqrt(6). Then, (x^2 - 5)^2 = (2*sqrt(6))^2 = 4*6 = 24. So, (x^2 - 5)^2 - 24 = 0.\n\nTherefore, x satisfies the polynomial (x^2 - 5)^2 - 24 = x^4 - 10x^2 + 25 - 24 = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = 0.\n\nSo, x is a root of x^4 - 10x^2 + 1. Is this polynomial irreducible over Q? Let's check if it has any rational roots. By the rational root theorem, possible rational roots are \u00b11. Plugging in x=1: 1 - 10 + 1 = -8 \u2260 0. x=-1: 1 - 10 + 1 = -8 \u2260 0. So, no rational roots.\n\nIs it possible to factor it into quadratic factors? Suppose x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 = (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d). Then, by expanding and equating coefficients:\n\nx^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (b + d + a c)x^2 + (a d + b c)x + b d = x^4 - 10x^2 + 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. a + c = 0 (since there's no x^3 term)\n\n2. b + d + a c = -10\n\n3. a d + b c = 0 (since there's no x term)\n\n4. b d = 1\n\nFrom 1, c = -a.\n\nFrom 4, b d = 1. Possible integer solutions: b=d=1 or b=d=-1.\n\nLet's try b=d=1.\n\nThen, from 3, a*1 + 1*(-a) = a - a = 0, which holds.\n\nFrom 2, 1 + 1 + a*(-a) = 2 - a^2 = -10 \u21d2 -a^2 = -12 \u21d2 a^2 = 12 \u21d2 a = sqrt(12), which is not rational.\n\nSimilarly, if b=d=-1:\n\nFrom 3, a*(-1) + (-1)*(-a) = -a + a = 0, which holds.\n\nFrom 2, -1 + (-1) + a*(-a) = -2 - a^2 = -10 \u21d2 -a^2 = -8 \u21d2 a^2 = 8 \u21d2 a = sqrt(8), again not rational.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial x^4 - 10x^2 + 1 is irreducible over Q, so the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 4, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the degree of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is 4.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
