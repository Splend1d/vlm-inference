                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about lifting a crate using an ideal pulley system. The crate weighs 100 N, and I'm pulling down on the rope with 25 N of force. The question is, for every 1 meter of rope I pull down, how much does the crate rise? The options are 25 cm, 25 m, 50 cm, or none of these.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how pulley systems work, especially ideal ones. I know that pulleys can change the direction of the force and can also multiply the force to make lifting heavier objects easier. In an ideal pulley system, there's no friction, so the mechanical advantage is purely based on the number of rope segments supporting the load.\n\nIn this case, I'm applying 25 N of force to lift a 100 N crate. So, the mechanical advantage (MA) of the system should be the ratio of the load to the effort force, which is 100 N / 25 N = 4. That means the pulley system has a MA of 4.\n\nNow, in pulley systems, the mechanical advantage is also related to the distance over which the effort is applied compared to the distance the load is moved. Specifically, if the MA is 4, then the distance the effort moves is 4 times the distance the load moves. In other words, for every meter of rope I pull, the crate should rise 1/4 of a meter.\n\nLet me check that. If MA = load / effort = 100 N / 25 N = 4, and MA is also equal to the distance the effort moves divided by the distance the load moves, then:\n\nMA = distance_effort / distance_load\n\nSo, 4 = 1 m / distance_load\n\nTherefore, distance_load = 1 m / 4 = 0.25 m\n\nNow, 0.25 m is the same as 25 cm. So, for every 1 meter of rope pulled down, the crate rises 25 cm.\n\nWait a minute, but the options include 25 cm and 25 m. 25 m seems way off because that would mean the crate rises 25 meters for every meter of rope pulled, which doesn't make sense with a MA of 4. So, 25 cm seems plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something about the direction of the force or something specific to ideal pulleys.\n\nIn an ideal pulley system, the velocity ratio (VR), which is the ratio of the distance the effort moves to the distance the load moves, is equal to the mechanical advantage. So, VR = MA = 4.\n\nTherefore, distance_effort / distance_load = 4\n\nGiven that distance_effort = 1 m, then distance_load = 1 m / 4 = 0.25 m = 25 cm.\n\nSo, the answer should be 25 cm, which is option A.\n\nBut the problem mentions pulling the rope downward with 25 N of force. I wonder if the direction of the force affects the calculation. In pulley systems, the direction of the force can change, but in terms of distance ratios, it should still hold as long as it's an ideal pulley.\n\nLet me consider a simple pulley system to visualize this. For example, a single movable pulley would have a MA of 2, meaning you'd need half the force to lift the load, but you'd have to pull twice as much rope. So, for MA = 4, I think it would involve more pulleys.\n\nBut regardless of the specific configuration, in an ideal pulley system, the relationship between force and distance should hold as per the mechanical advantage.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is 25 cm, option A.\n\nWait, but the other option is 50 cm, which is 0.5 m. If I made a mistake in the calculation, maybe that's why.\n\nLet me recalculate. MA = 4, distance_effort = 1 m, so distance_load = distance_effort / MA = 1 m / 4 = 0.25 m = 25 cm.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, option A is the right choice.\n\nI don't see any error in this reasoning. Therefore, the answer should be 25 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
