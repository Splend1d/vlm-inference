So, groupthink is a phenomenon where group members prioritize harmony and consensus over critical evaluation of alternatives, often leading to poor decisions.\n\nIrving Janis studied this concept and identified several causes and symptoms of groupthink. One of the key points is that when groups are under stress or pressure, they might rush to make decisions without considering all options, which can lead to flawed outcomes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Unanimity is important.\n\nWell, groupthink does involve a desire for consensus, but Janis's research suggests that this pursuit of unanimity can be detrimental because it suppresses dissent and critical thinking. So, I think this might be a trap answer.\n\nB. Small groups function better than large ones.\n\nJanis did find that groupthink is more likely to occur in homogeneous groups where members have similar backgrounds and perspectives, but he didn't necessarily say that small groups are always better. In fact, group size can be a factor, but it's not the only one.\n\nC. Groups function well under pressure.\n\nActually, pressure is often a factor that exacerbates groupthink. When groups are under time constraints or high stress, they may be more likely to fall into the trap of groupthink by making quick decisions without thorough evaluation.\n\nD. It is important for people to voice dissent.\n\nThis seems consistent with Janis's findings. He emphasized the importance of having a climate where dissent is encouraged and where group members feel comfortable expressing their own opinions, even if they go against the majority.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is D. It is important for people to voice dissent.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nOption A, unanimity is important, is actually something that groupthink promotes, but Janis's research shows that this can lead to poor decision-making. So, advocating for unanimity isn't a lesson we should take from his research.\n\nOption B, small groups function better than large ones, isn't directly addressed by Janis. While small groups might be more manageable, groupthink can occur in groups of any size, but it's more common in cohesive groups where members strive for agreement.\n\nOption C, groups function well under pressure, contradicts Janis's findings because pressure is often a condition that contributes to groupthink.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is D, emphasizing the importance of voicing dissent to prevent groupthink and improve decision-making.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
