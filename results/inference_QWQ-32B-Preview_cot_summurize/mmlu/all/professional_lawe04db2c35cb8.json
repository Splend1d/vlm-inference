                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a will here from a veterinarian who's leaving his home to someone, and there are conditions attached to it. The will says the home goes to \"my friend to whom I am everlastingly grateful for the devoted care she has lavished on my prize Pomeranians, but if ever my dogs who survive me shall fail to receive proper care, then to my beloved son and his heirs, if he be living and own any dogs, otherwise to the American Society for the Protection of Animals.\"\n\nNow, the question is about the son's interest under his father's will, and we need to figure out what kind of interest he has, given that the Rule against Perpetuities is in effect in this jurisdiction.\n\nFirst, let's break down the will:\n\n1. The initial gift is to the friend, conditional on her providing proper care for the surviving dogs.\n\n2. If the friend fails to provide proper care for the dogs, then the home goes to the son and his heirs, but only if the son is living and owns any dogs.\n\n3. If the son is not living or doesn't own any dogs, then it goes to the American Society for the Protection of Animals.\n\nSo, the son's interest is a contingent interest that depends on certain conditions being met: the friend fails to care for the dogs, the son is living, and he owns any dogs.\n\nNow, in terms of future interests in property law, there are different types of interests:\n\n- **Remainders:** These are interests that are set to take effect after the termination of a prior estate. Remainders can be vested or contingent.\n\n- **Executory interests:** These are shifting or springing interests that can cut short or modify the estate of a prior grantee.\n\nGiven that, let's see what the son's interest is.\n\nThe friend has a conditional fee simple estate\u2014she gets the home outright, but if she fails to care for the dogs, the home shifts to someone else. The son's interest is triggered upon the friend's failure to care for the dogs, provided the son is living and owns dogs.\n\nThis sounds like an executory interest because it's a future interest that can cut short the friend's estate upon the occurrence of a condition.\n\nNow, executory interests can be of two types:\n\n- **Shifting executory interests:** These transfer the interest from one grantee to another upon the occurrence of a condition.\n\n- **Springing executory interests:** These transfer the interest from the grantor to a third party upon the occurrence of a condition.\n\nIn this case, the interest is shifting from the friend to the son upon the friend's failure to care for the dogs.\n\nSo, option B says it's an executory interest of a shifting type, which seems correct.\n\nHowever, we also have to consider the Rule against Perpetuities, which says that no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\n\nSo, is there a possibility that the son's interest could vest more than 21 years after the veterinarian's death, potentially violating the Rule against Perpetuities?\n\nLet's think about this.\n\nThe veterinarian is devising his home, so the will takes effect at his death. The friend gets the home, conditionally. If she fails to care for the dogs, the home goes to the son if he's living and owns dogs.\n\nNow, the son has to be living and own dogs at the time the condition occurs\u2014that is, when the friend fails to care for the dogs.\n\nThe question is whether this interest could possibly vest more than 21 years after the veterinarian's death.\n\nWell, the friend could continue to care for the dogs indefinitely, meaning the condition never occurs, and the son's interest never vests. But if the friend fails to care for the dogs at any time, and the son is living and owns dogs at that time, the interest vests in him.\n\nBut the Rule against Perpetuities requires that the interest must vest within 21 years of some life in being at the time of the vesting\u2014wait, no, at the time the interest is created, which is the veterinarian's death.\n\nActually, the Rule against Perpetuities states that no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.\n\nIn this case, the creation of the interest is at the veterinarian's death.\n\nSo, we need to identify all lives in being at the time of the veterinarian's death, plus 21 years.\n\nNow, the son's interest is contingent on his being living and owning dogs at the time the friend fails to care for the dogs.\n\nThe friend's failure to care for the dogs could happen at any time, potentially more than 21 years after the veterinarian's death.\n\nIf the friend continues to care for the dogs for, say, 30 years, and then fails, and the son is living and owns dogs at that time, his interest would vest 30 years after the veterinarian's death, which is beyond the 21-year limit.\n\nTherefore, this interest could potentially vest more than 21 years after the veterinarian's death, which would violate the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nHowever, there might be a way to save this interest.\n\nSome jurisdictions have a \"wait and see\" approach to the Rule against Perpetuities, where they wait to see if the interest vests within the perpetuity period.\n\nBut assuming a traditional approach, the interest would be void because there's a possibility that it could vest more than 21 years after the veterinarian's death.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct: it's an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nBut wait, option D says it's an executory interest of a springing type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was a shifting interest because it's shifting from the friend to the son.\n\nBut perhaps I need to double-check the difference between shifting and springing executory interests.\n\nA shifting executory interest transfers the interest from one grantee to another upon the occurrence of a condition.\n\nA springing executory interest transfers the interest from the grantor to a third party upon the occurrence of a condition.\n\nIn this case, the grantor is the veterinarian, the initial grantee is the friend, and upon the friend's failure to care for the dogs, the interest shifts to the son.\n\nSo, it's shifting from the friend to the son, making it a shifting executory interest.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct: it's an executory interest of a shifting type that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nBut let's consider option A: it is a contingent remainder.\n\nIs the son's interest a contingent remainder?\n\nWell, remainders follow a prior estate, and they can be vested or contingent.\n\nIn this case, the friend has a conditional fee simple, and the son's interest follows upon the condition being breached.\n\nBut executory interests are different from remainders; they are future interests that can cut short or modify the estate of a prior grantee.\n\nSo, in this case, it's more accurately characterized as an executory interest rather than a remainder.\n\nTherefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that it's an executory interest of a shifting type, but it doesn't address the Rule against Perpetuities issue.\n\nOption C correctly identifies it as a shifting executory interest that is void under the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nOption D incorrectly characterizes it as a springing executory interest, which it's not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
