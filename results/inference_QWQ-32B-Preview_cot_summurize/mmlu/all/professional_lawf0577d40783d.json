                    "text": "Let's see... There's a mail carrier who was delivering mail on a homeowner's property, and he got bitten by a dog owned by the neighbor. The dog's owner had taken precautions to keep the dog secured, but there was one previous incident where the dog escaped and bit someone. Now, the question is whether the dog's owner is liable for the mailman's injuries.\n\nOption A says no, he's not liable because he used due care and wasn't negligent. That sounds plausible, but I need to think about it more. Even if the owner was careful, maybe there's still liability if the dog has known dangerous tendencies.\n\nOption B says no, he's not liable because the mailman was on someone else's property. Hmm, maybe the dog's owner isn't responsible for what happens on another person's property. But the dog somehow got out and caused harm, so maybe there's still liability.\n\nOption C says yes, the dog owner is always liable for any injuries caused to a third person. That seems too broad. Are dog owners always liable, regardless of the circumstances? I don't think that's the case. There must be some conditions or limitations.\n\nOption D says yes, the owner is liable because he knew about the dog's dangerous propensities and is strictly liable for ensuing damages. This sounds similar to strict liability in tort law, where if an animal is known to be dangerous, the owner is responsible for any harm it causes, even if all possible precautions were taken.\n\nLet me recall what I know about liability for dog bites. In many jurisdictions, dog owners can be strictly liable for injuries caused by their dogs, especially if the owner was aware of the dog's vicious or dangerous tendencies. This is based on the principle that if someone keeps an animal known to be dangerous, they should be responsible for any harm it causes, even if they took all possible precautions.\n\nIn this scenario, the dog's owner knew about one prior incident where the dog got loose and bit someone. That suggests that the owner was aware of the dog's potential to cause harm, despite taking precautions like securing it in a fenced area.\n\nSo, even though the owner was using due care, the knowledge of the dog's dangerous propensities might make him strictly liable for the mailman's injuries.\n\nOn the other hand, option A argues that since the owner used due care, he shouldn't be liable. But strict liability doesn't take into account whether the owner was negligent or not. It's about accepting responsibility for the inherent risks associated with keeping a dangerous animal.\n\nOption B suggests that because the mailman was on someone else's property, the dog's owner isn't liable. But the location of the injury might not absolve the dog's owner from responsibility, especially if the dog wandered onto the neighboring property.\n\nOption C is too absolute. Saying that dog owners are always liable doesn't account for the nuances in law, where liability might depend on the circumstances, such as whether the owner knew about the dog's dangerous tendencies or if the victim was trespassing, etc.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate. The dog's owner is liable because he knew about the dog's dangerous propensities, and therefore is strictly liable for the damages caused by the dog's actions.\n\nI think the answer is D."
