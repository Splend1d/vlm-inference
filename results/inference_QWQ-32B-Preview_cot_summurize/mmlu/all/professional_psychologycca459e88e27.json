                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about a test that provides information on four cognitive abilities identified by Luria in 1980. The abilities are planning, attention, simultaneous processing, and sequential processing. The options are:\n\nA. Slosson Intelligence Test Primary\n\nB. Cognitive Assessment System\n\nC. Kuhlman-Anderson Test\n\nD. Woodcock Johnson III\n\nOkay, first I need to recall who Luria is and what his theory was about. I remember that Alexander Luria was a Russian neuropsychologist who made significant contributions to understanding the brain and cognitive functions. In 1980, he proposed a model of higher cortical functions, which included three functional units of the brain, each responsible for different cognitive processes.\n\nBut the question mentions four cognitive abilities: planning, attention, simultaneous processing, and sequential processing. I think these might be related to the functional units he described. Let me see if I can recall them.\n\nLuria's model includes:\n\n1. The regulatory squadron, which is involved in planning and\u8c03\u8282\u884c\u4e3a.\n\n2. The attentional system, which handles attention and concentration.\n\n3. The information processing system, which deals with simultaneous and sequential processing.\n\nWait, that seems close, but it looks like simultaneous and sequential processing might be subsumed under the information processing system.\n\nNow, I need to find out which of these tests is based on Luria's model and assesses these specific abilities.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Slosson Intelligence Test Primary: I think this is an older intelligence test, maybe for children. I don't recall it being based on Luria's model.\n\nB. Cognitive Assessment System (CAS): Hmm, this rings a bell. I think the CAS is a test that's based on Luria's model of neuropsychological functions. It assesses planning, attention, and simultaneous and sequential processing.\n\nC. Kuhlman-Anderson Test: I'm not familiar with this one. Maybe it's another intelligence test, but I don't think it's based on Luria's model.\n\nD. Woodcock Johnson III: This is a comprehensive battery of tests for assessing achievement and cognitive abilities. It's very broad, but I don't recall it being specifically based on Luria's model.\n\nGiven that, option B, the Cognitive Assessment System, seems to be the most likely answer.\n\nTo confirm, let me think about what the CAS is. I believe it was developed by Joel Naglieri and Dennis Kaufman and is designed to assess cognitive processes consistent with Luria's model. It has four indices: Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive (which might be the same as sequential processing).\n\nYes, that matches the description in the question.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Cognitive Assessment System.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll quickly consider why the other options are not correct.\n\nA. Slosson Intelligence Test Primary: This is more of a general intelligence test and doesn't focus on the specific cognitive abilities identified by Luria.\n\nC. Kuhlman-Anderson Test: I think this might be a typo or misnomer. I can't find any reference to a \"Kuhlman-Anderson Test.\" Maybe it's meant to be the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC), but even that is different from Luria's model.\n\nD. Woodcock Johnson III: This is a comprehensive battery that assesses a wide range of cognitive abilities and achievements, but it's not specifically based on Luria's model.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Cognitive Assessment System.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
