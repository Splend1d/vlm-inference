                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Cicero's views on morality. So, Cicero was an ancient Roman philosopher and statesman who wrote a lot about ethics and moral philosophy. He was influenced by the Stoics and other Greek philosophical schools.\n\nThe question is: \"Cicero argues that we will never go morally astray if we:\n\nA. follow our conscience.\n\nB. follow the laws.\n\nC. follow religious edicts.\n\nD. follow Nature as our guide.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Cicero believed about morality and which of these options best aligns with his thoughts.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: follow our conscience. Cicero did place a lot of importance on conscience. He thought that conscience is an inner guide that helps us distinguish between right and wrong. In his work \"De Officiis\" (On Duties), he discusses the role of conscience in moral decision-making. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption B is to follow the laws. While Cicero did think that laws are important for society and that we have a duty to obey them, he also recognized that laws can be flawed. He believed that there is a higher law, which is the natural law, and that human laws should be in accordance with it. So, following laws isn't necessarily the ultimate guide to morality for him.\n\nOption C is to follow religious edicts. Cicero was somewhat skeptical of religion and didn't place much reliance on religious doctrines for moral guidance. He was more inclined towards rationality and natural law.\n\nOption D is to follow Nature as our guide. Cicero did believe in natural law, which is closely tied to nature and reason. He thought that there is a rational order in the universe, and morality consists in living in accordance with that order. So, following nature as our guide aligns with his philosophy.\n\nNow, between options A and D, I need to decide which one best captures Cicero's view.\n\nFollowing our conscience (option A) is important, but conscience, according to Cicero, is connected to our understanding of natural law. In other words, conscience is our internalization of the natural law. So, in a way, following conscience is a way of following nature.\n\nBut is there a difference between the two options?\n\nIf I look back at \"De Officiis,\" Cicero emphasizes the importance of following natural law and using our reason to discern what is right and wrong. Conscience plays a role, but it's rooted in the natural law.\n\nMoreover, in Cicero's view, natural law is universal and unchangeable, whereas conscience can sometimes be mistaken or misinformed.\n\nTherefore, perhaps following nature as our guide is more fundamental in Cicero's philosophy than just following our conscience.\n\nOn the other hand, conscience is our practical guide in specific situations, applying the universal principles of natural law to particular cases.\n\nHmm, maybe both are important, but if I have to choose one...\n\nWait, the question says \"never go morally astray.\" That's a strong statement. So, which one would guarantee that we don't make moral mistakes?\n\nIf we follow nature as our guide, and nature is the source of natural law, then following nature would mean adhering to the universal moral order. In that case, we wouldn't go morally astray.\n\nFollowing our conscience is important, but conscience can sometimes lead us wrong if it's not properly informed by natural law.\n\nSo, perhaps following nature as our guide is the safer bet to never go morally astray.\n\nLet me think about this some more.\n\nIn Cicero's thought, natural law is the ultimate standard of morality. Conscience is our internal guide that should reflect natural law, but it can sometimes fail us.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that we never go morally astray, we should look to nature itself as our guide, rather than relying solely on our conscience, which might be imperfect.\n\nSimilarly, following laws or religious edicts isn't sufficient, as laws can be bad and religious edicts can vary across different religions.\n\nSo, following nature as our guide seems to be the most reliable path to morality in Cicero's view.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. follow Nature as our guide.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider option A again.\n\nCicero did say that conscience is our guide and that we should listen to it. In \"De Officiis,\" he writes about how conscience helps us make moral decisions. However, he also emphasizes that conscience must be educated and informed by wisdom and knowledge of natural law.\n\nSo, if our conscience is aligned with natural law, then following it would indeed prevent us from going morally astray.\n\nBut there's a risk that our conscience might not be perfectly aligned with natural law, perhaps due to ignorance or prejudice.\n\nIn that case, following nature directly would be more reliable.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the better answer.\n\nOption C, following religious edicts, doesn't fit with Cicero's secular approach to morality. He didn't base his moral philosophy on any particular religion, so that's probably not the right choice.\n\nOption B, following the laws, is important for social order, but Cicero recognized that laws can be unjust, and in such cases, we have a duty to try to change them rather than blindly obey them.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe that Cicero would argue that we will never go morally astray if we follow Nature as our guide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
