Let's consider each option:\n\nA. Volunteering: Many retired people seek volunteer opportunities to stay engaged and give back to their communities. It's a common activity for retirees.\n\nB. Travel: Retirement often allows more free time for travel, so this is another activity frequently associated with retired individuals.\n\nC. Redoing the home: While some retirees might undertake home improvement projects, it's not as universally associated with retirement as volunteering or traveling.\n\nD. Household chores: Retirees have more time at home, so they might spend more time on household chores. However, this might not be as appealing or frequently named as other activities.\n\nComparing these, \"redoing the home\" seems less commonly named as a primary activity for retirees compared to volunteering, traveling, and household chores. Therefore, the answer is likely C. Redoing the home.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
