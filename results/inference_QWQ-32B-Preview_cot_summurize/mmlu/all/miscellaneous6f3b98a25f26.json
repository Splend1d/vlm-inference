Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about all of these, but I think I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, I know that haggis is a Scottish dish. I've heard that it's made from the heart, liver, and lungs of a sheep, mixed with oats and spices, and then stuffed into a sheep's stomach. So, that sounds like it uses internal organs, but specifically from a sheep, not a pig. And it's the stomach that's used as the casing, not the intestines. So, maybe haggis isn't the answer.\n\nNext, chitlins. I've heard of chitlins before, especially in Southern US cuisine. I think they are pig intestines that are cleaned and cooked. Yeah, that sounds right. So, chitlins are pig intestines prepared as a dish. That seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nThen, grits. Grits are a type of porridge made from ground corn, right? I don't think they have anything to do with pig intestines. They're a staple in Southern US cuisine, but entirely plant-based.\n\nLastly, chop suey. I know chop suey is a Chinese-American dish, often consisting of meat and vegetables in a starch sauce, served over rice or noodles. I don't think it includes pig intestines. Maybe in some variations, but it's not known for that.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like chitlins are the dish made from pig intestines. Haggis uses sheep offal and a stomach casing, grits are corn-based, and chop suey is a meat and vegetable dish. Therefore, the answer should be B. chitlins.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Let me think about haggis again. Is there any version of haggis that uses pig intestines? I don't think so. It's traditionally made with sheep or lamb parts. And grits and chop suey seem clearly not related to pig intestines.\n\nChitlins, on the other hand, are specifically pig intestines prepared as a dish. I've even heard that they are sometimes called \"chitterlings.\" So, that reinforces my initial thought.\n\nI think I'm confident with B. chitlins as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
