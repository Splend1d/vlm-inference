                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what afterimage Curtis would see after staring at a yellow star for a minute and then looking at a blank white paper. The options are green, yellow, red, or blue.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an afterimage is. I think it's when you see something even after you've stopped looking at it, like a lingering image. But in this case, it's probably a negative afterimage, which is when you see the complementary color of what you were staring at.\n\nSo, if Curtis was looking at a yellow star, the afterimage should be the complementary color of yellow. Complementary colors are colors that, when added together, make white light. Wait, actually, in color theory, complementary colors are pairs of colors that cancel each other out when combined in certain ways.\n\nLet me think about the color wheel. Opposite yellow on the color wheel is violet or purple, but that's not one of the options. Wait, maybe it's blue? But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about how our eyes get fatigued from staring at one color, and then when we look away, we see the opposite color. That makes sense. So, if he's staring at yellow, his eyes might get tired of yellow, and then when he looks at white paper, he sees the opposite color.\n\nLooking back at the options: green, yellow, red, blue. Yellow is the same as what he was staring at, so that probably wouldn't be the afterimage. Green is similar to yellow, but I think the opposite might be blue or blue-green.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the way colors are processed in the retina. There are cone cells that respond to different colors, and if you stare at a color for a long time, those cells can get fatigued, leading to an afterimage in the complementary color.\n\nSo, for yellow, which is a combination of red and green light, the complementary color would be blue, because blue light is the one not being stimulated when you're seeing yellow.\n\nLet me check that again. Yellow is red plus green, and the primary colors are red, green, and blue. So, if you take red and green, leaving out blue, then the complementary color would be blue.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the afterimage should be blue.\n\nBut wait, I remember that sometimes afterimages can be in complementary colors, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact mechanics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about how the photoreceptors adapt to the stimulus. If you stare at yellow, the photoreceptors sensitive to yellow might adapt and become less responsive, and when you look away, they recover at different rates, leading to an afterimage in the complementary color.\n\nGiven that, and considering that yellow is red plus green, the complementary color would be blue, as it's the color missing from the yellow light.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is blue.\n\nBut let me consider the other options quickly.\n\nGreen is similar to yellow, so that doesn't make sense as an afterimage.\n\nYellow is the same as what he was staring at, so that's unlikely.\n\nRed is one of the components of yellow, but again, not the complementary color.\n\nSo, blue seems to be the best answer.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
