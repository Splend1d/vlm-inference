                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which Jaina group allows only women to lead a life of semi-renunciation. The options are Svetambara, Jina, Agama, and Digambara. I know that Jainism has two main sects: Svetambara and Digambara. Agama seems related to Jain texts, and Jina refers to the spiritual teachers in Jainism. So, probably, the answer is either Svetambara or Digambara.\n\nI recall that Svetambara Jainism allows both men and women to become monks, but Digambara Jainism has different practices regarding renunciation. In Digambara tradition, monks typically do not wear clothes, hence the name \"sky-clad.\" As for nuns, I think in Digambara tradition, nuns are allowed to renounce but with some differences compared to monks.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look up specifically about semi-renunciation in Jainism. I think in Jainism, there are levels of renunciation, with complete renunciation being monastic life, and semi-renunciation being for laypeople who follow Jain principles but still live in society.\n\nBut the question is about leading a life of semi-renunciation, and only women are allowed to lead it in one of these groups. Hmm.\n\nLet me consider Svetambara Jainism first. Svetambaras have both male and female monks, and laypeople of both genders. Maybe in Svetambara tradition, women have more opportunities for semi-renunciation.\n\nOn the other hand, Digambara Jainism is more strict, especially for monks, who don't wear clothes and follow very austere practices. For nuns, I think they do wear clothes, which is a form of semi-renunciation compared to the monks' complete renunciation.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is Digambara, because in that tradition, only women are allowed to lead a life of semi-renunciation, meaning nuns who wear clothes, while monks must be completely renounced and naked.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should look up the differences between Svetambara and Digambara Jainism regarding gender and renunciation.\n\nOkay, I remember that in Svetambara Jainism, both men and women can be fully renounced monks, wearing white clothes. While in Digambara Jainism, monks do not wear any clothes, and nuns do wear clothes.\n\nSo, in Digambara tradition, only women are allowed to lead a life of semi-renunciation, meaning wearing clothes, while men must be fully renounced and naked.\n\nThat seems plausible. So, perhaps the answer is Digambara.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if \"semi-renunciation\" specifically refers to wearing clothes in Jainism.\n\nYes, in Digambara tradition, monks who wear no clothes are considered fully renounced, while nuns who wear clothes are in a semi-renounced state.\n\nTherefore, only women are allowed to lead a life of semi-renunciation in Digambara Jainism, since men must be fully renounced and naked.\n\nSo, the answer should be Digambara, which is option D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe in Svetambara Jainism, there is a different practice.\n\nIn Svetambara Jainism, both monks and nuns wear white clothes, so there might not be a distinction based on gender in terms of renunciation.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that Digambara is the correct answer.\n\nYes, I think D. Digambara is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
