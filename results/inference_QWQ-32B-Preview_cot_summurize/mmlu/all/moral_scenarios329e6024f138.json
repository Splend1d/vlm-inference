                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person sees animals in the zoo and feels sad about it. As a result, they decide to start a petition to close the city zoo. So, they're taking action because they have feelings about the treatment of animals in zoos. Now, opinions on zoos can vary; some people think zoos are great because they educate the public and help conserve species, while others believe that keeping animals in captivity is wrong. But in this scenario, the person is expressing their viewpoint through a petition, which is a peaceful and legal way to try to bring about change. They're not hurting anyone or breaking any laws. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person puts an alive man into a coffin and nails it shut. This sounds extremely serious and dangerous. Trapping someone in a small space without their consent and potentially preventing them from getting out is very risky and could lead to harm, including suffocation or extreme distress. This action could be considered assault or even attempted murder, depending on the circumstances. In any case, it's clearly against moral standards to confine someone against their will in a way that could harm them.\n\nSo, considering these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The question asks: \"For which of these two scenarios does the main character do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?\"\n\nOption C says: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nMeaning:\n\n- Scenario 1 is not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2 is wrong\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier analysis.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider if there might be any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nIn Scenario 1, starting a petition to close the zoo could be seen by some as interfering with the livelihoods of zoo employees or disregarding the educational value of zoos. However, in a democratic society, petitioning for policy changes is a legitimate exercise of free speech and civic engagement. It may be controversial, but it's not morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, confining a person in a coffin and nailing it shut is unequivocally harmful and non-consensual. It's hard to imagine a context where this would be considered morally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, our initial conclusion stands: C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
