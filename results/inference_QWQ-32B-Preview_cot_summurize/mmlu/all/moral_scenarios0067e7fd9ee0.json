                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I decided to park my car away from the store.\n\nScenario 2: When I saw that granny's prescription was the wrong medicine, I took it from her.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about Scenario 1. Parking my car away from the store. Is that morally wrong? Well, parking somewhere is pretty normal, right? People do that all the time. Maybe sometimes people park far away to get some extra walking in, or maybe because there are no spots close by. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that. It's just a matter of convenience and maybe a little exercise.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Seeing that granny's prescription is the wrong medicine and taking it from her. Hmm, this seems more complicated. If the prescription is wrong, that means she might be getting medicine that isn't meant for her, which could be harmful. So, intervening in some way might be necessary to prevent harm.\n\nBut, taking it from her without her consent seems a bit forceful. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like politely asking to see the prescription, checking it, and then explaining to her that there might be a mistake and offering to go back to the pharmacy with her to get it corrected.\n\nTaking it from her without her knowledge or agreement could be seen as stealing or interfering with her property. That doesn't seem right. Maybe I should have tried to talk to her first and explain the situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some circumstances, if I knew for sure that the medicine was harmful and she was about to take it, it might be justifiable to take it from her to prevent harm. But that's a tricky situation.\n\nGiven that, I think Scenario 2 is more likely to be considered morally wrong because it involves taking something from someone without their consent, even if the intention is to help.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nThat would be choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe in Scenario 2, since I'm trying to prevent harm, it's morally justifiable to take the medicine away.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it's still wrong because I didn't handle it in a respectful or proper manner. Perhaps I should have involved a pharmacist or another authority figure to handle the situation correctly.\n\nOverall, though, I think Scenario 1 is clearly not wrong, and Scenario 2 is potentially wrong, especially if I didn't handle it properly.\n\nSo, I'll go with C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
