The options are Franks, Visigoths, Russians, and Anglo-Saxons. I need to figure out which one of these was converted during that time by the Byzantines.\n\nFirst, I should recall when each of these groups was Christianized. Let's start with the Franks. I think the Franks were converted to Christianity much earlier, around the time of Clovis in the late fifth century. So that's way before the tenth century.\n\nNext, the Visigoths. I believe they were Arian Christians initially, but they converted to Nicene Christianity in the sixth century at the Council of Toledo. Again, that's earlier than the tenth century.\n\nNow, the Anglo-Saxons. I think they were converted to Christianity in the seventh century, with missionaries like Augustine of Canterbury sent by Pope Gregory the Great. So again, that's before the tenth century.\n\nThat leaves the Russians. I seem to remember something about the Rus' being converted in the tenth century. Let me think about that. I believe it was Prince Vladimir of Kiev who adopted Christianity for his realm around 988 C.E. And I think this conversion was influenced by the Byzantine Empire, possibly through marriage alliances or other diplomatic relations.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that the Byzantine Empire was known for its missionary activities, especially among neighboring peoples. The conversion of the Bulgars and the Serbs were also facilitated by Byzantine missionaries earlier in the ninth and tenth centuries.\n\nSo, if Prince Vladimir adopted Christianity in 988, that fits within the tenth century. And given the cultural and political ties between Kievan Rus' and the Byzantine Empire, it makes sense that Byzantine missionaries would have played a role in this conversion.\n\nLet me double-check the dates to make sure. The tenth century spans from 901 to 1000 C.E., and 988 falls within that period. So timing-wise, it checks out.\n\nComparing this with the other options, which were all Christianized earlier, the Russians seem to be the group that matches the criteria of being converted in the tenth century by Byzantine missionaries.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Russians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
