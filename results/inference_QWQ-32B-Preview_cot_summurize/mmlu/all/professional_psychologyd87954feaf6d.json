                    "text": "This question is about understanding conflicts within an immigrant family, specifically between a mother and her adolescent child. The options provided offer different perspectives on what might be causing these conflicts. Let's break down each option to see which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A suggests that the conflict is due to \"adolescent strivings for independence.\" This is a common phase in every adolescent's life, where they seek to establish their own identity and autonomy. However, in the context of an immigrant family, this might be exacerbated by cultural differences or the parents' own struggles with adjustment, making this a plausible choice.\n\nOption B proposes \"their differential rates of adjustment to the new environment.\" This seems particularly relevant in an immigrant family context. Different family members might adjust to the new culture at different paces, leading to friction. For example, the adolescent might assimilate more quickly than the mother, leading to conflicts over values and behaviors.\n\nOption C mentions \"the enmeshment that is typical of families that have left their native land.\" Enmeshment refers to a lack of boundaries between family members, where individual identities are not clearly differentiated. While this might be more common in some immigrant families due to the need for support in a new environment, it's not necessarily the primary cause of conflict between a mother and an adolescent child.\n\nOption D attributes the conflict to \"the psychopathology resulting from the stresses of the immigration experience.\" While immigration can indeed be stressful and lead to psychological issues, blaming the conflict solely on psychopathology might be too broad and doesn't specifically address the mother-child relationship dynamics.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most directly related to the immigrant experience. The differing rates at which family members adjust to the new environment can create significant tensions, especially between parents and adolescents who might be adapting at different speeds. Therefore, I would choose option B as the most likely reason for serious conflict in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
