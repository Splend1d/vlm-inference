I think CPI has something to do with it, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I know that inflation is about the general increase in prices over time. So, the government needs a way to track how much prices are rising for goods and services. That's probably what this question is getting at.\n\nLet me look up what each of these terms stands for.\n\nGNP is Gross National Product. I think that's the total value of goods and services produced by a country's citizens, including those produced abroad. So, it's a measure of economic output, but I'm not sure if it directly measures inflation.\n\nURL, well, that's usually stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which is basically a web address. That doesn't seem relevant here. Maybe it's a typo or something.\n\nCPI is Consumer Price Index. I've heard of this before in relation to inflation. I think it's a measure that looks at the average prices of a basket of goods and services that a typical consumer buys. By tracking changes in this index over time, it can show how much prices are increasing, which is inflation.\n\nFED is probably the Federal Reserve, which is the central banking system of the United States. While the Fed does monitor and try to control inflation, I don't think \"FED\" refers to a specific inflation measurement tool.\n\nSo, between these options, CPI seems like the most appropriate choice for measuring inflation.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should look up what government agencies say about inflation measures. I recall that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is responsible for calculating the CPI. They regularly release CPI data, which is used to track inflation.\n\nAlso, there's something called the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures inflation from the perspective of the seller, but that's not one of the options here.\n\nI think the other options don't directly measure inflation. GNP is more about economic output, URL is unrelated, and FED is an institution rather than a measurement tool.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be CPI, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
