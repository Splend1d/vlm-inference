It represents what you give up to pursue another option. For example, if you choose to spend your time and money on going to a movie, the opportunity cost would be the time and money you could have used for other activities or purchases.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Capital: In economics, capital refers to financial assets or the wealth used to produce goods and services. It doesn't relate to what you give up when making a choice.\n\nB. Land: Land is a factor of production, referring to natural resources and space. It's not related to the concept of giving something up to pursue another alternative.\n\nC. Money cost: This refers to the monetary expense incurred in pursuing an alternative. While it is a part of the opportunity cost, opportunity cost is broader and includes non-monetary sacrifices as well.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. opportunity cost."
