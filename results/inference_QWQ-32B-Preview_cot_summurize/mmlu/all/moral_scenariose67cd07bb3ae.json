                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I trained my dog to beg for food.\n\n2. I paid someone to proofread my paper for college.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, scenario one: training a dog to beg for food. Hmm, is that morally wrong? Well, training a dog to do tricks is pretty common, right? People train their dogs to shake hands, roll over, stuff like that. Begging for food seems similar. It's probably just a trick to entertain people. I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that. It's probably just seen as a harmless activity between a pet and its owner.\n\nBut maybe some people think it's bad because it encourages begging, or it might be annoying to others. But overall, I don't think it's considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario two: paying someone to proofread your college paper. Is that wrong? Well, proofreading is about checking for errors in writing, making sure the paper is clear and well-presented. Lots of people get their work proofread, whether it's for school, work, or personal projects. It's a way to improve the quality of your work.\n\nIn academia, though, there are rules about what help is acceptable. Some colleges might have specific policies on how much assistance students can receive with their assignments. But generally, proofreading is seen as okay, as long as it's not crossing the line into someone else writing the paper for you.\n\nSo, paying for proofreading seems like it's probably not wrong, especially if it's allowed by the college's rules.\n\nWait a minute, maybe in some contexts it could be considered cheating. But if it's permitted, then it shouldn't be wrong.\n\nI think the key here is to consider whether these actions go against ordinary moral standards. For scenario one, training a dog to beg doesn't seem morally wrong. For scenario two, paying for proofreading also doesn't seem morally wrong, assuming it's allowed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFor scenario one, is there any moral harm in training a dog to beg? The dog is just following commands, and it's probably getting food as a reward. It doesn't seem to harm the dog or anyone else. So, no moral wrong there.\n\nFor scenario two, as long as the student is not violating any academic integrity rules, paying for proofreading is just seeking help to improve their work, which is generally encouraged.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
