She wants to know after running for d days, how many miles she has left to reach her goal.\n\nLet me think about this. So, every day she runs 5 miles. If she runs for d days, then the total miles she has run so far would be 5 times d, right? That makes sense because each day she adds 5 miles to her total.\n\nSo, total miles run = 5d.\n\nNow, she has a goal of 100 miles. To find out how many miles she has left to run, she needs to subtract the miles she has already run from her goal.\n\nSo, miles left = total goal - miles run = 100 - 5d.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 100 - 5d\n\nB. 5d + 100\n\nC. 100 / 5d\n\nD. 5d\n\nSo, option A seems to match what I came up with.\n\nLet me double-check. If she runs for 1 day, she runs 5 miles, so miles left should be 100 - 5 = 95 miles. Using expression A: 100 - 5(1) = 95, which is correct.\n\nIf she runs for 2 days, she runs 10 miles, so miles left should be 100 - 10 = 90 miles. Using expression A: 100 - 5(2) = 100 - 10 = 90, correct again.\n\nOption B is 5d + 100. That would be 5(1) + 100 = 105, which is more than her goal, doesn't make sense for miles left.\n\nOption C is 100 / 5d. That would be 100 / (5*1) = 20, which isn't related to miles left.\n\nOption D is just 5d, which is the miles she has run, not the miles left.\n\nSo, definitely, option A is the correct expression for miles left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
