                    "text": "So Kerri ran four races with times of 18.04, 21.39, 12.99, and 14.14 seconds. We need to round each time to the nearest tenth of a second and then add them up to estimate the total time. The options are A. 66.6 seconds, B. 66.5 seconds, C. 66 seconds, and D. 65.5 seconds.\n\nFirst, I need to round each time to the nearest tenth. Let's do that one by one.\n\nStarting with 18.04 seconds. The tenths place is 0, and the hundredths place is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down, so 18.04 rounds to 18.0 seconds.\n\nNext, 21.39 seconds. The tenths place is 3, and the hundredths place is 9. Since 9 is 5 or greater, we round up, so 21.39 rounds to 21.4 seconds.\n\nNow, 12.99 seconds. The tenths place is 9, and the hundredths place is 9. Again, since 9 is 5 or greater, we round up. But rounding 9 up to 10 means that the whole number part increases by 1. So 12.99 rounds to 13.0 seconds.\n\nLastly, 14.14 seconds. The tenths place is 1, and the hundredths place is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down, so 14.14 rounds to 14.1 seconds.\n\nNow, I need to add these rounded times together: 18.0 + 21.4 + 13.0 + 14.1.\n\nLet's add them step by step.\n\nFirst, 18.0 + 21.4 = 39.4 seconds.\n\nThen, 39.4 + 13.0 = 52.4 seconds.\n\nFinally, 52.4 + 14.1 = 66.5 seconds.\n\nSo, the estimated total time is 66.5 seconds.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 66.5 seconds matches our calculation.\n\nBut wait, option C is 66 seconds, which is close, but not the same as 66.5. So, I need to make sure if 66.5 is the correct estimate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the total rounded to the nearest tenth again after summing, but I don't think that's necessary since we already rounded each time before adding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to estimate the total time.\n\nLet me try adding the original times without rounding to see how close 66.5 is to the actual total.\n\nSo, 18.04 + 21.39 + 12.99 + 14.14.\n\nAdding them step by step:\n\n18.04 + 21.39 = 39.43\n\n39.43 + 12.99 = 52.42\n\n52.42 + 14.14 = 66.56 seconds.\n\nSo, the actual total time is 66.56 seconds.\n\nRounding 66.56 to the nearest tenth would be 66.6 seconds, which is option A.\n\nBut earlier, when we rounded each time individually and then summed, we got 66.5 seconds.\n\nThere's a slight discrepancy here.\n\nI think the question specifies to round each individual time to the nearest tenth and then sum them up.\n\nFollowing that procedure, we get 66.5 seconds, which matches option B.\n\nHowever, if we add the original times first and then round to the nearest tenth, we get 66.6 seconds, which is option A.\n\nBut according to the question, we should round each time individually first and then sum them.\n\nTherefore, the correct estimate is 66.5 seconds.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 66.5 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
