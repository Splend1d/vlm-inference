                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about neuroticism increasing later in life and what it strongly predicts. So, neuroticism is one of the big five personality traits, right? It's associated with negative emotions like anxiety, worry, moodiness, and irritability.\n\nAs people age, some studies suggest that personality traits can change. Maybe neuroticism increases in some individuals as they get older. Now, the question is asking what this increase predicts.\n\nOption A is mortality. So, does an increase in neuroticism predict earlier death? Hmm, it's possible. Chronic stress and negative emotions are linked to poorer physical health, which could lead to earlier mortality. But I'm not sure if there's direct evidence for that.\n\nOption B is loss of social support. Could be. If someone becomes more neurotic, they might withdraw from social activities or have difficulties maintaining relationships, leading to a loss of social support.\n\nOption C is cognitive decline. There is some research suggesting a link between neuroticism and cognitive function. Higher neuroticism has been associated with a greater risk of dementia in some studies. So, perhaps an increase in neuroticism could predict cognitive decline.\n\nOption D is independence. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe if someone becomes more neurotic, they might rely more on others for support, thus reducing their independence. Or maybe not. It's a bit unclear.\n\nLet me think again. The question specifies that an increase in neuroticism later in life is a strong predictor of... So, it's not just having high neuroticism, but an increase in it over time.\n\nI recall that personality changes in older adults can have significant implications for their well-being. An increase in neuroticism might indicate underlying psychological or physiological changes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- Mortality: There is evidence that psychological factors can influence longevity.\n\n- Loss of social support: Personality changes can affect social relationships.\n\n- Cognitive decline: There are associations between personality traits and cognitive health.\n\n- Independence: This could be affected by both physical and mental health, which might be influenced by personality traits.\n\nAmong these, I think cognitive decline might be the strongest prediction of an increase in neuroticism later in life. There are studies suggesting that higher neuroticism is a risk factor for dementia and other cognitive impairments.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider each option more carefully.\n\nFirst, mortality: While chronic stress and negative emotions can impair immune function and overall health, leading to earlier death, I'm not sure if the increase in neuroticism specifically predicts mortality independently of other factors.\n\nSecond, loss of social support: It's plausible that becoming more neurotic could lead to social withdrawal or difficulties in maintaining relationships, which could result in losing social support. However, it's also possible that loss of social support could lead to increased neuroticism, so the direction of causality might not be clear.\n\nThird, cognitive decline: As I mentioned, there is research linking neuroticism to cognitive decline. For example, higher neuroticism has been associated with a greater risk of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.\n\nFourth, independence: This is a bit vague. Independence could refer to physical independence, like being able to perform daily activities, or emotional independence, like not relying on others for emotional support. An increase in neuroticism might affect both, but it's not as directly linked as cognitive decline.\n\nConsidering all this, I think cognitive decline is the strongest prediction of an increase in neuroticism later in life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
