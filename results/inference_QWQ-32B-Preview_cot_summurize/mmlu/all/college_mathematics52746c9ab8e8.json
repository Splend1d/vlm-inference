                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an upside-down cone with a height of 2 cm and a radius of 1 cm at the vertex. Water is dripping out at a rate of 3 cm\u00b3 per minute, and we need to find the rate at which the height of the water changes when the water level is half a centimeter below the top of the cone. That means the water depth is 1.5 cm (since the cone's height is 2 cm and the water level is 0.5 cm below the top).\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cone: V = (\u03c0/3) * r\u00b2 * h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height.\n\nHowever, in this problem, both the radius and height of the water level are changing as the water drips out. So, I need to find a relationship between r and h to express the volume in terms of one variable.\n\nGiven that the cone is similar at all points, the ratio of radius to height remains constant. The original cone has a height of 2 cm and a radius of 1 cm, so the ratio is r/h = 1/2. Therefore, r = (1/2)h.\n\nNow, substitute r in terms of h into the volume formula:\n\nV = (\u03c0/3) * ( (1/2)h )\u00b2 * h = (\u03c0/3) * (1/4)h\u00b2 * h = (\u03c0/3) * (1/4)h\u00b3 = (\u03c0/12) h\u00b3.\n\nSo, V = (\u03c0/12) h\u00b3.\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of change of height with respect to time, dh/dt, when h = 1.5 cm, given that dV/dt = -3 cm\u00b3/min (negative because the volume is decreasing).\n\nDifferentiate both sides of the volume equation with respect to time t:\n\ndV/dt = (\u03c0/12) * 3h\u00b2 * dh/dt = (\u03c0/4) h\u00b2 dh/dt.\n\nNow, plug in the known values:\n\n-3 = (\u03c0/4) * (1.5)\u00b2 * dh/dt.\n\nCalculate (1.5)\u00b2 = 2.25.\n\nSo, -3 = (\u03c0/4) * 2.25 * dh/dt.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-3 = (2.25\u03c0/4) dh/dt.\n\nNow, solve for dh/dt:\n\ndh/dt = -3 / (2.25\u03c0/4) = -3 * 4 / (2.25\u03c0) = -12 / (2.25\u03c0).\n\nSimplify 12 / 2.25:\n\n12 \u00f7 2.25 = 12 \u00f7 (9/4) = 12 * (4/9) = 48/9 = 16/3.\n\nTherefore, dh/dt = -16/(3\u03c0) cm/min.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. -16/(3\u03c0) cm/min.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-\\dfrac{16}{3\\pi} \\text{ cm/min}} \\]"
