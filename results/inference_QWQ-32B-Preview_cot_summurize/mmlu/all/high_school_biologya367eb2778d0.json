                    "text": "Let's go through each option to determine which statement is NOT true.\n\nOption A: Thyroxine increases the rate of metabolism.\n\nThyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland. It plays a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolic rate. When thyroxine levels are high, the body's metabolism increases, leading to higher energy consumption and heat production. So, this statement is true.\n\nOption B: Insulin decreases storage of glycogen.\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate glucose levels in the blood. One of its functions is to promote the storage of glucose as glycogen in liver and muscle cells. Therefore, insulin actually increases glycogen storage, not decreases it. This suggests that statement B is false.\n\nOption C: Vasopressin stimulates water reabsorption in the kidney.\n\nVasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is produced by the pituitary gland. Its primary function is to regulate water balance in the body by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. This helps concentrate the urine and reduce fluid loss. So, this statement is true.\n\nOption D: Epinephrine increases blood sugar levels and heart rate.\n\nEpinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and neurotransmitter secreted by the adrenal glands. It is released in response to stress or danger and prepares the body for a \"fight or flight\" response. Part of this response includes increasing blood sugar levels by stimulating glycogenolysis in the liver and increasing heart rate to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery to muscles. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nGiven the analysis above, the statement that is NOT true is option B: insulin decreases storage of glycogen. In reality, insulin promotes glycogen storage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
