                    "text": "So I have this question about calculating the required rate of return for two different stocks using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM for short. The stocks are A and B, with betas of 0.8 and 1.4, respectively. The expected return on the market is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 7%. I need to find out what the required rate of return is for each stock and choose the correct option from A to D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the CAPM formula is. I think it's something like:\n\nRequired return = Risk-free rate + Beta * (Market return - Risk-free rate)\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, the formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return} = R_f + \\beta \\times (R_m - R_f) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate,\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the stock,\n\n- \\( R_m \\) is the expected return on the market.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the values for each stock.\n\nLet's start with Stock A, which has a beta of 0.8.\n\nSo, for Stock A:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_A = 7\\% + 0.8 \\times (10\\% - 7\\%) \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the market risk premium, which is \\( R_m - R_f = 10\\% - 7\\% = 3\\% \\).\n\nThen, multiply that by the beta of Stock A: \\( 0.8 \\times 3\\% = 2.4\\% \\).\n\nFinally, add that to the risk-free rate: \\( 7\\% + 2.4\\% = 9.4\\% \\).\n\nSo, the required return for Stock A is 9.4%.\n\nNow, for Stock B, which has a beta of 1.4.\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_B = 7\\% + 1.4 \\times (10\\% - 7\\%) \\]\n\nAgain, the market risk premium is 3%.\n\nMultiply by the beta of Stock B: \\( 1.4 \\times 3\\% = 4.2\\% \\).\n\nAdd that to the risk-free rate: \\( 7\\% + 4.2\\% = 11.2\\% \\).\n\nSo, the required return for Stock B is 11.2%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A says 9.4% and 11.2%, which matches what I just calculated.\n\nBut let me double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nFirst, the CAPM formula seems right.\n\nI plugged in the risk-free rate correctly as 7%.\n\nThe market return is 10%.\n\nThe betas are 0.8 and 1.4 for stocks A and B, respectively.\n\nCalculations for Stock A:\n\n7% + 0.8 * (10% - 7%) = 7% + 0.8 * 3% = 7% + 2.4% = 9.4%.\n\nFor Stock B:\n\n7% + 1.4 * (10% - 7%) = 7% + 1.4 * 3% = 7% + 4.2% = 11.2%.\n\nSeems solid. I don't see any errors in the calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the information.\n\nIs there any possibility that the market return or the risk-free rate might need to be adjusted? Doesn't seem so; the question provides them directly.\n\nAlso, ensure that the betas are correctly associated with each stock. Stock A: 0.8, Stock B: 1.4. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the returns are expressed in decimals or percentages. In the formula, it's common to use percentages as I did, but sometimes people use decimals (e.g., 0.07 for 7%). But as long as consistent units are used, the result should be the same. I'll stick with percentages for simplicity.\n\nLet me quickly do the calculation using decimals to confirm.\n\nFor Stock A:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_A = 0.07 + 0.8 \\times (0.10 - 0.07) = 0.07 + 0.8 \\times 0.03 = 0.07 + 0.024 = 0.094 \\text{ or } 9.4\\% \\]\n\nFor Stock B:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_B = 0.07 + 1.4 \\times (0.10 - 0.07) = 0.07 + 1.4 \\times 0.03 = 0.07 + 0.042 = 0.112 \\text{ or } 11.2\\% \\]\n\nSame results as before. So, no issues there.\n\nNow, looking at the other options to see why they might be incorrect.\n\nOption B: -2.6% and 4.9%. Negative return for Stock A doesn't make sense in this context, especially since the risk-free rate is 7%, and betas are positive.\n\nOption C: 4.3% and 7.4%. These are lower than my calculations, and given the betas and market conditions, they seem too low.\n\nOption D: 6.4% and 10.5%. Again, these don't match my calculations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: 9.4% and 11.2%.\n\nI think that's the right call. CAPM is a straightforward formula, and as long as the inputs are correctly plugged in, the calculations are straightforward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
