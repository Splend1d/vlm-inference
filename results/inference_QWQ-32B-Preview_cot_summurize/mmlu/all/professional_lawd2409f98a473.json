                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out if the plaintiff's testimony is admissible in court. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the plaintiff is a management trainee who was wrongfully terminated, and she's suing for sex discrimination. She wants to testify that a janitor at the company told her something about her supervisor's comments to other male coworkers. Specifically, the janitor said he heard the supervisor say, \"Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether this testimony is admissible. The options are:\n\nA. No, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception.\n\nB. No, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are hearsay not within any exception.\n\nC. Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nD. Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n\nOkay, so hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nSo, let's identify the statements in question:\n\n1. The janitor's statement to the plaintiff: \"I heard her supervisor say to other male coworkers about her, 'Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.'\"\n\n2. The supervisor's statement to the male coworkers: \"Make it hard for her. Maybe she'll go home where she belongs.\"\n\nNow, is the plaintiff offering these statements to prove the truth of what was said? Yes, she's trying to show that the supervisor had a discriminatory attitude and perhaps acted on it by terminating her employment.\n\nSo, both statements are hearsay unless they fall under an exception.\n\nOption A says no, because the janitor's statement is hearsay not within any exception. Option B says no, because both statements are hearsay not within any exception. Options C and D say yes, and provide exceptions for admissibility.\n\nLet's look at option C first: Yes, because the janitor's statement is a present sense impression, and the supervisor's statement is a statement of his then-existing state of mind.\n\nPresent sense impression is an exception to the hearsay rule. It allows for the admission of a statement describing or explaining an event or condition made while the declarant was perceiving the event or immediately thereafter.\n\nSo, if the janitor made this statement to the plaintiff right after he heard the supervisor say something, it could qualify as a present sense impression. But we don't have information about when the janitor made this statement to the plaintiff\u2014whether it was immediately after hearing the supervisor or sometime later. If it was made shortly after hearing the supervisor, then it might be admissible under this exception.\n\nAs for the supervisor's statement, it's being relayed through the janitor's testimony. Statements of a person's then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition are exceptions to the hearsay rule, but typically, these are admissible only if they're made by the person themselves, not through someone else.\n\nHowever, in this case, the supervisor's statement is being relayed by the janitor, so it's still hearsay within hearsay. For this to be admissible, both layers of hearsay need to be covered by exceptions.\n\nOption D says yes, because both statements are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n\nThis seems to be referring to the doctrine of statements made by employees within the scope of their employment, which are admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule under the \"statements by agents concerning their agency\" exception.\n\nIn federal courts, this is covered under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2), which provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is a statement by an agent or servant concerning a matter within the scope of the agency or employment, made during the existence of the relationship.\n\nSo, if the supervisor made the statement within the scope of his employment, and the janitor relayed it, both statements might be admissible under this exception.\n\nBut again, we have to consider that the supervisor's statement is being relayed by the janitor, so it's hearsay within hearsay. For the janitor's statement to be admissible, it needs its own independent exception, or the supervisor's statement must be admissible under some exception.\n\nWait, under Rule 801(d)(2), the supervisor's statement would be admissible as a statement by an agent of the employer, especially in a lawsuit between the plaintiff and the employer.\n\nAs for the janitor's statement, is that also admissible under the same exception? The janitor is also an employee, and the statement concerns the supervisor's conduct within the scope of employment.\n\nSo, perhaps both statements fall under this exception.\n\nOption C mentioned the janitor's statement being a present sense impression, which might be one way to make it admissible, but option D suggests a different basis for admissibility.\n\nI need to think about which option is more comprehensive and accurate.\n\nGiven that this is a legal scenario, and considering the Federal Rules of Evidence, option D seems more appropriate because it directly addresses the employment context and the relationship between the speaker and the party.\n\nIn discrimination cases, statements made by employees within the scope of their employment are often admissible to show the employer's knowledge or the atmosphere of discrimination.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer: Yes, because the statements of both the janitor and the supervisor are statements concerning a matter within the scope of their employment.\n\nThis would allow both statements to be admissible under the statements by agents exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nOption C is also partially correct, as the janitor's statement could be a present sense impression, but it might not cover the supervisor's statement adequately.\n\nMoreover, in legal practice, statements made by employees within the scope of their employment are commonly admitted under Rule 801(d)(2), making option D the better choice.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
