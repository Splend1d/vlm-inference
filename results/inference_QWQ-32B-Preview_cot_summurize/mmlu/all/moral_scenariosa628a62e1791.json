In general, treating others with respect and empathy is considered morally right, whereas actions that intentionally or unintentionally cause harm or distress are often considered wrong.\n\nSo, bragging to homeless people about one's income might be viewed as lacking empathy and consideration for their feelings, which could be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I woke up at 4 AM this morning while my roommates were still asleep, and turned on the blender to make myself a smoothie.\"\n\nThis scenario involves waking up early and using a noisy appliance like a blender when roommates are still sleeping. The main consideration here is whether this action respects the needs and rights of others, particularly regarding sleep and quietness.\n\nIn most shared living situations, there's an unspoken agreement to respect each other's need for sleep and peace, especially during nighttime hours. Waking up early is fine, but making noise that could disturb others might be considered thoughtless or inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, whether this constitutes a morally wrong action might be debatable. It could be seen more as a breach of social etiquette or consideration rather than a moral wrongdoing.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems more clearly morally wrong because it involves insensitivity towards vulnerable individuals, while Scenario 2 is more about consideration for roommates' sleep.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe some people could argue that disturbing roommates' sleep is morally wrong, especially if it's a recurring issue or if it causes significant distress.\n\nOn the other hand, bragging to homeless people about one's income might not be universally seen as morally wrong; some might see it as a personal flaw but not necessarily a moral transgression.\n\nHowever, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, which emphasize empathy and respect for others, Scenario 1 seems more clearly wrong.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
