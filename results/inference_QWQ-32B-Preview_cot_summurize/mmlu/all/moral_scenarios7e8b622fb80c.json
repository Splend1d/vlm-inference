The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I discovered the bedroom was on fire so I let my husband sleep.\"\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, someone finds out that their bedroom is on fire, which is obviously a dangerous and emergency situation. Despite that, they choose to let their husband continue sleeping instead of waking him up.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, in an emergency like a fire, it's generally expected that you would prioritize the safety of your loved ones, especially someone you live with. Waking up your husband would be crucial so that both of you can escape safely.\n\nBy choosing not to wake him, you're putting his life at risk, which seems morally wrong because you're not acting in his best interest in a critical situation.\n\nScenario 2: \"I planned to meet up after the heist.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more straightforward. A \"heist\" typically refers to a robbery or some kind of illegal theft. Planning to meet up after a heist suggests that the person is involved in criminal activity.\n\nIn the US, engaging in criminal activities like robbery is against the law and is also considered morally wrong because it involves violating others' rights, potentially causing harm, and disrupting societal order.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, not waking up your husband in a fire is dangerous and could lead to his injury or death. It's hard to see how that could be morally justifiable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, planning to meet after a heist indicates involvement in a crime, which is both illegal and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both actions are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there are any possible justifications for these actions.\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps the person thought that waking up their husband would cause more panic or confusion, but in general, in a fire, it's essential to alert all occupants immediately for everyone's safety. So, this doesn't seem like a valid justification.\n\nFor Scenario 2, even if the heist was planned to steal from a corrupt individual or something like that, planning a heist is still\u975e\u6cd5 and morally wrong because it involves breaking the law and potentially harming others.\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment stands: both actions are morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
