                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about who argued that if an organization didn't affect a public, there was no need for a practitioner to consider that public in its communications. The options are Cutlip (2006), Leitch and Neilson (2001), Amaral and Phillips (2010), and Grunig and Hunt (1984). I need to figure out which of these authors or pairs of authors made that specific argument.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or look up what each of these sources said about public relations and publics. Let's start with Grunig and Hunt (1984). I remember that they are well-known for their work on models of public relations, particularly the four models: press agentry, public information, two-way asymmetric, and two-way symmetric. But I'm not sure if they specifically addressed the idea of only considering publics that an organization affects.\n\nNext, Cutlip (2006). Cutlip is a prominent figure in public relations history, and his book \"Effective Public Relations\" is a classic. I think in that book, he discusses the importance of understanding and communicating with various publics. However, I don't recall him specifically stating that if an organization doesn't affect a public, there's no need to consider them.\n\nLeitch and Neilson (2001). I'm not as familiar with this source. Maybe they wrote an article or a book where they discussed public relations practices and the consideration of publics. I should look that up.\n\nAmaral and Phillips (2010). Again, I'm not sure about this reference. It might be from a more recent publication, and they could have presented arguments about targeting publics based on the organization's impact on them.\n\nLet me try to think differently. The statement suggests that practitioners only need to consider publics that the organization affects. This seems related to the concept of publics in public relations theory. Traditionally, publics are defined as groups that have a relationship with the organization, either because they are affected by the organization's actions or because they can affect the organization.\n\nSo, the argument that if an organization doesn't affect a public, there's no need to consider them in communications seems to be narrowing down the definition of publics to only those who are directly impacted by the organization.\n\nI think Grunig and Hunt (1984) might have addressed this in their exposition of the symmetric model, where they emphasize mutual benefit and two-way communication with publics. But I'm not sure if they specifically said that unaffected publics don't need to be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Cutlip (2006) took a more pragmatic approach, suggesting that resources are\u6709\u9650\u7684, and therefore practitioners should focus on publics that the organization directly affects.\n\nWait a minute, maybe it's Leitch and Neilson (2001). I recall that they might have discussed issues related to publics and organizational impact in their work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Amaral and Phillips (2010) presented a framework where only affected publics are considered in communication strategies.\n\nTo answer this question accurately, I might need to refer back to these sources or find summaries of their arguments.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing knowledge of the concept of \"affected publics\" in public relations theory.\n\nIn that case, Grunig and Hunt (1984) are often associated with the idea of publics being those who are affected by or can affect the organization. Their two-way symmetric model emphasizes understanding and addressing the needs and concerns of these publics.\n\nHowever, the specific statement that if an organization doesn't affect a public, there's no need to consider them seems a bit different. It sounds like a more utilitarian approach, where communication efforts are focused only on those publics that the organization impacts.\n\nI think Cutlip (2006) might have taken that approach, considering his emphasis on public relations as a management function that manages communications with key publics to achieve organizational goals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Leitch and Neilson (2001) argued that way.\n\nGiven that, I'm going to take an educated guess that it's Cutlip (2006) who made that argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
