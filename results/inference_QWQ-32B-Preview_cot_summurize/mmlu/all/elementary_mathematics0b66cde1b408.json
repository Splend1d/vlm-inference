I need to remember the order of operations: parentheses first, then exponents, multiplication and division from left to right, and finally addition and subtraction from left to right. This is often abbreviated as PEMDAS.\n\nSo, starting inside the parentheses, I see 4\u00b2 + 1. I need to calculate 4 squared first because exponents come before addition.\n\n4\u00b2 is 16, so 16 + 1 is 17.\n\nNow the expression looks like 2(3(17)) - 2\u00b3.\n\nNext, I need to handle the multiplication inside the parentheses. 3 times 17 is 51.\n\nSo now it's 2(51) - 2\u00b3.\n\nNext, I need to calculate 2 cubed. 2\u00b3 is 8.\n\nNow the expression is 2(51) - 8.\n\nNext, I do the multiplication: 2 times 51 is 102.\n\nSo now it's 102 - 8.\n\nFinally, subtract 8 from 102, which is 94.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is 94.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 156\n\nB. 110\n\nC. 94\n\nD. 48\n\nThe correct answer is C. 94.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{94} \\]"
