Winning a game is generally considered acceptable and even desirable. There's nothing morally wrong with being excited about winning a game, especially if it's been a long time coming.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character undresses, showers, towels themselves dry, and then walks out of their door naked down the middle of Main Street. This behavior is clearly inappropriate and against social norms. Walking around naked in public is generally considered indecent exposure, which is illegal in many places and is morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
