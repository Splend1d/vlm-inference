The options are:\n\nA. deducing it from self-evident premises.\n\nB. direct acquaintance via moral intuition.\n\nC. the mutual support of many considerations, which it fits into one coherent view.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which one Rawls would agree with. I remember that Rawls talked about the idea of overlapping consensus and the veil of ignorance, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to justifying a conception of justice.\n\nOption A says deducing it from self-evident premises. That sounds like a rationalist approach, where you start with some basic truths that are obvious and then logically derive more complex ideas from them. Rawls might not fully subscribe to this because he emphasizes the role of reasoning and reflection within a framework that considers the perspectives of different positions.\n\nOption B mentions direct acquaintance via moral intuition. This seems more like an intuitionist approach to morality, where you just know what's right or wrong through some innate moral sense. Rawls, however, seems to prefer a more deliberative and reflective process for arriving at principles of justice.\n\nOption C talks about the mutual support of many considerations fitting into one coherent view. This sounds a lot like what Rawls describes in his method of \"reflective equilibrium.\" In this approach, you consider various moral intuitions, principles, and theories and adjust them until they all fit together in a coherent and justifiable way. This seems aligned with Rawls's ideas.\n\nOption D is none of the above, but if option C is accurate, then this wouldn't be the right choice.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Rawls is known for his \"theory of justice\" and the \"original position\" thought experiment, where rational agents choose principles of justice behind a veil of ignorance. The idea is that these principles would be those that no one could reasonably reject, as they are chosen in a fair and impartial way.\n\nIn his work, Rawls emphasizes the importance of public reasoning and the convergence of different comprehensive doctrines on certain political principles. This is what he calls an \"overlapping consensus.\" So, it's not about starting from self-evident premises or relying solely on intuition, but rather about achieving a balance where different perspectives can agree on a set of principles that are justified through mutual adjustment and reflection.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to best capture Rawls's view that a conception of justice should be justified by the mutual support of many considerations fitting into one coherent view.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
