                    "text": "So I have this problem here: 960 mg of the antibacterial drug Cotrimoxazole is prescribed every 12 hours. I need to find out what the daily dose is in grams. The options are A. 0.192, B. 1.92, C. 1920, and D. 0.96. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how much medicine is being taken each time and how often. It says 960 mg every 12 hours. Since a day has 24 hours, that means the medicine is taken twice a day\u2014once every 12 hours.\n\nSo, if it's 960 mg each time and twice a day, the total daily dose in mg would be 960 mg times 2, which is 1920 mg.\n\nNow, the question asks for the daily dose in grams, not milligrams. I know that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So, to convert milligrams to grams, I need to divide by 1000.\n\nSo, 1920 mg divided by 1000 equals 1.92 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, B. 1.92 seems to match that.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 960 mg every 12 hours, and there are 24 hours in a day, so 2 doses per day.\n\n960 mg times 2 equals 1920 mg.\n\nThen, 1920 mg divided by 1000 equals 1.92 grams.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of converting the units step by step.\n\nFirst, find the total mg per day: 960 mg/dose times 2 doses/day = 1920 mg/day.\n\nThen, convert mg to grams: 1920 mg * (1 g / 1000 mg) = 1.92 g/day.\n\nSame result.\n\nI can also consider the decimal places. 1920 mg is 1.92 grams, since moving the decimal point three places to the left gives grams from milligrams.\n\nSo, the daily dose is 1.92 grams.\n\nLooking at the options again: A. 0.192, B. 1.92, C. 1920, D. 0.96.\n\nOption B matches my calculation.\n\nOption A is 0.192, which is ten times less than 1.92.\n\nOption C is 1920, which is in mg, but the question asks for grams.\n\nOption D is 0.96, which is half of 1.92.\n\nSo, unless I made a mistake, B seems correct.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the question.\n\n\"Every 12 hours\" means twice a day, as 24 divided by 12 is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dose is 960 mg total per day, but that doesn't make sense because it specifies \"every 12 hours.\"\n\nSo, it's definitely two doses per day.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the dose per hour and then multiply by 24, but that seems unnecessary.\n\n960 mg every 12 hours is equivalent to 960 mg / 12 hours = 80 mg/hour.\n\nThen, 80 mg/hour times 24 hours = 1920 mg/day, which again is 1.92 grams.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is 1.92 grams, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n"
