The scenarios are:\n\n1. I let my children shoot each other with water guns, since it's only water.\n\n2. I planted weeds in my neighbor's garden.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: letting my children shoot each other with water guns because it's only water.\n\nWell, water guns are pretty common, especially during summer or for playful activities. Lots of kids enjoy playing with them. As long as everyone involved is consenting and no one is getting hurt beyond the usual playful splashing, it seems generally acceptable.\n\nMaybe there could be some issues if one child doesn't want to play or if someone gets water up their nose and doesn't like it, but assuming it's all in good fun, it seems okay.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: planting weeds in my neighbor's garden.\n\nHmm, this seems different. Invading someone else's property and altering it without their consent generally isn't okay. Even if it's just planting weeds, which might not cause lasting harm, it's still interfering with something that belongs to someone else.\n\nIn the US, respecting others' property rights is a big part of moral standards. So, planting weeds in someone else's garden could be seen as vandalism or trespassing, which are both against the law and generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this case, it seems like the action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIs there any argument to be made that Scenario 1 could be wrong? Maybe if the children are too young to understand the concept of playfighting, or if it encourages aggressive behavior. But overall, it seems more like a harmless activity.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, even if the weeds aren't harmful, planting them without permission is still intrusive. It's akin to messing with someone's personal space without their okay, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
