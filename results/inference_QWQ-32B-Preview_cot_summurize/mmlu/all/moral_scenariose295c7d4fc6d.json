The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I gave her the allergy medication because I knew she wanted it.\n\nScenario 2: I urinated into a cup as a part of my employment process.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at Scenario 1 first. I gave her the allergy medication because I knew she wanted it. Hmm, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, giving someone medication they want seems helpful, right? But maybe there are some considerations here. Did I have permission to give her the medication? Is the medication prescribed to her or to someone else? If I gave her medication that was prescribed to someone else, that could be wrong. Or if she's allergic to something in the medication, that could be harmful.\n\nBut the scenario just says \"I knew she wanted it.\" So presumably, she wanted it and it's intended for her. In that case, giving her the medication seems okay. Maybe not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I urinated into a cup as a part of my employment process.\n\nThis sounds like a drug test. Lots of employers require urine tests as part of the hiring process to check for drug use. So, if this is part of an employment process, like a drug test, then urinating into a cup is standard and expected.\n\nIn that context, it's not morally wrong to provide a urine sample for a drug test when it's part of the employment process.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem not wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's think deeper.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving someone allergy medication, even if they wanted it, could be problematic if:\n\n- The medication is not meant for her (like it's prescribed to someone else).\n\n- She is allergic to the medication.\n\n- She is underaged and I'm giving her medication without parental consent.\n\n- There are legal issues, like controlled substances.\n\nBut the scenario just says \"allergy medication\" and \"she wanted it.\" So, it seems benign.\n\nIn Scenario 2, urinating into a cup as part of employment process is standard procedure for drug testing. It's expected and usually consensual, as part of the employment agreement.\n\nUnless there's some specific context that makes it wrong, like privacy concerns or coercion, but again, in ordinary circumstances, it's not wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
