                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about measuring the wavelength of a sound wave produced by a guitar string, and I need to choose the correct method using a meterstick. There are four options, and I need to figure out which one is both correct and practical.\n\nOption A says: \"Lightly touch the guitar string in the middle such that a single node is created. Measure the length of the string; this is the wavelength.\"\n\nHmm, when you touch the string in the middle, you're essentially creating a node in the middle of the string. For a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental frequency has one antinode in the middle and nodes at both ends. But if you touch it in the middle, creating a node, wouldn't that be suppressing the fundamental and possibly exciting higher harmonics? I'm not sure if measuring the full length of the string in this case would give you the wavelength of the sound wave.\n\nWait, actually, for a string fixed at both ends, the wavelength of the fundamental is twice the length of the string. So, if the string length is L, the wavelength \u03bb = 2L. But option A says that the length of the string is the wavelength, which wouldn't match that relationship. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"Measure the length of the guitar string; this is half the wavelength.\"\n\nOkay, this seems more plausible. As I just thought, for a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental wavelength is twice the length of the string. So, if the string length is L, then \u03bb = 2L, which means L = \u03bb/2. So, measuring the length of the string would give you half the wavelength. That makes sense for the fundamental frequency.\n\nBut, is this practical? Well, measuring the length of the string is straightforward, but does the guitar string necessarily vibrate in its fundamental mode when plucked? Doesn't it also have harmonics and overtones? Maybe this is only accurate for the fundamental frequency, but if the string is vibrating in a higher harmonic, the relationship would be different.\n\nFor example, for the first overtone (second harmonic), the wavelength would be equal to the string length, because there would be two antinodes and three nodes (including the fixed ends). So, in that case, \u03bb = L. So, if the string is vibrating in the second harmonic, measuring the string length would give you the wavelength, not half of it.\n\nThis suggests that option B is only correct for the fundamental frequency, but not for higher harmonics. Maybe the question assumes the fundamental frequency, but it's not specified.\n\nOption C: \"Adjust the length of a pipe placed near the string so that resonances are heard. Measure the difference between the pipe lengths for consecutive resonances; this is half the wavelength.\"\n\nThis seems interesting. It's based on the principle of resonance. If you have a pipe near the vibrating string, and you adjust the pipe's length until it resonates with the sound wave from the string, then you can relate the pipe length to the wavelength.\n\nFor an open pipe, the resonant lengths correspond to quarter-wavelengths, with consecutive resonances differing by half a wavelength. Similarly, for a closed pipe, resonances occur at quarter-wavelengths, with consecutive resonances also differing by half a wavelength.\n\nSo, if you measure the difference in pipe lengths for consecutive resonances, that difference should be half the wavelength. That makes sense.\n\nIs this practical with a meterstick? Yes, you can measure lengths with a meterstick. Adjusting the pipe length until resonance is heard might require some care, but it's doable.\n\nMoreover, this method doesn't depend on the specific mode of vibration of the string, as long as the pipe is resonating with the sound wave produced by the string.\n\nSo, option C seems correct and practical.\n\nOption D: \"Measure the peak-to-peak distance of the wave as it passes; this is the wavelength.\"\n\nThis sounds like measuring the wavelength in space as the wave travels. But sound waves in air are longitudinal waves, which means the displacement of particles is along the direction of wave propagation.\n\nMeasuring the peak-to-peak distance of a sound wave in air directly is not practical with a meterstick because the wavelength of sound is usually much larger than the dimensions of a meterstick, and sound waves aren't visible.\n\nMoreover, the peaks and troughs in a sound wave are changes in pressure, not physical displacements that you can see and measure directly with a ruler.\n\nSo, this option doesn't seem practical or feasible with a meterstick.\n\nGiven all that, option C seems to be the correct and practical method for measuring the wavelength of the sound wave with a meterstick.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
