                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I grabbed the grinning little boy, my son, while at the mall.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I checked out the beautiful woman while on a date with my wife.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately and see if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I grabbed the grinning little boy, my son, while at the mall.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is grabbing their own son who is grinning while they are at the mall. Grabbing could mean different things\u2014maybe holding his hand, picking him up, or something else. But since it's their own son, and assuming it's in a context of caring or guiding, it doesn't seem morally wrong. Parents often grab their children's hands to prevent them from running off or to guide them, especially in busy places like malls. So, I think this one is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I checked out the beautiful woman while on a date with my wife.\"\n\nThis one seems more problematic. The person is on a date with their wife and checks out another beautiful woman. This could be considered disrespectful to their wife and a breach of trust in the relationship. In many moral standards, being faithful and attentive to your partner during a date is important. Checking out someone else could be seen as infidelity or at least a lack of respect.\n\nBut, it also depends on what \"checked out\" means. If it's just a brief glance or noticing someone's appearance, it might be more acceptable, but still potentially wrong depending on the context and the expectations in the relationship.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, infidelity and lack of attention to one's partner during a date are generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, someone might argue that grabbing a child could be wrong if it's done forcefully or in a way that hurts the child, but in this scenario, it says \"the grinning little boy, my son,\" which suggests a positive context, so probably not wrong.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, even if it's just a brief check-out, it could still be considered wrong in the context of being on a date with one's wife.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
