So, for the list ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1], the element at index 1 is 'Chemistry'.\n\nLet me confirm that:\n\n- Index 0: 'a'\n\n- Index 1: 'Chemistry'\n\n- Index 2: 0\n\n- Index 3: 1\n\nSo, ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][1] should be 'Chemistry'.\n\nWait, but the question is about Python 3. Is there any difference in how indexing works in Python 2 versus Python 3 that I should be aware of?\n\nI don't think so. Indexing in lists should be the same in Python 2 and Python 3. Both versions start indexing at 0.\n\nLet me double-check the options:\n\nA. a\n\nB. Chemistry\n\nC. 0\n\nD. 1\n\nBased on the indexing, the correct answer should be B. Chemistry.\n\nBut maybe there's some trick here that I'm missing. Is there any possibility that the list is being modified or something like that?\n\nThe question just says ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][1], which is a straightforward list with four elements, and we're accessing the element at index 1.\n\nI think the answer is clearly 'Chemistry'.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the question.\n\nWait, maybe someone thinks that [1] refers to the second element, which is 'Chemistry', but in programming, indices start at 0, so index 1 is indeed the second element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion with array indexing in other programming languages, but in Python, lists are zero-indexed.\n\nI think the answer is B. Chemistry.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
