The client didn't provide a client certificate, but the client and server are honest, they don't leak their keys, and the cryptography is good. We need to figure out which of the two attacks TLS protects against in this scenario.\n\nThe first attack is about an attacker replacing bytes sent by the client with their own bytes. The second is about an attacker reading the plaintext bytes sent by the client.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what TLS does. TLS provides confidentiality and integrity of data in transit. Confidentiality means that even if someone intercepts the data, they can't read it. Integrity means that any modification of the data in transit can be detected.\n\nSo, for the first attack, where the attacker replaces bytes sent by the client, TLS should protect against that because of the integrity provided by TLS. TLS uses message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure that the data hasn't been tampered with. So, if an attacker tries to replace some bytes, the MAC should fail, and the server should detect that the message has been altered.\n\nFor the second attack, where the attacker tries to read the plaintext bytes sent by the client, TLS should protect against that because of the confidentiality it provides. TLS encrypts the data, so even if an attacker intercepts the ciphertext, they shouldn't be able to decrypt it without the key.\n\nBut wait, the question says that the client didn't provide a client certificate. Does that affect anything? Well, in TLS, the client can optionally provide a certificate for mutual authentication, but in this case, it's omitted. However, since the server's certificate is checked, and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is done, they should still establish a secure channel for data transmission.\n\nAlso, the question assumes that the client and server are honest and don't leak their keys, and that the cryptography is good. So, we can trust that the key exchange was done securely, and the keys are not compromised.\n\nTherefore, TLS should protect against both attacks: preventing an attacker from replacing bytes and preventing an attacker from reading the plaintext.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way that omitting the client certificate could weaken the protection against these attacks?\n\nWell, without a client certificate, the server doesn't authenticate the client beyond perhaps using username/password or some other means. But in terms of the TLS channel itself, the confidentiality and integrity should still hold, because the key exchange and the symmetric keys derived from it should be secure.\n\nAlso, Diffie-Hellman key exchange should provide forward secrecy, meaning that even if the long-term keys are compromised later, the session keys cannot be derived from them.\n\nTherefore, even without a client certificate, the TLS session should still protect against both types of attacks.\n\nSo, I think A. True, True is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
