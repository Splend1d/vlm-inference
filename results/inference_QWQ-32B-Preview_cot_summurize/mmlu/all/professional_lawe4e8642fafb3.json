                    "text": "This is a tricky legal scenario involving attempted murder charges. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the husband receives a call accusing his wife of having an affair with his friend. He decides to confront his friend at his house with a loaded shotgun, intending to teach his friend a lesson. He believes his friend is in an upstairs bedroom and fires through the dining room window. However, unbeknownst to him, his friend's wife is in the dining room and gets a minor gunshot wound.\n\nNow, the question is about guilt for attempted murder. Attempted murder generally requires an intent to kill someone, and an act that is a substantial step towards carrying out that intent, but falls short because the intended victim isn't killed or the act doesn't result in death.\n\nOption A says the husband is guilty of attempted murder of his friend's wife only. But the husband didn't intend to harm his friend's wife; he thought he was shooting at his friend. So, did he have the intent to kill his friend's wife? Probably not. His intent was to harm his friend.\n\nOption B says he's guilty of attempted murder of his friend only. This seems more plausible because he intended to harm his friend, and he took a substantial step by firing the shotgun at where he thought his friend was.\n\nOption C says he's guilty of attempted murder of both his friend and his friend's wife. For this to be true, he would need to have intent to kill both. But again, he only intended to harm his friend, not his friend's wife.\n\nOption D says he's not guilty of attempted murder of either. But he did take a substantial step to harm his friend, so this seems unlikely.\n\nNow, regarding the injury to his friend's wife, was it accidental? Well, he didn't intend to harm her, but he should have foreseen that firing a shotgun into a house could harm anyone inside, not just his friend. So, there might be some liability there, perhaps under a different charge like reckless endangerment or negligent infliction of injury.\n\nIn legal terms, attempted murder requires specific intent to kill the victim. Since the husband intended to harm his friend, not his friend's wife, he might be guilty of attempted murder of his friend. The injury to his friend's wife could be considered a separate offense, possibly involuntary manslaughter or reckless endangerment, depending on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the law.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be Option B: guilty of attempted murder of his friend only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
