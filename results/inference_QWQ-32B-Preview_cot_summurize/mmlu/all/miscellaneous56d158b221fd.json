It is a sign of respect and acknowledgement of their noble status.\n\nOption A, \"Your Majesty,\" is typically reserved for monarchs and royalty, such as kings, queens, princes, and princesses. While dukes hold high ranks in the peerage, they are not royalty and thus should not be addressed with \"Your Majesty.\"\n\nOption B, \"Your Eminence,\" is generally used for high-ranking clergy, such as cardinals in the Roman Catholic Church. It is not appropriate for addressing nobility.\n\nOption C, \"Your Excellency,\" is commonly used for ambassadors, governors, and other high-ranking officials in various countries. In the UK, it is not the traditional form of address for dukes.\n\nTherefore, \"Your Grace\" is the correct and most respectful way to address a duke in formal settings."
