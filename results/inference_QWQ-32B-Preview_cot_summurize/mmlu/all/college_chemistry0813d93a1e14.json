                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about optical isomerism in complexes with achiral ligands. Optical isomerism, also known as chirality, is when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image. This is important in chemistry, especially in coordination chemistry where the geometry of metal complexes can lead to chiral molecules even if the ligands themselves are achiral.\n\nFirst, let's understand what achiral ligands are. Achiral ligands are those that lack handedness or chirality on their own. However, when these ligands bind to a central metal ion in a certain geometry, the overall complex can become chiral due to the spatial arrangement.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\nOption A: \"Square planar complexes can display optical isomerism only if all four ligands are identical.\"\n\nThis seems counterintuitive. In square planar complexes, if all four ligands are identical, the complex would have high symmetry and likely not be chiral. For example, [PtCl4]\u00b2\u207b is square planar and has four identical chloride ligands; this complex is achiral. On the other hand, if the ligands are different, the complex might exhibit chirality. For instance, [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] can exist as optical isomers (cis and trans, but specifically the cis isomer can have optical isomers if the ligands are arranged in a way that lacks a plane of symmetry).\n\nSo, Option A seems incorrect because square planar complexes can display optical isomerism when the ligands are not all identical.\n\nOption B: \"Tetrahedral complexes never display optical isomerism.\"\n\nThis is a common misconception. Tetrahedral complexes can indeed display optical isomerism, even with achiral ligands, as long as the arrangement of ligands around the central metal ion results in a chiral molecule. A classic example is [Cd(RNH2)2Cl2], where RNH2 is an achiral amine. If the tetrahedral arrangement of the ligands lacks a plane of symmetry, the complex can be chiral.\n\nTherefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\"\n\nLinear complexes have two ligands arranged in a straight line around the central metal ion. If the two ligands are different, say [Ag(NH3)(CN)], this complex would have a mirror plane between the two ligands, making it achiral. However, if both ligands are identical, like [Ag(CN)2]\u207b, it would also be achiral due to the symmetry.\n\nIt's challenging to have a linear complex with different ligands that would lack a plane of symmetry, which is necessary for chirality. Therefore, linear complexes typically do not display optical isomerism.\n\nSo, Option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism only when they have at least three different ligands.\"\n\nOctahedral complexes can exhibit optical isomerism under certain conditions. For monodentate ligands, the complexity arises from the different ways ligands can be arranged in the six positions around the central metal.\n\nLet's consider some cases:\n\n1. All six ligands are identical: [ML6], which is achiral due to high symmetry.\n\n2. Five ligands of one type and one different: [ML5X], which is chiral if the positions of the different ligand don't coincide with a symmetry element.\n\n3. Four ligands of one type and two of another: [ML4X2]. This can be further subdivided into cis and trans isomers. The cis isomer can be chiral if the arrangement lacks a plane of symmetry.\n\n4. Three ligands of one type and three of another: [ML3X3]. This can have various isomers, some of which may be chiral.\n\n5. Two ligands of one type, two of another, and two of a third: [ML2X2Y2]. Chirality depends on the arrangement.\n\n6. At least three different ligands: This increases the possibility of chiral isomers.\n\nFrom this, it seems that having at least three different ligands increases the likelihood of optical isomerism, but it's not the only condition. For example, [ML5X] with two different ligands can still be chiral.\n\nTherefore, Option D is not entirely accurate because octahedral complexes can display optical isomerism with fewer than three different ligands under certain arrangements.\n\nGiven that all options seem to have inaccuracies, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of which statement is the least incorrect or closest to being true.\n\nUpon reevaluation:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because square planar complexes can show optical isomerism when ligands are not all identical.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because linear complexes typically do not display optical isomerism, especially when ligands are different.\n\n- Option D is not entirely accurate, but among the options, it might be the closest to being correct because having more different ligands increases the possibility of optical isomerism in octahedral complexes.\n\nHowever, considering the phrasing \"only when they have at least three different ligands,\" it's too restrictive because, as mentioned, even with two different ligands, certain arrangements can lead to chirality.\n\nPerhaps the most accurate statement among the options is Option C, but upon closer inspection, it seems incorrect because linear complexes with different ligands still possess a plane of symmetry, making them achiral.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the question is designed to identify the statement that is true based on the constraints provided, even if the statements aren't perfectly accurate.\n\nLet's consider the key point: complexes containing achiral ligands displaying optical isomerism.\n\nGiven that, we need to find which statement correctly describes a scenario where achiral ligands lead to chiral complexes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because having all four ligands identical in a square planar complex would likely result in an achiral complex.\n\nOption B is incorrect because tetrahedral complexes can be chiral with achiral ligands.\n\nOption C is incorrect because linear complexes with different ligands still have a plane of symmetry, making them achiral.\n\nOption D is partially correct but overly restrictive, as octahedral complexes can exhibit optical isomerism with fewer than three different ligands.\n\nGiven that all options have flaws, perhaps the relatively best answer is Option D, acknowledging its limitations, because it at least recognizes that having multiple different ligands can lead to optical isomerism in octahedral complexes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the selection of Option C, considering that linear complexes with different ligands do not display optical isomerism, making the statement true in a negative sense.\n\nWait, Option C says \"can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\" But in reality, linear complexes with different ligands do not display optical isomerism due to the presence of a plane of symmetry. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that they cannot display optical isomerism under those conditions, making Option C false.\n\nGiven this, perhaps the question is designed to identify the statement that is true, and upon analysis, none seem entirely correct, but Option D is the least incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've missed something.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the correct answer is \"none of the above,\" but since that's not an option, I need to choose the best available option.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- Option A is incorrect.\n\n- Option B is incorrect.\n\n- Option C is incorrect.\n\n- Option D is partially correct but overly restrictive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
