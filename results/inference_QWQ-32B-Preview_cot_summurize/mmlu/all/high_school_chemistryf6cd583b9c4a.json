                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true for all bases. I remember that bases are substances that can donate hydroxide ions (OH-) in solution, but I need to make sure about the details.\n\nOption A says: \"All bases donate OH- ions into solution.\" Hmm, I think this is generally true. Bases, whether they are ionic compounds like sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or molecules like ammonia (NH3), can produce OH- ions in water. Sodium hydroxide dissociates completely into Na+ and OH- ions, while ammonia reacts with water to form the ammonium ion and OH- ions. So, both strong and weak bases can donate OH- ions, just that strong bases do it completely, and weak bases do it partially.\n\nOption B says: \"Only strong bases create solutions in which OH- ions are present.\" I don't think this is correct because weak bases also produce OH- ions, just not to the same extent as strong bases. So, both strong and weak bases can have OH- ions in solution, just in different concentrations.\n\nOption C states: \"Only strong bases are good conductors when dissolved in solution.\" Well, conductivity in solutions depends on the presence of ions. Strong bases dissociate completely into ions, so they should conduct electricity well. Weak bases also ionize in solution, but to a lesser extent, so their solutions should conduct electricity, but not as well as those of strong bases. However, it's not accurate to say that only strong bases are good conductors because even weak bases do conduct, just less effectively.\n\nOption D says: \"For weak bases, the concentration of the OH- ions exceeds the concentration of the base in the solution.\" I need to think about this one. In weak bases, only a small fraction of the base molecules react with water to produce OH- ions. So, the concentration of unreacted base molecules should be higher than the concentration of OH- ions produced. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option A seems to be the correct choice because all bases, whether strong or weak, donate OH- ions into solution, even if the extent of donation differs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
