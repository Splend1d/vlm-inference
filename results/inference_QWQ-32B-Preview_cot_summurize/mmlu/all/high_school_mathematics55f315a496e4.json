                    "text": "So Ben is rolling two dice, and I need to find the expected value of the larger number that comes up. If the numbers are the same, that number is considered the larger one. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that expected value is the sum of all possible values each multiplied by their probability. So, I need to find all possible larger numbers from two dice rolls and their respective probabilities.\n\nThe possible larger numbers can be from 1 to 6, since it's a six-sided die. So, I'll consider each possible larger number, say k, where k can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and find the probability that the larger number is k.\n\nThen, the expected value E would be:\n\nE = sum from k=1 to 6 of k * P(larger number is k)\n\nSo, I need to find P(larger number is k) for each k.\n\nLet's think about how to find P(larger number is k).\n\nFor the larger number to be k, both dice can show numbers up to k, but at least one die shows k.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the larger number is k if and only if:\n\n- Both dice show numbers less than or equal to k, and\n\n- At least one die shows k.\n\nSo, P(larger number is k) = P(both dice \u2264 k) - P(both dice < k)\n\nBecause P(both \u2264 k) is the probability that the larger number is at most k, and P(both < k) is the probability that the larger number is less than k. So, the difference gives the probability that the larger number is exactly k.\n\nNow, for a six-sided die, the probability that a single die shows a number \u2264 k is k/6, since there are k favorable outcomes out of 6.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a single die shows a number < k is (k-1)/6.\n\nSince the dice are independent, P(both \u2264 k) = (k/6)^2 = k^2 / 36\n\nAnd P(both < k) = ((k-1)/6)^2 = (k-1)^2 / 36\n\nTherefore, P(larger number is k) = (k^2 - (k-1)^2) / 36\n\nLet me simplify that:\n\nk^2 - (k-1)^2 = k^2 - (k^2 - 2k + 1) = k^2 - k^2 + 2k - 1 = 2k - 1\n\nSo, P(larger number is k) = (2k - 1)/36\n\nNow, I can plug this back into the expected value formula:\n\nE = sum from k=1 to 6 of k * (2k - 1)/36\n\nLet's compute this sum step by step.\n\nFirst, write out the sum:\n\nE = (1*(2*1 - 1) + 2*(2*2 - 1) + 3*(2*3 - 1) + 4*(2*4 - 1) + 5*(2*5 - 1) + 6*(2*6 - 1)) / 36\n\nCalculate each term:\n\nFor k=1: 1*(2*1 - 1) = 1*1 = 1\n\nFor k=2: 2*(2*2 - 1) = 2*3 = 6\n\nFor k=3: 3*(2*3 - 1) = 3*5 = 15\n\nFor k=4: 4*(2*4 - 1) = 4*7 = 28\n\nFor k=5: 5*(2*5 - 1) = 5*9 = 45\n\nFor k=6: 6*(2*6 - 1) = 6*11 = 66\n\nNow, sum these up: 1 + 6 + 15 + 28 + 45 + 66\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 15 = 22\n\n22 + 28 = 50\n\n50 + 45 = 95\n\n95 + 66 = 161\n\nSo, the numerator is 161, and the denominator is 36.\n\nTherefore, E = 161/36\n\nWait a minute, looking at the options, option B is 161/36, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the probability calculation:\n\nP(larger number is k) = P(both \u2264 k) - P(both < k) = (k/6)^2 - ((k-1)/6)^2 = (k^2 - (k-1)^2)/36 = (2k - 1)/36\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, E = sum from k=1 to 6 of k * (2k - 1)/36\n\nWhich is what I calculated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to list all possible outcomes when rolling two dice, and for each outcome, take the larger number, then find the average.\n\nThere are 6*6 = 36 possible outcomes.\n\nLet's list the larger number for each pair:\n\n(1,1):1 (1,2):2 (1,3):3 (1,4):4 (1,5):5 (1,6):6\n\n(2,1):2 (2,2):2 (2,3):3 (2,4):4 (2,5):5 (2,6):6\n\n(3,1):3 (3,2):3 (3,3):3 (3,4):4 (3,5):5 (3,6):6\n\n(4,1):4 (4,2):4 (4,3):4 (4,4):4 (4,5):5 (4,6):6\n\n(5,1):5 (5,2):5 (5,3):5 (5,4):5 (5,5):5 (5,6):6\n\n(6,1):6 (6,2):6 (6,3):6 (6,4):6 (6,5):6 (6,6):6\n\nNow, count how many times each larger number appears:\n\n- 1: once\n\n- 2: three times (1,2; 2,1; 2,2)\n\n- 3: five times (1,3; 3,1; 2,3; 3,2; 3,3)\n\n- 4: seven times (1,4; 4,1; 2,4; 4,2; 3,4; 4,3; 4,4)\n\n- 5: nine times (1,5; 5,1; 2,5; 5,2; 3,5; 5,3; 4,5; 5,4; 5,5)\n\n- 6: eleven times (1,6; 6,1; 2,6; 6,2; 3,6; 6,3; 4,6; 6,4; 5,6; 6,5; 6,6)\n\nNow, compute the total sum:\n\n1*1 + 2*3 + 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 + 6*11\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n1*1 = 1\n\n2*3 = 6\n\n3*5 = 15\n\n4*7 = 28\n\n5*9 = 45\n\n6*11 = 66\n\nSum: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 28 = 50; 50 + 45 = 95; 95 + 66 = 161\n\nTotal sum = 161\n\nTotal number of outcomes = 36\n\nTherefore, expected value E = 161 / 36\n\nWhich matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, the answer should be 161/36.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 161/6\n\nB. 161/36\n\nC. 161\n\nD. 161/3\n\nSo, the correct choice is B. 161/36\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"the larger of the two numbers rolled,\" and if they are the same, that number is taken as the larger.\n\nI think I've covered all possible interpretations, and my calculation seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 161/36\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{161}{36}} \\]"
