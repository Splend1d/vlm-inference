                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this population growth question. It's asking about the tendency for a population to keep growing even after it's reached replacement fertility. The options are zero population growth, rapid growth rate, homeostatic plateau, and demographic momentum. I think I need to understand what happens when a population reaches replacement fertility and why it might still grow.\n\nFirst, I know that replacement fertility is when the birth rate is just enough to replace the existing population, considering deaths. So, theoretically, if the birth rate equals the death rate, the population should stabilize, right? But the question is saying that there's a tendency for the population to continue growing even after reaching this point. That sounds counterintuitive to me.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the age structure of the population. If there are more young people, they will eventually reach reproductive age and have children, which could keep the population growing even if the current fertility rate is at replacement level. Is that what's happening here?\n\nLet me look up demographic momentum to see if that fits. Okay, demographic momentum is a term used in population studies to describe the phenomenon where a population continues to grow even after replacement fertility has been achieved, due to the large number of young people who haven't yet reached reproductive age. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nSo, if a country has high birth rates in the past, it would have a lot of young people now. Even if fertility rates drop to replacement level, those young people will grow up and have children of their own, keeping the population growth going for some time. It's like a delay in the population's response to changes in fertility rates.\n\nComparing that to the other options:\n\n- Zero population growth (option A) is when the population is stable, not growing or shrinking. But the question is about continued growth after reaching replacement fertility, so that doesn't match.\n\n- Rapid growth rate (option B) could be a possibility, but the question is specifically about the tendency to continue growing after replacement fertility, not just any period of rapid growth.\n\n- Homeostatic plateau (option C) sounds like a stable state, similar to zero population growth, where the population has reached equilibrium. Again, that doesn't align with the idea of continued growth.\n\n- Demographic momentum (option D) seems to fit best, as it explains why populations can continue to grow even after fertility rates have dropped to replacement level.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider each option more carefully.\n\nOption A, zero population growth, is when births equal deaths, and the population size remains constant. If a population has achieved replacement fertility, you might expect zero population growth, but the question says there's a tendency for continued growth, which contradicts zero population growth. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B, rapid growth rate, could occur for various reasons, but it's not specifically related to the phenomenon described. Replacement fertility is when the growth rate should be zero, so if the population is still growing rapidly, that would be unusual unless there are other factors like increased life expectancy or immigration.\n\nOption C, homeostatic plateau, isn't a term I've heard in population studies. Homeostasis refers to a stable state, but in the context of population growth, it might be similar to zero population growth. Again, that doesn't align with continued growth.\n\nOption D, demographic momentum, seems to be the correct term for this phenomenon. It accounts for the age structure of the population and how current young individuals will contribute to future population growth as they age and have children.\n\nI think the best answer is D, demographic momentum.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
