                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal problem. So, there's a state law that bans selling contraceptive devices to married people and also prohibits married people from using them. A doctor who works in that state sues in federal court, saying this law is unconstitutional. The doctor argues that the law stops him from giving professional advice about contraceptives to three married patients who could get sick if they have kids.\n\nThe question is asking whether the doctor likely has standing to bring this lawsuit. The options are:\n\nA. to have standing.\n\nB. to have standing jus tertii.\n\nC. not to have standing.\n\nD. not to have standing jus tertii.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"standing\" means in a legal context. Standing is a principle in U.S. law that requires a plaintiff to show that they have a direct and personal stake in the outcome of the case. Basically, they need to demonstrate that they've been harmed by the law or action they're challenging, and that the court can do something to fix that harm.\n\nIn this case, the doctor is saying that the state's contraceptive statute prevents him from giving professional advice to his patients about contraceptives. The patients are all married and their health could be endangered by pregnancy.\n\nSo, does the doctor have standing to challenge this law?\n\nLet me think about this. The law prohibits the sale of contraceptive devices to married persons and prohibits married persons from using them. The doctor claims that this prevents him from giving professional advice to his patients.\n\nIs the doctor directly affected by this law? Well, the law seems to target married persons, not doctors. But the doctor argues that it prevents him from giving advice. Is that a sufficient injury for standing?\n\nMaybe I need to look into cases where doctors have challenged laws related to patient care. I recall that sometimes doctors have standing to challenge laws that interfere with their ability to practice medicine or provide care to their patients.\n\nThere's a concept called \"third-party standing\" or \"jus tertii,\" which allows a plaintiff to raise rights belonging to someone else. In this case, the doctor is arguably trying to assert the rights of his patients to access contraceptive information and devices.\n\nOption B mentions \"standing jus tertii,\" which probably refers to third-party standing.\n\nBut I need to consider whether the doctor has standing in his own right, or only through his patients.\n\nFirst, let's consider whether the doctor has a personal stake in this. The law doesn't directly regulate the doctor's conduct; it regulates the sale and use of contraceptives by married persons. However, the doctor claims that it prevents him from giving professional advice.\n\nIs giving advice considered a protected activity that the law is interfering with? Maybe, but it's not entirely clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doctor is arguing that he can't provide certain treatments or prescriptions to his patients because of this law.\n\nWait, but the law prohibits the sale and use of contraceptives by married persons. So, if the patients are married, they can't lawfully obtain or use contraceptives.\n\nTherefore, even if the doctor advises them to use contraceptives, the patients couldn't lawfully do so.\n\nIn that sense, the law is limiting the doctor's ability to provide effective advice or treatment options to his patients.\n\nSo, the doctor's argument is that the law is hindering his professional judgment and ability to care for his patients.\n\nNow, does that constitute a sufficient injury for standing?\n\nI think it's plausible. Doctors have been found to have standing to challenge laws that interfere with their medical judgment and patient care.\n\nFor example, in cases involving abortion restrictions, doctors have been allowed to challenge laws that they claim impair their ability to provide necessary medical care to their patients.\n\nSimilarly, here, the doctor is arguing that the law prevents him from giving proper advice to patients who could be harmed by pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, the doctor is specifically identifying three patients whose health might be endangered by childbearing. This seems to provide concrete instances of how the law is harming both the patients and, by extension, the doctor's ability to treat them.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like the doctor likely has standing to challenge the law.\n\nBut let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B is \"to have standing jus tertii.\" That would mean the doctor is asserting the rights of his patients.\n\nWhile that might be the case, it's perhaps secondary to the doctor's own professional interest in being able to provide appropriate medical advice and care.\n\nOption C is \"not to have standing.\" That seems unlikely given the doctor's direct involvement and the potential harm to his professional practice.\n\nOption D is \"not to have standing jus tertii.\" But again, even if the doctor doesn't have third-party standing, he might still have standing in his own right.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that option A, \"to have standing,\" is the most appropriate.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should look at some relevant case law.\n\nOne famous case is Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where doctors and patients challenged Pennsylvania's abortion regulations. The Court allowed doctors to assert the rights of their patients in certain circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, in Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, the Supreme Court found that compounded pharmacists had standing to challenge federal drug regulations that affected their ability to compound medications.\n\nThese cases suggest that healthcare providers can have standing to challenge laws that interfere with their professional activities and patient care.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the doctor is likely to have standing to challenge the state's contraceptive statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
