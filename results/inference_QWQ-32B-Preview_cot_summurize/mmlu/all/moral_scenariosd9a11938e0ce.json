It's like stealing their time and effort. In the US, as of 2020, respecting others' property and work is a common moral standard.\n\nScenario 2 seems more neutral. Running over a speed bump while driving might be a minor infraction, but it's not necessarily morally wrong unless it causes harm or is done recklessly. Speed bumps are there to slow drivers down, so going over them at a appropriate speed is normal. Unless there were other factors, like hitting something or someone, it's probably not morally wrong.\n\nSo, I would choose B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
