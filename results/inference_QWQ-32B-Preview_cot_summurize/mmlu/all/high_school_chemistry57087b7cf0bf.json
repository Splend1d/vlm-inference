Bond order is a measure of the number of chemical bonds between a pair of atoms and it influences the bond length; generally, higher bond orders correspond to shorter bond lengths.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule one by one:\n\n1. **CO2 (Carbon Dioxide):**\n   - Carbon dioxide has a linear structure with double bonds between carbon and each oxygen atom.\n   - Bond order: 2\n\n2. **CO3^2- (Carbonate Ion):**\n   - The carbonate ion has a trigonal planar structure with resonance between three equivalent C-O bonds.\n   - Each C-O bond in carbonate is a combination of a single bond and a double bond due to resonance, effectively making the bond order approximately 1.33.\n\n3. **NO2^- (Nitrite Ion):**\n   - Nitrite ion has a bent structure with resonance between two equivalent N-O bonds.\n   - One N-O bond is a double bond and the other is a single bond, but due to resonance, the bond order is approximately 1.5 for each N-O bond.\n\n4. **NO3^- (Nitrate Ion):**\n   - Nitrate ion has a trigonal planar structure with resonance between three equivalent N-O bonds.\n   - Each N-O bond is a combination of a single bond and a double bond due to resonance, effectively making the bond order approximately 1.33.\n\nNow, comparing the bond orders:\n- CO2: 2\n- CO3^2-: ~1.33\n- NO2^- : ~1.5\n- NO3^- : ~1.33\n\nThe highest bond order is in CO2 with a bond order of 2, which corresponds to double bonds. Therefore, the bonds in CO2 should be the shortest among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
