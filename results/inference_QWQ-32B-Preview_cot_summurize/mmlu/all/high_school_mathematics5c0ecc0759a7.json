This will help us determine the limits of integration.\n\n2. **Set up the integral** to calculate the area between these curves from the y-axis (x = 0) to the point where they intersect.\n\n3. **Evaluate the integral** to find the area.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Points of Intersection\n\nWe need to solve the equation \\(x^2 = \\cos(x)\\) for \\(x\\) in the first quadrant.\n\nThis is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved algebraically, so we'll need to use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the solution.\n\nLet's sketch the graphs of \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(y = \\cos(x)\\) to estimate the intersection point.\n\n- \\(y = x^2\\) is a parabola opening upwards, passing through the origin.\n\n- \\(y = \\cos(x)\\) is a cosine curve starting at (0,1) and oscillating between -1 and 1.\n\nIn the first quadrant, \\( \\cos(x) \\) decreases from 1 to 0 as \\( x \\) increases from 0 to \\( \\pi/2 \\), while \\( x^2 \\) increases from 0 to \\( (\\pi/2)^2 \\).\n\nBy graphing or using a numerical solver, we can find that the intersection occurs at approximately \\( x \\approx 0.824 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the Integral\n\nTo find the area between the curves from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x \\approx 0.824 \\), we need to integrate the difference between the upper curve and the lower curve with respect to \\( x \\).\n\nIn this region, \\( \\cos(x) \\) is above \\( x^2 \\), so the area \\( A \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{0}^{a} (\\cos(x) - x^2) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\approx 0.824 \\) is the x-coordinate of the intersection point.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Integral\n\nWe need to compute:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{0}^{0.824} (\\cos(x) - x^2) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis integral can be evaluated by splitting it into two parts:\n\n\\[\nA = \\int_{0}^{0.824} \\cos(x) \\, dx - \\int_{0}^{0.824} x^2 \\, dx\n\\]\n\nFirst, compute \\( \\int \\cos(x) \\, dx = \\sin(x) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{0.824} \\cos(x) \\, dx = \\sin(0.824) - \\sin(0) = \\sin(0.824) - 0 = \\sin(0.824)\n\\]\n\nNext, compute \\( \\int x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{0.824} x^2 \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{0.824} = \\frac{(0.824)^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} = \\frac{0.555}{3} \\approx 0.185\n\\]\n\nNow, combine the results:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sin(0.824) - 0.185\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator to find \\( \\sin(0.824) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(0.824) \\approx 0.733\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 0.733 - 0.185 = 0.548\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.547}\n\\]\n\nThis matches option C."
