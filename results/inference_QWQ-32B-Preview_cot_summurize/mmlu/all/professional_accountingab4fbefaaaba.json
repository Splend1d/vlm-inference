                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about inventory valuation methods, specifically focusing on the switch from FIFO to LIFO and understanding the implications of using the LIFO method.\n\nFirst, it's important to recall what FIFO and LIFO stand for:\n\n- FIFO: First-In, First-Out. This method assumes that the oldest inventory items are sold first.\n\n- LIFO: Last-In, First-Out. This method assumes that the most recently acquired items are sold first.\n\nNow, the question presents four statements and asks which one is accurate regarding the use of the LIFO method. Let's evaluate each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:** \"In periods of rising prices, the LIFO method results in a lower cost of sales and higher taxable income, when compared to the FIFO method.\"\n\nLet's think about this. In a period of rising prices, the most recent inventory costs are higher than the older costs. Under LIFO, the higher costs are assigned to the cost of goods sold (COGS), which would make COGS higher, not lower, compared to FIFO. Higher COGS would lead to lower taxable income, not higher. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\n**Option B:** \"The taxpayer is required to receive permission each year from the Internal Revenue Service to continue the use of the LIFO method.\"\n\nThis one is about the administrative requirements for using LIFO. In reality, once a taxpayer chooses to use LIFO for tax purposes, they must obtain IRS approval to change back to another method, but they don't need annual permission to continue using LIFO. So, this statement appears to be false.\n\n**Option C:** \"The LIFO method can be used for tax purposes even if the FIFO method is used for financial statement purposes.\"\n\nThis touches on the concept of dual accounting methods, where a company might use one method for financial reporting and another for tax purposes. In the United States, it is permissible for a company to use LIFO for tax purposes while using FIFO for financial statements, provided certain requirements are met, such as disclosing the LIFO reserve in the financial statements. Therefore, this statement seems accurate.\n\n**Option D:** \"Under the LIFO method, the inventory on hand at the end of the year is treated as being composed of the earliest acquired goods.\"\n\nThis describes the LIFO method. Since LIFO assumes that the last items acquired are the first to be sold, the remaining inventory should consist of the oldest, or earliest acquired, goods. This seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, both options C and D seem accurate based on my initial assessment. However, the question asks for the statement that is accurate regarding the use of the LIFO method, implying that only one option is correct. Maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nLet me revisit option A. I thought it was incorrect because in rising prices, LIFO would result in higher COGS and lower taxable income compared to FIFO. But the statement says the opposite. So, it's definitely wrong.\n\nOption B is about annual permission from the IRS to use LIFO, which isn't required. Only a one-time approval is needed to adopt LIFO, and subsequent changes require approval.\n\nOption C is about using LIFO for tax purposes while using FIFO for financial statements, which is allowed with proper disclosures.\n\nOption D correctly describes how LIFO affects the composition of ending inventory.\n\nGiven that both C and D seem accurate, but the question likely expects only one answer, perhaps there's more to consider.\n\nMaybe the question is specifically about the tax implications or the method's application in taxation, which would make option C more directly relevant to the use of LIFO for tax purposes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding of how LIFO affects inventory valuation, which would point to option D.\n\nHowever, since the question mentions that the corporate taxpayer plans to switch from FIFO to LIFO for inventory valuation, and asks about statements accurate regarding the use of LIFO method, option C seems more pertinent because it discusses the permissibility of using LIFO for tax purposes even if FIFO is used for financial statements. This is a crucial aspect for a taxpayer considering such a switch.\n\nOption D, while correct in describing how LIFO affects the ending inventory, might not directly address the implications of using LIFO for tax purposes.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that option C is the most accurate statement in this context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
