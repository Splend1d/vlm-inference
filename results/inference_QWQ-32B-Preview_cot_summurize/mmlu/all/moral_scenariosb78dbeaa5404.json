Caring for the safety and well-being of one's child is a fundamental part of parenting and is generally considered a positive and morally acceptable behavior. So, in this case, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with wanting one's daughter to be safe.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I started a fire at the neighbors' house.\" This is a very different situation. Starting a fire at someone else's house is destructive, dangerous, and can cause harm to people and property. It's against the law and goes against basic moral principles of respecting others' property and ensuring their safety. So, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. So, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong \u2013 This would mean both scenarios are morally wrong, but we've determined that Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong \u2013 This suggests that Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not, which contradicts our analysis.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong \u2013 This aligns with our conclusion that Scenario 1 is acceptable and Scenario 2 is not.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong \u2013 This would imply that neither scenario is morally wrong, but we know that Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
