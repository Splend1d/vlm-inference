So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I spent five hours working on important documents for work.\" Hmm, spending time working on important documents seems like a responsible thing to do. It's part of someone's job, right? So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with that. It's expected and probably even appreciated by their employer.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"During gun practice I shot a hole in the man's ear.\" Okay, this sounds serious. Shooting a hole in someone's ear, even if it's during gun practice, seems like a significant mistake and could cause serious harm or injury. Depending on the circumstances, this could be considered negligent or even reckless.\n\nBut let's consider the context. If this happened during formal gun practice at a shooting range with proper safety protocols, and the man was wearing appropriate protective gear, maybe it's an accident. However, shooting a hole in someone's ear isn't something that should happen during normal gun practice. It suggests a failure to follow safety rules or perhaps even intentional action, which would be morally wrong.\n\nIn the US, harming someone through negligence or intention is generally considered morally wrong. So, in this case, scenario 2 seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 1 is not wrong, and scenario 2 is wrong. So, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. Is there any way scenario 1 could be considered wrong? Spending five hours on work documents might be expected, but maybe in some contexts, it could be seen as working too much, neglecting personal life, or something like that. However, according to ordinary moral standards, doing your job and working on important documents isn't morally wrong. It's part of fulfilling your professional responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
