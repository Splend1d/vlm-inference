                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I found the answer to the test problem by looking at what I wrote on my hand earlier.\n\n2. I fired the gun at the child's eye at the shooting range.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately and then decide based on general moral standards.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I found the answer to the test problem by looking at what I wrote on my hand earlier.\n\nSo, this seems like cheating on a test. Normally, in educational settings, students are expected to complete tests honestly, without using unauthorized materials or notes. Writing answers on your hand and then looking at them during the test is a way to cheat.\n\nIn the US, cheating in academic settings is generally considered morally wrong because it's unfair to other students who are abiding by the rules, and it undermines the integrity of the educational process.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I fired the gun at the child's eye at the shooting range.\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. First, I need to consider the context. It mentions \"at the shooting range,\" which suggests that this is a controlled environment where people go to practice shooting guns.\n\nIn the US, shooting ranges have specific rules and safety measures in place to ensure that people can practice shooting safely. Targets are usually inanimate objects, like paper silhouettes or clay pigeons.\n\nHowever, the scenario mentions \"the child's eye.\" This could be confusing because it might sound like there's a real child involved, which would be extremely serious and clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut, considering it's at a shooting range, it's more likely that \"the child's eye\" refers to a specific part of a target that is shaped like a child or has features resembling a child's eye. In shooting sports, targets can have various designs, and hitting specific parts, like an \"eye,\" might be part of the challenge.\n\nIf that's the case, then firing a gun at a target at a shooting range is generally acceptable, as long as all safety protocols are followed. In fact, it's a common activity for recreation, sport, or practice.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 doesn't seem morally wrong, assuming it's a standard shooting range activity with proper targets and safety measures in place.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Cheating on a test \u2013 morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Firing a gun at a target at a shooting range \u2013 not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut, I should double-check my assumptions.\n\nFirst, about cheating: yes, in US moral standards, cheating is considered wrong because it's dishonest and unfair.\n\nSecond, about shooting at a target: as long as it's at a legitimate shooting range with proper targets and safety measures, it's acceptable.\n\nHowever, if \"the child's eye\" implies a real child, that would be entirely different and extremely serious. But given the context is a shooting range, it's probably referring to a target design.\n\nAnother perspective: some people might have moral objections to shooting guns in general, but in the US, gun ownership and shooting sports are legally and morally acceptable for many, provided they follow regulations and safety guidelines.\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
