Let me see how to do this.\n\nI remember that to solve for x, I need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. So, if I have x - 3 = 6, I should do something to both sides to isolate x.\n\nMaybe I can add 3 to both sides. That way, the -3 and +3 cancel out, and I'm left with x on the left side.\n\nSo, if I add 3 to both sides: x - 3 + 3 = 6 + 3.\n\nThat simplifies to x = 9.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If x is 9, and I subtract 3, I get 6, which matches the equation. So, x = 9 seems right.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 6\n\nD. 9\n\nThe answer should be D. 9.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider if there's another way to solve this.\n\nMaybe I can think about what number minus 3 equals 6. So, if I have a number and take away 3, it's 6. What's the number? It's 9, because 9 - 3 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider the equation x - 3 = 6 as x = 6 + 3, which again is x = 9.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same answer, x = 9.\n\nI think I'm confident with this one. The answer is D. 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]"
