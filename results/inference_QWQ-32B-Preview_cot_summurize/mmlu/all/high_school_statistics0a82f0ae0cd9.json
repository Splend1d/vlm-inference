                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two sets of numbers, X and Y, and we need to determine which statement about them is false. The sets are:\n\nX = {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}\n\nY = {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The sets have identical medians.\n\nB. The sets have identical means.\n\nC. The sets have identical ranges.\n\nD. None of the above are false.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n- Median: The middle value when the numbers are ordered.\n\n- Mean: The average of the numbers.\n\n- Range: The difference between the largest and smallest numbers.\n\nLet's start with the medians.\n\n**Finding the Medians:**\n\nFor set X:\n\nX = {10, 30, 45, 50, 55, 70, 90}\n\nSince there are 7 numbers, the median is the 4th number when ordered.\n\nSo, median of X = 50.\n\nFor set Y:\n\nY = {10, 30, 35, 50, 65, 70, 90}\n\nAgain, 7 numbers, so the median is the 4th number.\n\nMedian of Y = 50.\n\nSo, the medians are identical. Statement A seems to be true.\n\n**Finding the Means:**\n\nNow, let's calculate the means.\n\nFor set X:\n\nMean = (10 + 30 + 45 + 50 + 55 + 70 + 90) / 7\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n10 + 30 = 40\n\n40 + 45 = 85\n\n85 + 50 = 135\n\n135 + 55 = 190\n\n190 + 70 = 260\n\n260 + 90 = 350\n\nSo, mean of X = 350 / 7 = 50.\n\nFor set Y:\n\nMean = (10 + 30 + 35 + 50 + 65 + 70 + 90) / 7\n\nAdding them up:\n\n10 + 30 = 40\n\n40 + 35 = 75\n\n75 + 50 = 125\n\n125 + 65 = 190\n\n190 + 70 = 260\n\n260 + 90 = 350\n\nSo, mean of Y = 350 / 7 = 50.\n\nThe means are also identical. Statement B is true.\n\n**Finding the Ranges:**\n\nFinally, let's check the ranges.\n\nFor set X:\n\nRange = largest number - smallest number = 90 - 10 = 80.\n\nFor set Y:\n\nRange = 90 - 10 = 80.\n\nThe ranges are identical as well. Statement C is true.\n\nSince all three statements A, B, and C are true, that means none of them are false. Therefore, option D \"None of the above are false\" is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check everything to be sure.\n\nDouble-checking the medians:\n\nBoth sets have 7 numbers, and the 4th number in both ordered sets is 50. Correct.\n\nMeans:\n\nBoth sets sum up to 350, divided by 7, mean is 50. Correct.\n\nRanges:\n\nBoth sets have minimum 10 and maximum 90, so range is 80. Correct.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
