                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 52-year-old woman who's been to the emergency department with some symptoms. Let's see what's going on. She's been having a low-grade fever for a week and increasing abdominal cramps that get worse when she has bowel movements. She's been taking some antibiotics\u2014amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole\u2014for the past two days, but they haven't helped her symptoms at all.\n\nFirst off, her medical history: She's had intermittent constipation for 12 years, which is a pretty long time. No nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or bloody stools, which is good to know. She has hypertension for 3 years and had a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 5 years ago due to uterine fibroids, which are called leiomyomata uteri.\n\nPhysical exam: She's 5 ft 5 in, weighs 190 lbs, so her BMI is 32, which is considered obese. Temperature is 100.6\u00b0F, pulse is 75, blood pressure is 150/80. Lungs are clear, heart sounds normal. Abdomen is soft, tender in the left lower quadrant with guarding but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal. Stool is brown, and occult blood test is negative. Lab tests: Hemoglobin is 14.5 g/dL, white blood cell count is 15,000/mm3, platelets are 280,000/mm3. Serum studies and urinalysis are normal.\n\nSo, she has a fever, abdominal cramps worse with bowel movements, tender abdomen in the left lower quadrant, elevated white blood cell count, and no signs of infection elsewhere. She's been on antibiotics, but they haven't helped.\n\nGiven that, let's think about possible causes. The left lower quadrant tenderness could suggest diverticulitis, especially since she has a history of constipation, which is a risk factor for diverticula. However, diverticulitis often presents with fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal pain, and sometimes change in bowel habits. But she doesn't have bloody stools, which can be seen in severe diverticulitis.\n\nAnother possibility could be inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, but she doesn't have a history of that, and her symptoms aren't typical for IBD.\n\nInfections could be a cause. She's been on antibiotics, which might suggest that a bacterial infection was suspected, but since she's not improving, maybe it's not working.\n\nOption A is to test the stool for C. difficile toxin. That makes sense because she's been on antibiotics, which is a risk factor for C. difficile infection, especially with broad-spectrum antibiotics like amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole. C. diff can cause colitis with abdominal cramps, fever, and leukocytosis. Even though she doesn't have diarrhea or bloody stools, it's still possible.\n\nOption B is endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which is for evaluating the biliary and pancreatic ducts. There's no mention of jaundice, pancreatitis symptoms, or biliary colic, so this seems less likely.\n\nOption C is pelvic ultrasonography. She's had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, so there aren't any uterine or ovarian organs left to image. Unless there's concern for something else in the pelvis, this seems unnecessary.\n\nOption D is a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast. This is a more extensive imaging study that could help diagnose a variety of abdominal pathologies, including diverticulitis, appendicitis, ovarian issues, etc. Given her left lower quadrant pain, it could be useful, but considering she's already on antibiotics and not improving, maybe we should consider other causes first.\n\nWait, she's been on antibiotics for two days and not improving. That suggests that perhaps the infection is not responding to the antibiotics, or maybe it's not an infection at all.\n\nBut considering the elevated white blood cell count and fever, there's definitely some inflammation or infection going on.\n\nGiven that she's on metronidazole, which covers anaerobes like C. difficile, but sometimes C. diff can be resistant or the treatment may not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not a bacterial infection at all, but something else.\n\nBut among the options provided, testing for C. difficile toxin seems like a reasonable next step, especially given her antibiotic use.\n\nAlternatively, a CT scan could reveal the source of her abdominal pain and inflammation, but testing for C. diff is less invasive and could explain why she's not improving on antibiotics.\n\nI think testing the stool for C. difficile toxin is the most appropriate next step.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
