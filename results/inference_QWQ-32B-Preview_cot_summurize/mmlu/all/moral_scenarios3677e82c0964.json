                    "text": "Let's see. I have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: I wanted to know how my sister really felt about me, so I read her diary.\n\nScenario 2: In order to receive a good grade, I worked hard to pay my teacher.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character reads their sister's diary without permission. Generally, diaries are personal and private, and reading someone else's diary without their consent is invading their privacy. In the US, respecting people's privacy is important, especially within families. So, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character worked hard to pay their teacher in order to receive a good grade. This sounds a bit unclear. If \"worked hard to pay my teacher\" means that they earned money through hard work to give as a gift or payment to the teacher, and in return, the teacher gives them a good grade, that could be considered bribery. Bribery is offering something of value to influence someone's actions, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if \"worked hard to pay my teacher\" means that they worked hard in class, participated, did their homework, and as a result, earned a good grade, that's just doing what's expected to succeed academically, which is not wrong.\n\nBut the way it's phrased, \"worked hard to pay my teacher,\" it seems like the character is paying the teacher for a good grade, which is bribery. That would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, reading someone's diary without permission is invading their privacy, which is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, paying a teacher for a good grade is bribery, which is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe Scenario 2 isn't clearly morally wrong. Maybe \"worked hard to pay my teacher\" means they worked hard and earned money to buy the teacher a gift, not as a bribe. But the phrase \"in order to receive a good grade\" suggests that the payment is conditional on the grade, which sounds like bribery.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nSo, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
