To do this, we'll calculate the unit price for each option by dividing the total price by the number of bars.\n\nLet's start with option A:\n\nA. 10 bars for $23.20\n\nUnit price = $23.20 / 10 = $2.32 per bar\n\nNow, option B:\n\nB. 16 bars for $36.48\n\nUnit price = $36.48 / 16 = $2.28 per bar\n\nOption C:\n\nC. 13 bars for $29.51\n\nUnit price = $29.51 / 13 \u2248 $2.27 per bar\n\nAnd finally, option D:\n\nD. 12 bars for $27.60\n\nUnit price = $27.60 / 12 = $2.30 per bar\n\nNow, let's compare the unit prices:\n\nA: $2.32\n\nB: $2.28\n\nC: $2.27\n\nD: $2.30\n\nThe lowest unit price is option C at approximately $2.27 per bar.\n\nTherefore, the best buy is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
