                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about graphs, and it's asking which of the statements I, II, and III must be true for a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E). Okay, let's tackle each one step by step.\n\nFirst, statement I says that the sum of the degrees of all vertices is even. I think I've heard something about that before. Oh, right! There's a theorem in graph theory that says that the sum of all degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. So, \u03a3_{v\u2208V} degree(v) = 2|E|. Since 2|E| is always even, no matter how many edges there are, the sum of the degrees should always be even. So, statement I must be true.\n\nNext, statement II says that |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1. Hmm, what does that remind me of? I think in trees, which are a type of connected graph, the number of edges is exactly |V| \u2212 1. And since the graph is connected, it must have at least that many edges to stay connected. If it had fewer edges, it wouldn't be connected anymore. So, I believe statement II is also true.\n\nNow, statement III says that G has at least one vertex with degree 1. Is that necessarily true for any connected, undirected graph? Let me think about this. Degree 1 means a vertex that's connected to only one other vertex. But is that always the case?\n\nWell, consider a graph where all vertices have degree 2. Like a cycle graph, where every vertex is connected to exactly two others, forming a loop. That's a connected graph, and none of the vertices have degree 1. So, statement III isn't necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, think about a star graph, where one vertex is connected to all others, and all others have degree 1. In that case, there are vertices with degree 1. But my previous example shows that it's not always the case.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and II must be true for any connected, undirected graph.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. I and II.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
