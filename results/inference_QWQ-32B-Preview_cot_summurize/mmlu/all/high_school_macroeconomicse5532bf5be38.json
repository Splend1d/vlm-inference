To close this gap, the goal is to reduce aggregate demand so that it aligns with the economy's potential output.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right: This would increase demand even further, exacerbating the expansionary gap and leading to higher inflation. This is counterproductive to closing the gap.\n\nB. Shifting the aggregate demand curve to the left: This would decrease demand, helping to bring actual output back in line with potential output. This seems like a plausible solution to close the expansionary gap.\n\nC. Shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right: An increase in aggregate supply would typically lead to lower prices and higher output, which might help reduce inflation but could also increase output beyond potential, depending on the slope of the aggregate demand curve. However, shifting aggregate supply is generally not the direct approach to closing an expansionary gap.\n\nD. Shifting the aggregate supply curve to the left: This would decrease supply, leading to higher prices and lower output, which could exacerbate the inflationary pressures associated with the expansionary gap.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate action to close an expansionary gap is to shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
