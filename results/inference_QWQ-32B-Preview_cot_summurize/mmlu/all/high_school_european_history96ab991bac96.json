It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft.

                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about Huizinga's support for Erasmus' belief in making the \"book of antiquity\" accessible to all. The question is asking why Huizinga seems to support this idea, and it gives four options: A, B, C, and D. I need to pick the most likely reason based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand what Erasmus believed. According to the passage, Erasmus wanted to make the treasures of classical culture available not just to a select group of humanists but to a much wider audience. He did this by compiling a collection of proverbial sayings from ancient Latin authors, which he thought would help people write better Latin and strengthen their arguments. So, his goal was to democratize access to classical knowledge.\n\nNow, Huizinga seems to support this idea, saying that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among the people and made it current. He also mentions that some humanists reproached Erasmus for divulging the mysteries of their craft when he published his Adagia, implying that these humanists wanted to keep their knowledge exclusive.\n\nGiven this context, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics.\n\nThis suggests that Huizinga, being from the twentieth century, lived in a time that valued accessibility and democratization of knowledge. So, his support for Erasmus' belief might be a reflection of the values of his own time.\n\nB. The longevity of Erasmus' works.\n\nThis option suggests that Huizinga supports Erasmus because his works have stood the test of time. While it's true that Erasmus' works are still studied today, the passage doesn't directly mention the longevity of his works, so this might not be the primary reason.\n\nC. The Dutch reverence for the works of Erasmus.\n\nHuizinga was Dutch, and Erasmus was also Dutch. It's possible that there's a national pride or reverence for Erasmus in the Netherlands, which might influence Huizinga's perspective. However, the passage doesn't provide information about Dutch attitudes towards Erasmus, so this is speculative.\n\nD. The typical unflinching support of one philosopher for another philosopher's work.\n\nThis option suggests that philosophers generally support each other's work without criticism. But this seems too broad and doesn't specifically address Huizinga's support for Erasmus' belief in making classical knowledge accessible.\n\nConsidering these options, I think A is the most plausible. Huizinga, writing in the twentieth century, likely valued the democratization of knowledge, which aligns with Erasmus' efforts to make classical culture more widely available. The other options either don't have sufficient support from the passage or are too general.\n\nSo, my answer is A. The author's life as a member of twentieth-century Europe, which prized such characteristics.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
