So, I need to figure out all the possible values that f(x) can be.\n\nFirst, I should think about the denominator, 1 - x. This can't be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, x can't be 1. That means the function is defined for all real numbers except x = 1.\n\nBut the question is about the range, not the domain. The domain is all real numbers except x = 1, but the range is about the output values.\n\nLet me try to solve for y in terms of x and see if I can find any restrictions on y.\n\nSo, y = 1 / (1 - x)\n\nI can solve for x in terms of y:\n\ny(1 - x) = 1\n\n1 - x = 1/y\n\n-x = 1/y - 1\n\nx = 1 - 1/y\n\nNow, x is defined as long as y is not zero, because otherwise I'd be dividing by zero in 1/y.\n\nAlso, since x can be any real number except x = 1, but from the expression x = 1 - 1/y, it seems that y can be any real number except zero.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that for every y except zero, there is a corresponding x that satisfies the original equation.\n\nLet me plug x = 1 - 1/y back into the original function:\n\nf(x) = 1 / (1 - (1 - 1/y)) = 1 / (1 - 1 + 1/y) = 1 / (1/y) = y\n\nSo, yes, for every y except zero, there is an x such that f(x) = y.\n\nTherefore, the range of f(x) is all real numbers except zero.\n\nIn interval notation, that would be (-\u221e, 0) U (0, \u221e).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (-\u221e, -1) U (1, \u221e)\n\nB. (-\u221e, 0) U (0, \u221e)\n\nC. [-1, 1]\n\nD. (-1, 1)\n\nSo, option B seems to match what I've concluded.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to find the range is to consider the behavior of the function.\n\nAs x approaches 1 from the left, 1 - x approaches 0 from the positive side, so f(x) approaches positive infinity.\n\nAs x approaches 1 from the right, 1 - x approaches 0 from the negative side, so f(x) approaches negative infinity.\n\nAnd as x goes to negative infinity, 1 - x goes to positive infinity, so f(x) approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nAs x goes to positive infinity, 1 - x goes to negative infinity, so f(x) approaches 0 from the negative side.\n\nSo, the function can take very large positive values, very large negative values, and values close to zero but never actually zero.\n\nTherefore, the range is all real numbers except zero, which is (-\u221e, 0) U (0, \u221e).\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the function is a hyperbola, and hyperbolas like this one have ranges that exclude a certain value, in this case, zero.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any y-values that can't be reached.\n\nSuppose y = 0. Then, from y = 1 / (1 - x), we'd have 0 = 1 / (1 - x), which is impossible because no real number divided by another real number can be zero unless the numerator is zero, but here the numerator is 1.\n\nSo, y can't be zero.\n\nAlso, for any other y, we can find an x such that y = 1 / (1 - x), as shown earlier.\n\nTherefore, the range is indeed all real numbers except zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. (-\u221e, 0) U (0, \u221e)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
