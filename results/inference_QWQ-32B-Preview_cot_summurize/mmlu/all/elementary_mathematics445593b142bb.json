                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Coach Wu has a total of 30 soccer balls. Out of these, 9 are white. That means the remaining soccer balls are either blue, pink, or green, and there's an equal number of each of these colors.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many soccer balls are not white. Since there are 30 soccer balls in total and 9 are white, I can subtract the white ones from the total to find the number of colored balls:\n\n30 (total balls) - 9 (white balls) = 21 (colored balls)\n\nSo, there are 21 soccer balls that are either blue, pink, or green.\n\nThe problem says that there is an equal number of blue, pink, and green balls. That means the 21 colored balls are divided equally among the three colors.\n\nTo find out how many balls there are of each color, I can divide the number of colored balls by 3:\n\n21 (colored balls) \u00f7 3 = 7 (balls per color)\n\nTherefore, there are 7 green soccer balls.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Total balls are 30, white balls are 9, so 30 - 9 = 21 colored balls. These 21 balls are equally divided among blue, pink, and green, so 21 \u00f7 3 = 7.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 7 green soccer balls.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 7\n\nB. 10\n\nC. 21\n\nD. 39\n\nOption A is 7, which matches my calculation.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]\n"
