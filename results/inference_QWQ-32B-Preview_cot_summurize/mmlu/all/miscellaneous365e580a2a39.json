According to Greek mythology, Cronus, fearing that his children would overthrow him just as he had overthrown his own father Uranus, swallowed his children as they were born. Rhea, however, managed to save Zeus by giving Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead of the infant. Zeus was then hidden away and later returned to overthrow Cronus and the Titans, becoming the king of the gods on Mount Olympus."
