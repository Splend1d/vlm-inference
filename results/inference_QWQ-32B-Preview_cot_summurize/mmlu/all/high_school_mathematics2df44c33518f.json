                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Sarah has five previous times for swimming 50 meters: 86, 94, 97, 88, and 96 seconds. She does a sixth attempt, and after that, her median time becomes 92 seconds. We need to find out what her sixth time was.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a median is. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers when they are ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nOkay, so before the sixth attempt, she has five times: 86, 94, 97, 88, and 96. Let's order these to find the median.\n\nSorting them: 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThe median of these five times is the third one, which is 94 seconds.\n\nNow, after the sixth attempt, the median becomes 92 seconds. That means with six times, the median will be the average of the third and fourth times.\n\nLet's denote her sixth time as x. So now, we have six times: 86, 94, 97, 88, 96, and x.\n\nWe need to order these six times and find the third and fourth values to average them and set equal to 92.\n\nWait a minute, I should include x in the list and then sort them.\n\nSo, the list is: 86, 94, 97, 88, 96, x.\n\nLet's consider different possibilities for x and see what the median would be.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to think about where x fits in the ordered list.\n\nFirst, let's order the original five times: 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nNow, we add x to this list and order the six times.\n\nThe median will be the average of the third and fourth times.\n\nWe know that the median is 92, so:\n\n(third time + fourth time)/2 = 92\n\nTherefore, third time + fourth time = 184.\n\nWe need to find x such that when added to the ordered list, the sum of the third and fourth times is 184.\n\nLet's consider different cases based on the value of x.\n\nCase 1: x is less than or equal to 86.\n\nThen the ordered list would be: x, 86, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThird time is 88, fourth is 94.\n\nSum: 88 + 94 = 182, which is less than 184.\n\nBut we need it to be 184. So this doesn't work.\n\nCase 2: x is greater than 86 but less than or equal to 88.\n\nThen the ordered list would be: 86, x, 88, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThird time is 88, fourth is 94.\n\nSum: 88 + 94 = 182, which is still less than 184.\n\nNot enough.\n\nCase 3: x is greater than 88 but less than or equal to 94.\n\nThen the ordered list would be: 86, 88, x, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThird time is x, fourth is 94.\n\nSo, x + 94 = 184.\n\nTherefore, x = 184 - 94 = 90.\n\nLet's check if this fits: x = 90.\n\nOrdered list: 86, 88, 90, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThird time is 90, fourth is 94.\n\nAverage: (90 + 94)/2 = 92. Perfect!\n\nSo, x = 90 is a possible time.\n\nCase 4: x is greater than 94 but less than or equal to 96.\n\nThen the ordered list would be: 86, 88, 94, x, 96, 97.\n\nThird time is 94, fourth is x.\n\nSo, 94 + x = 184.\n\nTherefore, x = 184 - 94 = 90.\n\nBut in this case, x is greater than 94, but 90 is less than 94. So this doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, x cannot be in this range.\n\nCase 5: x is greater than 96.\n\nThen the ordered list would be: 86, 88, 94, 96, x, 97.\n\nThird time is 94, fourth is 96.\n\nSum: 94 + 96 = 190, which is greater than 184.\n\nNot a match.\n\nSo, the only case that works is when x is between 88 and 94, specifically x = 90.\n\nLet me double-check if there are other possibilities.\n\nSuppose x is exactly 94.\n\nThen the ordered list would be: 86, 88, 94, 94, 96, 97.\n\nThird and fourth times are both 94.\n\nAverage: (94 + 94)/2 = 94, which is not 92.\n\nSo, x cannot be 94.\n\nSimilarly, if x is less than 86, as in case 1, the sum is 182, which is too low.\n\nIf x is between 88 and 94, only x = 90 gives the required sum of 184.\n\nTherefore, the sixth time must be 90 seconds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 92\n\nB. 90\n\nC. 87\n\nD. 10\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 90.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]"
