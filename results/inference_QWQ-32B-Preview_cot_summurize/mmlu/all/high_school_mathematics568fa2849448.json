                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that a number \\( x \\) factors as \\( 107 \\cdot 109^5 \\), and 107 and 109 are primes. I need to find the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of \\( x^{11} \\). The options are 9, 55, 21, and 11.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. I know that \\( x \\) is given as \\( 107 \\cdot 109^5 \\), and since 107 and 109 are primes, this is already its prime factorization. Now, I need to find the exponent of 109 in \\( x^{11} \\).\n\nI recall that when you raise a product to a power, you raise each factor to that power. So, \\( x^{11} = (107 \\cdot 109^5)^{11} = 107^{11} \\cdot (109^5)^{11} \\).\n\nNext, I need to simplify \\( (109^5)^{11} \\). I know that when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, \\( (109^5)^{11} = 109^{5 \\cdot 11} = 109^{55} \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( x^{11} = 107^{11} \\cdot 109^{55} \\).\n\nNow, the question is asking for the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of \\( x^{11} \\). From the expression above, it's clear that the exponent is 55.\n\nLooking back at the options, 55 is one of them. So, I think the answer is B. 55.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, \\( x = 107 \\cdot 109^5 \\).\n\nThen, \\( x^{11} = (107 \\cdot 109^5)^{11} \\).\n\nApplying the power to each factor: \\( 107^{11} \\cdot (109^5)^{11} \\).\n\nSimplifying the second part: \\( (109^5)^{11} = 109^{55} \\).\n\nSo, \\( x^{11} = 107^{11} \\cdot 109^{55} \\).\n\nYes, the exponent of 109 is indeed 55.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{55} \\]"
