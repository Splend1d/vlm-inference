                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about GDP and different components of spending. Let me see if I can figure this out. GDP is supposed to be equal to the sum of consumer spending, government spending, investments, and net exports, right? Net exports being exports minus imports.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\nGDP = Consumer Spending + Government Spending + Investments + (Exports - Imports)\n\nI'm given:\n\nGDP = $10 million\n\nConsumer Spending = $6 million\n\nGovernment Spending = $3 million\n\nExports = $2 million\n\nImports = $3 million\n\nI need to find out how much is spent on investments. So, I can plug in the values into the formula and solve for investments.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n10 = 6 + 3 + Investments + (2 - 3)\n\nFirst, calculate net exports:\n\nExports - Imports = 2 - 3 = -1 million\n\nSo, net exports are negative $1 million.\n\nNow, plug that back into the equation:\n\n10 = 6 + 3 + Investments + (-1)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n6 + 3 = 9\n\n9 + (-1) = 8\n\nSo, now it's:\n\n10 = 8 + Investments\n\nTo find investments, subtract 8 from both sides:\n\nInvestments = 10 - 8 = 2 million\n\nSo, investments are $2 million.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $0 million\n\nB. $1 million\n\nC. $2 million\n\nD. $3 million\n\nIt looks like C. $2 million is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\nGDP = Consumer Spending + Government Spending + Investments + (Exports - Imports)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n10 = 6 + 3 + Investments + (2 - 3)\n\nNet exports: 2 - 3 = -1\n\nSo:\n\n10 = 6 + 3 + Investments - 1\n\nCombine the constants on the right:\n\n6 + 3 = 9\n\n9 - 1 = 8\n\nSo:\n\n10 = 8 + Investments\n\nTherefore, Investments = 10 - 8 = 2 million\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the expenditure approach to GDP. The expenditure approach says that GDP is the total amount spent on final goods and services in an economy. So, it includes what consumers spend, what the government spends, what investors spend, and the net spending from abroad, which is net exports.\n\nIn this case, we're given all the components except investments, so it's straightforward to solve for investments.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the answer is $2 million.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
