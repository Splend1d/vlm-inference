                    "text": "So Gary claims he won $1000 in the lottery because he's really good at picking numbers. The question is asking about his locus of control. Locus of control refers to whether people believe they can control the events in their lives or not. There are two main types: internal and external. Internal locus of control means someone believes they have control over their life's outcomes, while external locus of control means they believe outside forces control their life's outcomes.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. External, powerful others\n\nB. Internal\n\nC. External, chance\n\nD. Secondary\n\nFirst, let's understand each option:\n\nA. External, powerful others: This suggests that Gary believes some powerful external forces or people are responsible for his win.\n\nB. Internal: This would mean Gary believes his own skills and efforts led to his win.\n\nC. External, chance: This suggests that Gary attributes his win to luck or chance, beyond his control.\n\nD. Secondary: This isn't a standard category in locus of control theory, so maybe it's a typo or miswording.\n\nNow, the question mentions that Gary \"really knows how to pick those numbers.\" This implies that he believes his skill in choosing numbers led to his winning the lottery. So, he is attributing his success to his own abilities rather than external forces or luck.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Gary has an internal locus of control regarding his lottery win. He believes his knowledge and skills in picking numbers were the key factors.\n\nHowever, let's consider the options again. Option B is \"Internal,\" which aligns with what we've just thought. But option A is \"External, powerful others,\" which doesn't fit because there's no mention of others influencing his win. Option C is \"External, chance,\" which would suggest he thinks it was just luck, but he specifically says he knows how to pick the numbers, indicating he doesn't see it as chance. Option D, \"Secondary,\" is unclear and probably not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B. Internal.\n\nBut wait a minute. Lotteries are games of chance. Each number has an equal probability of being drawn, and past picks don't influence future draws. So, in reality, there's no skill involved in picking lottery numbers. However, Gary believes he has this skill, which is a misconception.\n\nDespite this reality, the question is about his perceived locus of control, not about the actual nature of lotteries. Since he believes his skill in picking numbers led to his win, he is exhibiting an internal locus of control.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that if he believed he won because of luck or some external force, that would be an external locus of control. But since he attributes it to his own ability, it's internal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Internal.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A, \"External, powerful others\": This might apply if Gary believed that someone else helped him win, like a friend giving him lucky numbers or a psychic's prediction. But in this case, he says he really knows how to pick the numbers himself, so it's his own ability, not someone else's influence.\n\nOption C, \"External, chance\": This would apply if Gary thought he won purely by luck, without any skill involved. But again, he asserts that he knows how to pick the numbers, suggesting he believes there's a skill component.\n\nOption D, \"Secondary\": This doesn't make much sense in the context of locus of control. Maybe it's a mistake, and it should be \"external, chance,\" but that's speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, Gary's belief that his knowledge in picking numbers led to his lottery win indicates an internal locus of control. So, the correct answer is B. Internal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
