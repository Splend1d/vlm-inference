                    "text": "Let's see, I need to pick the correct description of utilitarianism. I remember that utilitarianism is about maximizing happiness or good for the greatest number of people. So, let me look at these options.\n\nOption A says: \"A theory which states that an action is morally incorrect if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\" Hmm, that sounds odd. If it's promoting the greatest good for the greatest number, shouldn't that be morally correct, not incorrect? Maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nOption B says: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the decision maker.\" That sounds more like egoism, where the individual's good is the priority. Utilitarianism is supposed to be about the greater good, not just the individual's good.\n\nOption C says: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the smallest number.\" That seems contrary to what I've learned. Utilitarianism aims for the greatest good for the greatest number, so focusing on the smallest number would be the opposite.\n\nOption D says: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\" Yeah, that aligns with what I know about utilitarianism. It's about maximizing overall happiness or utility.\n\nWait, option A and option D are almost identical except for \"morally incorrect\" versus \"morally right.\" So, if promoting the greatest good for the greatest number is the goal, then doing so should make the action morally right, not incorrect.\n\nMaybe I should double-check. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory, meaning that the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes. The key is to maximize utility, which is often interpreted as happiness, well-being, or preference satisfaction.\n\nSo, if an action leads to the greatest good for the greatest number, it should be considered morally right. That would make option D the correct choice.\n\nOption A seems to be a misstatement, perhaps a typo or a trick option. It says that promoting the greatest good for the greatest number makes an action morally incorrect, which contradicts the basic principle of utilitarianism.\n\nOption B is incorrect because utilitarianism isn't about maximizing the good just for the decision maker but for everyone affected by the action.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because aiming for the greatest good for the smallest number goes against the utilitarian goal of maximizing overall good.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: \"A theory which states that an action is morally right if it promotes the greatest good for the greatest number.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
