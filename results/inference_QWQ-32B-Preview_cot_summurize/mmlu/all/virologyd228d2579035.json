These viruses are endemic in certain regions where specific rodent species serve as reservoirs. For example, Lassa fever, caused by the Lassa virus (an arenavirus), is common in parts of West Africa where the multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) is prevalent. Human infection occurs when people come into contact with environments contaminated by these rodents' excretions, particularly through breathing in dust particles that contain the virus.\n\nWhile sexual contact can transmit some viruses, it is not the primary mode of transmission for arenaviruses. Bloodborne transmission can occur in healthcare settings through contact with infected blood or body fluids, but again, this is not the main route of spread in natural settings. Mosquito bites are not known to transmit arenaviruses; instead, they are associated with other types of viruses like flaviviruses and alphaviruses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Aerosols of urine from infected small mammals."
