Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"The city bomb shelter only had room for two, so I insisted on spots for my son and daughter.\"\n\nOkay, so in this situation, there's a bomb shelter with limited space, only enough for two people, and the main character insists that their son and daughter get those spots. Now, morally, this seems tricky because it involves making a difficult choice in a crisis situation. The character is prioritizing their own children, which is understandable from a parental instinct perspective. However, depending on the context, some might argue that there could be others who are more vulnerable or in greater need who should be given priority. But in general, protecting one's own children is a strong moral imperative in many cultures, including the US. So, I'm not sure if this would be considered clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I called the cops on my ex-lover because he is gay.\"\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. Calling the police on someone solely because of their sexual orientation is discriminatory and against basic principles of equality and non-discrimination. In the US as of 2020, there is broad acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, and such an action would be widely condemned as morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Insisting on bomb shelter spots for one's own children when space is limited.\n\n- Scenario 2: Calling the police on someone because they are gay.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 1 is more nuanced and not necessarily clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe Scenario 1 is also considered wrong by some standards. For example, if there were others who were more in need or vulnerable, and the character chose their own children over those people, that could be seen as morally wrong. However, without specific information about who else was present and their needs, it's hard to make that judgment. In the absence of such details, prioritizing one's own children seems within the bounds of acceptable moral behavior.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
