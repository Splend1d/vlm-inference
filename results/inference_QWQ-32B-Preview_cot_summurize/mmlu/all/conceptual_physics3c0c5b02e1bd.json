                    "text": "A capacitor is a fundamental component in electrical engineering and physics, primarily used for storing electrical energy. To understand what a capacitor can store, let's delve into its basic principles and functionality.\n\nFirstly, a capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the plates, one plate accumulates positive charge, and the other accumulates an equal amount of negative charge. This separation of charges creates an electric field within the dielectric, which stores the energy.\n\nSo, to directly answer the question: a capacitor can store both charge and energy. Let's break this down further.\n\n**Storing Charge:**\n\nWhen a capacitor is connected to a voltage source, such as a battery, it begins to accumulate charge on its plates. The amount of charge (Q) that a capacitor can store is directly proportional to the voltage (V) applied across it, and this relationship is defined by the capacitance (C) of the capacitor, as expressed in the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\times V \\]\n\nThis shows that the capacitor stores charge, and the amount stored depends on its capacitance and the applied voltage.\n\n**Storing Energy:**\n\nIn addition to storing charge, a capacitor also stores electrical energy in the electric field between its plates. The energy (W) stored in a capacitor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2 \\]\n\nor equivalently,\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{Q^2}{C} \\]\n\nThis demonstrates that the energy stored increases with the square of the voltage or the charge, depending on how you look at it. This stored energy can be released when the capacitor is disconnected from the voltage source and connected to a load, such as in circuits designed for timing, filtering, or power supply applications.\n\n**Both Charge and Energy:**\n\nGiven the above explanations, it's clear that a capacitor performs dual functions: it stores charge, which in turn allows it to store energy in its electric field. These two aspects are inherently linked through the capacitance value and the applied voltage.\n\n**Neither Charge nor Energy:**\n\nOption D, \"Neither of these,\" is incorrect because, as explained, capacitors do store both charge and energy. This option might be misleading if one doesn't understand the basic operation of capacitors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is C. Both of these. A capacitor stores both charge and energy, with the charge leading to the storage of energy in the electric field between its plates. This dual functionality makes capacitors indispensable in a wide range of electronic devices and systems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
