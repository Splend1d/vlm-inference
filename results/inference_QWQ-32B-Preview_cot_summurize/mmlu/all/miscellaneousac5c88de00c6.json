These genes are segments of DNA that contain instructions for the development, functioning, and reproduction of living organisms. Heredity explains why family members often resemble each other in terms of physical appearance, behavior, and other traits.\n\nTo clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\n- Heresy refers to a belief or opinion that is strongly at variance with established doctrines, especially in religion.\n\n- Homogeneity refers to the quality or state of being homogeneous; that is, composed of parts or elements that are all of the same kind.\n\n- Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. heredity."
