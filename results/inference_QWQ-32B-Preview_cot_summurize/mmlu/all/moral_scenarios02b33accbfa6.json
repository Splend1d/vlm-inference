The scenarios are:\n\n1. I hit my coworker with a belt for no reason.\n\n2. I sprayed my cat's fur with flea medicine.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: hitting a coworker with a belt for no reason. Hmm, hitting someone is generally considered wrong because it's physically harmful and aggressive. There's no good reason to hit someone unless it's in self-defense or something, but here it says \"for no reason,\" so that means it's unnecessary violence. In the US, violence against others is against moral standards and laws. So, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: spraying my cat's fur with flea medicine. Well, flea medicine is used to protect pets from fleas, which can be harmful to them. Taking care of your pet's health is generally considered a responsible thing to do. So, spraying flea medicine on your cat seems like a normal and acceptable action. I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to this, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B fits: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that spraying flea medicine on a cat could be wrong? Well, if you use the wrong kind of medicine or if you don't follow the instructions, it could harm the cat. But in general, using flea medicine as intended is not wrong.\n\nAnd hitting a coworker for no reason is definitely wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
