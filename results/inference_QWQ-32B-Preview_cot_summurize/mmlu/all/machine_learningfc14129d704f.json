                    "text": "So I've got these two statements about neural networks and I need to decide if they're true or false. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"CIFAR-10 classification performance for convolutional neural networks can exceed 95%.\"\n\nFirst off, CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It's widely used for training and testing machine learning and computer vision algorithms. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to architecture for image classification tasks like this.\n\nI know that CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10. In fact, I recall that architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and even simpler models with data augmentation can get above 95% accuracy. For example, a ResNet-110 or ResNet-164 can achieve around 95% to 96% accuracy. So, it seems like this statement is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Ensembles of neural networks do not improve classification accuracy since the representations they learn are highly correlated.\"\n\nThis statement is about ensembles in neural networks. An ensemble is when you combine multiple models to make predictions, usually to improve performance.\n\nI think the key point here is whether the representations learned by different neural networks are highly correlated. If they are, then combining them might not help much because they're essentially doing the same thing. However, if they learn different representations, then ensemble methods can improve accuracy by averaging out errors.\n\nIn practice, I've seen that ensembles of neural networks can indeed improve classification accuracy. Even if the individual models are similar, techniques like bagging (bootstrap aggregating) or using different initializations can lead to diverse models whose errors are not perfectly correlated. Therefore, their ensemble can perform better than any single model.\n\nMoreover, methods like ensemble averaging or stacking have been shown to improve performance in many scenarios, including image classification tasks like CIFAR-10.\n\nSo, based on this, I think this statement is false because ensembles can improve accuracy even if the representations are somewhat correlated.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
