                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option is the best example of a negative supply shock to the economy. Let's see what each option means and how it relates to supply shocks.\n\nFirst, what is a supply shock? A supply shock is an event that affects the supply of goods and services in an economy, often leading to a sudden change in prices and output. A negative supply shock reduces the overall supply, which typically results in higher prices and lower production.\n\nOption A: a decrease in government spending. Government spending is part of fiscal policy and affects aggregate demand, not directly supply. So, this seems like it's more related to demand side rather than supply side.\n\nOption B: a decrease in the real interest rate. Lower interest rates usually stimulate borrowing and investment, which can increase demand but don't directly affect supply. So, this also seems more related to demand than supply.\n\nOption C: an increase in the money supply. Increasing the money supply typically leads to more liquidity in the economy, which can increase demand, but again, it doesn't directly impact supply.\n\nOption D: unexpectedly higher resource prices. Now, this seems relevant to supply. If resource prices rise unexpectedly, it becomes more expensive for producers to make their goods, which can reduce the supply because their costs have increased. This would be a negative supply shock because it makes production less profitable, leading to lower supply and potentially higher prices.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option D seems to be the best example of a negative supply shock.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in the other options.\n\nOption A: decreased government spending could affect demand, but as I thought, it's not directly a supply shock.\n\nOption B: lower real interest rates encourage borrowing and spending, again affecting demand more than supply.\n\nOption C: increasing the money supply typically influences demand by making more money available for spending and investment.\n\nOption D: higher resource prices directly increase production costs, which affects supply.\n\nYes, I think I'm correct. Option D is the best example of a negative supply shock.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
