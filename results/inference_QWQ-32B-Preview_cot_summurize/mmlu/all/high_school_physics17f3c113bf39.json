                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a disk that's rotating, and I need to find out how far a point on the edge of the disk travels in a certain amount of time. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, the disk has a radius of 0.1 meters, and it starts from rest, which means its initial angular velocity is zero. It has an angular acceleration of 2.0 radians per second squared, and I need to find the total distance traveled by a point on the rim in 4.0 seconds.\n\nOkay, so since the disk is rotating, the point on the rim is moving in a circular path. The distance it travels should be the circumference of the circle it's moving along, multiplied by the number of rotations it makes in that time.\n\nBut wait, the disk is accelerating, so its angular velocity is changing over time. That means the speed at which it's covering the circumference is increasing. So, I probably can't just use a simple formula for constant speed.\n\nI remember that for rotational motion, there are equations similar to the kinematic equations for linear motion. Maybe I can use one of those.\n\nLet's see, the angular displacement \u03b8 can be found using the equation:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03c9\u2080 t + (1/2) \u03b1 t\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03b8 is the angular displacement in radians\n\n- \u03c9\u2080 is the initial angular velocity (which is 0, since it starts from rest)\n\n- \u03b1 is the angular acceleration (2.0 rad/s\u00b2)\n\n- t is time (4.0 s)\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\u03b8 = 0 * 4 + (1/2) * 2.0 * (4.0)\u00b2\n\n\u03b8 = 0 + (1) * 16.0\n\n\u03b8 = 16.0 radians\n\nAlright, so the disk has rotated through 16.0 radians in 4.0 seconds.\n\nNow, I need to find the linear distance traveled by a point on the rim. I know that the arc length s is related to the angular displacement \u03b8 and the radius r by:\n\ns = r \u03b8\n\nSo, s = 0.1 m * 16.0 rad = 1.6 m\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check if there's anything I'm missing.\n\nThe problem says \"total distance traveled by a point on the rim of the disk in 4.0 s.\" And according to this, it's 1.6 meters. But let's see, is there any other factor I should consider? Like, is the disk sliding as well as rotating, or is it just pure rotation?\n\nThe problem says \"the disk only rotates,\" so I think it's just pure rotation, meaning that the point on the rim is only moving due to the rotation, without any translational movement.\n\nTherefore, the distance traveled should indeed be the arc length, which is s = r \u03b8.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the linear velocity of the point on the rim. Linear velocity v is related to angular velocity \u03c9 by v = r \u03c9.\n\nBut since the angular velocity is changing with time due to angular acceleration, I would need to integrate the velocity over time to find the total distance traveled.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nFirst, angular velocity \u03c9 as a function of time is:\n\n\u03c9(t) = \u03c9\u2080 + \u03b1 t\n\nSince \u03c9\u2080 = 0, \u03c9(t) = 2.0 t rad/s\n\nThen, linear velocity v(t) = r \u03c9(t) = 0.1 * 2.0 t = 0.2 t m/s\n\nNow, the distance traveled s is the integral of v(t) from t=0 to t=4.0 s:\n\ns = \u222b v(t) dt from 0 to 4.0\n\ns = \u222b 0.2 t dt from 0 to 4.0\n\ns = 0.2 * (t\u00b2 / 2) evaluated from 0 to 4.0\n\ns = 0.2 * ( (4.0)\u00b2 / 2 - (0)\u00b2 / 2 )\n\ns = 0.2 * (16.0 / 2)\n\ns = 0.2 * 8.0\n\ns = 1.6 m\n\nOkay, so I get the same answer as before. That gives me more confidence that 1.6 meters is correct.\n\nLet me just make sure that I'm using the correct units and that everything makes sense.\n\nRadius r = 0.1 m\n\nAngular acceleration \u03b1 = 2.0 rad/s\u00b2\n\nTime t = 4.0 s\n\nAngular displacement \u03b8 = (1/2) \u03b1 t\u00b2 = (1/2)(2.0)(16.0) = 16.0 radians\n\nLinear distance s = r \u03b8 = (0.1)(16.0) = 1.6 m\n\nAlternatively, using linear velocity integration, s = \u222b v(t) dt = 1.6 m\n\nBoth methods give the same result, so I think it's correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.4 m\n\nB. 0.8 m\n\nC. 1.2 m\n\nD. 1.6 m\n\nMy answer matches option D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other aspect I might have overlooked.\n\nIs the disk rolling without slipping? The problem doesn't mention anything about translation, so I assume it's just rotating in place.\n\nIf it were rolling without slipping, then there would be both rotational and translational motion, and the total distance traveled by a point on the rim would be different.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"the disk only rotates,\" so I think my approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the point on the rim is moving in a circular path with a circumference of 2 \u03c0 r = 2 * \u03c0 * 0.1 \u2248 0.628 m.\n\nIn 4.0 seconds, with angular acceleration of 2.0 rad/s\u00b2, it rotates through 16.0 radians, which is 16.0 / (2 \u03c0) \u2248 2.546 rotations.\n\nSo, the distance traveled should be 2.546 * circumference \u2248 2.546 * 0.628 \u2248 1.6 m, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is 1.6 meters, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
