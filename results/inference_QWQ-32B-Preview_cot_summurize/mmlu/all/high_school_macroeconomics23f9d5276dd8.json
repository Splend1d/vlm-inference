                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options is an example of contractionary monetary policy. Let me see what each one means.\n\nFirst, option A: \"The Fed lowers the reserve ratio.\" I know that the reserve ratio is the amount of money banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. If the Fed lowers this ratio, banks can lend out more money, which usually stimulates the economy. So, that seems like an expansionary policy, not contractionary.\n\nNext, option B: \"The Fed lowers the discount rate.\" The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges banks for loans. If the Fed lowers this rate, it makes borrowing cheaper for banks, which again, leads to more lending and economic stimulation. So, this also seems like expansionary policy.\n\nOption C: \"The Fed increases taxes on household income.\" Hmm, I thought taxes are more related to fiscal policy, which is handled by the government, not the central bank. Usually, the Fed doesn't directly control taxes. So, this might not be the right answer.\n\nFinally, option D: \"The Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks.\" Selling Treasury securities means the Fed is taking money out of the banking system because banks are paying for those securities. This reduces the amount of money banks have to lend, which should slow down economic activity. That sounds like contractionary monetary policy.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option D is the correct answer. Contractionary monetary policy is aimed at reducing the money supply to slow down the economy, perhaps to control inflation. Selling Treasury securities is a way to do that because it withdraws money from the banks.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A and B both involve actions that increase lending and economic activity, which are expansionary. Option C involves taxes, which is usually fiscal policy, not monetary policy. Option D involves reducing the money supply, which is contractionary.\n\nYeah, I think D is the right answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
