The manufacturer answered, denying all liability and stating that it had never supplied its insulation to the worker's employer. The worker's attorney deposed the manufacturer's president, and the manufacturer's attorney deposed the worker. Immediately thereafter, the manufacturer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the worker had no evidence showing that the insulation had ever been used by the worker's employer.

Argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability, and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\nB. Argue that the motion should be denied, because a central issue in the case will be the manufacturer's credibility on the question of its distribution of the insulation, and only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\nC.

                    "text": "I think I need to figure out the best way for the construction worker to respond to the manufacturer's motion for summary judgment. So, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's summary judgment? It's when a court decides a case without a trial, saying that there's no need for a trial because there's no dispute about the facts, and one side should win as a matter of law.\n\nIn this case, the manufacturer is saying, \"We never supplied insulation to the worker's employer, so there's no connection between our product and his health condition. Therefore, there's no case to go to trial.\"\n\nThe worker needs to show that there's at least some evidence that the manufacturer's insulation was used by his employer, and that it caused his health condition.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Argue for more discovery time and attach a declaration describing desired discovery.\n\nThis could be a good approach. Maybe the worker's attorney hasn't had enough time to gather all the evidence needed to show that the manufacturer's insulation was used by the worker's employer. By asking for more discovery time, the attorney can try to find documents, witness statements, or other evidence that links the manufacturer's product to the work sites.\n\nB. Argue that only a jury can decide questions of credibility.\n\nThis might not be the strongest argument here. While it's true that juries decide on credibility, the issue here is whether there's any evidence to support the claim that the manufacturer's insulation was used by the employer. If there's no evidence, then it doesn't matter what a jury thinks about credibility; the case shouldn't go to trial.\n\nC. Argue that the manufacturer failed to attach evidence showing their insulation wasn't used.\n\nI don't think this is correct because, in summary judgment motions, the burden is on the party opposing the motion to show that there's a genuine dispute of material fact. So, it's the worker's responsibility to show that there's evidence supporting his claim, not the manufacturer's responsibility to disprove it.\n\nD. Make a cross-motion for summary judgment arguing that the manufacturer has introduced no evidence to show that its insulation did not harm the worker.\n\nThis seems counterintuitive. The manufacturer is the one moving for summary judgment, saying there's no connection. The worker shouldn't be making a cross-motion for summary judgment; instead, he should be opposing the manufacturer's motion.\n\nSo, between options A and B, I think A is better. Asking for more discovery time allows the worker's attorney to gather evidence that could establish the link between the manufacturer's insulation and the worker's employer.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Maybe there's evidence from the depositions that can show a connection. For example, in the president's deposition, maybe there are statements that suggest the manufacturer did supply insulation to the worker's employer, contrary to what's being claimed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the worker's deposition provides information about the types of insulation he was exposed to, which could be linked to the manufacturer's product.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are product labels, invoices, or other documents that can be discovered to show the connection.\n\nIn any case, arguing for more discovery time seems like a prudent step to ensure that all possible evidence is considered before deciding on summary judgment.\n\nOption B, about only a jury deciding credibility, might be a weak argument because the issue isn't solely about credibility; it's about whether there's any evidence to support the claim. Even if the worker thinks the manufacturer is not being credible, if there's no evidence of supply to the employer, the court might still grant summary judgment.\n\nTherefore, the best response is likely A: argue that more time is needed for additional discovery to show the manufacturer's liability and attach a declaration describing the desired discovery.\n\nThis way, the worker's attorney can outline what specific evidence they need to gather and how it would support the claim, giving the court a reason to deny the summary judgment motion and allow further discovery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
