                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's an employee who works as a delivery person for a drugstore. His job is to deliver prescriptions and other items like toiletries, cosmetics, vitamins, and gift products to customers. One day, during his work hours, he remembers it's his girlfriend's birthday and decides to buy her a bottle of perfume from the pharmacy's cosmetics department. He pays $79.95 for it and has it gift-wrapped. Then, while he's supposed to be making deliveries, he drives to his girlfriend's house in the company van to deliver the perfume personally. This happens during his regular working hours, and he's on his way to make another delivery when this occurs.\n\nWhile driving to his girlfriend's house, he's in a hurry and runs a red light, colliding with another vehicle. The other driver was going on a green light and tried to avoid the collision but couldn't. The driver was injured, and both cars were damaged extensively. Now, if this driver sues the drugstore to recover damages from the accident, what will probably happen?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Prevail, because the employee paid for the perfume.\n\nB. Prevail, because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident.\n\nC. Not prevail, because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\n\nD. Not prevail, because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these options is most likely correct in this scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of employer liability for employees' actions. Generally, employers can be held liable for the actions of their employees if those actions occur within the scope of employment. This is known as vicarious liability.\n\nSo, the key here is determining whether the employee's actions were within the scope of his employment when the accident happened.\n\nLet's look at what the employee was doing. He was on his way to deliver a personal gift to his girlfriend, something that was purely for his own purposes, not related to his job duties. He bought the perfume with his own money, which might be relevant, but the fact remains that he was using the company van to go deliver a personal item during work hours.\n\nWas he furthering the employer's business at the time of the accident? It doesn't seem so. His action of delivering a personal gift to his girlfriend isn't something that benefits the drugstore; it's a purely personal errand.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider whether the employee was still within the course of his employment. Sometimes, even if an employee takes a detour for personal business, the connection to employment can still exist, especially if the personal errand is incidental to the employment.\n\nIn this case, the employee was en route to make another delivery when he decided to make a stop at his girlfriend's house. So, he was still generally in the course of his employment, but the specific act of delivering the perfume was for personal reasons.\n\nJurisdictions have different tests for determining scope of employment. Some consider whether the act was authorized by the employer, whether it was committed for the employer's benefit, or whether it was incidental to the employee's duties.\n\nHere, buying and delivering the perfume wasn't authorized by the employer, wasn't for the employer's benefit, and wasn't incidental to his duties, beyond perhaps using the company van.\n\nBut, because he was still on the job, using the company vehicle, and the accident occurred while he was still performing his employment duties (albeit taking a detour for a personal errand), there might be an argument for the employer's liability.\n\nOption A says the driver will prevail because the employee paid for the perfume. I don't see how the payment for the perfume affects the employer's liability. The payment indicates it was a personal purchase, but that doesn't directly relate to whether the employer is liable for the employee's actions.\n\nOption B says the driver will prevail because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident. This seems plausible because the employee was still on the clock, using the company van, and performing his employment duties, even if he took a detour for a personal errand.\n\nOption C says the driver will not prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident. This also seems plausible because delivering a personal gift isn't within the scope of his employment.\n\nOption D says the driver will not prevail because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee. This seems less relevant. Even if the drugstore wasn't negligent in hiring, if the employee was acting within the scope of employment, the employer could still be liable.\n\nSo, the conflict is between options B and C: whether the employee was acting within or outside the scope of employment.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if an employee deviates from their employment duties for a personal errand, the employer may not be liable for actions taken during that deviation. This is called a frolic of his own.\n\nA frolic of his own is when an employee substantially departs from their employer's business and pursues their own business or purposes. In such cases, the employer isn't liable for the employee's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the employee is still performing employment duties and takes a slight detour for a personal errand, the employer might still be liable.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee was on his way to make a delivery when he decided to make a stop at his girlfriend's house. So, he was still engaged in employment activities but took a detour for a personal errand.\n\nSome courts might consider this a minor deviation that doesn't break the chain of employment, especially since he was still using the company van and was otherwise engaged in employment duties.\n\nOther courts might view it as a significant deviation, such that the employee was on a frolic of their own at the time of the accident.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is likely C: the driver will not prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident because it depends on how the court interprets the scope of employment in this situation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B: the driver will prevail because the employee was under the control and direction of the drugstore at the time of the accident.\n\nBut I think the key is whether the employee was acting within the scope of employment, and in this case, since he was on a personal errand, even if using the company van, it might be considered outside the scope.\n\nI recall that using a company vehicle for personal errands can still keep the employer liable, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that the employee was still within the scope of employment because he was using the company van and was otherwise performing employment duties, and that the deviation was not substantial enough to break the chain of employment.\n\nIf that's the case, then the employer could be liable, and option B would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the court finds that the employee was on a significant detour for purely personal purposes, then the employer might not be liable, and option C would be correct.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the employee was delivering a personal gift, which isn't related to his employment duties, I think option C is more accurate: the driver will not prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure, as employer liability in such situations can vary based on the specific facts and jurisdiction.\n\nMaybe I should look up some case law or legal principles related to employer liability for employees' actions during personal errands.\n\nUpon reviewing relevant legal principles, I find that when an employee deviates from their employment duties for a personal errand, the employer may not be liable for the employee's actions during that deviation.\n\nThis is often referred to as a \"frolic of their own.\" If the employee takes a substantial detour for personal purposes, it's less likely that the employer will be held liable.\n\nHowever, if the deviation is slight and incidental to the employment, the employer may still be liable.\n\nIn this scenario, the employee was on his way to make a delivery when he decided to make a stop at his girlfriend's house to deliver a personal gift. This seems like a substantial detour for personal purposes, especially since he was using the company van to do so.\n\nTherefore, it's more likely that the employee was acting outside the scope of employment at the time of the accident, and the drugstore wouldn't be liable.\n\nHence, option C is probably correct: the driver will not prevail because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option D: not prevail, because the drugstore was not negligent in hiring the employee.\n\nThis seems less relevant because even if the drugstore wasn't negligent in hiring, if the employee was acting within the scope of employment, the employer could still be liable.\n\nHowever, since the employee was likely acting outside the scope of employment, option D could also be considered correct.\n\nBut I think option C is more directly addressing the issue of scope of employment, which is crucial in determining employer liability in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the most probable answer is C: not prevail, because the employee was acting outside the scope of the employment relationship at the time of the accident.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
