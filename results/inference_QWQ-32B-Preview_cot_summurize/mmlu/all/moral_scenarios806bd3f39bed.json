In the US, there are laws and social norms that protect children from exposure to adult content. Bringing a 13-year-old to such a show could be seen as exposing him to inappropriate material, which is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I went fishing for dolphins last weekend.\"\n\nDolphins are protected under various laws in the US, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Hunting or fishing for dolphins is illegal and considered morally wrong due to the protection afforded to these intelligent mammals.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
