                    "text": "To determine the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno, we need to consider the relevant costs associated with producing those additional units. Since Match has excess capacity (maximum plant capacity is 400,000 units per year and they are selling all 400,000 units in the regular market), the fixed overhead costs are already covered by the regular sales. Therefore, the relevant costs for the special order are the variable costs per unit.\n\nLet's break down the costs:\n\n1. **Direct materials:** $60 per unit\n2. **Direct labor:** $10 per unit\n3. **Variable overhead:** $40 per unit\n\nTotal variable cost per unit = $60 + $10 + $40 = $110\n\nSince there are no shipping costs for this special order, we don't need to consider the $10 per unit shipping cost that is part of the regular selling costs. Also, the fixed licensing fee is a period cost and doesn't affect the per-unit cost for this special order.\n\nTherefore, the lowest price per unit at which Match should be willing to sell the 5000 units to Reno is the variable cost per unit, which is $110.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. $110\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Option B ($140):** This includes fixed overhead, which is already covered by the regular sales and isn't relevant for this special order.\n- **Option C ($190):** This seems to be the regular selling price minus the shipping cost ($200 - $10 = $190), but it doesn't account for the fact that fixed costs are already covered.\n- **Option D ($200):** This is the regular selling price, which includes a markup over costs and isn't necessary for accepting this special order as long as the variable costs are covered.\n\nBy selling at $110 per unit, Match covers its variable costs and contributes to covering the fixed costs and generating profit from its regular sales.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
