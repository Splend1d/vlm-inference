                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about when the Inca began their military expansion across South America. The options are 200 A.D., 900 A.D., 1450 A.D., and 1650 A.D. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Inca Empire was located in South America and was known for its advanced civilization and extensive empire. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dates of their expansion.\n\nI think the Inca Empire was at its height around the time of the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. So, 1650 A.D. seems too late because that's after the Spanish had already conquered the Inca. Similarly, 200 A.D. seems way too early; that's before the Inca even existed as a significant power.\n\nLet me think about 900 A.D. and 1450 A.D. I believe the Inca civilization started around the 13th century, so 900 A.D. might be a bit early. Maybe their expansion started later.\n\nI recall that the Inca ruler Pachacuti is famous for beginning the expansion of the Inca Empire in the 15th century. If that's the case, then 1450 A.D. seems like a plausible date.\n\nLet me double-check. Pachacuti was an Inca emperor who reigned from about 1438 to 1471. During his reign, he expanded the Inca territory significantly, turning the small kingdom into a large empire.\n\nSo, if the expansion began around 1438, 1450 A.D. would be within that expansion period.\n\nOn the other hand, 1650 A.D. is long after the Spanish conquest, which took place in 1532 when Francisco Pizarro defeated the Inca emperor Atahualpa.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 1450 A.D.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options again. 200 A.D. is during the time of the Moche culture in Peru, which predates the Inca by many centuries. 900 A.D. is around the time of the Wari Empire, another pre-Inca civilization. So, neither of these periods corresponds to the Inca expansion.\n\nThus, the answer is C. 1450 A.D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
