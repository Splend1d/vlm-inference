                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question about Protocol 14. I need to identify which statement among A, B, C, and D is false. I'm a bit rusty on the specifics of Protocol 14, but I remember it made several changes to the functioning of the European Convention on Human Rights system. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation.\" Hmm, I think Protocol 14 did introduce changes to how admissibility decisions are made. I believe it allowed for single judges to declare applications inadmissible in certain cases, which would mean moving from a three-judge committee to a single judge for some admissibility decisions. So, this seems plausible, but I need to verify.\n\nOption B states: \"Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\" I recall that Protocol 14 did introduce new admissibility criteria, particularly regarding the concept of \"significant disadvantage,\" which allows the Court to declare an application inadmissible if the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C says: \"Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\" Now, I know that the Commission was abolished under Protocol 14, and its functions were transferred to the Court and the Committee of Ministers. So, this statement appears to be true.\n\nOption D states: \"Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\" I think the term of office for judges at the European Court was indeed extended by Protocol 14. Previously, judges served for nine years, and Protocol 14 extended this to ten years. So, this seems accurate.\n\nWait a minute, if all these statements seem to be true, then which one is false? Maybe I missed something. Let me double-check each option.\n\nStarting with Option A: \"Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three judge to a one judge formation.\" Actually, Protocol 14 introduced a system where single judges can declare applications inadmissible in certain clear-cut cases, but for other cases, the three-judge panel remains. So, it's not that the committee was changed from three judges to one judge universally, but rather that single judges gained the power to handle some admissibility decisions. Perhaps the statement is too sweeping in saying it changed the committee for all admissibility cases.\n\nOption B: \"Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility.\" As I recall, the \"significant disadvantage\" criterion was indeed added, so this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights.\" Yes, the Commission was abolished, and its supervisory functions were transferred elsewhere, so this is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.\" Yes, the term was extended from nine to ten years.\n\nGiven this, perhaps Option A is the false statement because Protocol 14 did not change all admissibility hearings to be handled by a single judge; instead, it allowed single judges to handle some admissibility decisions, while others still require a three-judge panel.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more to it. Let me look up some details about Protocol 14 to confirm.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Protocol 14 did introduce a new system for admissibility decisions, known as the \"single judge formation.\" This allows a single judge to declare an application inadmissible if it falls within certain categories, such as being manifestly ill-founded or an abuse of the right of application. However, for other applications, the Chamber of three judges continues to handle admissibility and merits together.\n\nTherefore, it's not that the committee was changed from three judges to one judge across the board, but rather that an additional layer was introduced where single judges can deal with straightforward inadmissibility cases. So, the original committee structure for more complex cases remains a three-judge chamber.\n\nHence, statement A is too absolute in saying it changed from a three-judge to a one-judge formation, as in reality, it introduced an additional option for single judges to handle certain cases.\n\nIn contrast, statements B, C, and D accurately describe changes introduced by Protocol 14.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
