In the NBA, the shot clock is set to 24 seconds, meaning that a team must attempt a shot within that time frame or else the game clock will stop and the opposing team will get possession of the ball. The shot clock was introduced in the NBA in 1954 to increase the pace of the game and prevent stalling tactics by teams leading in score. The 24-second limit was chosen after experiments with different time limits, and it has remained the standard in the NBA since its implementation."
