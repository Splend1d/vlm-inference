I need to remember how these things are connected.\n\nFirst off, contractionary monetary policy is when the central bank tries to reduce the money supply in the economy. They do this to curb inflation, basically to cool down the economy when it's heating up too much.\n\nOne tool they use is the discount rate. That's the interest rate the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks. So, if the central bank raises the discount rate, that makes it more expensive for commercial banks to borrow from the central bank. As a result, commercial banks might raise their own interest rates to customers to maintain their profit margins.\n\nSo, if the discount rate increases, the nominal interest rate is likely to increase as well. Nominal interest rate is just the overall level of interest rates in the economy.\n\nNow, when interest rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive. That means people and businesses might borrow less, which can slow down spending. Less spending means less demand for goods and services, which is aggregate demand.\n\nSo, if the central bank increases the discount rate, leading to higher nominal interest rates, that should decrease aggregate demand.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Discount rate decreases, nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand decreases.\n\nB. Discount rate increases, nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand decreases.\n\nC. Discount rate decreases, nominal interest rate decreases, aggregate demand decreases.\n\nD. Discount rate increases, nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand increases.\n\nHmm, options B and D both have discount rate and nominal interest rate increasing, but aggregate demand does different things in each.\n\nWait, in contractionary monetary policy, the goal is to reduce inflation by reducing aggregate demand. So, aggregate demand should decrease.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: discount rate increases, nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand decreases.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the discount rate decreases, that would make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the central bank, which might lead to them lowering their own interest rates, increasing borrowing and spending, and thus increasing aggregate demand. That would be expansionary policy, not contractionary.\n\nSo, option A doesn't make sense for contractionary policy.\n\nOption C has discount rate decreasing and nominal interest rate decreasing, but aggregate demand decreasing. That seems inconsistent. If interest rates are decreasing, borrowing is cheaper, which should increase aggregate demand, not decrease it.\n\nOption D has discount rate and nominal interest rate increasing, but aggregate demand increasing. Again, that doesn't make sense for contractionary policy. Increasing interest rates should decrease aggregate demand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: discount rate increases, nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand decreases.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
