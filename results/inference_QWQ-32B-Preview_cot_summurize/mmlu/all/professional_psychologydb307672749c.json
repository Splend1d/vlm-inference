Let's see:\n\nOption A says \"reducing program costs and beneficiary expenditures.\" Hmm, that sounds more like financial management or cost-control measures. While quality assurance might have some impact on costs, I don't think that's its primary goal.\n\nOption B says \"improving the health status and satisfaction of patients.\" That seems more aligned with what quality assurance aims for. It's about ensuring that patients receive high-quality care and are satisfied with the services they receive.\n\nOption C is \"policing the profession by detecting and dealing appropriately with incompetent psychologists.\" This sounds more like professional regulation or oversight. While quality assurance might involve evaluating the competence of providers, its primary focus is broader and more about the overall quality of care.\n\nOption D is \"guaranteeing that the needs of patients belonging to a particular group or population are being met.\" This seems somewhat related, but it's more specific than the general goal of quality assurance. Quality assurance is about ensuring quality for all patients, not just specific groups.\n\nComparing these, option B seems the most comprehensive and directly related to the core purpose of quality assurance: improving health status and patient satisfaction through high-quality care.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
