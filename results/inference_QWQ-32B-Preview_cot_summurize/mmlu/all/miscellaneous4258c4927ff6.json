Hmm, I need to figure out which one doesn't use cards.\n\nFirst, I know that baccarat is a card game. I've seen it in casinos, and players bet on whether the player or the bank will have a hand closer to 9. So, that's definitely a card game.\n\nNext, rummy. Rummy is also a card game where players draw and discard cards to form melds, which are sets or runs. So, that's cards for sure.\n\nNow, craps. Craps is a dice game, right? It's played with dice, and players make bets based on the outcome of the dice rolls. So, this seems different from the others because it doesn't involve cards.\n\nLastly, solitaire. Solitaire is a single-player card game where you arrange cards in a specific order or pattern. There are many variations, but they all involve cards.\n\nSo, comparing all these, baccarat, rummy, and solitaire are all card games, while craps is a dice game. Therefore, the answer should be C. craps.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Baccarat: cards. Rummy: cards. Craps: dice. Solitaire: cards. Yep, craps is the only one not using cards.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Maybe the question is trying to see if I know that craps is a dice game and not a card game.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
