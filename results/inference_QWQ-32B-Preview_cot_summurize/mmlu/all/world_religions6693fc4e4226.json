                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Guru Nanak and the term he used to denote the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. The options are A. Shabad, B. Khalsa, C. Nam, and D. Guru. I need to recall which one of these refers to the divine word in Sikhism, which was founded by Guru Nanak.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Sikhism, the concept of the divine word is quite important. Guru Nanak emphasized the importance of hearing and meditating on the word of God. So, among these options, I need to figure out which one specifically refers to that divine word.\n\nOption A is \"Shabad.\" I think Shabad is a term used in Sikhism to refer to the divine word or the hymns found in the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the holy scripture of Sikhism. So, Shabad seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption B is \"Khalsa.\" I know that Khalsa is a term that refers to the collective body of baptized Sikhs, those who have undergone the Khalsa initiation ceremony. It's more about the community of committed Sikhs rather than the divine word itself.\n\nOption C is \"Nam.\" Nam typically refers to the name of God or the invocation of God's name, which is a central practice in Sikhism. While it's related to the divine, it's not specifically the term for the divine word as part of revelation.\n\nOption D is \"Guru.\" Guru refers to the spiritual teacher or guide in Sikhism. While the Guru Granth Sahib is considered the eternal guru, the term \"Guru\" itself denotes the teacher rather than the divine word.\n\nComparing these options, it seems that \"Shabad\" is the most appropriate term for the divine word as part of divine revelation in the context of Guru Nanak's teachings.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that in Sikhism, the Shabad is not just any word but the divine utterance that carries the wisdom and guidance from God. It's through the Shabad that divine revelation is conveyed to humanity.\n\nAdditionally, the Guru Granth Sahib is filled with Shabads, which are meant to be recited and meditated upon to connect with the divine. So, this further reinforces that Shabad is the correct term for the divine word.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is A. Shabad.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
