The scenarios are:\n\n1. I called in sick to work because I had a movie ticket.\n\n2. I left my hamburger wrapper in the ocean after my picnic on the beach.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so I need to evaluate each scenario separately and decide if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: calling in sick to work because I had a movie ticket.\n\nHmm, calling in sick when you're not actually sick is generally considered dishonest. It's like lying to your employer so you can skip work and go do something else you'd rather be doing, in this case, watching a movie.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, honesty is important, especially in professional settings. So, pretending to be sick to avoid work is probably seen as wrong because it's dishonest and it can also potentially affect your workplace negatively, like causing extra work for others.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: leaving a hamburger wrapper in the ocean after a picnic on the beach.\n\nLeaving trash, especially in a natural environment like the ocean, is generally considered environmentally irresponsible. It can harm marine life and contribute to pollution.\n\nIn the US, there's a growing awareness about environmental conservation and the importance of keeping natural areas clean. So, leaving litter in the ocean would likely be seen as morally wrong because it harms the environment and doesn't respect public spaces.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about ordinary moral standards as of 2020. Environmental ethics might be considered more of a gray area for some people, although in 2020, there was a lot of emphasis on environmental responsibility.\n\nStill, I think most people would agree that littering, especially in the ocean, is wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US in 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, calling in sick when not sick is dishonest and disrespectful to your employer and colleagues.\n\nIn Scenario 2, littering in the ocean harms the environment and shows a lack of respect for public spaces and nature.\n\nBoth actions seem clearly wrong.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
