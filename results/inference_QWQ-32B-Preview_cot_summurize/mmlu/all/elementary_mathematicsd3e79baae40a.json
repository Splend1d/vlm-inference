                    "text": "So I have this problem here: I need to find which ratio can form a proportion with 3 over 8. The options are A: 18 over 40, B: 18 over 56, C: 24 over 64, and D: 15 over 48. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a proportion is. A proportion is when two ratios are equal. So, if I have 3/8 and another fraction, say x/y, and if 3/8 equals x/y, then they form a proportion.\n\nSo, to find out which of these options is equal to 3/8, I can either cross-multiply and see if the products are equal, or I can simplify each option and see if it reduces to 3/8.\n\nLet me try the cross-multiplication method first.\n\nStarting with option A: 18 over 40.\n\nSo, if 3/8 = 18/40, then by cross-multiplying, 3*40 should equal 8*18.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n3*40 = 120\n\n8*18 = 144\n\n120 \u2260 144, so option A does not form a proportion with 3/8.\n\nNext, option B: 18 over 56.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*56 should equal 8*18.\n\n3*56 = 168\n\n8*18 = 144\n\n168 \u2260 144, so option B is not proportional.\n\nOption C: 24 over 64.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*64 should equal 8*24.\n\n3*64 = 192\n\n8*24 = 192\n\nHey, 192 equals 192, so option C forms a proportion with 3/8.\n\nBut wait, let's check option D too to make sure.\n\nOption D: 15 over 48.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3*48 should equal 8*15.\n\n3*48 = 144\n\n8*15 = 120\n\n144 \u2260 120, so option D is not proportional.\n\nAlternatively, I could have simplified each option and seen if it reduces to 3/8.\n\nLet's try that for option C to confirm.\n\nOption C is 24 over 64.\n\nI can divide both numerator and denominator by 8.\n\n24 \u00f7 8 = 3\n\n64 \u00f7 8 = 8\n\nSo, 24/64 simplifies to 3/8, which matches the given ratio.\n\nSimilarly, for option A: 18/40.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\n40 \u00f7 2 = 20\n\nSo, 18/40 simplifies to 9/20, which is not equal to 3/8.\n\nOption B: 18/56.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2.\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n\n56 \u00f7 2 = 28\n\nSo, 18/56 simplifies to 9/28, which is not equal to 3/8.\n\nOption D: 15/48.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3.\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n48 \u00f7 3 = 16\n\nSo, 15/48 simplifies to 5/16, which is not equal to 3/8.\n\nTherefore, only option C, 24/64, forms a proportion with 3/8.\n\nAlternatively, I could have scaled up the original ratio 3/8 to see which option matches.\n\nIf I multiply both numerator and denominator of 3/8 by 3, I get 9/24.\n\nBy 4, I get 12/32.\n\nBy 5, I get 15/40.\n\nBy 6, I get 18/48.\n\nBy 8, I get 24/64.\n\nLooking at these, 24/64 matches option C.\n\nSo, again, confirming that option C is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have divided both numerator and denominator by the same number to see if I get 3/8.\n\nBut scaling up seems more straightforward in this case.\n\nWait, in option C, 24/64, if I divide both by 8, I get 3/8, which matches.\n\nWhereas for other options, like 18/40, dividing by 2 gives 9/20, which is not 3/8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the ratio that forms a proportion with 3/8 is 24 over 64, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
