                    "text": "In DNA, adenine normally pairs with thymine. So, the correct answer is C. thymine.\n\nTo explain this in more detail, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is composed of four different types of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These bases pair up with each other in a specific way to form the rungs of the DNA ladder, which is shaped like a double helix.\n\nThe pairing is based on hydrogen bonds, and the rules for pairing are as follows:\n\n- Adenine pairs with thymine (A-T)\n\n- Cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G)\n\nThis specific pairing is crucial for the accurate replication of DNA and the transmission of genetic information.\n\nIt's worth noting that in RNA (ribonucleic acid), thymine is replaced by uracil (U), so in RNA, adenine pairs with uracil (A-U). However, since the question is specifically about DNA, the answer is thymine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
