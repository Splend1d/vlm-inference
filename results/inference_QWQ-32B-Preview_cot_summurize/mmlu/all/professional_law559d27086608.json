                    "text": "So Liang is this really smart student from another country who went to school in the U.S. and got degrees, and now he wants to stay here and teach. But there's a state law that says only citizens can be teachers. The question is, could that law stop Liang from teaching?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because states can regulate aliens.\n\nB. Yes, because the teacher could exert too much influence.\n\nC. No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.\n\nD. No, there is no compelling state interest.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what's being asked here. It's about whether a state law requiring citizenship for teachers can prevent Liang from teaching, given that he's not a citizen.\n\nI think this has to do with constitutional law and equal protection. Aliens, or non-citizens, are a suspect class when it comes to legal classifications, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's quasi-suspect? I need to recall the levels of scrutiny for different classifications.\n\nIn equal protection cases, the court uses different levels of scrutiny based on the category of people affected. For racial classifications, it's strict scrutiny, meaning the law must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.\n\nFor gender-based classifications, it's intermediate scrutiny, which is a bit less strict, requiring the law to be substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nThen there are rational basis review, where the law just needs to be rationally related to a legitimate government interest, and that's the easiest test to meet.\n\nSo, for aliens, I think it's rational basis review unless they're denying fundamental rights or it's national origin discrimination.\n\nBut teaching is not a fundamental right, is it? I don't think so. So maybe it's just rational basis review.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. In some cases, alienage is subject to strict scrutiny, especially when a law denies aliens a fundamental right or discriminates based on national origin.\n\nBut teaching is a job, not really a fundamental right. So perhaps it's only subject to rational basis review.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Is there a specific constitutional provision or case law that addresses alienage and employment?\n\nI recall that in the case of Sugarman v. Dougall, the Supreme Court held that New York's requirement that only citizens could hold public employment was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, even under rational basis review.\n\nWait, but in that case, it was public employment, and the Court found that the state's interest in preserving jobs for citizens was not sufficient to justify the discrimination against aliens.\n\nBut in another case, Ambach v. Norwick, the Court upheld a New York law requiring citizenship for public school teachers, saying that it was rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\nHmm, that seems contradictory. In Sugarman, the Court struck down a citizenship requirement for public employment, but in Ambach, it allowed it for public school teachers.\n\nSo, maybe there's a difference based on the nature of the job.\n\nIn Ambach, the Court seemed to think that teachers, especially those teaching courses like citizenship and history, needed to be citizens to effectively teach those subjects.\n\nI think the Court said that there was a rational basis for requiring citizenship for teachers, as they play a vital role in inculcating civic values and citizenship skills.\n\nSo, in that case, the state had a legitimate interest in ensuring that teachers of certain subjects were citizens themselves.\n\nBut, I also recall that in other cases, the Court has been wary of laws that discriminate based on alienage, especially when it comes to accessing public benefits or education.\n\nFor example, in Plyler v. Doe, the Court struck down a Texas law that denied free public education to children who were undocumented immigrants, finding that it violated equal protection.\n\nBut that's different because it was about access to education for children, not about employment.\n\nSo, going back to Liang's situation, he's an alien wanting to teach, and there's a state law saying only citizens can teach.\n\nGiven that Ambach v. Norwick seems to support such laws, at least for public schools, perhaps the answer is that yes, the state law could prevent him from teaching.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"a state law requiring citizenship for teachers,\" and it's about preventing him from doing so.\n\nSo, if the law requires citizenship to teach, and Liang is not a citizen, then yes, the law would prevent him from teaching.\n\nBut the question is asking whether such a law could prevent him from teaching, implying that there might be constitutional issues with the law itself.\n\nGiven that, options A and B suggest that yes, the law could prevent him from teaching, while C and D suggest that no, it couldn't, unless certain standards are met.\n\nLooking back at Ambach v. Norwick, the Court allowed the citizenship requirement for teachers, meaning that such a law is constitutional under certain circumstances.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is A: Yes, because states can regulate aliens.\n\nBut, I feel like there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider the level of scrutiny applied to alienage classifications.\n\nIn general, alienage classifications are subject to strict scrutiny when they interfere with fundamental rights or when they are based on national origin.\n\nBut, as teaching is not a fundamental right, perhaps the law is constitutional under rational basis review.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are other considerations, like the state's interest in preserving jobs for citizens or ensuring loyalty.\n\nBut, in Ambach, the Court seemed to accept the state's interest in having citizens teach certain subjects.\n\nHowever, I also recall that in some contexts, the Court has struck down laws that discriminate based on alienage, even if they're rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\nFor example, in Graham v. Richardson, the Court struck down state laws that denied welfare benefits to aliens, finding that it violated equal protection even under rational basis review.\n\nBut again, that's different because it's about accessing public benefits, not about employment.\n\nMoreover, in Plyler v. Doe, the Court found that denying free public education to undocumented children was unconstitutional, again under equal protection.\n\nBut, in the context of employment, the rules seem different.\n\nIn Sugarman v. Dougall, the Court struck down a New York law that required only citizens to hold public employment, finding that it violated equal protection under the Equal Protection Clause, even under rational basis review.\n\nBut then, in Ambach v. Norwick, the Court allowed a citizenship requirement for public school teachers.\n\nSo, there seems to be a discrepancy here.\n\nPerhaps the key is that teaching involves imparting civic values and citizenship, which is why the state has a stronger interest in requiring citizenship for teachers.\n\nIn any case, given that Ambach v. Norwick upheld such a law, it seems that a state law requiring citizenship for teachers could indeed prevent Liang from teaching, provided that the state has a legitimate interest in doing so.\n\nTherefore, option A seems plausible: Yes, because states can regulate aliens.\n\nOption B says \"Yes, because the teacher could exert too much influence.\" That seems vague and not directly related to any specific legal standard. It might be referring to the state's interest in controlling the influence that teachers have, especially in sensitive subjects like citizenship and history.\n\nOption C says \"No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.\" This seems to suggest that the law couldn't prevent him from teaching unless the state applies rational basis review, which doesn't make much sense. Because rational basis review is a standard of review that the court uses to evaluate the law, not something the state \"uses.\"\n\nOption D says \"No, there is no compelling state interest.\" But in Ambach v. Norwick, the Court found that there was a legitimate state interest in requiring citizenship for teachers, even if it's not a compelling interest.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is A: Yes, because states can regulate aliens, provided that they do so in a way that's consistent with constitutional requirements.\n\nIn this case, since Ambach v. Norwick allows for citizenship requirements for teachers, it seems that such a law could indeed prevent Liang from teaching.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
