                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to find the P-value for a hypothesis test. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a null hypothesis, H0, which says that the population proportion, p, is equal to 0.3. And the alternative hypothesis, HA, is that p is greater than 0.3. So, it's a one-tailed test because we're only interested in whether p is larger than 0.3.\n\nNext, I have a sample proportion, which is denoted by p-hat, and it's equal to 0.35. The sample size is 95. I need to find the P-value based on these values.\n\nI remember that for hypothesis tests about proportions, we can use the z-test if the sample size is large enough. To check if the sample size is large enough, we can use the conditions for the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. That is, n*p0 >= 10 and n*(1 - p0) >= 10, where p0 is the hypothesized proportion under H0.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nn*p0 = 95 * 0.3 = 28.5\n\nn*(1 - p0) = 95 * 0.7 = 66.5\n\nBoth of these are greater than 10, so it's okay to use the z-test.\n\nNow, the formula for the z-score in this case is:\n\nz = (p-hat - p0) / sqrt(p0 * (1 - p0) / n)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nz = (0.35 - 0.3) / sqrt(0.3 * 0.7 / 95)\n\nLet me calculate the denominator first:\n\nsqrt(0.3 * 0.7 / 95) = sqrt(0.21 / 95) = sqrt(0.002210526) \u2248 0.0470\n\nSo, z = (0.35 - 0.3)/0.0470 = 0.05/0.0470 \u2248 1.0638\n\nOkay, so the z-score is approximately 1.06.\n\nNow, since this is a one-tailed test (right-tailed, because HA: p > 0.3), the P-value is the area to the right of z = 1.06 under the standard normal curve.\n\nI need to find P(Z > 1.06), where Z is a standard normal random variable.\n\nI can look this up in a z-table or use a calculator with normal distribution functions.\n\nLooking up z = 1.06 in a standard normal table, I find the area to the left is approximately 0.8554.\n\nSince the total area under the curve is 1, the area to the right is 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446.\n\nTherefore, the P-value is 0.1446.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.06\n\nB. 0.1446\n\nC. 0.2275\n\nD. 0.8554\n\nIt looks like option B is the correct P-value.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, z = (0.35 - 0.3)/sqrt(0.3*0.7/95)\n\nsqrt(0.3*0.7/95) = sqrt(0.21/95) = sqrt(0.002210526) \u2248 0.0470\n\nThen, z = 0.05/0.0470 \u2248 1.0638, which is approximately 1.06.\n\nP(Z > 1.06) = 1 - P(Z < 1.06) = 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the continuity correction, but since n is reasonably large and p is not too close to 0 or 1, I think the approximation is fine without continuity correction.\n\nSo, the P-value is 0.1446, which corresponds to choice B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
