                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate conundrum. So, we've got a developer who bought a 100-acre tract in 1995 and planned to turn it into a subdivision with 100 one-acre residential lots. The subdivision plan was recorded in 1996, and over the next few years, the developer sold 60 lots, each with deeds that included a clause prohibiting mobile homes or house trailers on any lot within the subdivision.\n\nFast forward to 2002, the developer sold the remaining 40 lots to a builder, and the builder subsequently sold all of those lots. Here's the kicker: the deeds from the builder to the new owners didn't include the mobile-home prohibition clause that was in the original 60 deeds sold directly by the developer.\n\nNow, in 2008, one of the buyers from the builder puts a mobile home on their property, and a neighbor who owns a lot from the original 60 is suing to get the mobile home removed. The question is, is there an enforceable restriction against mobile homes on the lots?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. There is no enforceable restriction because the mobile-home provision did not \"run with the land.\"\n\nB. There is no enforceable restriction because the man's deed did not include the mobile-home provision.\n\nC. The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nD. The outcome turns on whether a common development scheme had been organized for the entire subdivision.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what it means for a restriction to \"run with the land.\" In real estate law, for a covenant (which is like a promise in a deed) to run with the land, it has to bind not just the original parties but also their successors. There are rules for covenants running with the land, and generally, they require that the covenant be intended to run with the land, that there's privity of estate, and that there's horizontal and vertical privity.\n\nIn this case, the original 60 deeds had the mobile-home prohibition, but the later 40 deeds sold by the builder didn't include it. So, for the 40 lots sold by the builder, did the mobile-home restriction still apply?\n\nWell, if the restriction is part of a common development scheme for the entire subdivision, it might be argued that it applies to all lots, even if not expressly included in every deed. Subdivision developments often have covenants that apply uniformly to all lots to maintain certain standards or restrictions for the benefit of the entire subdivision.\n\nOption C suggests that the restriction would be enforceable because of the common development scheme. Option D says the outcome depends on whether such a scheme was established.\n\nOption A says there's no enforceable restriction because the provision didn't run with the land. Option B says there's no enforceable restriction because the specific deed didn't include the provision.\n\nI think the key here is whether the mobile-home restriction was part of a general scheme for the entire subdivision or whether it only applied to the lots where it was expressly mentioned in the deed.\n\nGiven that the original subdivision plan was recorded, and the first 60 deeds included the restriction, it seems like there was an intention to have a uniform standard for the subdivision. However, when the builder bought the remaining 40 lots and sold them without including the mobile-home restriction in the deeds, it might be argued that this indication was abandoned for those lots.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if the subdivision plan recorded in 1996 included this restriction and all lots were part of that plan, one could argue that the restriction applies to the entire subdivision, regardless of whether it's mentioned in every deed.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, recorded subdivision plans can impose restrictions on all lots within the subdivision, even if not all deeds expressly include those restrictions. This is especially true if the plan was recorded before the deeds were issued.\n\nMoreover, the original deeds from the developer specified that every lot was to be recorded in the county recorder's office, which suggests that there was a formal process for recording the lots and their associated restrictions.\n\nGiven that, it might be possible for the neighbor to enforce the restriction against the new owner, even though their deed didn't include it, because it's part of the overall subdivision plan.\n\nHowever, this could also depend on whether the subdivision was set up with a homeowners' association or some other governing body that enforces the covenants. If there's no such entity, and the restriction isn't in the deed, it might be harder to enforce.\n\nOption D seems a bit vague, as it says the outcome turns on whether a common development scheme was organized. While that's relevant, it doesn't directly answer whether the restriction is enforceable.\n\nOption C is more definitive, stating that the restriction would be enforceable because of the common development scheme.\n\nOption B says there's no enforceable restriction because the specific deed didn't include it, which might be the case if the restriction doesn't run with the land or isn't part of a binding subdivision plan.\n\nOption A suggests that the restriction didn't run with the land, which could be a reason why it's not enforceable against the new owner.\n\nI think the most accurate statement of law here would be Option C: The mobile-home restriction would be enforceable because a common development scheme had been established for the entire subdivision.\n\nThis is because the subdivision plan was recorded, and the original deeds included the restriction, indicating a uniform scheme for the entire development. Even if the later deeds didn't include the restriction, it might still be enforceable as part of the overall subdivision plan.\n\nHowever, I should note that this could vary depending on state law and specific circumstances. Some jurisdictions might require that all deeds include the restriction for it to be enforceable, while others might allow for restrictions in a recorded subdivision plan to bind all lots within the plan.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the information provided, Option C seems to be the most accurate statement of law in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
