It's asking which approach involves putting a product or service in as many outlets or locations as possible to give customers the maximum chance to find and purchase it. The options are:\n\nA. Exclusive distribution.\n\nB. Intensive distribution.\n\nC. Selective distribution.\n\nD. Direct distribution.\n\nI need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nStarting with A, exclusive distribution: I think this is when a product is sold through only a few select retailers or dealers. It's kind of like making the product exclusive to certain places, maybe to maintain a high-end image or to ensure a certain level of service to customers. So, that's the opposite of what the question is asking for, because it's limiting the number of outlets, not maximizing them.\n\nOption B is intensive distribution. This sounds like the strategy where a company tries to get its product into as many retail locations as possible. The goal is to make the product widely available, so customers can find it easily, no matter where they shop. That seems to match what the question is describing.\n\nC, selective distribution, is a middle ground between exclusive and intensive. It means choosing a select number of retailers in a geographic area to carry the product. It's more widespread than exclusive but not as broad as intensive. So, it's not about maximizing outlets as much as balancing availability and control.\n\nD, direct distribution, refers to selling products directly to customers without going through retailers. This could be through the company's own website, mail-order, or other direct channels. This isn't about maximizing outlets; it's about cutting out the middleman.\n\nGiven these definitions, it seems like intensive distribution is the approach that aims to place a product in as many outlets as possible to maximize customer access.\n\nBut let me double-check. Exclusive distribution limits the number of outlets to maintain exclusivity. Selective distribution chooses a limited number of outlets that meet certain criteria. Direct distribution bypasses retailers altogether. Only intensive distribution focuses on broad availability through many outlets.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Intensive distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
