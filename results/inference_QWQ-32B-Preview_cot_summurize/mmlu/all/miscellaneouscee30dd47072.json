I need to pick the best term from the options given: mimesis, installation art, performance art, or digital collage.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nMimesis: I think this is a Greek term that refers to the imitation of nature or reality in art. So, it's more about representing things as they are in real life. Doesn't seem to fit with the theatrical elements mentioned.\n\nInstallation art: This is when artists create immersive environments or installations in a specific space. It can involve various media like sculpture, video, sound, and more. While it can be interactive, it's not specifically about performance or theatrical elements.\n\nPerformance art: This seems promising. Performance art involves live presentations where the artist's performance is the main focus. It can include body movement, audience interaction, music, and visual elements like projected images. This sounds a lot like what the question is describing.\n\nDigital collage: This is a type of artwork created using digital media, where various elements are combined into a single image. It's more about visual composition and less about live performance or audience participation.\n\nGiven these definitions, performance art seems to be the best fit for an artwork that incorporates theatrical elements such as body movement, audience participation, music, and projected images.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. performance art.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
