                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** \"Linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what linear regression is and what properties its estimators have. Linear regression is a method to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The most common estimator used in linear regression is the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator.\n\nI think the statement is referring to the Gauss-Markov theorem, which states that under certain conditions, the OLS estimator has the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimators. However, the statement says \"among all unbiased estimators,\" not just linear ones. So, is there a theorem that says the OLS estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators, linear or not?\n\nI recall that the Gauss-Markov theorem only guarantees that OLS is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE), but there might be non-linear estimators that have smaller variances. So, perhaps the statement is too broad because it doesn't specify that it's among linear unbiased estimators.\n\nLet me check that. According to the Gauss-Markov theorem, if certain assumptions hold (like linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and no perfect multicollinearity), then the OLS estimator is the best linear unbiased estimator. But there could be non-linear estimators that are more efficient, meaning they have smaller variances.\n\nFor example, in some cases, using a weighted least squares estimator or other types of estimators could lead to smaller variances if the assumptions of OLS are violated.\n\nTherefore, I think Statement 1 is false because the OLS estimator only has the smallest variance among linear unbiased estimators, not necessarily among all unbiased estimators.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.\"\n\nNow, let's consider AdaBoost, which is a boosting algorithm used in machine learning. AdaBoost combines multiple weak classifiers into a strong classifier by assigning weights to the training instances and adjusting these weights based on the performance of each weak classifier.\n\nIn AdaBoost, each weak classifier is assigned a coefficient \u03b1, which determines its contribution to the final classification. The coefficient \u03b1 is based on the error rate of the weak classifier: classifiers with lower error rates get higher \u03b1 values.\n\nI need to recall how \u03b1 is calculated in AdaBoost. The general formula for \u03b1 in AdaBoost is:\n\n\u03b1 = 0.5 * ln((1 - error)/error)\n\nwhere error is the classification error rate of the weak classifier.\n\nGiven this formula, if the error is less than 0.5, \u03b1 will be positive because the argument of the natural logarithm will be greater than 1, and ln(x) for x > 1 is positive. If the error is greater than 0.5, \u03b1 would be negative, but in practice, AdaBoost often inverts the polarity of the classifier in such cases to make \u03b1 positive.\n\nWait, let's check that again. In some formulations of AdaBoost, if a classifier has an error rate greater than 0.5, it's better to invert its prediction, which effectively makes its error rate 1 - error, which would then be less than 0.5, leading to a positive \u03b1.\n\nSo, in standard AdaBoost, the coefficients \u03b1 are always non-negative because any classifier with error > 0.5 has its prediction inverted, making its effective error rate less than 0.5 and thus \u03b1 positive.\n\nHowever, I've heard of variations of AdaBoost where negative \u03b1 coefficients are allowed, but in the classic AdaBoost algorithm, \u03b1 coefficients are non-negative.\n\nTo confirm, I should look up the original AdaBoost algorithm.\n\nIn the original AdaBoost algorithm by Freund and Schapire, the weight update for each instance is based on whether the classifier correctly classified the instance or not. The coefficient \u03b1 is calculated as above, and indeed, classifiers with error rates above 0.5 can have their predictions inverted to ensure \u03b1 is positive.\n\nTherefore, in the standard AdaBoost algorithm, the coefficients \u03b1 are always non-negative.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. Therefore, the correct choice is:\n\nD. False, True\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
