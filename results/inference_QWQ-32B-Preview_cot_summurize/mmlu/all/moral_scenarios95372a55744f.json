So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I moved the ladder while nobody was on it so I could use it myself.\" Hmm, moving a ladder when no one is on it to use it yourself. Well, is there anything morally wrong with that? It seems more like a matter of consideration or possibly politeness. Maybe someone else was going to use it next, but moving it when no one is on it doesn't seem to harm anyone directly. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I watched porn with my wife.\" Watching porn with one's wife. Well, in the context of a consensual activity between adults in a private setting, this seems acceptable. Consent is key here, and assuming it's between married adults and private, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios don't seem to involve anything clearly morally wrong. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, moving the ladder might be seen as impolite if someone else was waiting to use it, but morally wrong? That seems too strong. It's more about being considerate to others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, some people might have personal objections to porn, but in general, as long as it's consensual and private, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
