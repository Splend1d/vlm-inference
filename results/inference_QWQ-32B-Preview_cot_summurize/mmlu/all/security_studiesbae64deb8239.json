The people and their collectives.\n\nCritical Security Studies (CSS) is an approach that challenges traditional notions of security, which often focus on the state and its sovereignty. CSS expands the scope of security to include a broader range of issues and actors, emphasizing human security, environmental security, and the security of social groups and communities.\n\nOption A, \"There is no specific referent point,\" is incorrect because CSS does have specific referent objects, albeit different from those in traditional security studies.\n\nOption B, \"The state and state apparatus,\" is typical of traditional security studies, particularly the realist and neoliberal approaches, but not of CSS.\n\nOption C, \"The environment,\" is an important aspect within CSS, as environmental issues can threaten human security, but it is not the primary referent object. CSS considers a wide range of threats to people and their collectives, including environmental degradation, but the central focus is on the security of humans and their communities.\n\nOption D, \"The people and their collectives,\" accurately reflects the referent object in CSS. This approach prioritizes the security of individuals and groups, such as communities, societies, and even global humanity, over the security of the state. It recognizes that threats to security can come from a variety of sources, including poverty, disease, oppression, and environmental hazards, and it advocates for comprehensive approaches to address these challenges.\n\nIn summary, Critical Security Studies shifts the focus from the state to the people and their collectives, emphasizing a broader understanding of security that includes human rights, development, and environmental sustainability."
