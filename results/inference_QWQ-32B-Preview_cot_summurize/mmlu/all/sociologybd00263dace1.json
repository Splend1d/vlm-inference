                    "text": "Let's see. I'm looking at this question about Sullivan's 2000 study on the proportion of housework men did. So, I need to figure out in which situation men did the most housework according to this study. The options are:\n\nA. when they had rediscovered themselves as 'new men'\n\nB. when their wives were at home and nagged them all the time\n\nC. when exciting gadgets like the hoover and electric iron were invented\n\nD. when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time\n\nHmm, I don't remember the specifics of Sullivan's study, but I can try to think this through.\n\nOption A mentions \"new men,\" which I think refers to a cultural shift where men take on more domestic responsibilities. That sounds plausible, but I'm not sure if that was the main finding of the study.\n\nOption B seems a bit outdated and perhaps a stereotype. It's unlikely that a scholarly study would conclude that nagging is the key factor in men doing more housework.\n\nOption C talks about the invention of gadgets like hoovers and electric irons. While technology certainly affects housework, I don't think the study was about historical inventions. Maybe it's about how modern gadgets affect current housework distribution, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D mentions unemployment or both partners working full time. This seems interesting. Maybe when men are unemployed, they have more time to do housework, or when both work full time, they share responsibilities more equally.\n\nLet me consider the context of the year 2000. At that time, there was a growing trend of dual-income households, and perhaps studies were looking into how that affected domestic labor.\n\nI think option D makes the most sense in that context. When both partners work full time, they might have to split housework more evenly due to time constraints. Alternatively, if a man is unemployed, he might be expected to handle more housework at home.\n\nOption A seems a bit vague. \"Rediscovered themselves as 'new men'\" sounds like a personal transformation, but I'm not sure how directly that correlates to doing more housework.\n\nOption B is probably not the answer because it relies on a stereotype that isn't likely to be supported by academic research.\n\nOption C is about inventions, which might have a long-term impact, but I don't think the study was about historical changes due to technology.\n\nSo, between A and D, I'm leaning towards D because it seems more directly related to contemporary work and family dynamics around the year 2000.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up the study or find some notes on it.\n\nWait, this is probably a question from a sociology class, and I might have covered this in my studies, but I can't recall the specifics right now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A, suggesting that men who identify with a newer, more egalitarian gender role take on more housework. That could make sense.\n\nHowever, considering that the study was conducted in 2000, and considering the options provided, I think D is the better choice.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the answer is C, because the invention of labor-saving devices like hoovers and electric irons makes housework easier, encouraging men to participate more.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. While gadgets might make housework easier, I don't know if that directly correlates to men doing more of it.\n\nOption B is probably meant to be humorous or sarcastic, suggesting that nagging wives make men do more housework. But again, I doubt that's the focus of an academic study.\n\nSo, coming back to option D, it seems plausible that employment status affects the division of labor at home. If both partners are working full time, they might share housework more equally. Alternatively, if the man is unemployed, he might be expected to handle more housework.\n\nGiven that, I think D is the most likely answer.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D: when they were unemployed or both partners worked full time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
