                    "text": "So I have this equation: 6a = 72. I need to find the value of 'a'. The question is asking which step explains how to do that. The options are:\n\nA. add 6 to both sides\n\nB. divide both sides by 6\n\nC. multiply both sides by 6\n\nD. subtract 6 from both sides\n\nAlright, let's think about this. I know that in an equation, whatever I do to one side, I have to do to the other to keep it balanced. So, I need to isolate 'a' on one side to find its value.\n\nLooking at the equation, 6a means 6 multiplied by a equals 72. To find 'a', I need to undo the multiplication by 6. How do I undo multiplication? By division, right? So, dividing both sides by 6 should give me 'a' equal to 72 divided by 6.\n\nLet me try that: if I divide both sides by 6, I get:\n\n6a / 6 = 72 / 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na = 12\n\nThat makes sense. So, option B seems correct.\n\nNow, let's quickly check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: add 6 to both sides.\n\nIf I add 6 to both sides, I get:\n\n6a + 6 = 72 + 6\n\nWhich is:\n\n6a + 6 = 78\n\nThat doesn't help me isolate 'a'. In fact, it makes the equation more complicated. So, A doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C: multiply both sides by 6.\n\nIf I multiply both sides by 6, I get:\n\n6a * 6 = 72 * 6\n\nWhich is:\n\n36a = 432\n\nAgain, this doesn't help me find 'a'. It just makes the coefficient of a larger. So, C is not the right choice.\n\nOption D: subtract 6 from both sides.\n\nIf I subtract 6 from both sides, I get:\n\n6a - 6 = 72 - 6\n\nWhich is:\n\n6a - 6 = 66\n\nThis still doesn't isolate 'a'. I'd still have to deal with the subtraction and the multiplication. It's not the most direct way to solve for 'a'.\n\nSo, compared to all these options, option B makes the most sense because it directly isolates 'a' by dividing both sides by the coefficient of 'a', which is 6.\n\nI think the answer is B. Divide both sides by 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
