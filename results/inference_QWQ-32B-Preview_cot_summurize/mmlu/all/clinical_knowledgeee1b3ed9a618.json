                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about IV therapy complications. It says: \"Leakage of vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage.\" And I have to choose between extravasation, phlebitis, inflammation, and infiltration.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nExtravasation sounds familiar. I think it has something to do with fluids leaking out of the vein into the surrounding tissue. And since it mentions vesicant medication or fluid causing tissue damage, that seems like a match.\n\nPhlebitis is inflammation of the vein, usually due to infection or irritation from the IV catheter. So, it's more about the vein itself getting inflamed.\n\nInflammation is a general term for the body's response to injury or infection, characterized by redness, heat, swelling, and pain. It's a broad term and could be a result of various complications.\n\nInfiltration is when non-vesicant fluids leak into the surrounding tissue, which can also cause swelling and discomfort, but it's different from extravasation because the fluids aren't necessarily irritants.\n\nSo, comparing these, extravasation specifically involves the leakage of vesicants, which are irritants that can cause tissue damage, whereas infiltration involves non-irritating fluids leaking into the tissue.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Extravasation.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nExtravasation: leakage of vesicant fluids into surrounding tissues, causing damage.\n\nPhlebitis: inflammation of the vein, often due to IV catheter placement.\n\nInflammation: a general response to injury or infection.\n\nInfiltration: leakage of non-vesicant fluids into surrounding tissues.\n\nYes, extravasation fits the description perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
