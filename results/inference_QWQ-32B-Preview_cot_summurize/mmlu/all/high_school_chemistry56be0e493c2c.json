                    "text": "So I have this question here about which reaction may need to be balanced using the ion-electron method. The options are:\n\nA. BaCl\u2082 + Al\u2082(SO\u2084)\u2083 \u2192 AlCl\u2083 + BaSO\u2084\n\nB. H\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O\n\nC. NaOH + H\u2083PO\u2084 \u2192 Na\u2082HPO\u2084 + H\u2082O\n\nD. C\u2082H\u2082(g) + N\u2082O(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g) + H\u2082O(g) + N\u2082(g)\n\nI need to figure out which one requires the ion-electron method for balancing. Let me recall what the ion-electron method is. It's also known as the half-reaction method, and it's particularly useful for balancing redox reactions in acidic or basic solutions. So, I need to identify which of these reactions is a redox reaction.\n\nFirst, let's look at option A: BaCl\u2082 + Al\u2082(SO\u2084)\u2083 \u2192 AlCl\u2083 + BaSO\u2084\n\nThis seems like a double displacement reaction. Barium chloride reacts with aluminum sulfate to form aluminum chloride and barium sulfate. I don't think there's any change in oxidation states here. Let me check the oxidation numbers:\n\n- Ba in BaCl\u2082: +2\n\n- Cl in BaCl\u2082: -1\n\n- Al in Al\u2082(SO\u2084)\u2083: +3\n\n- S in SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: +6\n\n- O in SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: -2\n\nOn the product side:\n\n- Al in AlCl\u2083: +3\n\n- Cl in AlCl\u2083: -1\n\n- Ba in BaSO\u2084: +2\n\n- S in SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: +6\n\n- O in SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: -2\n\nNo change in oxidation states, so this is not a redox reaction.\n\nOption B: H\u207a + OH\u207b \u2192 H\u2082O\n\nThis is a neutralization reaction. Hydrogen ions react with hydroxide ions to form water. Again, let's check the oxidation states:\n\n- H\u207a: +1\n\n- O in OH\u207b: -2\n\n- H in OH\u207b: +1\n\n- H in H\u2082O: +1\n\n- O in H\u2082O: -2\n\nNo change in oxidation states here either. So, not a redox reaction.\n\nOption C: NaOH + H\u2083PO\u2084 \u2192 Na\u2082HPO\u2084 + H\u2082O\n\nThis looks like an acid-base reaction where sodium hydroxide reacts with phosphoric acid to form sodium hydrogen phosphate and water. Let's check the oxidation states:\n\n- Na in NaOH: +1\n\n- O in OH\u207b: -2\n\n- H in OH\u207b: +1\n\n- H in H\u2083PO\u2084: +1\n\n- P in H\u2083PO\u2084: +5\n\n- O in H\u2083PO\u2084: -2\n\nOn the product side:\n\n- Na in Na\u2082HPO\u2084: +1\n\n- H in HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: +1\n\n- P in HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: +5\n\n- O in HPO\u2084\u00b2\u207b: -2\n\n- H in H\u2082O: +1\n\n- O in H\u2082O: -2\n\nAgain, no change in oxidation states. So, not a redox reaction.\n\nOption D: C\u2082H\u2082(g) + N\u2082O(g) \u2192 CO\u2082(g) + H\u2082O(g) + N\u2082(g)\n\nThis seems more complex. It involves acetylene (C\u2082H\u2082), dinitrogen monoxide (N\u2082O), carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen gas. Let's check the oxidation states:\n\n- C in C\u2082H\u2082: Each C is assumed to be in a certain state, but in reality, in C\u2082H\u2082, the two C atoms form a triple bond, and each H is +1. So, let's calculate:\n\nLet\u2019s set the oxidation state of C as x.\n\n2x + 2(+1) = 0 \u2192 2x + 2 = 0 \u2192 2x = -2 \u2192 x = -1\n\nSo, C: -1 each\n\nH: +1 each\n\n- N in N\u2082O: N has different oxidation states. Let\u2019s assume N's oxidation state as y.\n\n2y + (-2) = 0 \u2192 2y - 2 = 0 \u2192 2y = 2 \u2192 y = +1\n\nSo, N: +1 each\n\nO: -2\n\nOn the product side:\n\n- C in CO\u2082: C: +4 (since O is -2, and there are two O's: 2*(-2) = -4, so C must be +4 to balance.)\n\n- O in CO\u2082: -2\n\n- H in H\u2082O: +1\n\n- O in H\u2082O: -2\n\n- N in N\u2082: 0 (since it's in its elemental form.)\n\nSo, comparing reactants and products:\n\n- C: from -1 in reactants to +4 in products\n\n- N: from +1 in reactants to 0 in products\n\n- O: from -2 in reactants to -2 in products (no change)\n\n- H: from +1 in reactants to +1 in products (no change)\n\nSo, there are changes in oxidation states for C and N, which indicates a redox reaction.\n\nTherefore, option D is a redox reaction and may need to be balanced using the ion-electron method.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: No oxidation state changes.\n\nOption B: No oxidation state changes.\n\nOption C: No oxidation state changes.\n\nOption D: Oxidation state changes for C and N.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
