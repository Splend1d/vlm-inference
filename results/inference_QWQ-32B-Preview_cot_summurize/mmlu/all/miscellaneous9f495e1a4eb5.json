She's looking for the best reference material to help her understand and correct her mistakes. Let's look at the options she has:\n\nA. A dictionary\n\nDictionaries are great for definitions and meanings of words. They tell you what a word means and how to use it in sentences. But when it comes to understanding the specific grammatical rules between \"who\" and \"whom,\" a dictionary might not provide enough detail. It might explain the basic usage but may not delve into the nuances that Anna needs to get it right every time.\n\nB. A thesaurus\n\nA thesaurus is a book or reference source that lists words with similar meanings. So, if Anna is looking for synonyms or alternative words to use, a thesaurus would be helpful. However, for understanding when to use \"who\" versus \"whom,\" a thesaurus isn't the right tool because it doesn't deal with grammar or sentence structure.\n\nC. A glossary\n\nA glossary is a list of terms with definitions, usually related to a specific subject or field. It's useful for understanding specialized vocabulary, but again, it doesn't provide guidance on grammatical usage. So, for Anna's issue with \"who\" and \"whom,\" a glossary probably won't offer the help she needs.\n\nD. A grammar guide\n\nA grammar guide is a resource that explains the rules and principles of language usage. It covers topics like parts of speech, sentence structure, and proper word choice. Since Anna's problem is with distinguishing between \"who\" and \"whom,\" which is a grammatical issue, a grammar guide would be the most appropriate reference material. These guides often have sections on pronouns and their correct usage, which would include examples and explanations for \"who\" and \"whom.\"\n\nSo, considering Anna's need to understand and correct her use of \"who\" and \"whom,\" a grammar guide (option D) would be the best choice. It will provide her with the necessary rules and examples to ensure she uses these words correctly in her narrative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
