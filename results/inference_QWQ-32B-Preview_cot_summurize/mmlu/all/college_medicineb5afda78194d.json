This relationship is based on the concept of oxygen calorimetry, which quantifies how much energy is released per liter of oxygen consumed.\n\nFirst, we need to know the standard value for the energy equivalent of oxygen consumption. This value is approximately 20.1 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed under aerobic conditions. This means that for every liter of oxygen used by the body, about 20.1 kilojoules of energy are released.\n\nGiven that the athlete's mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 liters per minute, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure by multiplying the oxygen consumption rate by the energy equivalent per liter.\n\nLet's do the calculation step by step:\n\n1. Identify the rate of oxygen consumption: 2 L/min.\n2. Identify the energy equivalent per liter of oxygen: 20.1 kJ/L.\n3. Multiply the two values to find the rate of energy expenditure:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Rate of energy expenditure} = 2 \\, \\text{L/min} \\times 20.1 \\, \\text{kJ/L} = 40.2 \\, \\text{kJ/min}\n\\]\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 400 kJ/min.\nB. 200 kJ/min.\nC. 80 kJ/min.\nD. 40 kJ/min.\n\nThe calculated rate of energy expenditure is approximately 40 kJ/min, which corresponds to option D.\n\nIt's important to note that the exact value might vary slightly depending on the specific conditions and the type of activity, but for the purposes of this question, option D is the closest and most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
