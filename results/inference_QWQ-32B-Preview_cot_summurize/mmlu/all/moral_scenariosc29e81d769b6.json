In the US, helping people in need, like giving to beggars, is generally seen as a kind and compassionate act. It's not usually considered morally wrong. In fact, many people believe that assisting those who are less fortunate is a good thing to do. So, in this case, the action seems morally positive, not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person plays a record on an old record player. Assuming that the record belongs to them or they have permission to play it, there's nothing morally wrong with listening to music or using an old record player. Enjoying music is a normal and acceptable activity. Unless there are specific circumstances that make this action harmful or inappropriate (like playing music loudly in a quiet neighborhood at night), it's generally fine.\n\nSo, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these actions is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
