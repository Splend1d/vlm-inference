                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which school policy is most likely to help reduce the digital divide. The digital divide is basically about who has access to computers and the internet and who doesn't, right? It's a big issue because so much of education and life now depends on technology.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The school lets students bring their own graphing calculator from home for math assignments. Well, graphing calculators are useful for math, but not everyone can afford one. So, this might actually widen the gap because students from families that can afford a graphing calculator have an advantage over those who can't.\n\nB. The school lets students bring a tablet to class every day for graded quizzes. Tablets can be really helpful for learning, but again, not all families can afford them. This might also create inequality in the classroom, with some students having better devices than others, which could affect their performance on quizzes.\n\nC. The school provides a laptop or tablet to all enrolled students. This seems like a great idea because it ensures that every student has access to the necessary technology, regardless of their family's income. It promotes equality and gives everyone the same tools to succeed.\n\nD. The school recommends that all students buy a computer with as much processing speed as possible for projects. This could be problematic because it might lead to a \"keeping up with the Joneses\" situation where families feel pressure to buy the most expensive, high-performance computers. Not only is this costly, but it could also create a hierarchy among students based on their computers' specifications, which isn't fair.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems to be the best choice because it provides equal access to technology for all students, helping to bridge the digital divide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
