                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the overjustification hypothesis and how it relates to the self-concept, specifically regarding an individual's belief about their own attributes. The question is: \"What can happen according to the overjustification hypothesis?\" And there are four options:\n\nA. Rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest.\n\nB. To experience an emotion, a person must first experience physiological arousal, then a cognitive interpretation of that arousal.\n\nC. When internal cues are vague, people infer by observing their behavior and the situational context.\n\nD. Not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what the overjustification hypothesis is. I remember that it's related to how external rewards can affect a person's intrinsic motivation. So, if someone is already enjoying an activity for its own sake, adding an external reward might actually decrease their interest in it. That sounds a lot like option A.\n\nLet me think about this. If someone is doing something they love, like painting or playing music, and they start getting paid for it, maybe they'll start seeing it more as a job than a hobby, and their enjoyment might lessen. That makes sense. So, option A seems plausible.\n\nNow, option B talks about experiencing emotions through physiological arousal followed by cognitive interpretation. That sounds more like the James-Lange theory of emotion, not the overjustification hypothesis. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C mentions inferring feelings when internal cues are vague by observing behavior and situational context. That sounds like the self-perception theory, which is different from the overjustification hypothesis.\n\nOption D is the opposite of option A. It says that not rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest. But according to the overjustification hypothesis, it's the addition of rewards that can be problematic.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at the exact definition of the overjustification hypothesis to make sure.\n\nSo, the overjustification hypothesis suggests that external rewards can reduce a person's intrinsic motivation to engage in an activity. In other words, if someone is already motivated to do something because they enjoy it, adding an external reward can make them see the activity as work rather than fun, and thus decrease their intrinsic interest.\n\nThat aligns with option A: rewarding people for an enjoyable activity can undermine their interest.\n\nOption D is the opposite: not rewarding them could undermine interest. But according to the hypothesis, it's the introduction of rewards that's the problem, not the absence of them.\n\nSo, if anything, not rewarding someone for an activity they already enjoy shouldn't affect their intrinsic motivation, assuming no rewards were expected in the first place.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider the other options again.\n\nOption B is about the sequence of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation in experiencing emotions. That's more related to emotion theories, not motivation or self-concept.\n\nOption C is about self-perception theory, where people infer their attitudes and feelings based on their behavior and the situation, especially when internal cues are unclear. Again, not directly related to overjustification.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
