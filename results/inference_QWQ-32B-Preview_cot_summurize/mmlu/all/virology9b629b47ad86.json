                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the biggest risk factor is for getting infected with Ebola from the options given. Let's see:\n\nOption A is \"Working in a category IV laboratory.\" I know that category IV labs handle some of the most dangerous pathogens, including those that are highly infectious and often have no known treatment. So, working in such a lab must be risky, right? But Ebola is a category IV pathogen, so handling it in a lab could definitely expose you to the virus if safety protocols aren't strictly followed.\n\nOption B is \"Attending a funeral of a victim outside.\" I've heard that funeral practices can be a significant way Ebola spreads, especially in some cultures where there are specific rituals involving touching the body of the deceased. If the body isn't handled properly, it could indeed be a high-risk situation.\n\nOption C is \"Nursing a patient at home.\" Caring for someone with Ebola at home would probably involve a lot of close contact, possibly handling body fluids, which are highly infectious for Ebola. So, this seems like it could be very risky.\n\nOption D is \"Attending football matches or large gatherings.\" Now, in general, large gatherings can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases because of the close proximity of people. But for Ebola, which isn't airborne and requires direct contact with bodily fluids to transmit, I'm not sure if this would be as risky compared to the other options.\n\nLet me think about this. Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected person, or through contaminated needles and other medical equipment. So, any situation where you might come into contact with an infected person's fluids would be risky.\n\nOption A, working in a category IV lab: If proper safety protocols are followed, the risk should be minimized. But if there are breaches in protocol, it could be very dangerous. However, in a lab setting, there are usually strict safety measures in place to prevent exposure.\n\nOption B, attending a funeral: If the body is handled without proper precautions, and if there's contact with bodily fluids, that could be very risky. In some cultures, there are funeral practices that involve washing or touching the body, which could lead to infection if the person died of Ebola.\n\nOption C, nursing a patient at home: This would likely involve a lot of close contact, possibly changing bedding, cleaning up vomit or diarrhea, etc., all of which could expose you to the virus if you're not wearing proper protective gear.\n\nOption D, attending football matches or large gatherings: While these gatherings could potentially allow for the spread of Ebola through direct contact, it's less likely compared to the other options because casual contact doesn't transmit the virus. You'd have to have direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids to get infected.\n\nComparing all these, I think nursing a patient at home would be the biggest risk factor. When you're caring for someone at home, you're in very close proximity, possibly for extended periods, and it might be harder to maintain strict infection control measures compared to a professional medical setting.\n\nBut let me double-check. Funerals can be risky, especially if there are cultural practices that involve touching the body. And working in a lab could be dangerous if there are accidents or protocol failures.\n\nMaybe I should consider the likelihood of exposure in each scenario.\n\nIn a lab, there are safety protocols in place to handle Ebola safely. So, assuming those protocols are followed, the risk might be lower compared to caring for a sick person at home where you might not have the same level of training or equipment.\n\nAt a funeral, if the body is handled properly, with precautions to avoid contact with bodily fluids, the risk could be minimized. But in reality, especially in areas where Ebola outbreaks occur, there might be cultural practices that increase the risk.\n\nNursing a patient at home would likely involve frequent and close contact, increasing the chances of exposure to the virus.\n\nSo, overall, I think option C, nursing a patient at home, is the biggest risk factor among the options given.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
