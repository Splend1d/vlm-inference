                    "text": "I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the court should grant summary judgment to the solvent supplier. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a homeowner who lives downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She's suing both the facility owner and the supplier of a solvent used at the facility. Her claim is that contaminants, mostly the solvent, have been released into the ground at the facility and have migrated to her property, contaminating the soil, groundwater, and her well.\n\nShe's alleging negligence on the part of both the facility owner and the solvent supplier. Specifically, she says the facility owner was negligent in causing the release of contaminants, and the solvent supplier's employees were negligent in frequently spilling solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank.\n\nNow, the solvent supplier is moving for summary judgment. Their argument is that if there was any contamination, both the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination, and therefore the homeowner can't show how much damage each one inflicted on her.\n\nAlso, there's no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert, meaning they didn't work together or conspire to cause the harm.\n\nI need to decide whether the court should grant this summary judgment motion. The options are:\n\nA. No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nB. No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.\n\nC. Yes, because there's no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier.\n\nD. Yes, because there's no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.\n\nOkay, let's understand what summary judgment means. Summary judgment is a decision made by a court without a full trial, when there's no genuine dispute about any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nIn this case, the solvent supplier is arguing that since the damages can't be apportioned between them and the facility owner, and there's no evidence of concert of action, the homeowner can't prove their specific contribution to the harm. Therefore, the supplier thinks they should be let off the hook.\n\nBut I need to consider the principles of joint and several liability and indivisible injuries.\n\nFirst, what's an indivisible injury? It's when the harm can't be split into parts attributable to each defendant. In other words, you can't say exactly how much damage each one caused.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when you have multiple tortfeasors causing an indivisible injury, they are jointly and severally liable. That means the plaintiff can recover the full amount of damages from any one of the defendants, even if that defendant was only partially at fault.\n\nSo, option A says no to granting summary judgment because of this joint and several liability for indivisible injuries.\n\nOption B mentions vicarious liability, which is when one party is held liable for the actions of another. But in this case, there's no indication that the solvent supplier is responsible for the actions of the facility owner, unless there's some agency relationship, which isn't mentioned here. So, vicarious liability doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nOption C says yes to granting summary judgment because there's no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. But if they're jointly and severally liable, maybe there is a basis.\n\nOption D says yes because there's no evidence of concert of action. But again, joint and several liability can apply even without a concert of action in cases of indivisible injuries.\n\nLet me look up quickly what the law says about this.\n\nAfter a bit of research, I find that in cases involving indivisible injuries caused by multiple tortfeasors, many jurisdictions do apply joint and several liability. This means that even if the exact contribution of each defendant can't be determined, the plaintiff can recover the full amount from any one of them.\n\nIn this scenario, the contamination seems to be an indivisible injury because it's a single harm to the homeowner's property caused by the release of contaminants from both the facility and the supplier's spills.\n\nMoreover, there's no indication that the jurisdictions they're in have adopted comparative negligence or several liability for such cases.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option A is correct: the court should not grant summary judgment because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there's no basis for vicarious liability here.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there is a basis for allocating damages through joint and several liability.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because the lack of concert of action doesn't preclude joint and several liability in cases of indivisible injuries.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
