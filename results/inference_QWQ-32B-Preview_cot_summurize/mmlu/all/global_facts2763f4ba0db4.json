                    "text": "Let's see. The question is about comparing the years of schooling for 30-year-old men and women worldwide as of 2020. It says that men of this age have spent an average of 10 years in school. We need to find out how many years women of the same age have spent in school, and choose the correct option among A. 12 years, B. 9 years, C. 6 years, or D. 3 years.\n\nFirst, I need to think about general trends in education between genders. Historically, there have been disparities in education, with men often having more access to schooling than women. However, in many parts of the world, especially in recent decades, there has been a significant push for gender equality in education.\n\nSo, as of 2020, I would expect that the gap between men and women's years of schooling has narrowed, but perhaps not completely closed. Let me consider some possible scenarios.\n\nOption A suggests that women have spent 12 years in school, which is more than men's 10 years. This would imply that women have more education than men, on average. While in some countries this might be the case, globally, it seems less likely because of the historical disparities I mentioned.\n\nOption B suggests 9 years, which is less than men's 10 years but closer. This could be possible if there is still a small gap favoring men.\n\nOption C suggests 6 years, which is a significant difference from men's 10 years. This would indicate that men have considerably more education than women, which might have been true in the past but seems outdated for 2020.\n\nOption D suggests 3 years, which is a huge disparity and probably not accurate for the year 2020, given global efforts towards education equality.\n\nConsidering global education trends, I recall that the United Nations and other international organizations have been working towards universal primary and secondary education, with a focus on gender equality. As of 2020, many countries have achieved or are\u63a5\u8fd1 achieving parity in enrollment rates for primary and secondary education.\n\nHowever, there might still be differences in the years of schooling completed due to various factors such as cultural norms, economic circumstances, and access to higher education.\n\nGiven that 30-year-olds would have completed their education around 2020, assuming they started school at around age 5 or 6, they would have gone through the education system in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nDuring this period, there was a global push for education for all, and specifically for girls' education. For example, the Millennium Development Goals included targets for universal primary education and gender equality in education.\n\nSo, by 2020, it's likely that the gender gap in education has narrowed significantly, but may not have completely disappeared.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A suggests women have more years of schooling than men, which might be possible in some regions, but globally, it seems less likely.\n\nOption B, 9 years, is close to men's 10 years, suggesting a small gap still exists.\n\nOption C, 6 years, is a substantial difference, and option D, 3 years, is even more extreme.\n\nGiven that universal primary education is typically 6 years, and secondary education another 6 years, making 12 years in total, the 10 years for men suggests they may have completed primary and some secondary education on average.\n\nIf women have 9 years, that would mean they completed primary and a bit of secondary, which is plausible.\n\nBut to make a more informed decision, perhaps I should look up some data or recall specific statistics if I have them.\n\nI seem to remember that as of 2020, the global gender gap in education has narrowed, but men still have slightly more years of schooling on average.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some regions, women have caught up or even surpassed men.\n\nHowever, considering the worldwide average, it's likely that men still have a slight advantage in years of schooling, but not by a large margin.\n\nTherefore, option B, 9 years, seems reasonable.\n\nOption A, 12 years, would suggest that women have completed secondary education on average, which might be higher than the actual global average.\n\nOption C, 6 years, would indicate that women have only completed primary education, which seems too low given the global efforts in education.\n\nOption D, 3 years, is implausibly low for the year 2020.\n\nHence, I will go with option B, 9 years, as the closest estimate for the years of schooling completed by 30-year-old women worldwide as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
