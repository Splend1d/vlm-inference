We have to determine which of the given expressions correctly identify whether a person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, based on their age.\n\nFirst, let's understand the conditions:\n\n- To drive a car: age must be at least 16 years old.\n\n- To vote: age must be at least 18 years old.\n\nSo, the person must be \u226516 to drive and <18 to not be able to vote. Therefore, the age should be between 16 and 17 inclusive.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option I: (age \u2265 16) AND (age \u2264 18)**\n\nThis expression checks if the age is at least 16 and at most 18. So, ages 16, 17, and 18 would satisfy this condition.\n\nBut, remember that to vote, you need to be at least 18. So, age 18 should not be included in the \"old enough to drive but not old enough to vote\" category. Therefore, this expression is incorrect because it includes age 18.\n\n**Option II: (age \u2265 16) AND (NOT(age \u2265 18))**\n\nThis expression checks if the age is at least 16 and not at least 18. In other words, age is 16 or 17.\n\nThis matches our required condition perfectly, as ages 16 and 17 can drive but cannot vote.\n\n**Option III: (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))**\n\nThis expression checks if the age is less than 18 and not less than 16. So, age is greater than or equal to 16 and less than 18, which is age 16 and 17.\n\nAgain, this matches our required condition.\n\nSo, both options II and III are correct, while option I is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. II and III only.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check.\n\nOption I includes age 18, which should not be included since at age 18, the person can vote. So, it's incorrect.\n\nOption II excludes age 18 by using NOT(age \u2265 18), which is correct.\n\nOption III also excludes age less than 16 by using NOT(age < 16), which means age \u226516, and combined with age <18, it's correct.\n\nHence, indeed, only II and III are correct.\n\nSo, the answer is D. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
