Terracotta, and D. Stoneware. Hmm, I need to think about what each of these terms means in the context of pottery.\n\nFirst off, what is bisque firing? Bisque firing is the first firing of clay bodies, where the greenware (that's what I think they call unfired clay pieces) is heated in a kiln to a temperature where the clay becomes ceramic and the pores are closed, but it's not glazed yet. So, greenware is the term for pottery that hasn't been fired at all, right?\n\nLet me check each option:\n\nA. Raku: I know that Raku is a type of pottery that's fired at low temperatures and often removed from the kiln while still glowing hot, then placed in materials like sawdust or metal reduction chambers to create unique glaze effects. But Raku pieces are definitely fired, so that can't be the answer.\n\nB. Greenware: As I just thought, greenware is unfired clay pieces. So, this seems like the correct answer.\n\nC. Terracotta: Terracotta is a type of clay that is often fired to create pottery, usually earthenware. It's typically reddish in color. But terracotta refers to the type of clay or the fired pottery, not the unfired state.\n\nD. Stoneware: Stoneware is a type of pottery that's fired at higher temperatures than earthenware, making it more durable. Again, it's a type of fired pottery.\n\nSo, based on this, greenware should be the correct answer because it refers to pottery that has not been bisque fired or fired at all.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure. Is there any chance that raku is unfired? No, raku is definitely fired, just at lower temperatures and with a different firing process.\n\nTerracotta and stoneware are both types of fired pottery, different in their firing temperatures and properties.\n\nTherefore, greenware is indeed the term for unfired pottery.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
