I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration?

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Albert Beveridge's speech, \"The March of the Flag.\" So, the question is: In \"The March of the Flag,\" Albert Beveridge supported which of the following? And we have four options: Populism, War with Great Britain, Constitutional reform in the United States, or The creation of an American overseas empire.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the speech is about. From the excerpt provided, it seems like Beveridge is talking about governing new possessions, likely referring to territories acquired by the United States around that time, probably after the Spanish-American War in 1898. He mentions Hawaii and compares governing it to governing states like New Mexico and California, suggesting that the U.S. has experience in managing territories with diverse populations.\n\nHe asks rhetorical questions about whether America can govern foreign lands, comparing it to England and Germany's abilities, and seems to be arguing that America is capable of doing so. He also mentions the \"march of the flag,\" which suggests expansionism, the idea that the U.S. flag should be spread further, implying territorial expansion.\n\nSo, considering this context, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is Populism. Populism generally refers to political ideas that emphasize the needs and interests of ordinary people over those of the elite. While Beveridge might have had some populist appeal, the speech seems more focused on national expansion and capability rather than domestic social or economic policies that populism typically addresses. So, this seems less likely.\n\nOption B is War with Great Britain. There's no mention of Great Britain in the excerpt, and Beveridge seems to be using England as an example of a country that can govern foreign lands, not as an adversary. So, this option doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption C is Constitutional reform in the United States. The speech doesn't appear to be discussing changes to the U.S. Constitution or domestic political structures. Instead, it's about the ability of the U.S. to govern overseas territories. Therefore, this option doesn't seem directly related to the content of the speech.\n\nOption D is The creation of an American overseas empire. This seems to align closely with the themes in the speech. Beveridge is arguing that the U.S. can and should govern new possessions, comparing it to how other nations manage their foreign lands. He draws parallels between governing these new territories and the way the U.S. has incorporated states like New Mexico and California, which had \"savage and an alien population.\" This suggests that he sees the expansion into overseas territories as a continuation of the nation's expansionist history.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"the march of the flag\" is evocative of imperial expansion, where the flag is symbolically planted in new territories to claim them for the nation. This was a common trope in discussions about American expansionism at the time.\n\nTherefore, based on the content of the speech and the context of the times, it seems that Beveridge was supporting the idea of creating an American overseas empire.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider the historical context. In 1898, the Spanish-American War had just ended, and the U.S. had acquired territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. There was a significant debate in the U.S. about whether to retain these territories or grant them independence. Expansionists, like Beveridge, argued in favor of retaining and governing these territories, seeing it as both a national duty and an expression of American power.\n\nGiven this, it's clear that Beveridge was advocating for the U.S. to take on an imperial role, similar to European powers, by governing these new possessions overseas.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. The creation of an American overseas empire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
