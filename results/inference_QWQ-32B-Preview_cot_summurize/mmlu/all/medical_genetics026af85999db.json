                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about a concept in biology related to how genes and environment interact during development. The question is:\n\n\"______ has been described as the phenomenon by which one genotype can give rise to a range of different physiological or morphological states in response to different environmental conditions during development (West-Eberhard, 1989).\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Fetal plasticity\n\nB. The fetal origins hypothesis\n\nC. Developmental plasticity\n\nD. Environmental plasticity\n\nOkay, so I need to understand what this phenomenon is. It's about how a single genotype can produce different physical or physiological forms depending on the environment during development. That sounds like the concept where an organism's development can be influenced by external conditions, leading to variations in its traits.\n\nLet me think about each option:\n\nA. Fetal plasticity: This might be related to changes in the fetus in response to the environment, but I'm not sure if it's the broadest term for this phenomenon.\n\nB. The fetal origins hypothesis: I think this is more about how conditions during fetal development can have long-term health effects later in life, like increasing the risk of certain diseases. It's related but seems more specific.\n\nC. Developmental plasticity: This sounds very similar to what the question is describing. It's about the ability of an organism to adjust its development in response to environmental conditions.\n\nD. Environmental plasticity: This might also be related, but \"developmental plasticity\" seems more precise in emphasizing the developmental stage.\n\nLet me look up West-Eberhard, 1989, to see what she specifically discussed. Mary Jane West-Eberhard is a renowned evolutionary biologist known for her work on development and evolution, particularly the concept of developmental plasticity.\n\nAccording to her work, developmental plasticity refers to the ability of a single genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to environmental cues during development. This aligns perfectly with the description in the question.\n\nSo, option C, developmental plasticity, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options again:\n\n- Fetal plasticity: This might be a narrower term, perhaps specific to fetal development, whereas developmental plasticity is broader, covering development across different life stages.\n\n- The fetal origins hypothesis: This is more about the programming of adult diseases based on fetal environmental conditions, which is a specific application of the broader concept of developmental plasticity.\n\n- Environmental plasticity: This term might be used in different contexts, but in biology, it could refer to an organism's ability to adjust to environmental changes, which is similar but not as precise as developmental plasticity.\n\nTherefore, based on the description and the context provided by West-Eberhard's work, developmental plasticity is the most appropriate term.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
