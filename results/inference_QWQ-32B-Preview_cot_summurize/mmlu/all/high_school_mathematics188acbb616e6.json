                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"How many positive 4-digit integers have only odd digits?\" And the options are A. 100, B. 999, C. 625, D. 500. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a 4-digit integer is. Well, it's any number from 1000 to 9999, right? And it has to have only odd digits. So, the digits allowed are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. No even digits at all.\n\nAlright, so for a 4-digit number, there are four positions: thousands, hundreds, tens, and units. Each of these positions needs to be filled with an odd digit.\n\nLet me think about the thousands place first. It can't be zero anyway, since it's a 4-digit number, and it has to be odd. So, the possible digits for the thousands place are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. That's 5 options.\n\nNow, moving to the hundreds place. This can be any odd digit, including zero, but wait, zero is even, so no zero here. Only 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So, again, 5 options.\n\nSimilarly, the tens place can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Five options.\n\nAnd the units place also has the same options: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So, five options again.\n\nOkay, so for each digit in the 4-digit number, there are 5 possible choices.\n\nTo find the total number of such numbers, I can use the counting principle, which says that if there are m ways to do one thing, and n ways to do another, then there are m times n ways to do both, and so on.\n\nSo, in this case, for each of the four digits, there are 5 choices. Therefore, the total number should be 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5, which is 5^4.\n\nLet me calculate that: 5^4 is 625.\n\nWait a minute, but look at the options. Option C is 625, which matches my calculation. But there's also option D, which is 500. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me double-check. Is there any restriction I haven't considered?\n\nWell, I know that in some cases, the first digit can't be certain numbers, but in this case, I already ensured that the thousands place is not zero and is odd, so that's covered.\n\nAlso, all digits need to be odd, which I've accounted for by choosing only from 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 for each place.\n\nSo, 5 options for each of the four digits, totaling 5^4 = 625.\n\nBut why is there an option for 500? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about what constitutes a 4-digit number.\n\nWait, does 0 count as an odd digit? No, 0 is even. So, I'm correct in excluding it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for leading zeros, but in 4-digit numbers, leading zeros aren't allowed because that would make it a fewer-digit number.\n\nFor example, 0123 is actually 123, which is a 3-digit number. So, leading zeros are not considered in 4-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but in my earlier reasoning, I already ensured that the thousands place is not zero, so that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted differently, but I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the digit '2' is sometimes written as odd, but no, '2' is even.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some contexts, '1' is not considered a digit, but no, '1' is definitely an odd digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the number has to be odd, meaning only the last digit needs to be odd, but no, the question says \"only odd digits\", which should mean all digits are odd.\n\nWait, perhaps some confusion there.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"How many positive 4-digit integers have only odd digits?\"\n\nYes, only odd digits, meaning all four digits must be odd.\n\nSo, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 500 if we consider something else.\n\nWait, maybe the first digit can't be zero, but I already accounted for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a restriction on repeated digits, but the problem doesn't mention any restriction on repetition.\n\nSo, digits can be repeated.\n\nFor example, 1111 is allowed, as are 1357, and so on.\n\nSo, no restriction on repetition.\n\nTherefore, indeed, it's 5 choices for each digit, totaling 5^4 = 625.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled, or perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nBut given that, I think the correct answer should be 625, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is interpreted differently, but based on my reasoning, I think C. 625 is the correct answer.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{625} \\]"
