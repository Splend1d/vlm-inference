Instead of combining all the lists and selecting a random sample from the entire group, they decide to take a random sample of principals from each district. I need to figure out what kind of sampling method this is and which conclusion is correct.\n\nFirst, I should recall the different sampling methods:\n\n1. **Simple Random Sample (SRS):** Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, and selections are made independently.\n\n2. **Cluster Sample:** The population is divided into clusters (groups), and then entire clusters are randomly selected for the sample.\n\n3. **Stratified Sample:** The population is divided into strata (subgroups) based on certain characteristics, and then samples are taken from each stratum.\n\n4. **Systematic Sampling:** Members are selected at regular intervals from a list.\n\nIn this scenario, the researcher is sampling from each of the 125 school districts, which are like subgroups or strata. They are taking a random sample from each district separately. This sounds a lot like stratified sampling because the population is divided into distinct subgroups (strata), and samples are drawn from each stratum.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. **This is a simple random sample obtained in an easier and less costly manner than procedures involving sampling from the entire population of principals.**\n\n- Wait, a simple random sample would involve selecting principals randomly from the entire population, not from each district separately. So, this doesn't sound right.\n\nB. **This is a cluster sample in which the population was divided into heterogeneous groups called clusters.**\n\n- In cluster sampling, entire clusters are selected at random, and all members within those clusters are included in the sample. Here, the researcher is selecting samples from each cluster (district), not entire clusters. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nC. **This is an example of systematic sampling, which gives a reasonable sample as long as the original order of the list is not related to the variables under consideration.**\n\n- Systematic sampling involves selecting every kth element from a list. There's no mention of selecting every kth principal here, so this doesn't seem applicable.\n\nD. **This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.**\n\n- This matches my earlier thought. Stratified sampling allows for comparing differences between strata, which could be useful for analyzing variations between districts.\n\nSo, the correct conclusion is D. This is a stratified sample, which may give comparative information that a simple random sample wouldn't give.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
