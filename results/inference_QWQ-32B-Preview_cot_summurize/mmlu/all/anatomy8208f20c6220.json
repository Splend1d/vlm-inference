                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about the pupillary light reflex is correct. I remember that the pupillary light reflex is when your pupils constrict in response to bright light. It's an important reflex that helps protect the retina from getting damaged by too much light.\n\nOption A says, \"Its efferent limb is carried in the optic nerve.\" Hmm, efferent means the pathway that carries the signal from the brain to the muscle to constrict the pupil. I think the optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain, which would be the afferent pathway, not the efferent one. So maybe A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says, \"It is mediated by the inferior colliculi in the midbrain.\" I know that the pupillary light reflex involves the brain, but I'm not sure about the inferior colliculi. I think the reflex is mediated by the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain, not the inferior colliculi. The inferior colliculi are involved in auditory processing, I believe. So probably B is not correct.\n\nOption C says, \"It is a consensual reflex.\" Consensual means that when you shine light in one eye, both pupils constrict. I think that's true for the pupillary light reflex. So maybe C is correct.\n\nOption D says, \"Its afferent limb is carried in the oculomotor nerve.\" Wait, the afferent limb carries the sensory information from the eye to the brain, which should be the optic nerve, not the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve is cranial nerve III and it controls the muscles that move the eye and also controls the pupil constriction. So, it should be involved in the efferent pathway, not the afferent one. Therefore, D seems incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check. The pupillary light reflex: light hits the retina, which sends a signal through the optic nerve (cranial nerve II) to the brain, specifically to the pretectal nucleus. From there, neurons send signals through the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) to the iris sphincter muscle, causing the pupil to constrict.\n\nAlso, it is indeed consensual, meaning that shining light in one eye affects both pupils\u2014both pupils will constrict, even if light is only shone in one eye.\n\nSo, based on that, option C seems to be the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
