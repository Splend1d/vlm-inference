                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the ancient city of Cahokia. The question is: \"The ancient city of Cahokia contained more than _______ and a population of around _______.\" And there are four options:\n\nA. 120 earthen mounds; 10,000\n\nB. 60 burial mounds; 2,000\n\nC. 50 religious monuments; 5,000\n\nD. 200 pyramidal mounds; 200,000\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct. I remember that Cahokia was a big settlement in pre-Columbian North America, located near present-day St. Louis, Missouri. It was built by the Mississippian culture, and it's known for its large earthen mounds.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how many mounds were in Cahokia. I think it had a significant number, but I'm not sure exactly how many. Option A says more than 120 earthen mounds, option B says more than 60 burial mounds, option C says more than 50 religious monuments, and option D says more than 200 pyramidal mounds.\n\nI know that Cahokia had a central mound called Monks Mound, which is the largest earthwork in North America. Besides that, there were many other mounds serving different purposes, like residential mounds, burial mounds, and plazas.\n\nI believe the total number of mounds was around 120, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nAlso, regarding the population, I remember that Cahokia was one of the largest cities in pre-Columbian America, with a population that might have been comparable to some European cities at the time. I think the population estimate is around 10,000 to 20,000 people at its peak.\n\nOption A says 10,000, which sounds plausible. Option B says 2,000, which seems too low. Option C says 5,000, which could be possible but maybe a bit low. Option D says 200,000, which sounds way too high.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the time frame. Cahokia flourished from around 600 to 1400 AD, and its population peaked around 1050 to 1200 AD.\n\nI recall that some sources estimate the population to have been as high as 40,000 people, but I think that's on the higher end. A more conservative estimate is around 10,000 to 20,000.\n\nAlso, regarding the mounds, I think the number is closer to 120. I remember seeing maps of the site with over 100 mounds.\n\nOption D mentions pyramidal mounds, but I think the mounds at Cahokia were earthen mounds, not pyramidal like in Mesoamerica. So maybe that's not accurate.\n\nOption C mentions religious monuments, which could be correct, but the number 50 seems low compared to what I recall.\n\nOption B says 60 burial mounds, but again, I think there were more than that.\n\nSo, based on my memory, option A seems the most accurate: more than 120 earthen mounds and a population of around 10,000.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should verify the facts.\n\nFirst, let's check the number of mounds at Cahokia.\n\nAccording to my knowledge, Cahokia had about 120 mounds, but perhaps there are more recent discoveries.\n\nI recall that there are about 80 mounds still visible today, but historically, there were more.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a reliable source to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the layout of Cahokia.\n\nThere was a central plaza, Monk's Mound, and surrounding areas with other mounds.\n\nSome sources might provide a precise number, but I don't have access to them right now.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with my initial thought that there were more than 120 mounds.\n\nNow, about the population.\n\nI remember that estimates vary widely, from as low as 10,000 to as high as 40,000.\n\nBut considering the area and the resources available, a population of 10,000 seems more plausible.\n\nOption D suggests 200,000, which would be extraordinary and, in my opinion, unlikely.\n\nSo, balancing these thoughts, I think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
