I've got this question: \"Which of these animals shares its name with a luxury car?\" And the options are A. yak, B. gazelle, C. sloth, and D. jaguar.\n\nOkay, first I need to think about each of these animals and see if there's a car brand or model that has the same name.\n\nStarting with A. yak. A yak is a type of livestock, like a cow, but found in high altitudes, I think. I don't recall any car called Yak. Maybe some off-road vehicle, but I'm not sure.\n\nNext, B. gazelle. Gazelle is an African antelope, known for its speed. Hmm, I think there's something. Wait, isn't there a car called Gazelle? I think I've heard of a Volkswagen Gazelle, but was that a luxury car? Actually, I'm not sure about that. Maybe it was more of a commercial vehicle or something.\n\nThen, C. sloth. A sloth is that slow-moving mammal from Central and South America. I don't think there's a car called Sloth. Maybe some ultra-slow concept car, but that doesn't seem likely.\n\nFinally, D. jaguar. Jaguar is a big cat, a predator known for its power and grace. Now, I know there's a car brand called Jaguar. It's a British luxury car manufacturer. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like Jaguar is the one that's clearly a luxury car brand, sharing its name with the animal.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about the others again.\n\nYak: No car association that I can recall.\n\nGazelle: There was a Volkswagen Gazelle, but Volkswagen is a mass-market brand, not really luxury. So, probably not.\n\nSloth: Nothing comes to mind for a car called Sloth.\n\nJaguar: Definitely a luxury car brand.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. jaguar.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
