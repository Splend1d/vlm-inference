                    "text": "Let's see. I have this case here about a 3-year-old girl who got a PPD skin test, and now there's 10 mm of induration at the site. Her parents are surprised because their own tests were nonreactive, and they've been healthy. They've been living in homeless shelters and vacant buildings recently.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a PPD skin test is. It's used to test for tuberculosis infection. The induration of 10 mm suggests that she might have been exposed to TB, especially since she's in a high-risk environment like a homeless shelter.\n\nOption A is to call her previous physician to get more history. That could be helpful, but I don't know if there's time, and maybe the parents can provide some history themselves.\n\nOption B is to order a chest x-ray. That seems relevant because if she has TB, especially pulmonary TB, it would show up on an x-ray.\n\nOption C is to test for HIV antibody. Hmm, why would that be necessary? Well, HIV can weaken the immune system, making someone more susceptible to TB. Also, in some areas, TB and HIV co-infection is common. But she's only 3 years old, and her parents say she's been healthy.\n\nOption D is to repeat the PPD skin test. But she just had it 48 hours ago. Why repeat it so soon?\n\nLet me think about this again. She's 3 years old, lives in a shelter, and has 10 mm of induration. According to the CDC, for children under 5 in high-risk settings, any induration of 5 mm or more is considered positive.\n\nSo, in this case, 10 mm is definitely positive. The next step should be to confirm whether this is a true TB infection or possibly a false positive.\n\nGiven that, ordering a chest x-ray makes sense to check for active TB disease. If the x-ray is normal, then maybe it's a latent infection, and treatment can be considered.\n\nBut why consider HIV testing? Well, children with HIV are at higher risk for TB, and if she's HIV positive, that could explain a positive PPD in the absence of TB exposure. Also, in some areas, HIV and TB co-infection is common, especially in high-risk populations like homeless individuals.\n\nWait, but her parents say she's been healthy and hasn't had much medical care in the past 2 years. Maybe they don't know her HIV status, especially if they've been living in unstable conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps testing for HIV is a good idea to rule out immunocompromise that could be causing a false-positive PPD or to identify co-infection.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the PPD is accurate, and she has been exposed to TB in the shelter.\n\nI guess the most appropriate step would be to order a chest x-ray to check for active TB disease.\n\nBut the question is asking for the most appropriate step at this time.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. Call her previous physician to obtain more history.\n\nThat might be useful, but it might take time, and perhaps the parents can provide some history for now.\n\nB. Order a chest x-ray.\n\nThis seems immediate and relevant.\n\nC. Order a test for HIV antibody.\n\nThis might be important if there's a chance she's HIV positive, which could affect the interpretation of the PPD.\n\nD. Repeat the PPD skin test.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense so soon after the first test.\n\nConsidering that she's in a high-risk environment and has a positive PPD, and given the possibility of HIV co-infection, maybe both B and C are important.\n\nBut I have to choose one.\n\nPerhaps ordering the chest x-ray is the most urgent step to rule out active TB disease.\n\nThe HIV test can be done, but it might take time to get results, and the x-ray can be done more quickly.\n\nAlso, if the x-ray is normal, then maybe proceed with HIV testing to interpret the PPD result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both should be done simultaneously.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, I'll go with ordering a chest x-ray.\n\nSo, option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
