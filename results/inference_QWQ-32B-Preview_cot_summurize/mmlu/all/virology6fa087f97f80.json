                    "text": "I think the answer is D. Direct-acting antivirals like daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. Hepatitis C is a viral infection that affects the liver, and for a long time, the standard treatment was interferon, which had a lot of side effects and wasn't always effective. But in recent years, there have been big advances in medications that directly target the virus, and these are called direct-acting antivirals or DAAs.\n\nDaclatasvir and sofosbuvir are two examples of these DAAs. They work by blocking specific proteins that the hepatitis C virus needs to replicate itself. When these proteins are inhibited, the virus can't make copies of itself as easily, and over time, the amount of virus in the body decreases until it's undetectable.\n\nThese new treatments have several advantages over older methods like interferon. For one, they have fewer side effects, which makes them easier for patients to tolerate. They also have higher cure rates, meaning more people who take them are able to clear the virus from their systems completely. Plus, the treatment courses are shorter, often lasting only 8 to 12 weeks, whereas interferon treatments could go on for six months or more.\n\nSo, while interferon was a significant step forward when it was first introduced, the development of DAAs like daclatasvir and sofosbuvir has really transformed the way hepatitis C is treated today. They're more effective, better tolerated, and lead to better outcomes for patients.\n\nOption B, a new vaccine, isn't correct because there is no vaccine available for hepatitis C yet. Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B, but not C. Option C, monoclonal antibodies, aren't the primary treatment for hepatitis C; they're more commonly used in other types of infections or cancers.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is D: Direct-acting antivirals such as daclatasvir and sofosbuvir.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
