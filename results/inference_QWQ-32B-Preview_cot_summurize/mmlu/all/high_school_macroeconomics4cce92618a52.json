It provides a more accurate reflection of economic growth by removing the distortions caused by price level changes. This allows for a better comparison of economic output over time.\n\nOption A is incorrect because real GDP is not simply the actual GDP as opposed to an estimate; both real and nominal GDP are calculated and reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the United States.\n\nOption B is incorrect because current-dollar GDP refers to nominal GDP, which is GDP measured at current market prices without adjusting for inflation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because real GDP is indeed calculated for the United States by the BEA as part of its national income and product accounts."
