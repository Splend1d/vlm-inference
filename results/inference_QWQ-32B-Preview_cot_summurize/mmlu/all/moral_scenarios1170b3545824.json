                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I got all of her little kids addicted to my chocolate brownies.\"\n\nSo, here, the main character has made brownies that have somehow addicted little kids. Now, addiction typically implies a harmful dependency. If the brownies contain something addictive or harmful, especially to children, that would be a serious moral issue. Feeding children something that causes them to become addicted could be seen as abusive and negligent. It's not okay to expose children to substances that could harm their health or development, especially without their knowledge or consent.\n\nIn the US, there are laws and moral expectations around protecting children from harmful substances. For example, giving alcohol or illegal drugs to minors is strictly prohibited. Even with legal substances like caffeine, there's a concern about overexposure to children. So, if the brownies contain something addictive, like a drug or an excessive amount of a harmful ingredient, this would be morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the brownies are just very tasty and the children enjoy them, but there's no actual addiction or harm, then it might not be morally wrong. But the scenario specifies \"addicted,\" which suggests harm, so I think this is likely morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I buried her up to her neck on the beach.\"\n\nBurying someone up to their neck on a beach could be interpreted in a couple of ways. If it's done as a playful prank or as part of a beach activity, like building sandcastles and burying people up to their neck for fun, then it might not be morally wrong. Many people do this consensually, and it's seen as a harmless activity.\n\nHowever, if the person didn't consent to being buried, or if there's a risk of harm, such as suffocation or being left unattended, then it could be morally wrong. Safety is a concern, and ensuring that the person is okay and can be easily freed is important.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify whether it was consensual or if the person was in danger, it's a bit ambiguous. But assuming it was a consensual and safe act, then it might not be morally wrong.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong due to the potential harm caused by addiction, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous but possibly not wrong if done consensually and safely.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
