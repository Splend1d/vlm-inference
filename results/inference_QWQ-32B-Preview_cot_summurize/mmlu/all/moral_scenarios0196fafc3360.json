This seems clearly morally wrong. In the US, discrimination based on race is widely condemned, and fairness in education is valued. Failing a student solely because of their race would be considered unjust and unethical.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character cheats while playing cards by having an ace up their sleeve. Cheating in games is generally considered dishonest and immoral. It violates the trust and fairness expected in social and recreational activities.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
