The 80-acre tract included the family home, an exquisite mansion built in 1929 by a wealthy industrialist. For many years, the closest town to the tract had been in the grips of economic decline. However, in 1988 and 1989, several large corporations built plant facilities in the local area. By the early 1 990s, prosperity had burst upon the area. To take advantage of the real estate boom, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots. By 1995, the attorney had sold 90 lots to various individual buyers.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. So, there's an attorney who bought an 80-acre tract in a rural area back in 1980. This tract includes a fancy mansion built in 1929. For many years, the area was economically depressed, but then in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some big corporations set up plants there, and the area prospered. As a result, the attorney divided the 80-acre tract into 160 lots and started selling them, with deeds that included restrictions limiting the use to single-family residences. By 1995, he had sold 90 lots to individual buyers, each with these restrictive covenants.\n\nThen, in 1996, the county board of supervisors bought 30 lots from the attorney for the purpose of building a new county pest-control office. The deed to the county didn't mention the restrictive covenants that were in the other deeds, and instead had a clause saying that the conveyance was in lieu of exercising eminent domain.\n\nAfter that, the county rezoned those 30 lots to permit the construction of the pest-control office, and started building it. At this point, all the other lot owners sued to stop the construction or to get damages.\n\nThe question is: If the county board of supervisors prevails on both counts, it will be because of which option?\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. The power of eminent domain is the equivalent of the power to zone.\n\nI'm not sure about this. Eminent domain is the power to take private property for public use, usually with compensation, while zoning is the power to regulate land use for the public welfare. They're related but not exactly the same thing.\n\nB. The purchase of the 80-acre tract property by a public body with the power of eminent domain is an act of inverse condemnation.\n\nInverse condemnation is when a government action has the same effect as a taking, even if it wasn't intended as eminent domain. But in this case, the county did purchase the property, so it's a voluntary purchase, not inverse condemnation.\n\nC. The abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant is not a compensable taking.\n\nThis seems relevant. Restrictive covenants are private agreements that limit how property can be used, and if the county isn't bound by them, it might affect the value of the neighboring properties. But I need to think about whether voiding the covenant constitutes a taking that requires compensation.\n\nD. Restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n\nThis seems pertinent because the county's deed didn't include the restrictive covenants. So, perhaps the county isn't bound by them, whereas the other lot owners are.\n\nLet me try to understand the legal principles here.\n\nFirst, restrictive covenants are private agreements that run with the land, binding not just the original parties but also their successors in title, provided certain conditions are met, like notice and intent.\n\nIn this case, the attorney included in the deeds to the 90 lots sold to individual buyers a covenant that the property shall not be used for other than single-family residences, and also a covenant to include similar restrictions in all deeds to lots in the 80-acre tract.\n\nHowever, when selling to the county board of supervisors, the attorney didn't include these restrictions in the deed. Instead, there's a clause saying that the conveyance is in lieu of exercising eminent domain.\n\nSo, the question is whether the county is bound by the restrictive covenants despite them not being in their deed.\n\nI think the key here is that restrictive covenants are generally enforceable only against those who have agreed to them, either by accepting them in their deed or by some other manifestation of assent.\n\nSince the county's deed doesn't contain the restrictive covenants, and the county is a governmental entity, it might not be bound by them.\n\nAdditionally, governmental entities often have sovereign immunity or other legal protections that could affect the enforceability of private covenants against them.\n\nAlso, the county is planning to use the property for a public purpose, which might override private covenants.\n\nFurthermore, the county rezoned the property to permit the construction of the pest-control office, which suggests that local land use regulations now allow this use.\n\nSo, if the county isn't bound by the restrictive covenants and has rezoned the property, the other lot owners might not be able to enforce the covenants against the county.\n\nNow, regarding the options:\n\nOption A suggests that the power of eminent domain is equivalent to the power to zone. I don't think that's accurate. Eminent domain is about taking property for public use, while zoning is about regulating how property can be used. They are related but distinct powers.\n\nOption B mentions inverse condemnation. Inverse condemnation occurs when government actions effectively take private property without formally exercising eminent domain. However, in this case, the county did purchase the property, so it's a straightforward purchase, not inverse condemnation.\n\nOption C talks about the abrogation of the right to enforce the restrictive covenant not being a compensable taking. This might be relevant if the county's action somehow diminishes the value of the neighboring properties due to the voiding of the covenant. However, I'm not sure if voiding a restrictive covenant constitutes a taking that requires compensation.\n\nOption D states that restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions. This seems to align with the general principle that restrictive covenants run with the land and bind those who have agreed to them in their deeds.\n\nGiven that the county's deed doesn't contain the restrictive covenants, it's possible that the county isn't bound by them, whereas the other lot owners are.\n\nTherefore, if the county prevails, it would be because restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n\nBut wait, there might be more to it.\n\nPerhaps the attorney's covenant to include similar restrictions in all deeds is relevant here. The attorney covenanted to insert similar restrictions in all deeds to lots in the 80-acre tract. However, he didn't include them in the deed to the county. So, perhaps the attorney breached that covenant by not including the restrictions in the county's deed.\n\nBut even if that's the case, it might not directly affect the county's ability to use the property as it sees fit, especially since it's a governmental entity.\n\nMoreover, the county's deed has a clause stating that the conveyance is in lieu of the exercise of eminent domain. This might imply that the county is treating the purchase as equivalent to eminent domain, which could have implications for the enforceability of private covenants.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, governmental entities may not be bound by private restrictive covenants when they acquire property for public use.\n\nAdditionally, the county's rezoning of the property to permit the pest-control office might override the restrictive covenants, as zoning regulations generally govern land use.\n\nTherefore, the county might argue that its acquisition of the property and subsequent rezoning supersede any private covenants.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most plausible reason for the county to prevail would be option D: restrictions on the use of land can be enforced only against a buyer whose deed contains the restrictions.\n\nThis is because the county's deed doesn't contain the restrictive covenants, and therefore, they don't bind the county.\n\nThe other options don't seem as directly applicable or accurate in this context.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
