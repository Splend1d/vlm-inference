                    "text": "So I have this question here about which pair of liquids is expected to be immiscible. The options are:\n\nA. H2O and CH3OH\n\nB. C6H6 and C5H12\n\nC. C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH\n\nD. CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH\n\nI need to figure out which one of these pairs won't mix well, meaning they are immiscible. To do that, I need to recall some basic principles about liquid mixtures and what makes liquids miscible or immiscible.\n\nFirst off, \"miscible\" means that two liquids can mix in any proportion, meaning they can form a homogeneous mixture regardless of the ratio in which they are mixed. \"Immiscible\" means they don't mix; they tend to separate into layers.\n\nA common rule of thumb is \"like dissolves like.\" This means that substances with similar types of intermolecular forces are more likely to be miscible. So, polar liquids mix with other polar liquids, and nonpolar liquids mix with other nonpolar liquids. Mixing polar and nonpolar liquids often results in immiscibility.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: H2O and CH3OH\n\nH2O is water, which is\u6781\u6027 because of its bent shape and the difference in electronegativity between oxygen and hydrogen. CH3OH is methanol, which also has a hydroxyl group (-OH), making it polar as well. Since both are polar, they should be miscible. In fact, methanol is fully miscible with water.\n\nOption B: C6H6 and C5H12\n\nC6H6 is benzene, which is a nonpolar aromatic hydrocarbon. C5H12 is pentane, which is also a nonpolar alkane. Both are nonpolar, so they should be miscible with each other.\n\nOption C: C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH\n\nC10H22 is likely decane, a nonpolar alkane. CH2CH2CH2OH appears to be a typo or shorthand for something like propane-1-ol (CH3CH2CH2OH), which has a hydroxyl group making it polar. So here, we have a nonpolar liquid and a polar liquid. Based on the \"like dissolves like\" principle, these should be immiscible.\n\nOption D: CH3CH2NH2 and CH3CH2CH2OH\n\nCH3CH2NH2 is ethylamine, which has a nitrogen atom with a lone pair, making it polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. CH3CH2CH2OH is propanol, which also has a hydroxyl group and can hydrogen bond. Both are polar and capable of similar types of intermolecular interactions, so they should be miscible.\n\nWait a minute, in option C, if CH2CH2CH2OH is indeed propane-1-ol, then it's polar due to the -OH group, and C10H22 is nonpolar, so they should be immiscible. But let's make sure about the notation.\n\nThe formula CH2CH2CH2OH seems off; perhaps it's meant to be CH3CH2CH2OH, which is propane-1-ol. If that's the case, then yes, it's polar. C10H22 is a long-chain alkane, which is nonpolar.\n\nAlternatively, if CH2CH2CH2OH is meant to be OHC-CH2-CH2OH, which is glycerol, that would still be polar due to multiple hydroxyl groups. But assuming it's propane-1-ol, option C should have a nonpolar and a polar liquid, which should be immiscible.\n\nHowever, in reality, some degree of mixing can occur between polar and nonpolar liquids due to the formation of micelles or other aggregates, but generally, they are considered immiscible.\n\nWait, but I recall that some alcohols can mix with alkanes to some extent, especially if the alcohol is short-chain and the alkane is also short-chain. But as the alkane chain gets longer, the immiscibility increases.\n\nGiven that C10H22 is a fairly long alkane chain, and CH3CH2CH2OH is a short-chain alcohol, they are likely to be immiscible.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to ensure that option C is indeed the correct answer.\n\nOption A: Water and methanol are both polar and fully miscible.\n\nOption B: Benzene and pentane are both nonpolar and should mix well.\n\nOption D: Ethylamine and propanol are both polar and should be miscible.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the pair that is expected to be immiscible.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any specific cases or exceptions where nonpolar and polar liquids might be miscible. Generally, the \"like dissolves like\" rule holds, but there could be exceptions based on specific interactions.\n\nFor example, hydrogen bonding can sometimes allow some miscibility between polar and nonpolar substances, but in the case of C10H22 and CH3CH2CH2OH, the nonpolar alkane chain is too large to engage in significant interactions with the polar hydroxyl group, so they should separate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option C: C10H22 and CH2CH2CH2OH.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
