                    "text": "So I have this problem here about vector spaces and subspaces of polynomials. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst, V is the vector space of all real polynomials of degree at most 3. So, any polynomial in V can be written as p(x) = a + bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3, where a, b, c, d are real numbers. I know that the dimension of V is 4 because the basis for V would be {1, x, x\u00b2, x\u00b3}, and there are four elements in this basis.\n\nNow, W is a subspace of V consisting of all polynomials p(x) in V such that p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0. So, these are polynomials of degree at most 3 that have roots at x=0, x=1, and x=-1.\n\nWait a minute, if a polynomial of degree at most 3 has three roots, doesn't that mean it has to be the zero polynomial? Because a non-zero polynomial of degree n can have at most n roots. So, a degree 3 polynomial can have at most 3 roots, and if it has exactly 3 roots, it's determined up to a scalar multiple.\n\nBut here, p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0, so the only polynomial that satisfies this is the zero polynomial, right? That would mean W consists only of the zero polynomial, and hence dim W = 0.\n\nBut if that's the case, then dim V + dim W = 4 + 0 = 4, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are non-zero polynomials of degree at most 3 that have these three roots. But, as I thought, that would only be possible if the polynomial is the zero polynomial.\n\nWait, or maybe I should consider that p(x) is of the form p(x) = kx(x-1)(x+1), where k is a real number. But expanding this, p(x) = kx(x\u00b2 - 1) = k(x\u00b3 - x), which is a polynomial of degree 3, provided k \u2260 0.\n\nSo, p(x) = k(x\u00b3 - x), and this polynomial satisfies p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 for any real number k.\n\nSo, W consists of all polynomials of the form k(x\u00b3 - x), where k is in R. Therefore, W is one-dimensional, spanned by the polynomial x\u00b3 - x.\n\nAh, so dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5, which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that only the zero polynomial satisfies p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0, but now I see that any scalar multiple of x(x-1)(x+1) also satisfies these conditions.\n\nSo, W is indeed one-dimensional.\n\nWait, but is there any other polynomial in V that satisfies p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 besides the multiples of x(x-1)(x+1)?\n\nI don't think so, because any polynomial of degree 3 is determined by its roots up to a scalar multiple.\n\nSo, W is spanned by {x(x-1)(x+1)} = {x\u00b3 - x}, and hence dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 5.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a trick here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are more constraints or something I'm missing.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is to consider the conditions p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0 as linear equations that the coefficients of p(x) must satisfy.\n\nSo, let p(x) = a + bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3.\n\nThen, p(0) = a = 0.\n\np(1) = a + b + c + d = 0.\n\nBut since a = 0, this becomes b + c + d = 0.\n\np(-1) = a - b + c - d = 0.\n\nAgain, since a = 0, this is -b + c - d = 0.\n\nSo, we have the system:\n\n1. a = 0\n\n2. b + c + d = 0\n\n3. -b + c - d = 0\n\nFrom equation 1, a = 0.\n\nAdding equations 2 and 3: (b + c + d) + (-b + c - d) = 0 + 0 \u21d2 2c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0.\n\nSubstituting c = 0 into equations 2 and 3:\n\nFrom equation 2: b + 0 + d = 0 \u21d2 b + d = 0 \u21d2 d = -b.\n\nFrom equation 3: -b + 0 - d = 0 \u21d2 -b - d = 0 \u21d2 d = -b.\n\nSo, d = -b.\n\nTherefore, p(x) = a + bx + cx\u00b2 + dx\u00b3 = 0 + bx + 0x\u00b2 + (-b)x\u00b3 = b(x - x\u00b3).\n\nSo, p(x) = b(x - x\u00b3) for some real number b.\n\nThis confirms that W is spanned by {x - x\u00b3}, and hence dim W = 1.\n\nTherefore, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 5.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other constraints or if I've miscounted the dimensions.\n\nWe know that V has dimension 4, and W is a subspace defined by three conditions (p(0) = p(1) = p(-1) = 0). Each condition corresponds to a linear equation in the coefficients a, b, c, d.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n1. a = 0\n\n2. b + c + d = 0\n\n3. -b + c - d = 0\n\nThese are three equations, but as we saw, they reduce to a = 0, c = 0, and d = -b.\n\nSo, effectively, there is only one free parameter, b, which determines the polynomial p(x) = b(x - x\u00b3).\n\nTherefore, the number of independent constraints is such that the dimension of W is 1.\n\nHence, dim V + dim W = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
