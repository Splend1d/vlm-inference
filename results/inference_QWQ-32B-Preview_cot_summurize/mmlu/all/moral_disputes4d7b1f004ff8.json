The question is: \"Kant refers to the special worth or value of persons as\n\nA. virtue.\n\nB. beauty.\n\nC. praiseworthiness.\n\nD. dignity.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to recall what Kant said about the value of persons. I remember that Kant was a big proponent of treating people as ends in themselves and not just as means to an end. He talked about the inherent worth of human beings.\n\nLet me think about the term \"dignity.\" I think Kant used the concept of dignity in relation to human beings. In his moral philosophy, he emphasized that people have a dignity that must be respected.\n\nLet me consider the other options. Virtue is more about moral excellence or good character. Beauty is related to aesthetics, which is about what is pleasing to the senses or the mind. Praiseworthiness seems to be about deserving praise, which might be related to doing something good or virtuous.\n\nBut dignity seems to fit best with the idea of inherent worth or value that Kant attributed to persons. I think in his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant discusses dignity in relation to moral law and the respect owed to rational beings.\n\nLet me double-check. In Kant's philosophy, dignity (German: W\u00fcrde) is a central concept in his moral theory. He distinguishes between price (Preis) and dignity (W\u00fcrde). Things that have a price have a market value, but things that have dignity are priceless and incomparable.\n\nPersons, according to Kant, have dignity because they are rational beings capable of making moral decisions. This dignity is something that should never be compromised or treated instrumentally.\n\nSo, comparing the options:\n\nA. Virtue \u2013 that's more about moral character.\n\nB. Beauty \u2013 that's about aesthetic value.\n\nC. Praiseworthiness \u2013 that's about deserving praise for actions.\n\nD. Dignity \u2013 that's about inherent worth and respect due to rational beings.\n\nIt seems clear that dignity is the term Kant used to describe the special worth or value of persons.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should look it up in a philosophy textbook or a reliable source on Kant's ethics. But based on my knowledge, dignity is the correct answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this one. The answer is D. dignity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
