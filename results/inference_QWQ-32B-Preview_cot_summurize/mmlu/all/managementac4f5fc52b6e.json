It is based on the idea that leaders provide clear instructions and rewards for desired behaviors, while also punishing undesirable behaviors. This approach emphasizes maintaining the status quo and achieving short-term goals through a system of rewards and punishments.\n\nKey characteristics of transactional leaders include:\n\n1. **Guiding**: Transactional leaders provide clear directions and expectations to their followers. They outline what needs to be done and how it should be done, ensuring that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.\n\n2. **Commanding**: These leaders often take a more authoritative approach, issuing orders and expecting compliance. They may closely monitor performance and intervene when necessary to ensure tasks are completed as instructed.\n\n3. **Motivating through rewards and punishments**: Transactional leaders use a system of incentives and deterrents to motivate their team members. Rewards are given for meeting or exceeding performance standards, while punishments or penalties are imposed for failing to meet expectations.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the correct answer is:\n\n**B. Guiding, commanding and motivating**\n\nOption A includes \"mentoring,\" which is more associated with developmental leadership styles rather than transactional leadership. Option C includes \"demonstrating,\" which is not a primary characteristic of transactional leadership. Option D includes both \"mentoring\" and \"demonstrating,\" neither of which are central to transactional leadership.\n\nIn summary, transactional leaders are primarily concerned with maintaining order, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently, and using a system of rewards and punishments to motivate their team members."
