Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that when you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive. So, -40 divided by -8 should give me a positive number. That means options B and C, which are negative, probably aren't right.\n\nLet me double-check that rule about negative numbers. Yes, negative divided by negative equals positive. Negative divided by positive equals negative, and positive divided by positive equals positive. So, in this case, since both numbers are negative, the quotient should be positive.\n\nOkay, so that narrows it down to options A and D. Now, I need to figure out what -40 divided by -8 actually is.\n\nI remember that division is basically asking how many times one number fits into another. So, -8 multiplied by what number equals -40? Well, 8 times 5 is 40, but since both numbers are negative, it should be positive 5. So, -8 times 5 equals -40, but wait, no: -8 times 5 is -40, and since both negatives make a positive in division, the answer should be positive 5.\n\nWait a minute, let's think about it differently. If I have -40 and I divide it by -8, it's like asking how many -8's are there in -40. Well, if you have -40, and you add -8 five times, you get -40. Because -8 plus -8 is -16, plus -8 is -24, plus -8 is -32, plus -8 is -40. So, five times -8 gives -40. Therefore, -40 divided by -8 is 5.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5, which is option D.\n\nBut let's check option A, which is 1 over 5, or 0.2. Does -40 divided by -8 equal 0.2? No, that doesn't make sense because 0.2 times -8 would be -1.6, not -40. So, that's definitely not right.\n\nSimilarly, options B and C are negative, which we've already determined shouldn't be the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5} \\]"
