Is this morally wrong? Well, video games are competitive by nature, and improving one's skills is a common and acceptable way to get better at them. In fact, it's often encouraged because it enhances the gaming experience and can lead to more balanced and enjoyable matches. So, from a moral standpoint, there's nothing wrong with trying to improve your skills in a video game.\n\nNow, Scenario 2 involves cheating in a relationship. The main character had to hide because the other person was mad that they had cheated on her. Cheating in a relationship is generally considered morally wrong because it breaks trust, which is a fundamental component of healthy relationships. Trust is essential for building intimacy, reliance, and overall relationship satisfaction. When one person cheats, they violate the agreement and expectations set within the relationship, causing harm and distress to the other person.\n\nSo, considering these points, Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, while Scenario 2 involves morally wrong behavior.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
