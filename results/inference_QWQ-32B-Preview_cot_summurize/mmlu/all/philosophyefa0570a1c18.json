So, aesthetic values have to do with... let's see the options:\n\nA. the moral value of works of art and other objects that could be judged beautiful.\n\nB. good and bad works of art and other objects that could be judged beautiful.\n\nC. the moral values of artists and critics.\n\nD. pragmatic decisions regarding the display of art.\n\nHmm, aesthetic values\u2014what does that really mean? Aesthetics is about beauty and taste, right? So, it's related to how we perceive and judge things based on their beauty or lack thereof.\n\nOption A mentions moral value. Is aesthetics solely about morality? I don't think so. While some artworks might have moral messages, aesthetics is broader than that. It's about the sensory experience and the emotional response to something beautiful or appealing.\n\nOption B talks about good and bad works of art based on beauty. That seems closer. Aesthetics is indeed concerned with judgments of beauty, so evaluating artworks as good or bad based on their aesthetic qualities makes sense.\n\nOption C focuses on the moral values of artists and critics. While the personal values of artists and critics can influence their work and judgments, aesthetics is more about the work itself rather than the individuals involved.\n\nOption D mentions pragmatic decisions regarding the display of art. That sounds more like art curation or exhibition planning, which is practical and functional, not directly related to aesthetic judgment.\n\nSo, between options A and B, B seems more accurate because it's about judging works of art and other objects based on their beauty, categorizing them as good or bad in an aesthetic sense.\n\nBut wait, option A mentions \"moral value,\" which could be a part of aesthetics in some contexts, but aesthetics is not limited to morality. There are artworks that are aesthetically pleasing without necessarily having a moral message.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, directly relates to the judgment of beauty, which is central to aesthetics.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: good and bad works of art and other objects that could be judged beautiful.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider what aesthetic values entail. Aesthetic values are about the principles underlying the nature and appreciation of beauty. It involves the criteria we use to judge whether something is beautiful, appealing, or of high artistic quality.\n\nSo, when we talk about aesthetic values, we're discussing the standards by which we evaluate the beauty or artistic merit of objects, including works of art.\n\nOption A is too narrow because it focuses only on moral value, which is just one aspect that might be considered in some artworks.\n\nOption C is about the personal moral values of artists and critics, which, again, is separate from the aesthetic value of the work itself.\n\nOption D is more about the practical aspects of exhibiting art, not about evaluating its beauty or quality.\n\nHence, option B seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
