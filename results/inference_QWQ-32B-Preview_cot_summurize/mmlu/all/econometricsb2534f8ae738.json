                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which features of financial asset return time-series can be captured using a standard GARCH(1,1) model. The options are:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution\n\nii) Leverage effects\n\niii) Volatility clustering\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns\n\nAnd the answer choices are:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a GARCH(1,1) model is and what it can capture.\n\nGARCH stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's a model used in finance to predict volatility in time-series data, like stock returns. The standard GARCH(1,1) model is a specific case where we have one lag of the squared return and one lag of the conditional variance in the model.\n\nSo, let's go through each of the features:\n\ni) Fat tails in the return distribution:\n\nFat tails mean that the returns have higher kurtosis than a normal distribution, indicating more extreme values or outliers. GARCH models can capture fat tails indirectly because they model time-varying volatility, which can lead to fatter tails in the return distribution. However, strictly speaking, GARCH models assume that the standardized residuals are independently and identically distributed, often assumed to be normal or student-t distributed, which can capture fat tails. But the GARCH model itself doesn't directly model the fat tails; it's the combination of GARCH with a distribution that allows for fat tails.\n\nii) Leverage effects:\n\nLeverage effects refer to the phenomenon where negative returns tend to increase future volatility more than positive returns of the same magnitude. In other words, bad news increases volatility more than good news. The standard GARCH(1,1) model doesn't capture leverage effects because it treats positive and negative returns symmetrically. To capture leverage effects, you would need an asymmetric GARCH model, like EGARCH or GJR-GARCH.\n\niii) Volatility clustering:\n\nVolatility clustering is the observation that large changes in returns tend to be followed by large changes, and small changes tend to be followed by small changes. This is a key feature that GARCH models are designed to capture. The GARCH(1,1) model explicitly models this by including lagged variances and squared returns in the equation for conditional variance.\n\niv) Volatility affecting returns:\n\nThis is a bit vague. If it means that volatility Granger-causes returns, or that there's a relationship between volatility and returns, that's not directly captured by the standard GARCH(1,1) model. GARCH models are focused on modeling the volatility of returns, not the relationship between volatility and returns themselves. However, in some extended models, like APARCH or models with time-varying coefficients, you might capture such effects, but not in the standard GARCH(1,1).\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- i) Fat tails:\u95f4\u63a5 captured, but requires assumption about the distribution of standardized residuals.\n\n- ii) Leverage effects: Not captured by standard GARCH(1,1).\n\n- iii) Volatility clustering: Captured by GARCH(1,1).\n\n- iv) Volatility affecting returns: Not captured by standard GARCH(1,1).\n\nGiven this, the correct answer seems to be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about (i) because while GARCH can lead to fat tails in the return distribution, it's not that the GARCH model directly captures fat tails; it's more about the combination of GARCH with a suitable distribution for the residuals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (i) is considered captured because GARCH models can produce return distributions with fatter tails than normal, even if the standardized residuals are assumed to be normal.\n\nI think the best answer is B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
