                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to recall what Rawls said about the two parts of his theory. I think it's related to his political philosophy, particularly in his book \"A Theory of Justice.\" Rawls proposed two principles of justice that he believed should govern a just society.\n\nThe first principle is the liberty principle, which asserts that each person has an equal right to the most extensive basic liberties compatible with similar liberties for others. The second principle is the difference principle, which allows social and economic inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society.\n\nNow, regarding the relationship between these two parts of his theory, I need to remember if Rawls thought they were interdependent or independent.\n\nI think the correct answer is A. are interdependent: You cannot accept one part without accepting the other. Rawls likely saw these principles as complementary and necessary for a comprehensive theory of justice. Each principle plays a crucial role, and accepting one without the other would undermine the overall coherence of the theory.\n\nLet me consider the other options to make sure. Option B says they are independent: You can accept either part without accepting the other. But that doesn't seem right because, in Rawls's view, these principles are meant to work together to form a complete theory of justice.\n\nOption C says they are provable from self-evident premises. Rawls was influenced by Kant and sought a rational foundation for his theory, but I don't recall him claiming that his principles are self-evident or provable in a deductive sense. Instead, he based them on the original position and the veil of ignorance, which are thought experiments to arrive at principles of justice.\n\nOption D says they cannot be justified via rational means. That also doesn't seem accurate because Rawls devoted a lot of effort to providing a rational justification for his principles through his method of reflective equilibrium and the original position.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is A. The two parts of Rawls's theory are interdependent, and accepting one requires accepting the other for the theory to hold together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
