I answer: Out of local conditions and the necessities of the case methods of government will grow. If England can govern foreign lands, so can America. If Germany can govern foreign lands, so can America. If they can supervise protectorates, so can America. Why is it more difficult to administer Hawaii than New Mexico or California? Both had a savage and an alien population; both were more remote from the seat of government when they came under our dominion than the Philippines are to-day.\nWill you say by your vote that American ability to govern has decayed; that a century's experience in self-rule has failed of a result? Will you affirm by your vote that you are an infidel to American power and practical sense? Or will you say that ours is the blood of government; ours the heart of dominion; ours the brain and genius of administration? Will you remember that we do but what our fathers did\u2014we but pitch the tents of liberty farther westward, farther southward\u2014we only continue the march of the flag?\n\u2014Albert Beveridge, \"The March of the Flag,\" Indianapolis, September 16, 1898\nBeveridge's speech was a response to which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about a speech given by Albert Beveridge in 1898, called \"The March of the Flag.\" It seems like it's related to some kind of expansion or acquisition of territory by the United States. The options are about different historical events: the purchase of Alaska, the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War, and World War I.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the speech is about. Beveridge is talking about governing \"new possessions\" and mentions Hawaii and the Philippines. He's arguing that the United States has the ability to govern these territories, just like other countries do. He compares the governance of these new territories to that of New Mexico and California, which were also incorporated into the United States with their own unique challenges.\n\nThe speech was given in 1898, which is a key date. Let's recall what was happening in 1898 in terms of U.S. foreign policy and territorial acquisitions.\n\nI know that in 1898, the Spanish-American War took place. As a result of that war, the United States acquired several territories, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. Also, earlier in that year, Hawaii was annexed by the United States.\n\nSo, the mention of Hawaii and the Philippines in the speech suggests that it's related to these acquisitions.\n\nOption A is the purchase of Alaska. That happened in 1867, which is long before 1898. So, that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nOption B is the Mexican War, which took place in the 1840s. Again, that's before 1898.\n\nOption C is the Spanish-American War, which occurred in 1898. That matches the date of the speech.\n\nOption D is World War I, which started in 1914, after 1898.\n\nGiven that the speech mentions Hawaii and the Philippines, which were acquired in 1898 during and after the Spanish-American War, it's logical to conclude that Beveridge's speech was a response to the Spanish-American War and the subsequent acquisitions.\n\nMoreover, the tone of the speech seems to be defending the idea of expansion and the United States taking on a more significant role in global affairs, which aligns with the imperialist sentiment that was present during and after the Spanish-American War.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. The Spanish-American War.\n\nBut let's double-check. Was there any specific event in 1898 related to these territories?\n\nYes, the Spanish-American War started in April 1898 and ended in August 1898. As part of the Treaty of Paris signed in December 1898, the United States gained control over Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. Also, in July 1898, the U.S. annexed Hawaii.\n\nSo, the speech was likely given in the context of these recent events, arguing for the United States' ability to govern these new possessions.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
