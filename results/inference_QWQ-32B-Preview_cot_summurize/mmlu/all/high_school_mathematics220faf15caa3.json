Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that three-digit numbers start from 100 and go up to 999. So, the smallest three-digit number is 100 and the largest is 999.\n\nTo find out how many numbers there are in total, I think I can subtract the smallest three-digit number from the largest and then add one, because both ends are inclusive.\n\nSo, it would be 999 minus 100, which is 899, and then adding one makes it 900. Wait, but let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about how many options there are for each digit in the number. A three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\n- For the hundreds place, it can be from 1 to 9, because 0 would make it a two-digit number. So, 9 options.\n\n- For the tens and units places, each can be from 0 to 9, so 10 options each.\n\nSo, total numbers would be 9 (for hundreds) times 10 (for tens) times 10 (for units), which is 900.\n\nThat matches my first calculation. So, it seems like there are 900 three-digit positive integers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another way. If I list out the numbers from 100 to 999, how many are there?\n\nIf I think about the range, 100 is the first number, and 999 is the last. To find the count, I can subtract 99 (since 99 is the largest two-digit number) from 999.\n\n999 minus 99 is 900. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are 999 total positive integers up to 999, and subtract the first 99 numbers (which are two-digit or smaller), that also gives me 900.\n\nSo, all these methods point to 900 being the correct answer.\n\nI think the confusion might come from including or excluding the endpoints, but in this case, both 100 and 999 are three-digit numbers, so they should both be included.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 900.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{900} \\]"
