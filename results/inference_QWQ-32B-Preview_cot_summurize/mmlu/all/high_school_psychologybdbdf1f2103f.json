                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who among these psychologists would most likely say that \"people are basically good.\" Let's look at each one and see what their theories suggest about human nature.\n\nFirst, there's Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. He's known for his ideas about the unconscious mind and the struggle between the id, ego, and superego. Freud had a pretty pessimistic view of human nature, believing that people are driven by primal instincts and often engage in selfish and aggressive behaviors. So, it doesn't seem like he would think people are basically good.\n\nNext is B.F. Skinner, the famous behaviorist. He focused on how behavior is shaped by environmental factors, like reinforcement and punishment. Skinner didn't really make judgments about whether people are good or bad; he was more interested in understanding and controlling behavior through external stimuli. So, I don't think he would specifically say that people are basically good.\n\nThen there's Albert Ellis, a cognitivist known for developing Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). Ellis believed that our thoughts and beliefs influence our emotions and behaviors. He emphasized the importance of rational thinking and challenging irrational beliefs. While he promoted positive change, I don't recall him specifically stating that people are inherently good. Maybe he saw people as having the potential for goodness but not necessarily as being basically good.\n\nFinally, there's Carl Rogers, a humanist psychologist. Humanism is all about the inherent goodness and potential for growth in every person. Rogers is famous for his client-centered therapy, which emphasizes empathy, unconditional positive regard, and congruence. He believed that people have an innate tendency toward self-actualization and that they can fulfill their potential given the right conditions. This sounds a lot like believing that people are basically good.\n\nSo, comparing all these psychologists, it seems like Carl Rogers, the humanist, would most likely say that \"people are basically good.\" The other psychologists either had different focuses or more nuanced, perhaps less optimistic, views of human nature.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
