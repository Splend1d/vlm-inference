The objection is that freedom of association is much more important in marriage than in politics, and I need to figure out what Wellman says in response.\n\nOption A says that there is no freedom of association in the marital context. But that seems extreme; marriage definitely involves choosing to associate with someone, so I doubt Wellman would say that.\n\nOption B says that his argument doesn't require marital and political freedom of association to be equally important. This sounds plausible. Maybe he's saying that even if marital association is more important, his overall argument still holds.\n\nOption C claims that freedom of association is equally important in both contexts. But the objection suggests that it's more important in marriage, so if Wellman agrees with the objection, he might not say they're equal.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which I might consider if none of the other options seem right.\n\nLet me think about this. The key here is understanding Wellman's position in relation to the objection. If someone objects that marital freedom of association is more important than political, Wellman might respond in different ways.\n\nOption B seems the most reasonable because it allows for the difference in importance without undermining his argument. Maybe his argument about freedom of association is valid regardless of the degree of importance in different contexts.\n\nOption A is unlikely because it denies freedom of association in marriage, which contradicts the very concept of marriage.\n\nOption C goes against the objection that marital association is more important, so if Wellman acknowledges the objection, he probably wouldn't say they're equally important.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: his argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
