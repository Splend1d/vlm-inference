                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. So, we have a shopper who got hurt in a grocery store after slipping on a puddle. She's now suing the store for damages. During the trial, she testified that after falling, while she was sitting on the floor, she heard the assistant manager tell an employee, \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" The store's lawyer objected to this testimony on hearsay grounds. Now, we need to figure out what the court will decide based on the options provided.\n\nFirst off, let's understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if someone testifies about something they heard someone else say outside of court, and the purpose is to prove that what was said is true, that's hearsay and generally not admissible unless there's an exception.\n\nIn this case, the shopper is testifying about what the assistant manager said to an employee. The statement is \"I thought I told you to get that mess up!\" If the shopper is using this statement to prove that there was indeed a mess on the floor that the employee was supposed to clean up, then it seems like hearsay because she's trying to prove the truth of the statement\u2014that there was a mess that should have been addressed.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement was not hearsay\u2014it was offered to show that they were aware of a problem on the floor.\n\nThis option suggests that the statement isn't hearsay because it's being used to show the store's knowledge of the problem, not to prove that there was actually a mess. In other words, it's being offered to demonstrate notice or awareness on the part of the store, which is relevant to establishing negligence.\n\nIn legal terms, this might fall under the category of statements indicating knowledge or belief, which can be admissible for that purpose even if they also assert a fact (like the existence of a mess). So, perhaps this is a valid exception to the hearsay rule.\n\nB. The objection will be sustained because the asst. manager's statement was pure hearsay and she had to be available for cross-examination for the statement to be admissible.\n\nThis option argues that the statement is hearsay and, therefore, inadmissible unless the assistant manager is present for cross-examination. However, as we considered in option A, if the statement is being used to show knowledge or notice rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted, it might not be hearsay.\n\nMoreover, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule that might apply here, such as admissions by a party-opponent. Since the assistant manager is an agent of the grocery store, her statement could be considered an admission by a party-opponent, which is generally admissible.\n\nC. The objection will be sustained because the statement was irrelevant to whether or not the store was negligent and liable for the shopper's injuries.\n\nThis option suggests that the statement doesn't have any bearing on the issue of negligence and liability. However, if the statement shows that the store was aware of the mess and had instructed an employee to clean it up, that could be highly relevant to whether the store exercised reasonable care to maintain a safe environment.\n\nKnowing about the mess and failing to clean it up promptly could establish negligence on the store's part. Therefore, this statement seems quite relevant to the negligence claim.\n\nD. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nThis option is similar to option A but specifies that the statement is a vicarious admission by the party opponent. In other words, since the assistant manager is an agent of the grocery store, her statement can be attributed to the store itself.\n\nUnder the law, statements by agents concerning matters within the scope of their employment are generally admissible as admissions by a party-opponent. This is because the agent's statements are considered to be the party's own statements.\n\nGiven this, option D seems strong. The assistant manager's statement about telling an employee to clean up the mess suggests that she knew about the mess and had instructed action to be taken, which could imply that the store was on notice and had a duty to address the hazard.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the most accurate answer is D. The objection will be overruled because the asst. manager's statement, made in the scope of her duties, was a vicarious admission of the party opponent, the grocery store.\n\nThis aligns with the principle that statements by agents within the scope of their employment are admissible as admissions by the party-opponent. It also acknowledges the relevance of the statement to the issue of the store's knowledge and response to the hazardous condition, which is central to establishing negligence.\n\nOption A is also plausible, but option D more specifically identifies the legal basis for the statement's admissibility. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the potential for the statement to be an admission by a party-opponent, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. Option C is clearly wrong because the statement is directly relevant to the store's knowledge and response to the hazardous condition.\n\nTherefore, the court is likely to overrule the objection based on the statement being a vicarious admission by the party opponent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
