It's abusive and can cause serious harm or even death to the infant. There's no justification for such an action, and it goes against basic principles of care and protection for vulnerable individuals.\n\nIn Scenario 2, volunteering a 99-year-old granny to enter an abandoned mine to rescue lost children seems risky, but it's not necessarily morally wrong. The intention appears to be rescue and helping others, which are positive actions. However, the wisdom of such a decision might be questioned due to the granny's age and potential risks involved, but morally, it's different from intentional harm.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
