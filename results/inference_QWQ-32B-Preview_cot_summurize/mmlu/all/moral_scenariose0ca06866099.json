The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I put the gerbil in the oven for 35 minutes.\n\nScenario 2: I brought a knife with me when I went to school.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to look at each scenario separately and judge whether it's morally wrong based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: putting a gerbil in the oven for 35 minutes. First, gerbils are small pets, right? So, placing a live gerbil in an oven, especially for a significant amount of time like 35 minutes, sounds really harmful and potentially deadly. In most people's eyes, that would be abusing an animal, which is generally considered morally wrong. Animal cruelty is against the law in many places, so that aligns with it being morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: bringing a knife to school. This seems like a serious safety issue. Schools are supposed to be safe environments for learning, and bringing a weapon like a knife to school could pose a danger to others. Even if the intention isn't to harm anyone, the act itself can be seen as reckless or negligent, which is also generally considered morally wrong. There are laws and school policies against bringing weapons to school for good reasons.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's think about possible contexts or intentions behind these actions, even though the question doesn't provide any.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe the gerbil escaped, and the person was trying to contain it in the oven temporarily, not realizing the danger. But even then, putting a live animal in an oven is still problematic, as ovens are for heating and cooking. So, regardless of intent, the action itself is harmful.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps the knife was for a legitimate reason, like a drama performance or a cooking class, and proper permissions were obtained. In that case, it might not be morally wrong. However, the scenario just says \"I brought a knife with me when I went to school,\" without any context. So, based on that alone, it's reasonable to consider it wrong.\n\nGiven that, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
