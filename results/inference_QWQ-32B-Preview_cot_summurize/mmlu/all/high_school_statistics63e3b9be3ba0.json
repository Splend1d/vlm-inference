                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about midterm and final exam scores. It says that the midterm scores are normally distributed with a mean of 52 points and a standard deviation of 4 points. The final exam scores are normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points. There's one student who scored 58 points on the midterm, and the question is, if she had the same z-score on the final exam, what must her score have been?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what a z-score is. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula for z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the value of the element,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the set,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the set.\n\nSo, for the midterm, the student scored 58 points, the mean is 52, and the standard deviation is 4. Plugging these into the formula gives:\n\n\\[ z_{\\text{midterm}} = \\frac{(58 - 52)}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\]\n\nSo, the student's z-score on the midterm is 1.5. Now, the problem says that she had the same z-score on the final exam. That means her z-score on the final is also 1.5.\n\nNow, I need to find out what score on the final exam corresponds to a z-score of 1.5, given that the final exam scores have a mean of 112 and a standard deviation of 10.\n\nUsing the z-score formula again, but this time solving for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{(X - 112)}{10} \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( X \\):\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 10 = X - 112 \\]\n\n\\[ 15 = X - 112 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 15 + 112 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 127 \\]\n\nSo, the student must have scored 127 points on the final exam to have the same z-score of 1.5.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 15 points\n\nB. 58 points\n\nC. 118 points\n\nD. 127 points\n\nThe correct answer is D. 127 points.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, z-score for midterm:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(58 - 52)}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, for the final exam, using z = 1.5, mean = 112, standard deviation = 10:\n\n\\[ 1.5 = \\frac{(X - 112)}{10} \\]\n\n\\[ X - 112 = 1.5 \\times 10 = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ X = 112 + 15 = 127 \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The problem says \"the same standardized score (z-score)\" on the final exam, so it's clear that the z-scores should be equal.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the z-score is a measure of how far away a particular score is from the mean in terms of standard deviations. So, if someone has the same z-score on two different tests, it means they performed similarly relative to the other test-takers in each test.\n\nIn this case, the student scored 58 on the midterm, which is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean, and to have the same relative performance on the final, she needs to score 1.5 standard deviations above the final's mean, which is 127 points.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 127 points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
