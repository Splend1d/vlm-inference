                    "text": "So, I've got this question here about multigrained bread and how advice about its health benefits affects the market. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nThe question says that consumers are advised that multigrained bread will substantially lessen the risk of cancer. So, basically, there's new information out there saying that this type of bread is good for you, right? It helps prevent cancer.\n\nNow, I need to think about what happens in the market for multigrained bread when people hear this. There are a few options: the demand curve could shift, or the supply curve could shift, and depending on which one shifts, the price could go up or down.\n\nLet me recall what demand and supply curves represent. The demand curve shows how much of a good consumers are willing to buy at different prices, holding other factors constant. The supply curve shows how much producers are willing to supply at different prices.\n\nIn this case, the advice is about the health benefits of multigrained bread. That seems like it would affect demand, right? Because it's about consumers' preferences and perceptions of the product's value.\n\nIf multigrained bread is now seen as something that can prevent cancer, more people might want to buy it, even at the current price. So, the demand for multigrained bread would increase. That means the demand curve would shift to the right, because at every price level, more people want to buy the bread.\n\nNow, if demand increases and supply stays the same, what happens to the price? Well, if more people want to buy the same amount of bread, but suppliers aren't making more yet, the price should go up. That makes sense.\n\nSo, option C says that the demand curve will shift to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread. That seems logical.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says the demand curve shifts to the left, decreasing the price. But that would happen if people suddenly didn't want multigrained bread anymore, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption B says the supply curve shifts to the left, increasing the price. Shifting the supply curve to the left means suppliers are offering less at every price level. But in this scenario, nothing is mentioned about suppliers changing their behavior; it's about consumer advice.\n\nOption D says the supply curve shifts to the right, decreasing the price. That would happen if suppliers decide to make more multigrained bread, but again, the question is about consumer advice, not about suppliers' decisions.\n\nSo, it seems like option C is the correct one. The demand curve shifts to the right, increasing the price of multigrained bread.\n\nBut wait a minute, maybe in the long run, suppliers would see that demand has increased and decide to supply more. Would that happen?\n\nWell, in the short term, the demand increases, and if supply doesn't change immediately, prices go up. Then, seeing higher prices and higher demand, suppliers might decide to increase supply, shifting the supply curve to the right, which would bring prices back down.\n\nBut the question seems to be asking about what happens when consumers are advised about the health benefits, which immediately affects demand. So, probably, the immediate effect is the demand curve shifting to the right, increasing price.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
