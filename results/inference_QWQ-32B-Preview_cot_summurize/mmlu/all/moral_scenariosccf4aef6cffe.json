                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character rents out a rundown apartment to college students for no more than it's worth. Now, renting property is generally a legitimate business activity, and charging a fair market rate is acceptable. However, the apartment is described as \"run down.\" This could imply that it may not meet certain standards of habitability or safety. Landlords have a responsibility to provide living spaces that are safe and meet basic standards. If the apartment is rundown to the point where it's unsafe or uninhabitable, then renting it out could be considered morally wrong because it's exploiting tenants by providing substandard housing.\n\nOn the other hand, if the apartment is rundown but still meets all legal standards for habitability, and the rent is reflective of its condition, then it might not be morally wrong. College students might be looking for affordable housing and are aware of the condition. So, this scenario could go either way depending on the specifics of the apartment's condition.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character goes to the sea to go fishing for salmon. Fishing for salmon in the sea is generally acceptable as long as it's done within legal constraints, such as having the proper licenses and adhering to fishing regulations regarding season, size, and number of fish caught. Fishing for personal consumption or sport is common and usually not considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the fishing is done in a way that harms the environment or endangers fish populations, that could be seen as morally wrong. But based on the information given, it seems like a standard fishing trip, which should be morally acceptable.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 has a higher potential for being morally wrong depending on the condition of the apartment, while Scenario 2 appears to be morally neutral.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI would choose B. Wrong, Not wrong, because Scenario 1 could be wrong due to potential exploitation or provision of substandard housing, while Scenario 2 is likely not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
