                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about depositions in a civil lawsuit, and it presents three statements, I, II, and III, and asks which of them are true. The options are A. II only, B. I and II only, C. II and III only, and D. I, II, and III.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a deposition is. In civil litigation, a deposition is a pre-trial procedure where a witness's testimony is taken under oath, but outside of court. It's used to discover information, preserve testimony, or impeach a witness at trial. Depositions are governed by the rules of civil procedure, specifically Rule 30 in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and similar rules in state courts.\n\nLet's look at statement I: \"A deposition of a person against whom another person contemplates filing an action may be compelled by the party contemplating the action, without leave of court, before the action is filed.\"\n\nHmm, interesting. So, can someone take a deposition before even filing a lawsuit? Generally, depositions are taken after a lawsuit has been filed, but is there a provision for taking depositions before filing a lawsuit?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, pre-litigation depositions are allowed under certain circumstances. For example, in federal court, Rule 27 allows for depositions to be taken before an action is filed if certain conditions are met. However, it usually requires a court order, not just the party's discretion.\n\nSo, without leave of court, meaning without the court's permission, can a party take a deposition before filing a lawsuit? I think the answer is no, at least in federal court. The party would need to seek leave of the court to take a pre-litigation deposition.\n\nTherefore, statement I seems false.\n\nMoving on to statement II: \"A deposition of the defendant in an action may be taken by the plaintiff without service of a subpoena on the defendant.\"\n\nOkay, so this is about how to compel someone to attend a deposition. A subpoena is a legal document that orders someone to appear and testify or produce documents.\n\nIn civil cases, parties to the lawsuit are already under an obligation to participate in discovery, including depositions, once the lawsuit is filed. So, does the plaintiff need to serve a subpoena on the defendant to take their deposition?\n\nActually, no. Under Rule 30, a notice of deposition must be served on the parties, but subpoenas are typically used to compel non-parties to attend depositions. Since the defendant is a party to the action, they are already bound by the court's jurisdiction and the rules of discovery.\n\nTherefore, the plaintiff doesn't need to serve a subpoena on the defendant to take their deposition; a notice of deposition is sufficient.\n\nSo, statement II seems true.\n\nNow, statement III: \"A deposition may be taken even though all the testimony secured by it will be inadmissible at the trial.\"\n\nThis is intriguing. So, can a party take a deposition if they know that none of the testimony will be admissible at trial?\n\nWell, the purpose of depositions is not only to get admissible testimony but also to discover information, to understand the other side's case, to preserve testimony, or to prepare for trial.\n\nEven if the testimony itself won't be admissible, the deposition can still be useful for these other purposes.\n\nMoreover, there's no rule that requires that all testimony in a deposition must be admissible at trial. In fact, a lot of deposition testimony might not make it to trial due to evidentiary rules.\n\nTherefore, it seems that statement III is also true.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Statement I: False\n\n- Statement II: True\n\n- Statement III: True\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. II only.\n\nB. I and II only.\n\nC. II and III only.\n\nD. I, II, and III.\n\nGiven that I think I and III are false and II is true, but actually, I reconsidered: I think I is false, II is true, and III is true.\n\nWait, but option C is II and III only, which aligns with my conclusion.\n\nHowever, let me double-check.\n\nStatement I: Cannot take a deposition before filing a lawsuit without court leave. I believe that's correct; you generally need court permission for pre-litigation depositions.\n\nStatement II: Plaintiff doesn't need to serve a subpoena on the defendant to take their deposition. Correct, as defendant is already a party to the action.\n\nStatement III: Depositions can be taken even if all testimony would be inadmissible at trial. Yes, for discovery purposes and other reasons.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. II and III only.\n\nBut wait, the options include B. I and II only, which would be incorrect because I is false.\n\nAnd D. I, II, and III, which is also incorrect because I is false.\n\nAnd A. II only, which misses III as true.\n\nSo, C seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
