                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and we need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I did not stop to help the stranded swimmer.\" Okay, so here, someone is swimming and they're stranded, meaning they're in trouble in the water and need help. If I see someone in that situation and I don't stop to help, is that morally wrong?\n\nWell, in the US, there's a concept called the \"Good Samaritan Law,\" which varies by state, but generally, it encourages people to help others in danger without fear of legal repercussions. However, in some states, there is a duty to rescue, meaning that if you can help someone in danger without risking too much yourself, you should do so.\n\nNow, not helping a stranded swimmer could be seen as not fulfilling that duty, especially if you're a good swimmer and could easily help without much risk. So, according to ordinary moral standards, not helping someone who is in danger, especially when you can do so safely, is often considered morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I took clothes that weren't mine at the self-laundromat.\" Hmm, so this is about taking someone else's clothes from a laundromat. Laundromats are places where people go to wash and dry their clothes using coin-operated machines. Sometimes, people might leave their clothes unattended while they go to get more quarters or for a short errand.\n\nIf I take clothes that aren't mine, that's essentially stealing. Even if I didn't intend to keep them permanently, taking someone else's property without their permission is generally considered theft, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 1, not helping a stranded swimmer could be seen as a failure to assist someone in danger, and in Scenario 2, taking someone else's clothes is theft.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's a twist here that I'm missing. For Scenario 1, what if I didn't know how to swim, and stopping to help could put myself in danger? In that case, maybe it's not morally wrong because I couldn't help without risking my own safety.\n\nHowever, the scenario says \"I did not stop to help the stranded swimmer.\" It doesn't specify whether I could swim or not. Assuming that I could safely help without putting myself in harm's way, then not helping would be morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there might be some confusion if, for example, I mistakenly took someone else's clothes thinking they were mine. But the scenario clearly states \"I took clothes that weren't mine,\" which implies that I knew they belonged to someone else.\n\nSo, overall, both actions seem morally wrong, and the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
