                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract law scenario. So, we've got a man who owns a haberdashery, and he orders \"triple-dozen\" purple cashmere socks from a wholesale supplier. Now, \"triple-dozen\" typically means three dozen, right? But somehow, there's a mix-up in the ordering process.\n\nFirst, he places an order for triple-dozen socks, size 10-13, at the current resale price. The supplier's sales agent accepts the order orally at $250 per dozen. So, if it's three dozen, that would be $750 total. But then, the supplier sends a confirmation letter stating 36 dozen socks at $250 per dozen, totaling $9,000. The man receives this letter, glances at it without noticing the quantity or total price, and files it away without responding.\n\nThree weeks later, the supplier tenders 36 dozen socks, which the man rejects, saying he only ordered three dozen. The supplier then resells those socks to another buyer for $8,000 and sues the man for the $1,000 difference. The man pleads the statute of frauds as a defense.\n\nOkay, so the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable, especially if they exceed a certain value or involve specific types of agreements. In this case, the order involves goods worth more than $500, which typically falls under the statute of frauds in many jurisdictions.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the statute was not satisfied by the supplier's tender of the goods, which were rejected by the man, and the supplier did not rely on the oral agreement other than by attempting delivery.\n\nB. Yes, because the agreed price for three dozen socks was over $500, and the supplier's written memo incorrectly stated the quantity of goods ordered.\n\nC. No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\n\nD. No, because the supplier's written memo operated as an acceptance, with proposals for additional terms that became part of the contract after the man failed to object to such additional terms within a reasonable time.\n\nHmm. Let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the man ordered triple-dozen, which is three dozen, at $250 per dozen, totaling $750. The supplier's confirmation letter says 36 dozen at $250 per dozen, totaling $9,000. There's a clear discrepancy here.\n\nNow, the statute of frauds generally requires that contracts for the sale of goods over a certain value be in writing to be enforceable. In this case, both $750 and $9,000 exceed the $500 threshold, so the statute applies.\n\nOption A suggests that the defense is successful because the statute wasn't satisfied by the supplier's tender, which was rejected, and the supplier didn't rely on the oral agreement beyond attempting delivery. But, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) has provisions about how contracts can be enforced even if they don't comply with the statute of frauds in certain circumstances.\n\nOption B says yes, the defense is successful because the agreed price was over $500, and the memo incorrectly stated the quantity. This seems plausible, but let's consider the other options.\n\nOption C says no, the defense isn't successful because the supplier's memo satisfied the statute, and the man failed to object within 10 days. This brings up the UCC's provisions on contract formation and modifications.\n\nOption D says no, because the memo operated as an acceptance with additional terms, which became part of the contract when the man didn't object within a reasonable time.\n\nWait a minute. Under the UCC, when there's a written confirmation sent by one party, it can serve as an acceptance of the terms if the other party doesn't object within a certain time frame. Specifically, UCC 2-201 deals with the statute of frauds, and UCC 2-207 deals with additional terms in confirmatory memoranda.\n\nLet's recall that the man received the confirmation letter but didn't notice the incorrect quantity and didn't respond. Under UCC 2-201, a written confirmation is sufficient against the party who receives it and doesn't object within 10 days.\n\nIn this case, the man received the memo, had reason to know its contents (even if he didn't carefully read it), and didn't give notice of objection within 10 days. So, according to the UCC, the memo would satisfy the statute of frauds, and the terms in the memo would be enforceable.\n\nMoreover, under UCC 2-207, additional terms in a confirmation memo can become part of the contract unless the receiving party objects within a reasonable time. Here, the man didn't object to the quantity stated in the memo.\n\nTherefore, it seems that options C and D are more accurate in this context.\n\nOption C directly states that the memo satisfied the statute against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of its contents, failed to object within 10 days. This aligns with UCC 2-201.\n\nOption D suggests that the memo operated as an acceptance with additional terms that became part of the contract due to the man's failure to object within a reasonable time. This relates to UCC 2-207.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is more directly applicable here because it specifically addresses the statute of frauds and the time frame for objection.\n\nSo, the correct answer is likely C: No, because the supplier's written memo was sufficient to satisfy the statute as against the supplier, and the man, having reason to know of the memo's contents, failed to give notice of objection within 10 days of receipt.\n\nThis means the man's statute of frauds defense wouldn't be successful because the written memo, despite the quantity error, satisfied the statute, and his failure to object within the specified time frame binds him to the terms stated in the memo.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
