                    "text": "Let's see. Madison is in fifth grade, and she tries to pay attention in class, but she has trouble focusing. She looks around the classroom while the teacher is talking, and then when everyone else starts their assignments, she doesn't know what to do. I need to figure out which condition this behavior is characteristic of from the options given: panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these disorders involves.\n\nPanic disorder is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear that may include heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, or a feeling of impending doom. It doesn't seem directly related to Madison's difficulty focusing and paying attention in class.\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Symptoms can include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Again, Madison's issue seems more about attention and focus rather than trauma-related symptoms.\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. Inattention symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention, being easily distracted, forgetfulness in daily activities, and often not listening when spoken to directly. This sounds a lot like Madison's behavior\u2014she tries to listen but looks around and then doesn't know what to do when it's time to start assignments.\n\nBipolar disorder involves episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs. During manic phases, individuals may feel elated, full of energy, and engage in impulsive behavior. Depressive phases can include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and loss of interest in activities. While mood swings could potentially affect focus, the primary symptoms seem more related to mood than to attention difficulties.\n\nGiven this information, Madison's symptoms\u2014difficulty focusing, looking around the classroom, and not knowing what to do when others start assignments\u2014seem most aligned with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Specifically, she appears to exhibit inattention symptoms.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
