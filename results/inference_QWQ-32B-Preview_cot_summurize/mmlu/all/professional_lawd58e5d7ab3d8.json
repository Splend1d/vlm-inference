                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a parcel of land and a bunch of deeds between different people: an artist, a bartender, a counselor, a dentist, and an engineer. The developer owns the land in fee simple absolute, which means they have complete ownership over it. The land is unpossessed, meaning no one is living on it or using it at the moment.\n\nOkay, so the transactions happen in this order:\n\n1. The artist conveys to the bartender.\n\n2. The developer conveys to the artist.\n\n3. The artist conveys to the counselor.\n\n4. The bartender conveys to the dentist.\n\n5. The counselor conveys to the engineer.\n\nAnd then there's recording of deeds: developer to artist, artist to bartender, and artist to counselor, in that order. Then the bartender-to-dentist and counselor-to-engineer deeds are recorded right after they're executed.\n\nThe question is, in a notice jurisdiction, who owns the parcel of land?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a notice jurisdiction is. In a notice jurisdiction, the law protects subsequent purchasers who buy property without actual notice or constructive notice (through recording) of any prior claims or interests.\n\nSo, the key here is the recording of deeds and who had notice at the time of purchase.\n\nLet's map out the conveyances and recordings:\n\n- Developer \u2192 Artist\n\n- Artist \u2192 Bartender\n\n- Artist \u2192 Counselor\n\n- Bartender \u2192 Dentist\n\n- Counselor \u2192 Engineer\n\nRecordings:\n\n- Developer to Artist\n\n- Artist to Bartender\n\n- Artist to Counselor\n\nThen,\n\n- Bartender to Dentist (recorded immediately after execution)\n\n- Counselor to Engineer (recorded immediately after execution)\n\nNow, the developer is the original owner in fee simple absolute.\n\nFirst conveyance: Artist to Bartender. But hold on, the developer conveys to the artist later. Wait, the sequence of conveyances is a bit confusing because it's listed in that order, but likely, the developer conveying to the artist happens before the artist conveys to others.\n\nWait, maybe I should list them in chronological order based on when they were executed:\n\n1. Developer conveys to Artist.\n\n2. Artist conveys to Bartender.\n\n3. Artist conveys to Counselor.\n\n4. Bartender conveys to Dentist.\n\n5. Counselor conveys to Engineer.\n\nAnd the recordings:\n\n- Developer to Artist\n\n- Artist to Bartender\n\n- Artist to Counselor\n\nThen,\n\n- Bartender to Dentist (recorded immediately after execution)\n\n- Counselor to Engineer (recorded immediately after execution)\n\nAssuming that \"immediately after execution\" means right after their respective executions.\n\nOkay, now, in a notice jurisdiction, the rule is usually \"first to record\" or \"first in time, first in right,\" but with recording providing constructive notice.\n\nEach grantee paid value and took without actual notice of any facts that would defeat her title and without knowledge of any facts that would put her on inquiry, both at the time she took her deed and at the time she recorded it.\n\nSo, no one had actual notice of any problems with the title.\n\nNow, let's see:\n\n- Developer sells to Artist.\n\n- Artist sells to Bartender and to Counselor.\n\n- Bartender sells to Dentist.\n\n- Counselor sells to Engineer.\n\nNow, recordings:\n\n- Developer to Artist (recorded first)\n\n- Artist to Bartender (recorded second)\n\n- Artist to Counselor (recorded third)\n\n- Bartender to Dentist (recorded after its execution)\n\n- Counselor to Engineer (recorded after its execution)\n\nBut the problem says that the bartender-to-dentist and counselor-to-engineer deeds were each recorded immediately after their respective executions, and this happened after the artist-to-counselor deed was executed and recorded.\n\nSo, timeline:\n\n1. Developer conveys to Artist.\n\n2. Artist conveys to Bartender.\n\n3. Artist conveys to Counselor.\n\n4. Bartender conveys to Dentist.\n\n5. Counselor conveys to Engineer.\n\nRecordings:\n\n- Developer to Artist\n\n- Artist to Bartender\n\n- Artist to Counselor\n\n- Bartender to Dentist (after its execution)\n\n- Counselor to Engineer (after its execution)\n\nNow, in a notice jurisdiction, a subsequent purchaser who records first and without notice of prior interests gets priority.\n\nHere, the developer sells to the artist, who then sells to both the bartender and the counselor.\n\nNow, the artist doesn't have the right to sell the property twice, but in a notice jurisdiction, the first to record would have priority.\n\nWait, but the developer is the original owner. So, if the developer sold to the artist, and the artist sold to the bartender and the counselor, then both the bartender and the counselor are claiming interests in the property through the artist.\n\nBut the artist only has the right to sell the property once, right? Wait, no, in reality, the artist can't sell the property to both the bartender and the counselor because they only own it once. But in terms of deeds and recordings, in a notice jurisdiction, it's about who records first and without notice.\n\nBut in this case, both the artist-to-bartender and artist-to-counselor deeds are recorded, with artist-to-bartender recorded before artist-to-counselor.\n\nSo, the bartender recorded first, so the bartender has priority over the counselor.\n\nThen, the bartender sells to the dentist, and that deed is recorded after its execution.\n\nSimilarly, the counselor sells to the engineer, and that deed is recorded after its execution.\n\nNow, the dentist is claiming through the bartender, and the engineer is claiming through the counselor.\n\nBut since the bartender recorded first, their interest has priority over the counselor's.\n\nTherefore, the dentist, as the grantee from the bartender, would have better title than the engineer.\n\nBut wait, the counselor recorded after the bartender, so the counselor's interest is subordinate to the bartender's.\n\nTherefore, the counselor's conveyance to the engineer wouldn't defeat the bartender's prior interest.\n\nSo, the bartender, and by extension, the dentist, have priority.\n\nTherefore, the owner would be the dentist.\n\nWait, but the engineer is claiming through the counselor, who recorded after the bartender.\n\nSo, the counselor's interest is subordinate to the bartender's.\n\nTherefore, the engineer's interest is also subordinate to the bartender's.\n\nBut then, the bartender sold to the dentist, so the dentist has the bartender's interest plus what was conveyed.\n\nWait, but the dentist bought from the bartender, who had an interest subordinate to the counselor's, but since the bartender recorded first, the bartender has priority.\n\nWait, no, the bartender recorded first, so the bartender's interest is prior to the counselor's.\n\nTherefore, the counselor's deed to the engineer is inferior to the bartender's deed to the dentist.\n\nSo, the dentist has priority over the engineer.\n\nTherefore, the owner is the dentist.\n\nBut let's check the options:\n\nA. The bartender.\n\nB. The counselor.\n\nC. The dentist.\n\nD. The engineer.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, C, the dentist, would be the owner.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn a notice jurisdiction, recording provides constructive notice to subsequent purchasers.\n\nSo, the developer sold to the artist, who then sold to the bartender and the counselor.\n\nThe bartender recorded first, so the bartender has priority over the counselor.\n\nThen, the bartender sold to the dentist, and that deed was recorded after its execution.\n\nSimilarly, the counselor sold to the engineer, and that deed was recorded after its execution.\n\nSince the bartender recorded first, and the dentist is the grantee from the bartender, the dentist has priority over the engineer.\n\nTherefore, the owner is the dentist.\n\nWait, but what about the counselor? Did the counselor have notice of the bartender's interest when they took their deed?\n\nYes, because the artist-to-bartender deed was recorded before the artist-to-counselor deed.\n\nTherefore, the counselor had constructive notice of the bartender's interest when they took their deed.\n\nSimilarly, the engineer, as the grantee from the counselor, also had constructive notice of the bartender's interest.\n\nTherefore, the dentist, as the grantee from the bartender, who recorded first, has priority.\n\nTherefore, the owner is the dentist.\n\nSo, the answer is C. the dentist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
