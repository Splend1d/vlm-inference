It's about the Inca civilization and how they increased their arable land, which is land that can be plowed and used for growing crops. The options are irrigating, terracing, slashing and burning, and fertilizing. I need to figure out which one of these practices was used by the Inca to increase their farmland.\n\nFirst, let's think about the geography of the Inca Empire. The Inca civilization was located in the Andes Mountains of South America, which are very rugged and steep. So, they had to find a way to farm on these slopes without losing soil and water.\n\nOption A is irrigating, which is bringing water to the fields, especially in dry areas. While irrigation is important for agriculture, it doesn't directly increase the amount of land that can be farmed. It makes existing land more productive by providing water, but it doesn't create new arable land.\n\nOption B is terracing. Terracing involves cutting flat areas into slopes, creating steps of land that can be farmed. This practice is especially useful in mountainous regions because it prevents soil erosion and allows for more stable farming conditions. The Incas are famous for their terraces, which allowed them to cultivate crops on otherwise unusable steep land.\n\nOption C is slashing and burning, which is a method of clearing forest land for agriculture by cutting down trees and burning the debris. While this can create short-term fertility in the soil, it's not sustainable in the long run and can lead to soil degradation. Also, the Inca Empire was primarily in the Andes, which may not have had extensive forests in some areas, so this might not have been their main method.\n\nOption D is fertilizing, which involves adding nutrients to the soil to make it more fertile. While fertilizing is crucial for maintaining soil health and crop productivity, it doesn't increase the amount of land that can be farmed. It improves the quality of existing arable land but doesn't create new arable land.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that terracing would be the practice that allowed the Inca to greatly increase the amount of arable land. By creating flat terraces on mountainsides, they were able to cultivate areas that otherwise couldn't be used for farming.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall from my history classes that the Incas were masters of terracing. Their terraces not only provided more farming space but also helped in conserving water and preventing soil erosion. This technique was crucial for their agricultural success in such a challenging terrain.\n\nI think option B, terracing, is the correct answer. The other options, while important for agriculture, don't directly increase the amount of arable land in the way that terracing does, especially in mountainous regions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
