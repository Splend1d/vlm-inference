                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find the best symbolization of the given sentence in propositional logic (PL). The sentence is:\n\n\"A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the sentence into its logical components. It seems like there are a few key parts here:\n\n1. The person was born or died in the present year.\n\n2. Your home was this person's home for the entire time they were alive.\n\n3. A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year.\n\nI need to see how these parts relate to each other logically.\n\nLet me assign some symbols to these parts to make it easier:\n\n- Let's say B represents \"the person was born in the present year.\"\n\n- D represents \"the person died in the present year.\"\n\n- H represents \"your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\"\n\n- L represents \"a person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year.\"\n\nNow, the sentence can be rephrased using these symbols:\n\n\"L if (B or D) and H.\"\n\nSo, in logical terms, it seems like L is true if both (B or D) and H are true.\n\nIn propositional logic, \"if P then Q\" is represented as P \u2283 Q.\n\nBut in this case, it's \"L if P,\" which is equivalent to \"if P then L.\" So, it should be P \u2283 L.\n\nWait, no. Actually, \"L if P\" means that L is true whenever P is true, which is indeed P \u2283 L.\n\nBut let's make sure about the structure here.\n\nThe sentence is: \"A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if [conditions].\"\n\nSo, it's saying that if the conditions are met, then L is true.\n\nTherefore, it's [conditions] \u2283 L.\n\nNow, what are the conditions?\n\n\"The person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\"\n\nSo, conditions are (B \u2228 D) and H.\n\nTherefore, the whole statement should be [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L\n\nB. [L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)] \u2022 H\n\nC. L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H]\n\nD. (B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L\n\nOption A matches what I've come up with.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption B: [L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)] \u2022 H\n\nThis would mean that (L \u2283 (B \u2228 D)) and H.\n\nBut the original sentence doesn't say that if L then (B \u2228 D), and H.\n\nIt says that L if (B \u2228 D) and H.\n\nSo, this doesn't match.\n\nOption C: L \u2283 [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H]\n\nThis would mean that if L, then (B \u2228 D) and H.\n\nBut again, the original says L if (B \u2228 D) and H, which is the other way around.\n\nOption D: (B \u2228 D \u2022 H) \u2283 L\n\nThis seems similar to A, but the parentheses are different.\n\nD has (B \u2228 (D \u2022 H)), which is not the same as ((B \u2228 D) \u2022 H).\n\nSo, D is different.\n\nTherefore, A seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nThe original sentence is:\n\n\"A person is considered to have lived with you for all of the present year if the person was born or died in the present year and your home was this person's home for the entire time this person was alive.\"\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n- Born or died in the present year.\n\n- Home was this person's home for the entire time they were alive.\n\nAnd if both these conditions are met, then L is true.\n\nTherefore, [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the logical structure.\n\nThe sentence is in the form: \"L if P and Q.\"\n\nWhich is equivalent to \"(P and Q) \u2283 L.\"\n\nHere, P is (B \u2228 D), and Q is H.\n\nSo, [(B \u2228 D) \u2022 H] \u2283 L.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
