The options are normal, inferior, complements, or substitutes. Let me try to understand this step by step.\n\nFirst off, what is cross-price elasticity of demand? I remember it's a measure of how the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. The formula is something like: percentage change in quantity demanded of good A divided by the percentage change in the price of good B.\n\nNow, the key here is that it's negative. So, when the price of one good goes up, the quantity demanded of the other good goes down, or vice versa. That suggests that these two goods are somehow connected in a way that when one becomes more expensive, people buy less of the other.\n\nLet me think about normal and inferior goods. Normal goods are those for which demand increases as income increases, and inferior goods are those for which demand decreases as income increases. But in this case, we're talking about the relationship between two goods, not between a good and income. So, options A and B probably aren't the right answers here.\n\nThat leaves complements and substitutes. Complements are goods that are used together, like bread and butter or cars and gasoline. If the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes down because they're used together. Substitutes are goods that can be used in place of each other, like tea and coffee. If the price of one goes up, people might switch to the other.\n\nGiven that, if the cross-price elasticity is negative, it means that when the price of one good increases, the quantity demanded of the other good decreases. That sounds like complements to me, because if one becomes more expensive, people buy less of both.\n\nWait a minute, but substitutes would have a positive cross-price elasticity, right? Because if the price of one goes up, people buy more of the substitute. So, in that case, the cross-price elasticity would be positive.\n\nTherefore, if the cross-price elasticity is negative, the goods must be complements.\n\nLet me double-check that. Suppose goods A and B are complements. If the price of B increases, the quantity demanded of A decreases, because people are buying less of B and therefore need less A to go with it. That would make the cross-price elasticity negative.\n\nOn the other hand, if goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of B would lead to an increase in the quantity demanded of A, as people switch from B to A. That would make the cross-price elasticity positive.\n\nSo, yes, negative cross-price elasticity implies that the goods are complements.\n\nI think that makes sense. Unless there's some exception or special case I'm not thinking of, but based on standard economics, this should be correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
