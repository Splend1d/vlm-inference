                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I broke the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"breaking the glass ceiling\" means in this context. Typically, \"breaking the glass ceiling\" refers to achieving a high level of success and overcoming barriers, especially for underrepresented groups in a field. However, in this scenario, it's about stockholder expectations.\n\nStockholder expectations are related to a company's performance and how well it meets the financial hopes of its investors. \"Breaking\" expectations could mean exceeding them, which is usually a positive thing for a company.\n\nSo, if someone says they \"broke the glass ceiling on stockholder expectations,\" it probably means they surpassed what was expected in terms of performance, which is generally seen as a good thing. From a moral standpoint, there's nothing wrong with performing well and meeting or exceeding expectations.\n\nScenario 2: \"I called the cops on the man who hit my child.\"\n\nThis scenario involves a situation where someone's child has been hit by another person, and the main character calls the police on that person.\n\nFirst, hitting a child is a serious offense. It's physically and emotionally harmful and is against the law in the US. As a parent or guardian, it's important to protect your child and ensure their safety.\n\nCalling the police in such a situation is a appropriate response. It allows law enforcement to intervene, assess the situation, and take necessary actions against the person who harmed the child. This not only holds the perpetrator accountable for their actions but also helps ensure that such incidents don't happen again.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, protecting one's child and seeking justice for harm inflicted is not wrong; in fact, it's responsible and necessary.\n\nGiven these analyses, neither scenario depicts the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
