                    "text": "Let's see. Arno Co. didn't record a credit purchase of merchandise before the year-end, but the merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory. I need to figure out how this omission affects the balance sheet at year-end, specifically assets and liabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a credit purchase is. A credit purchase means that the company bought merchandise on credit, which typically means they received the goods but haven't paid for them yet. So, normally, this would increase both assets (merchandise inventory) and liabilities (accounts payable).\n\nBut in this case, Arno Co. didn't record the purchase. That means they didn't increase their merchandise inventory or their accounts payable. However, the merchandise was included in the year-end physical inventory. So, even though they didn't record the purchase, the inventory count still has the merchandise.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. If they didn't record the purchase, their inventory records shouldn't show the merchandise, but the physical inventory did include it. Maybe the inventory record is correct because they physically have the merchandise, but since they didn't record the purchase, their accounts don't reflect the increase in inventory and the corresponding liability.\n\nLet me think about the balance sheet. Assets are supposed to include all the resources the company owns or controls, and liabilities include all the obligations the company has.\n\nIf they didn't record the purchase, their inventory, which is an asset, would be understated because it doesn't include the cost of the purchased merchandise. But wait, the physical inventory includes the merchandise, so the inventory value should reflect that. Hmm.\n\nWait, no. If they didn't record the purchase, their inventory records might not have the cost of that merchandise recorded, but the physical count includes the merchandise. So, their inventory value might be understated because the cost isn't recorded, but they have more inventory than their records show.\n\nAdditionally, since it's a credit purchase, they owe money for that merchandise, which should be recorded as accounts payable, a liability. But since they didn't record the purchase, their accounts payable doesn't include this liability, so liabilities would be understated.\n\nSo, assets are understated because inventory doesn't include the cost of the purchased merchandise, and liabilities are understated because accounts payable doesn't include the obligation for that purchase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Understated Understated.\n\nBut let me double-check. If they didn't record the purchase, but the inventory is physically there, maybe there's something else I'm missing.\n\nPerhaps the inventory is actually correctly stated because it's included in the physical count, but the cost isn't recorded. Wait, no, the physical count would show the quantity, but the value of inventory is based on cost, which isn't recorded if the purchase isn't recorded.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider the journal entries.\n\nNormally, when you purchase merchandise on credit, you debit inventory and credit accounts payable. If that entry isn't recorded, then inventory is understated and accounts payable is understated.\n\nSo, assets are understated and liabilities are understated.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the inventory is physically there but not recorded, maybe there's an adjustment needed at year-end based on the physical count. But since the question says that the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, perhaps the inventory value is adjusted to reflect the physical count, despite not recording the purchase.\n\nIf that's the case, then inventory might be correctly stated, but accounts payable would still be understated because the liability wasn't recorded.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider how the physical inventory affects the records.\n\nIf they perform a physical inventory count and find more merchandise than what's recorded, they should adjust their inventory records to match the physical count. This would involve recording the missing inventory, which would require recording the purchase.\n\nBut since they didn't record the purchase, perhaps they didn't make the adjustment entry based on the physical count.\n\nIn that case, their inventory records wouldn't match the physical inventory, leading to understated assets and understated liabilities.\n\nAlternatively, if they did adjust inventory to match the physical count but didn't record the corresponding liability, then inventory would be correctly stated, but liabilities would be understated.\n\nBut the question says that the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, which might imply that inventory is correctly stated.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nAssume that at year-end, the balance sheet should reflect the true economic position of the company.\n\nIf they didn't record a credit purchase, meaning they have merchandise that they haven't paid for yet, their assets should include the value of that merchandise, and their liabilities should include the obligation to pay for it.\n\nIf they didn't record the purchase, neither the asset nor the liability is recorded, so both are understated.\n\nBut, if the physical inventory includes the merchandise, and assuming that the inventory is valued based on the physical count, then perhaps the inventory is correctly stated, but the liability isn't recorded, so only liabilities are understated.\n\nBut the question says that the merchandise was correctly included in the year-end physical inventory, which suggests that inventory is correct, but liabilities are understated.\n\nBut that doesn't match with option D, which says both are understated.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is B. No effect on assets, understated liabilities.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because if they haven't recorded the purchase, inventory should be understated.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the physical inventory includes the merchandise, but since it wasn't recorded, their inventory ledger might not reflect the correct value.\n\nHowever, in practice, at year-end, companies adjust their inventory records to match the physical count. So, if they have more inventory than recorded, they should record an adjusting entry to increase inventory and recognize the corresponding liability.\n\nIf they didn't do that, then their inventory would be understated, and their liabilities would also be understated.\n\nTherefore, the balance sheet would show both assets and liabilities as understated.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. Understated Understated.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
