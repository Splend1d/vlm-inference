So, I would go with option C.\n\nBut let me double-check. St. Isidore of Seville is known as the patron saint of the Internet, which doesn't seem related to animals. St. Anthony of Padua is known more for finding lost items and is a patron of lost things, not specifically animals. And St. Joan of Arc is a national heroine of France, known for her role in the Hundred Years' War, not for animals.\n\nSo, yeah, St. Francis of Assisi seems to be the correct answer here. He's also the patron saint of ecology, which further connects him to the natural world and animals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
