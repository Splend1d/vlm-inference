                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about negative residual autocorrelation. It says: \"Negative residual autocorrelation is indicated by which one of the following?\" and then there are four options: A. A cyclical pattern in the residuals; B. An alternating pattern in the residuals; C. A complete randomness in the residuals; D. Residuals that are all close to zero.\n\nOkay, so first things first, I need to understand what residual autocorrelation is. Residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by a model. Autocorrelation refers to the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. So, residual autocorrelation is about whether these residuals are correlated with each other over time or across observations.\n\nNegative residual autocorrelation would mean that if one residual is positive, the next one tends to be negative, and vice versa. It's like they are alternating in sign.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"A cyclical pattern in the residuals.\" A cyclical pattern might suggest that residuals go up and down in a regular cycle, which could indicate positive autocorrelation if the cycle is consistent in direction, but it's not specifically about negative autocorrelation. So, maybe not the best choice.\n\nOption B says: \"An alternating pattern in the residuals.\" This sounds promising because alternating patterns suggest that residuals switch signs from one observation to the next, which is characteristic of negative autocorrelation.\n\nOption C says: \"A complete randomness in the residuals.\" Randomness would suggest no autocorrelation at all, positive or negative. So, this doesn't indicate negative autocorrelation.\n\nOption D says: \"Residuals that are all close to zero.\" If residuals are all close to zero, it might indicate that the model fits the data very well, but it doesn't specify anything about the correlation between residuals. They could be randomly close to zero or have some pattern.\n\nSo, based on this, option B seems to be the most appropriate answer. An alternating pattern in the residuals suggests negative autocorrelation because the residuals tend to switch signs from one observation to the next.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about the properties of negative autocorrelation. In a time series context, negative autocorrelation at lag 1 means that the correlation between consecutive residuals is negative. So, if one residual is above zero, the next one is likely below zero, and vice versa. This is exactly an alternating pattern.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. An alternating pattern in the residuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
