                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out how annelids and arthropods are similar. I know that both are phyla in the animal kingdom, but I'm not entirely sure about their specific characteristics.\n\nOption A says they both have segmented bodies. I think annelids, like earthworms, are definitely segmented. Each segment has similar structures, and they have a repeating pattern. Arthropods, like insects and crustaceans, also have segmented bodies, right? Like how a beetle's body is divided into different segments: head, thorax, and abdomen. So, both have segmented bodies. That seems likely.\n\nOption B mentions a closed circulatory system. I think annelids have a closed circulatory system. For example, earthworms have blood vessels and their blood flows in a closed system. Arthropods, like insects, also have a closed circulatory system, where the blood is contained within vessels. So, this could be another similarity.\n\nOption C talks about gas exchange by diffusion through a moist membrane. I know that earthworms breathe through their moist skin by diffusion. Arthropods, on the other hand, have different respiratory systems. Insects have tracheae, which are tubes that directly deliver oxygen to cells, and crustaceans have gills. So, not all arthropods conduct gas exchange through a moist membrane. Maybe this isn't a universal similarity.\n\nOption D says they have well-developed sense organs. Annelids like earthworms have some sensory organs, but they're not as complex as those in arthropods. Arthropods, especially insects, have highly developed sense organs like compound eyes and antennae. So, while both may have sense organs, they might not be equally well-developed in all members of both phyla.\n\nConsidering all this, options A and B seem like strong possibilities. Both annelids and arthropods have segmented bodies and a closed circulatory system. Option C isn't universally true for arthropods, and option D might not hold for all members of both phyla.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is that members of both phyla have segmented bodies, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
