                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what happens to most popular third-party movements in politics. There are four options here:\n\nA. They replace one of the two main parties and become major parties themselves.\n\nB. They are ignored by the public because their ideas are seen as too extreme.\n\nC. Their supporters get discouraged and stop participating in politics.\n\nD. They fall apart when one or both of the main parties take up their goals.\n\nI need to think about how third parties usually fare in a two-party system like in the United States.\n\nOption A suggests that third parties can replace one of the major parties. I know that in U.S. history, there have been third parties that have had some impact, like the Progressive Party or the Libertarian Party, but I don't recall any of them actually displacing one of the two main parties\u2014Democratic or Republican. So, maybe A isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B says that third parties are abandoned because their politics are too radical. While some third parties do have platforms that are considered extreme, not all of them do. For example, the Green Party might be seen as radical by some, but other third parties have more centrist positions. So, this might not apply to all third parties.\n\nOption C mentions that supporters get frustrated and withdraw from politics. That could happen in some cases, but it doesn't describe the fate of the third-party movement itself, just the reaction of its supporters. So, perhaps that's not the best description.\n\nOption D says that third parties disintegrate when the major parties adopt their goals. This seems plausible because sometimes major parties pick up popular ideas from third parties to broaden their appeal. For instance, the Progressive Era saw the Republican Party adopting some progressive policies, which might have drawn support away from third parties.\n\nLet me think about another example. In the 1992 presidential election, Ross Perot's Independent candidacy received a significant portion of the vote. After that, some of his policy positions, like reducing the federal budget deficit, gained more attention from the major parties. Perhaps this led to a decline in support for Perot's movement in subsequent elections.\n\nAlso, historically, the Populist Party in the late 19th century had some successes, but many of its ideas, such as the secret ballot and the direct election of senators, were eventually adopted by the Democratic and Republican Parties, which might have lessened the need for the Populist Party.\n\nSimilarly, the Tea Party movement that emerged in 2009 had a significant impact on Republican politics, pushing the party to the right on certain issues. As a result, some Tea Party supporters felt that the Republican Party had adopted their causes, which might have led to the movement's decline.\n\nOn the other hand, some third parties maintain a presence over time, like the Libertarian Party, without being absorbed by the major parties.\n\nConsidering these examples, it seems that option D\u2014third parties disintegrating when major parties adopt their goals\u2014is a common fate for many popular third-party movements.\n\nBut I should also consider whether all third parties experience this. For instance, some third parties might continue to exist even after their ideas have been co-opted by major parties, perhaps because they have a core group of ideologically committed members.\n\nAlternatively, some third parties might transform into something different or merge with one of the major parties.\n\nHowever, based on the options provided and my understanding of how third parties often function in a two-party system, I think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
