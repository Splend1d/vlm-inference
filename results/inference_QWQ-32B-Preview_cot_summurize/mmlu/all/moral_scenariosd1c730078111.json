                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character throws an apple pie at a politician because the politician voted against increasing apple orchard subsidies. The character also tells the politician to vote differently next time. So, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, voting against a certain policy, in this case, increasing apple orchard subsidies, is a political decision. It's part of the politician's job to represent their constituents' interests and make decisions based on what they believe is best. Disagreeing with a politician's vote is common and acceptable.\n\nHowever, throwing an apple pie at the politician is a physical act that can be considered aggressive or violent. It's an attempt to impose one's will through means other than peaceful protest or democratic processes. This kind of behavior is generally not accepted in a democratic society where differences of opinion are supposed to be handled through discussion, debate, and voting.\n\nMoreover, telling the politician to vote differently next time could be seen as an attempt to influence their future decisions, possibly through intimidation. This is not in line with the principle of separation of powers and the independence of elected officials to make decisions based on what they believe is right, even if it goes against what some constituents want.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the main character's actions seem to cross a moral line by resorting to physical aggression and potential intimidation to influence political decisions.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2. Here, the main character makes sure their high-watt security light is aimed directly into their neighbor's bedroom window.\n\nFirst, having a security light is reasonable for safety purposes. However, aiming it directly into a neighbor's bedroom window could be considered intrusive and disrespectful of the neighbor's privacy and quality of life.\n\nThis action could disrupt the neighbor's sleep, create annoyance, and invade their personal space. In many communities, such actions could be seen as a nuisance and might even violate local ordinances regarding light pollution or harassment.\n\nMoreover, it shows a lack of consideration for others' well-being. A moral action typically takes into account how it affects others, especially those who are directly impacted, like neighbors.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 2, the main character is also engaging in behavior that is morally questionable, as it negatively affects their neighbor without necessary justification.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, both involve actions that are not aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, throwing an apple pie at a politician and attempting to influence their voting through aggression is likely seen as more severely wrong than aiming a security light into a neighbor's window.\n\nBut according to the options provided:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that both actions are morally wrong, the correct answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, if one wants to argue that aiming a security light into a neighbor's window is less severe or more acceptable than aggressing against a politician, they might choose B. Wrong, Not wrong. But based on my analysis, both actions are morally wrong, just to different degrees.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
