                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's talking about the temperature of the Sun and how it emits a blackbody spectrum peaking around 500 nm. Then it asks about a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K and wants to know at what wavelength its thermal spectrum would reach a maximum. The options are all in different units: PM, Pm, mm, and mm again. I think there might be a typo in the options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Wien's displacement law because it relates the temperature of a blackbody to the wavelength at which its emission spectrum peaks. Wien's displacement law states that the product of the temperature (in Kelvin) and the wavelength at which the emission peaks is a constant. The constant is known as Wien's displacement constant, which is approximately 2.898 x 10^-3 meters times Kelvin.\n\nSo, the formula is:\n\n\u03bb_max = b / T\n\nwhere:\n\n- \u03bb_max is the wavelength of the peak emission\n\n- b is Wien's displacement constant (2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K)\n\n- T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin\n\nGiven that, for the Sun, which has a temperature of about 6,000 K, the peak emission is around 500 nm. Let me check if that matches with Wien's law.\n\nFirst, convert 500 nm to meters:\n\n500 nm = 500 x 10^-9 m = 5 x 10^-7 m\n\nNow, plug into Wien's law:\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K / 6000 K = 4.83 x 10^-7 m = 483 nm\n\nThat's close to 500 nm, so Wien's law holds approximately.\n\nNow, for a body with a surface temperature of 300 K, let's find \u03bb_max.\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K / 300 K = 9.66 x 10^-6 m = 9.66 \u03bcm\n\nBut looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 10:00 PM - this seems unrelated; maybe a typo?\n\nB. 100 Pm - Pm could stand for picometers (10^-12 m), but that's way too small.\n\nC. 10 mm - 10 x 10^-3 m = 10^-2 m\n\nD. 100 mm - 100 x 10^-3 m = 10^-1 m\n\nNeither of these matches the 9.66 \u03bcm I calculated. Maybe there's a mistake in the options or in my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the options are in picometers (pm), but 100 pm is 100 x 10^-12 m = 10^-10 m, which is much smaller than the expected 10^-6 m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Pm\" stands for petameters, which is 10^15 m, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"PM\" stands for something else, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are miswritten, and it's supposed to be:\n\nA. 10 pm\n\nB. 100 pm\n\nC. 10 \u03bcm\n\nD. 100 \u03bcm\n\nThat would make more sense. Given that, 10 \u03bcm would be closest to the 9.66 \u03bcm I calculated.\n\nBut since the options are listed as A. 10:00 PM, B. 100 Pm, C. 10 mm, D. 100 mm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about time, but that doesn't make sense with the context of blackbody radiation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"PM\" stands for a unit I'm not familiar with, but I can't think of any physical unit abbreviated as \"PM\" that would make sense here.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C. 10 mm, but that's 10 x 10^-3 m = 10^-2 m, which is still larger than the expected 10^-6 m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misprint, and it's supposed to be \"10 \u03bcm\" instead of \"10 mm\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about something else entirely, but based on the context, it seems to be about Wien's displacement law.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that at 300 K, the peak emission is in the infrared region, which is on the order of micrometers, not millimeters.\n\nGiven that, options C and D (10 mm and 100 mm) are in the millimeter range, which is much larger than the expected wavelength.\n\nTherefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, and the correct answer should be around 10 \u03bcm, but since it's not listed, maybe the closest option is C. 10 mm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to show that at lower temperatures, the peak wavelength is much larger, in the infrared or even microwave region.\n\nGiven that, option D. 100 mm is 10 cm, which is in the microwave region, but that seems too large even for 300 K.\n\nWait, let's double-check the calculation.\n\n\u03bb_max = 2.898 x 10^-3 m\u00b7K / 300 K = 9.66 x 10^-6 m = 9.66 \u03bcm\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic effects or something, but that's unlikely for this level of problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the peak in terms of frequency rather than wavelength, but that would still follow a similar relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the Rayleigh-Jeans law or something else, but given the context, Wien's displacement law seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the units.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the options are in picometers (pm), but 100 pm is 100 x 10^-12 m, which is way too small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Pm\" stands for picometers, but that's not standard; pm is the standard abbreviation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Pm\" is a typo and it's meant to be \"pm\".\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, or there's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to test the understanding that at lower temperatures, the peak wavelength is longer, and among the given options, 10 mm is longer than 500 nm, so perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the time of day, which doesn't make sense.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best approach is to choose option C. 10 mm as the closest approximation, recognizing that there is likely a typo in the options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{10 \\text{ mm}} \\]"
