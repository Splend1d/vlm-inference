                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about Butler's views, specifically what he considers impossible. So, I need to recall Butler's ethical thoughts to answer this correctly.\n\nFirst, who is Butler? He was an 18th-century Scottish philosopher and theologian known for his work in moral philosophy. His most famous work is \"Fifteen Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel,\" where he discusses conscience and the nature of human motivation.\n\nOkay, so looking at the options:\n\nA. Approve of the actions of others without imitating them.\n\nIs this something Butler thought was impossible? I think about how Butler views conscience and morality. He believed that conscience is the voice of God within us, guiding us toward moral behavior. But does that mean we must always imitate the actions we approve of in others? Maybe not necessarily. People can approve of certain actions without feeling compelled to imitate them. So, perhaps this isn't what Butler considered impossible.\n\nB. Do something of which one does not oneself approve.\n\nThis seems more aligned with Butler's views. Butler emphasized the importance of conscience in determining moral actions. He believed that conscience is the ultimate authority in moral decision-making. So, according to him, it would be impossible to do something that one doesn't approve of oneself because conscience guides us toward what is right. If someone does something they don't approve of, it might be seen as acting against their conscience, which Butler might argue is not possible because conscience is the governing principle of our actions.\n\nWait, but isn't it possible for people to do things they know are wrong? Maybe Butler would say that in such cases, people are rationalizing their actions or confusing their desires with moral judgment.\n\nC. Be motivated by genuine benevolence.\n\nButler\u80af\u5b9a\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ec1\u6148\u6240\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u54f2\u5b66\u4e2d\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4ec1\u6148\u548c\u540c\u60c5\u5fc3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u4ed6\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6211\u5173\u7231\u548c\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eba\u798f\u5229\u7684\u5173\u5fc3\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4ed6\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\n\nD.
