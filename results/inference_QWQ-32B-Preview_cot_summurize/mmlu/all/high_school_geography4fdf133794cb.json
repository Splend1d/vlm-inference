According to this model, urban areas grow outward in a series of concentric circles or zones from the central business district (CBD).\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of the zones in Burgess's model:\n\n1. **Zone I: Central Business District (CBD)** - This is the heart of the city, characterized by high land values, dense building structures, and a mix of retail, office, and some residential uses.\n\n2. **Zone II: Transition Zone** - Adjacent to the CBD, this zone is often characterized by deteriorating housing, mixed land uses, and a high level of human activity. It's where industrial and residential areas overlap.\n\n3. **Zone III: Working-Class Homes** - This zone consists of residential areas where working-class families live. The housing here is more affordable and may include multi-family dwellings.\n\n4. **Zone IV: Better Residential Area** - Here, you find more spacious and higher-quality housing, including single-family homes and higher-rent apartments. This zone is preferred by middle- and upper-class residents who can afford better living conditions.\n\n5. **Zone V: Commuter's Zone** - This is the outermost zone, consisting of suburban and exurban areas where residents commute to the city for work. It includes newer developments, single-family homes, and lower-density housing.\n\nGiven this information, the zone where one would find better houses, single-family homes, and higher-rent apartments is **Zone IV: Better Residential Area**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **D. Fourth**.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nBurgess, E. W. (1925). The growth of the city: An introduction to a research project. *The American Journal of Sociology*, 30(6), 843-857."
