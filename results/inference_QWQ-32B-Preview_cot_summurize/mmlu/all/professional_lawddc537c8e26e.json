                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation where a man wants to sell his bungalow for $10,000, and his neighbor agrees to buy it to expand his yard and use it as a storage space. They have a written agreement, and the sale is supposed to be complete on October 14. But then, on October 10, the neighbor realizes he can't pay $10,000 and offers to pay $8,000 instead. The man agrees, and the exchange happens on October 14. After that, the man sues for the remaining $2,000. The question is, would he likely prevail in getting that additional $2,000 that was part of the original signed contract?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, the modification of the sales price was accepted, and therefore both parties are bound to the $8,000 price.\n\nB. Yes, there was a lack of additional consideration under the pre-existing duty rule, so that the modification was invalid, and the original price was still valid.\n\nC. No, the original contract was a unilateral contract that could not be modified and had to be performed at the original price.\n\nD. No, there was full performance of the contract.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand what a unilateral contract is. A unilateral contract is one where only one party makes a promise. For example, if I say, \"I'll pay you $100 if you mow my lawn,\" and you go ahead and mow the lawn, that's a unilateral contract because only I made a promise to pay upon completion of the act.\n\nIn this case, the man agrees to sell the bungalow, and the neighbor agrees to buy it for $10,000. That seems more like a bilateral contract, where both parties are making promises to each other\u2014the man promises to sell, and the neighbor promises to buy for that price.\n\nBut then, four days before the sale, the neighbor says he can only pay $8,000, and the man agrees. So, they've modified the original agreement from $10,000 to $8,000.\n\nNow, the man is suing for the additional $2,000. So, is he arguing that the modification wasn't valid, and he should get the full $10,000?\n\nOption A says no, the modification was accepted, so both are bound to $8,000. Option B says yes, because of the pre-existing duty rule, the modification is invalid, and the original price stands.\n\nOption C says no, it was a unilateral contract that couldn't be modified, so he had to perform at the original price. Option D says no, there was full performance of the contract.\n\nFirst, let's consider whether this is a unilateral or bilateral contract. As I thought earlier, it seems bilateral because both parties are promising something.\n\nOption C says it's unilateral and couldn't be modified, but that might not be accurate because it appears to be bilateral.\n\nOption D says there was full performance of the contract. Well, the exchange happened on October 14 for $8,000. So, if the contract was modified to $8,000, then yes, full performance would mean the man received $8,000 and gave the bungalow.\n\nBut the man is suing for $2,000 more, which suggests he's claiming that the modification wasn't valid, and he's entitled to the full $10,000.\n\nNow, the pre-existing duty rule comes into play here. In contract law, generally, a promise to do something you're already obligated to do isn't sufficient consideration for a new promise. So, if I already owe you $10,000, and you promise to accept $8,000 instead, that might not be enforceable unless there's additional consideration.\n\nBut in this case, it seems like both parties agreed to modify the contract. The man agreed to accept $8,000 instead of $10,000. So, was there consideration for this modification?\n\nWell, consideration is something of value exchanged between parties. Here, the neighbor is getting a reduction in price, and the man is accepting less money. So, perhaps the consideration is the neighbor's promise to buy at $8,000, and the man's promise to accept that amount.\n\nBut under the pre-existing duty rule, if someone already owes you something, promising to accept less doesn't constitute new consideration unless there's something extra.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, if there's a valid reason for the modification, like hardship, and both parties agree, courts might enforce the modification.\n\nGiven that, option B says yes, there was a lack of additional consideration, so the modification is invalid, and the original price is still valid.\n\nBut option A says no, the modification was accepted, so both are bound to $8,000.\n\nI think option A is more accurate here because both parties agreed to the modification. The man accepted the $8,000, which suggests he's agreeing to the new terms.\n\nOption C is likely incorrect because it's probably a bilateral contract.\n\nOption D says no, there was full performance of the contract. Well, if the contract was modified to $8,000, then receiving $8,000 would be full performance.\n\nBut the man is suing for more, so he's arguing that the original contract shouldn't have been modified, or that the modification isn't valid.\n\nHowever, since both parties agreed to the modification and the exchange occurred, it seems like the modification was valid.\n\nTherefore, the man is unlikely to prevail in getting the additional $2,000.\n\nSo, the answer is A: No, the modification of the sales price was accepted, and therefore both parties are bound to the $8,000 price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
