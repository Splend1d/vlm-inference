                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Adler's views on birth order, specifically regarding firstborn children. The options are sociable, funny, responsible, and followers. I need to recall what Adler said about firstborns in comparison to their younger siblings.\n\nAdler was a psychologist who developed the concept of birth order and its influence on personality. From what I remember, he believed that firstborn children tend to have certain characteristics because of their position in the family. Let me think about this.\n\nFirstborns receive all the attention from their parents initially, but when a second child comes along, they might feel dethroned or replaced. Adler suggested that this can lead to certain behaviors or traits in firstborns.\n\nI think Adler said that firstborns are more likely to be responsible and conscientious. They often take on a helper role with their younger siblings and are expected to set an example. So, maybe option C, responsible, is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me consider the other options. Sociable (option A) might not necessarily be a trait uniquely associated with firstborns according to Adler. In fact, maybe later-borns are more sociable because they have to interact more with their siblings. So, perhaps sociable isn't the best choice.\n\nFunny (option B) doesn't seem to be related to Adler's theories on birth order. He didn't mention humor as a trait influenced by birth order, as far as I can recall.\n\nFollowers (option D) seems contradictory to what Adler said about firstborns. If firstborns are responsible and conscientious, they might be more likely to be leaders rather than followers.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is phrased differently than I thought. It says \"more likely than subsequent children in a family to be...\" So, it's comparing firstborns to their younger siblings.\n\nIf Adler said that firstborns are more responsible, then compared to their younger siblings, they would indeed be more responsible. Younger siblings might be more free-spirited or less burdened by responsibilities since they don't have the same expectations placed on them as firstborns.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe Adler said something different. I should recall his actual statements on birth order.\n\nAdler believed that birth order affects personality development within the family context. Firstborn children have a unique experience of having their parents' full attention until the arrival of a second child. After the second child is born, firstborns may feel replaced or experience a sense of loss.\n\nTo cope with this, firstborns might become overachievers, striving for excellence to regain their parents' attention and approval. They might also become protective of their younger siblings, taking on caretaking roles.\n\nGiven this, it seems that firstborns are more likely to be responsible and conscientious, as they are expected to set an example and help with household duties.\n\nIn contrast, younger siblings might be more rebellious or try to find their own niche within the family, which could lead to different traits.\n\nSo, considering this, option C, responsible, seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider each option again.\n\nOption A, sociable: While firstborns might be sociable, there's no specific correlation in Adler's theory that suggests they are more sociable than their younger siblings. In fact, younger siblings might have more social practice with their brothers and sisters.\n\nOption B, funny: Humor isn't a trait that Adler associated with birth order.\n\nOption D, followers: As mentioned earlier, firstborns are more likely to be leaders due to their responsibility and conscientiousness, so being followers seems unlikely.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is C, responsible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
