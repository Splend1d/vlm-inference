                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a rancher who owned a 200-acre tract in a rural area. In 1997, he conveyed this tract to his uncle for one dollar, and specified that it goes to his uncle, his heirs, and assigns, but if the uncle's wife dies without issue, it goes to his personal assistant and her heirs and assigns.\n\nSo, the deed seems to create a conditional fee simple. The uncle gets the property, but there's a condition: if his wife dies without issue, the property goes to the personal assistant.\n\nNow, the uncle discovers oil on the property and starts drilling and selling it. The personal assistant later finds out about this and sues for an accounting of the oil removed and for an injunction to stop further removal.\n\nWe need to determine under what basis the decision would be in favor of the uncle. The options are:\n\nA. the right to remove oil is an incident of a defeasible fee simple.\n\nB. the personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract.\n\nC. there was no showing that the uncle acted in bad faith.\n\nD. the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A mentions a defeasible fee simple. A defeasible fee simple is an estate that can be lost upon the occurrence of a specified event. In this case, the condition is if the uncle's wife dies without issue, the property goes to the personal assistant. So, the uncle holds a defeasible fee simple.\n\nThe right to remove oil is generally considered a part of the mineral rights attached to the land. If the uncle has the defeasible fee simple, he has the right to exploit the minerals unless there's a restriction.\n\nOption B says the personal assistant has no interest in the 200-acre tract. Well, according to the deed, the personal assistant has a future interest called a possibility of reverter if the condition occurs (i.e., if the uncle's wife dies without issue). Until that condition occurs, the personal assistant has no present interest in the property.\n\nOption C mentions that there was no showing of bad faith by the uncle. While the uncle might have been acting within his rights, the personal assistant might argue that he had a fiduciary duty or some other obligation to account for the oil removal. However, unless there's a specific relationship that imposes such a duty, bad faith might not be relevant.\n\nOption D states that the right to remove oil is an incident of the right to possession. The uncle, as the holder of the defeasible fee simple, has the right to possess the land and exploit its resources, including oil, unless there's a restriction.\n\nGiven that, if the decision is in favor of the uncle, it would likely be based on the fact that the right to remove oil is an incident of his defeasible fee simple estate. He has the right to possess the land and exploit its minerals, and there's no indication in the deed that he doesn't have this right.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, let's double-check.\n\nIf the personal assistant has only a future interest, she doesn't have any present right to the property or its proceeds. Therefore, she might not have standing to sue for an accounting of the oil removed.\n\nBut, since she's suing in equity, perhaps she's arguing that the uncle has a fiduciary duty to her or that she has some equitable interest.\n\nNevertheless, based on the information given, the uncle holds the present estate with the right to possess and exploit the property, including removing oil, subject to the condition.\n\nTherefore, the decision in favor of the uncle would indeed be based on the fact that the right to remove oil is an incident of his defeasible fee simple estate.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
