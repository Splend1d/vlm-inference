For example, 2 ** 3 would calculate 2 raised to the power of 3, which equals 8.\n\nLet's briefly look at what the other options do:\n\nB. // : This is the floor division operator. It divides the first number by the second number and rounds down to the nearest whole number. For example, 5 // 2 would equal 2.\n\nC. is : This is an identity operator. It checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory. For example, a is b would be True if a and b are pointing to the same object.\n\nD. not in : This is a membership operator. It checks if a value does not exist in a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string). For example, 3 not in [1, 2, 3] would be False because 3 is in the list.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. **"
