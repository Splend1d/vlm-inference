                    "text": "After releasing an egg, the follicle, under stimulation of luteinizing hormone, turns into a glandular mass of cells called the corpus luteum.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. corpus luteum.\n\nLet me explain this in a bit more detail. In the female reproductive system, during the menstrual cycle, a follicle in the ovary matures and releases an egg during ovulation. After ovulation, the follicle that released the egg undergoes a transformation. With the stimulation of luteinizing hormone (LH), this follicle turns into a structure called the corpus luteum.\n\nThe corpus luteum is important because it secretes hormones, primarily progesterone and some estrogen, which help prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum continues to produce hormones to support the early stages of pregnancy. If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a drop in hormone levels and the start of the menstrual period.\n\nNow, to clarify why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Corpus cavernosum: This term is related to the male reproductive system. The corpus cavernosum is a part of the penis that fills with blood during an erection.\n\nC. Corpus callosum: This is a structure in the brain that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, allowing for communication between them. It's not related to the reproductive system.\n\nD. Corpus glandula: This term isn't standard in reproductive biology. It might be a misnomer or a confusion with other terms.\n\nSo, remember, after ovulation, the follicle becomes the corpus luteum, which plays a crucial role in hormone production related to reproduction.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
