So, we're looking for the best definition among these options:\n\nA. the central city and its developed areas.\n\nB. the central city and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nC. the central city and its hinterlands.\n\nD. the central city and the adjacent counties.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the most accurate definition of an urban area.\n\nStarting with option A: \"the central city and its developed areas.\" This seems broad, but I'm not sure what exactly \"developed areas\" encompass. Does it include suburbs? Hinterlands? Adjacent counties? I need to clarify this.\n\nOption B: \"the central city and its surrounding suburbs.\" This seems straightforward. It includes the central city and the suburbs around it. Suburbs are typically urban or suburban developments outside the city center but still part of the urban sphere.\n\nOption C: \"the central city and its hinterlands.\" Hinterlands usually refer to the rural areas that surround a city and supply it with resources like food and raw materials. So, this option includes both urban and rural areas.\n\nOption D: \"the central city and the adjacent counties.\" Counties are administrative divisions that can include both urban and rural areas, so this might be too broad.\n\nNow, thinking about what an urban area is, it's generally characterized by higher population density, infrastructure, and services compared to rural areas. So, it should include areas that are developed and have these characteristics.\n\nOption A mentions \"developed areas,\" which could include suburbs, but it's a bit vague. Option B specifically mentions suburbs, which are typically urban or suburban developments. This seems more precise.\n\nOption C includes hinterlands, which are rural areas, so that might not fit the definition of an urban area. Similarly, option D includes adjacent counties, which could be a mix of urban and rural areas.\n\nTherefore, option B seems the most appropriate, as it includes the central city and its surrounding suburbs, both of which are urban or suburban developments.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a more comprehensive definition.\n\nLooking up the definition of an urban area, according to the United States Census Bureau, an urban area is \"densely developed territory containing at least 2,500 people.\" It includes the central city and adjacent suburbs that meet certain population density requirements.\n\nSo, this aligns with option B: the central city and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nOption A is a bit vague, and \"developed areas\" could be interpreted in different ways. Option C includes hinterlands, which are rural, so that doesn't fit. Option D includes adjacent counties, which might not all be urban.\n\nTherefore, the best definition is option B: the central city and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
