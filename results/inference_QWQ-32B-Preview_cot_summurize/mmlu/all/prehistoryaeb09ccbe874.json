                    "text": "I'm trying to understand how Aurignacian technology differed from Mousterian technology. There are four options here:\n\nA. Mousterian technology produced more projectile points.\n\nB. Mousterian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nC. Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nD. Aurignacian technology was focused on the production of hand axes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Aurignacian and Mousterian technologies are. I know that these are archaeological cultures associated with different periods in prehistory.\n\nMousterian technology is associated with Neanderthals, right? It's named after the site of Le Moustier in France. They primarily used the Levallois technique for making stone tools.\n\nAurignacian technology, on the other hand, is associated with early modern humans, dating to the Upper Paleolithic period. It's known for more sophisticated tool-making techniques and a wider variety of tools.\n\nSo, looking at option A: Mousterian technology produced more projectile points. I think this might not be accurate because Aurignacian cultures are often credited with the development of more advanced projectile technology, like spear-throwers and perhaps even early forms of bows and arrows.\n\nOption B says Mousterian technology produced more usable blade surface. I'm not sure about that. Mousterian tools include a variety of flakes and blades, but I think Aurignacian technology might have been more efficient in utilizing blade production.\n\nOption C is that Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface. That sounds plausible because Aurignacian tool-making techniques were more refined, allowing for better utilization of raw materials.\n\nOption D suggests that Aurignacian technology was focused on the production of hand axes. But I thought hand axes were more characteristic of earlier Acheulean technology, which predates both Mousterian and Aurignacian cultures.\n\nWait, maybe Neanderthals also made hand axes in some periods. I need to double-check that.\n\nActually, Mousterian tools are more associated with flakes and points, while hand axes are more typical of the Acheulean industry.\n\nSo, perhaps option D is incorrect because Aurignacian technology wasn't focused on hand axes.\n\nLet me consider this again. What was distinctive about Aurignacian technology compared to Mousterian?\n\nAurignacian tool kits include a variety of tools like burins, end-scrapers, and points, often made using blade cores. They also have personal ornaments and other cultural artifacts.\n\nMousterian tools are more characterized by prepared-core techniques, like the Levallois method, which produces flakes of a predetermined shape.\n\nIn terms of blade production, I believe Aurignacian cultures had more efficient methods for producing long, thin blades, which could be more efficiently retouched into various tool types.\n\nSo, comparing blade production, it seems that Aurignacian technology might have produced more usable blade surface per unit of raw material.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most accurate: Aurignacian technology produced more usable blade surface.\n\nOption A is likely incorrect because Aurignacian cultures are more associated with projectile technology.\n\nOption B is probably incorrect because Mousterian technology, while advanced, wasn't as efficient in blade production as Aurignacian.\n\nOption D is incorrect because hand axes weren't a focus of Aurignacian technology.\n\nSo, my answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
