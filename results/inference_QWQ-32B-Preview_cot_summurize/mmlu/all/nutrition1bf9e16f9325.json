These proteins play a critical role in the blood clotting process, which helps prevent excessive bleeding when a blood vessel is injured.\n\nHere's a bit more detail:\n\n- **Vitamin K** is a fat-soluble vitamin that is vital for the proper functioning of the blood clotting system.\n\n- It is involved in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on certain proteins, which allows them to bind calcium and function in blood coagulation.\n\n- The main clotting factors that require vitamin K for their synthesis are factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S, which regulate clotting.\n\n- Deficiency in vitamin K can lead to impaired blood clotting and an increased risk of bleeding.\n\n- Vitamin K is found in green leafy vegetables, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and is also produced by bacteria in the gut.\n\nThe other vitamins listed have different functions:\n\n- **Vitamin A** is important for vision, immune function, and cell growth.\n\n- **Vitamin D** is crucial for calcium absorption and bone health.\n\n- **Vitamin E** is an antioxidant that protects cells from damage.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Vitamin K."
