                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question. So, the question is asking about an elephant-headed Hindu deity who is often described as the most beloved. The options are Parvati, Ganesha, Vishnu, and Sita.\n\nFirst, I need to recall which of these deities have an elephant head. I remember that Ganesha is the one with an elephant head. Parvati is a goddess, Vishnu is a major deity often depicted with human form, and Sita is a central character in the Ramayana, also human.\n\nSo, Ganesha is the elephant-headed deity among the options. Now, the question is whether he is considered the most beloved.\n\nI know that Ganesha is very popular in Hindu culture. He is the remover of obstacles and is worshipped at the beginning of ceremonies and events. He is also known as the patron of arts and sciences and the god of intellect and wisdom.\n\nGiven his popularity and the various roles he plays in Hindu mythology and practice, it makes sense that he is often described as the most beloved.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nParvati is a important goddess, the consort of Shiva and the mother of Ganesha and Kartikeya. She is revered but I don't recall her being described as the most beloved in general.\n\nVishnu is one of the principal deities in Hinduism, preserver of the universe, and has many avatars like Rama and Krishna. While he is greatly revered, I don't think he is specifically described as the most beloved in the same way Ganesha is.\n\nSita is a central figure in the Ramayana, known for her righteousness and devotion to Rama. She is highly respected but again, not typically described as the most beloved in a general sense.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is B. Ganesha.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
