Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.\u2026 He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.\u2026 This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.\u2026 He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; \u2026 wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!\n\u2014William Hickling Prescott, History of the Conquest of Mexico, 1843\nAs Prescott makes clear in the passage above, an important reason for Cortes's military success was which of the following?\n\nA. The advantage of superior numbers\nB. The superior military skill of mercenaries\nC. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\nD. Effective use of European artillery\n"

                    "text": "So I've been reading this passage about Hernando Cortes and his conquest of Mexico. It's from a book written by William Hickling Prescott in 1843. Prescott seems really impressed by Cortes; he calls him a \"great general\" and talks about how Cortes achieved this huge enterprise with what seemed like inadequate resources.\n\nFirst, Prescott says that Cortes had this adventurous spirit, like a knight-errant, which drove him to conquer Mexico right from when he first landed there. Even when he saw how strong the civilization was, he didn't back down. That shows a lot of determination and perhaps overconfidence, but in this case, it paid off.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Prescott argues that Cortes was more than just a lucky adventurer. He says that Cortes was a great general because he could achieve great things with the resources he created himself. That means Cortes was skilled at improvising and making the most out of what he had.\n\nThe passage mentions that Cortes assembled a very diverse group of people: mercenaries from Cuba and the islands who wanted gold, hidalgos from Spain who came to win glory, and various native tribes who were traditional enemies. These groups had nothing in common\u2014different races, languages, and interests. Yet, Cortes managed to bring them all together, make them follow his lead, and work in harmony towards a common goal.\n\nSo, the question is: According to Prescott, what was an important reason for Cortes's military success?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The advantage of superior numbers\n\nB. The superior military skill of mercenaries\n\nC. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians\n\nD. Effective use of European artillery\n\nLet's look at each option.\n\nOption A: Superior numbers. The passage doesn't really mention that Cortes had more people than his opponents. In fact, it says that he achieved great things with apparently inadequate resources, which might suggest that he didn't have superior numbers.\n\nOption B: Superior military skill of mercenaries. While mercenaries were part of his force, the passage emphasizes that he had a motley collection of people, not just mercenaries. It doesn't specifically highlight the mercenaries' military skill as the key to his success.\n\nOption C: Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians. This seems plausible because he managed to get some native tribes to ally with him against others. The passage mentions that he brought together wild tribes of natives who had been enemies and made them work together. So, he must have exploited the existing divisions among them.\n\nOption D: Effective use of European artillery. The passage doesn't mention anything about artillery or specific weapons. It focuses more on his ability to manage diverse groups of people.\n\nConsidering the information provided, option C seems to be the most accurate. Prescott emphasizes that Cortes brought together various native tribes who were traditional enemies and made them allies in his conquest. This suggests that he took advantage of divisions among the Indians to build his coalition and achieve his goals.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Taking advantage of divisions among the Indians.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
