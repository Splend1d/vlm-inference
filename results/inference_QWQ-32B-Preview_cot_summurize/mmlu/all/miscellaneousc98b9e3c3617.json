So, I think the answer is C. white. But to be sure, maybe I should look it up.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember seeing images of Uncle Sam, and he usually has white hair and a white goatee. He's often wearing a suit with stars and stripes, representing the American flag. So, that makes sense.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should check some sources. I could look for official descriptions or images of Uncle Sam to confirm the color of his goatee.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the origin of Uncle Sam. I believe the character originated in the early 19th century, and the image we know today was popularized by artist James Montgomery Flagg in his World War I recruitment posters. In those posters, Uncle Sam has white hair and a white goatee.\n\nAlso, in other representations, like in political cartoons or other historical documents, Uncle Sam is consistently depicted with white hair and a white goatee. So, it seems safe to say that his goatee is white.\n\nBut, to cover all bases, let's consider the other options:\n\nA. Brown - That doesn't seem right, as I don't recall seeing Uncle Sam with brown hair.\n\nB. Black - Again, my memory is that his hair is white, not black.\n\nD. Dishwater blond - That sounds more like a very pale blond color, which doesn't match the typical depiction of Uncle Sam.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
