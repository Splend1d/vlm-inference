                    "text": "So I've got this method here, `nextIntInRange`, and it's supposed to return a random integer between `low` and `high`, inclusive. So, if I call `nextIntInRange(1, 5)`, I should get back any integer from 1 to 5, and each number should have an equal chance of being selected.\n\nNow, looking at the options, they all involve `Math.random()`, which returns a double greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. So, to get a range of integers, I need to scale and shift this value appropriately.\n\nLet's consider option A: `(int)(Math.random() * high) + low;`\n\nIf `low` is 1 and `high` is 5, this would be `(int)(Math.random() * 5) + 1`. `Math.random() * 5` gives a number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 5.0 (exclusive), and casting to int truncates the decimal, so `(int)(Math.random() * 5)` gives 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Adding `low` (which is 1) shifts this to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. That seems okay, but let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B: `(int)(Math.random() * (high - low)) + low;`\n\nWith `low` = 1 and `high` = 5, that's `(int)(Math.random() * 4) + 1`, which gives 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, that doesn't include 5. So that doesn't satisfy the \"inclusive\" part of the range.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * (high - low + 1)) + low;`\n\nHere, with `low` = 1 and `high` = 5, it's `(int)(Math.random() * 5) + 1`, which again gives 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. That looks good.\n\nOption D: `(int)(Math.random() * (high + low)) + low;`\n\nWith `low` = 1 and `high` = 5, that's `(int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1`, which gives 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But 6 is outside the range we want, so that's not correct.\n\nSo, between options A and C, both seem to work for the example I picked. But I should check if they always work, for any `low` and `high`.\n\nLet's try `low` = 0 and `high` = 0. According to the method, it should return 0.\n\nOption A: `(int)(Math.random() * 0) + 0` which is always 0. Good.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * 1) + 0`, which can be 0 or 0, since `Math.random() * 1` is between 0.0 and 1.0, and casting to int makes it 0. So, always 0. Good.\n\nNow, `low` = -1 and `high` = 1.\n\nOption A: `(int)(Math.random() * 1) + (-1)`, which is -1 or 0. Missing 1.\n\nWait, `high` is 1, so `Math.random() * 1` is between 0.0 and 1.0, cast to int is 0, plus `-1` is -1. So, only -1 and 0, missing 1.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * (1 - (-1) + 1)) + (-1)` = `(int)(Math.random() * 3) + (-1)`, which gives -1, 0, or 1. Perfect.\n\nOption B: `(int)(Math.random() * (1 - (-1))) + (-1)` = `(int)(Math.random() * 2) + (-1)`, which gives -1 or 0, missing 1.\n\nOption D: `(int)(Math.random() * (1 + (-1))) + (-1)` = `(int)(Math.random() * 0) + (-1)` = -1. But the range is from -1 to 1, so it's missing 0 and 1.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the only one that consistently includes both `low` and `high` in the possible outputs.\n\nLet me try another example: `low` = 10, `high` = 10. Should always return 10.\n\nOption A: `(int)(Math.random() * 10) + 10`, which can be 10 to 19. Not good.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * 1) + 10`, which is always 10. Perfect.\n\nOption B: `(int)(Math.random() * 0) + 10`, which is always 10. But in general, it fails for other ranges.\n\nOption D: `(int)(Math.random() * 20) + 10`, which can be 10 to 29. Not good.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the most consistent. Let me see if there's any case where it fails.\n\nSuppose `low` = 5, `high` = 10.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * 6) + 5`, which gives 5 to 10. Perfect.\n\nAnother one: `low` = -3, `high` = 2.\n\nOption C: `(int)(Math.random() * 6) + (-3)`, which gives -3 to 2. Correct.\n\nSeems like option C is the way to go. The key is to multiply `Math.random()` by `(high - low + 1)` to include both endpoints in the range.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
