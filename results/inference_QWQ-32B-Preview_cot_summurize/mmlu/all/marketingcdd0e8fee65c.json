From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are:\n\n1. **Physiological needs**: These are biological requirements for human survival, such as air, food, water, shelter, clothing, etc.\n\n2. **Safety needs**: Once physiological needs are met, the need for safety and security becomes prominent. This includes personal security, financial security, health and well-being, and safety against accidents, injury, and illness.\n\n3. **Love and belonging (social needs)**: After ensuring safety, humans need to feel a sense of belonging and love. This includes friendship, family, and sexual intimacy.\n\n4. **Esteem needs**: These include internal esteem factors such as self-respect, autonomy, and achievement, and external esteem factors such as status, recognition, and attention.\n\n5. **Self-actualization**: This is the highest level of Maslow's hierarchy, referring to the realization of a person's full potential. It involves the desire to become everything one is capable of becoming.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Self-actualization."
