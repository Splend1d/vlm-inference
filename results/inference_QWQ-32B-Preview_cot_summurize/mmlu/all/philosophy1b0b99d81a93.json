                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Gauthier and the foundational crisis in morality. The options are enlightened egoism, pure altruism, justified constraint, and prima facie duties. I need to figure out which one Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Gauthier's perspective is on morality. I remember that David Gauthier is a philosopher who has written about morality and rationality, particularly in his book \"Morals by Agreement.\" In this work, he argues for a contractarian approach to morality, where moral rules are seen as rational constraints on pursuit of one's goals.\n\nSo, Gauthier is known for proposing that morality arises from rational agreement among individuals who recognize that cooperating and restraining their own self-interest in certain ways can be beneficial for all. This is sometimes called \"morals by agreement\" or contractarianism.\n\nNow, the question mentions a \"foundational crisis\" in morality as described by Gauthier. I need to think about what he might consider a crisis in the foundations of morality.\n\nEnlightened egoism is an ethical theory that suggests that acting in one's long-term self-interest aligns with moral behavior. Pure altruism, on the other hand, is the doctrine that holds that individuals have an obligation to help others and that their actions should be motivated by concern for others' well-being.\n\nJustified constraint refers to the idea that moral rules are justifiable constraints on individual freedom, imposed for the mutual benefit of all parties involved. Prima facie duties are moral responsibilities that appear obligatory at first glance but may be overridden by more pressing duties in certain situations.\n\nGiven Gauthier's contractarian approach, he is likely to view morality as involving some form of justified constraint\u2014rules that individuals agree to follow for mutual benefit. So, option C seems relevant.\n\nBut the question is about a foundational crisis in morality. Maybe Gauthier sees a crisis in how traditional moral theories try to ground morality in either egoism or altruism, and he proposes an alternative based on justified constraints.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Enlightened egoism: This seems more aligned with self-interest, but Gauthier argues that pure self-interest doesn't lead to morality; instead, morality requires constraints on self-interest.\n\nB. Pure altruism: This is the opposite of egoism, emphasizing selfless concern for others. Gauthier might see this as unrealistic or not aligned with rational self-interest.\n\nC. Justified constraint: This seems central to Gauthier's view. He argues that moral rules are justified constraints that rational agents agree to for mutual benefit.\n\nD. Prima facie duties: This is a concept from W.D. Ross, suggesting duties that appear obligatory but can be overridden. Gauthier might not focus on this in his discussion of foundational crises.\n\nConsidering this, it seems that Gauthier might see a crisis in relying solely on enlightened egoism or pure altruism as foundations for morality. Instead, he proposes that morality is based on justified constraints that rational agents agree to.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A. enlightened egoism, if the crisis is about relying on egoism alone to ground morality.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's B. pure altruism, if the crisis is about the unsustainability of pure selflessness without any regard for one's own interests.\n\nBut given that Gauthier is critiquing both extreme egoism and extreme altruism, perhaps the crisis is in trying to found morality on either of these alone.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says \"the morality that Gauthier describes as facing a foundational crisis essentially involves...\" So, it's about the morality that is facing the crisis, not necessarily the solution.\n\nMaybe Gauthier is critiquing traditional morality that tries to balance egoistic and altruistic considerations, and thus faces a foundational crisis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the crisis is in the idea of justified constraint itself, if that's what morality is built upon.\n\nWait, perhaps the crisis is in justifying the constraints\u2014how can we justify imposing constraints on individual freedom in the name of morality?\n\nGiven that, maybe C. justified constraint is the answer.\n\nBut the phrasing is a bit confusing. Let me see if I can find more specific information.\n\nI recall that Gauthier discusses the \"morality of rationality,\" where rational agents seek to maximize their own interests but recognize that cooperating and accepting certain constraints can lead to better outcomes for everyone.\n\nHe argues against both psychological egoism and altruism, proposing instead that morality is based on rational constraints that are mutually advantageous.\n\nSo, perhaps the foundational crisis is in trying to ground morality in either egoism or altruism, which don't provide a stable foundation.\n\nTherefore, the morality that is facing the crisis is the one that tries to base itself on enlightened egoism or pure altruism.\n\nLooking back at the options, A. enlightened egoism seems to be the closest match.\n\nOption B. pure altruism could also be considered, but Gauthier might see altruism as less problematic or perhaps as an unrealistic standard.\n\nOption C. justified constraint is more aligned with his proposed solution, not the crisis.\n\nOption D. prima facie duties seem unrelated to his main argument.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A. enlightened egoism.\n\nGauthier might argue that morality cannot be solely based on enlightened egoism because it doesn't account for the need for constraints that go beyond what is in one's own interest.\n\nInstead, morality requires that rational agents agree to constraints that may sometimes require them to act against their own interests for the sake of mutual benefit.\n\nHence, the foundational crisis is in trying to base morality solely on enlightened egoism, which doesn't adequately explain the need for moral constraints.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. enlightened egoism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
