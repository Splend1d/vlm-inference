                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out whether the trial court is likely to grant the motion to dismiss. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a campaign worker for a City Council candidate who distributed a flier promising transportation to the polls on election day, along with free food, drink, and prizes for those who voted. Two police undercover agents went to this event and agreed to be taken to vote in return for $50 each. The campaign worker drove them to what was supposed to be their polling location, but it was a set-up, and the agents arrested him for conspiracy to violate election bribery laws.\n\nThe defense is filing a motion to dismiss based on legal impossibility, arguing that it was legally impossible to commit the crime because the agents weren't registered to vote in that district and they never intended to actually vote. So, the question is, should the court grant this motion to dismiss?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because legal impossibility is a defense to the crime of conspiracy.\n\nB. Yes, because he could not be guilty of conspiring with two law enforcement agents who never intended to commit the crime.\n\nC. No, because the basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit the act, along with an affirmative step in that direction.\n\nD. No, because when the worker drove the agents to the voting place, he committed the complete crime of bribery, and the conspiracy was an element contained within it.\n\nOkay, so to decide this, I need to understand the elements of conspiracy and the concept of legal impossibility.\n\nConspiracy generally requires an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, followed by an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. So, in this case, the agreement was to provide transportation and incentives for voting, and the overt act was driving the agents to the polling location.\n\nNow, legal impossibility is a defense in some jurisdictions, which argues that the act in question couldn't constitute a crime as a matter of law. For example, if someone tries to bribe a juror but the person isn't actually a juror, it might be considered legally impossible to commit bribery.\n\nIn option A, it says yes, legal impossibility is a defense to conspiracy. But I'm not sure if this is universally accepted. In some legal systems, impossibility is not a defense to conspiracy because the focus is on the agreement and the intent, not the feasibility of the crime.\n\nOption B suggests that conspiring with law enforcement agents who didn't intend to commit the crime makes the conspiracy impossible. But again, in conspiracy cases, the intent and agreement are key. The fact that the agents didn't intend to vote might not invalidate the conspiracy if the defendant believed they were going to vote.\n\nOption C states that the conspiracy charge is based on the agreement and an affirmative step, which in this case was driving them to the polling location. This seems solid because even if the ultimate act couldn't be completed (because the agents weren't registered), the agreement and the step taken could still constitute conspiracy.\n\nOption D says that the worker committed the complete crime of bribery by driving them to the voting place, and conspiracy is contained within it. This seems a bit confusing. Bribery typically requires an actual exchange of something of value for a vote or official action. If no vote occurred, was there actually bribery?\n\nConsidering all this, I think option C is the most likely correct answer. The basis of the conspiracy charge is the agreement to commit bribery (providing transportation and incentives for voting) and an affirmative act towards that goal (driving the agents to the polling location). The fact that the agents weren't registered or didn't intend to vote might be irrelevant because the defendant believed he was facilitating bribery.\n\nMoreover, legal impossibility is not generally a defense to conspiracy charges because the law punishes the agreement and the intent, not just the completion of the crime. So, even if the crime couldn't be completed, the conspiracy itself is still punishable.\n\nTherefore, the trial court is unlikely to grant the motion to dismiss.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
