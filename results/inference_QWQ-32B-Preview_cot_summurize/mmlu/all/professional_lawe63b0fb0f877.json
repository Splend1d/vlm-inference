                    "text": "Let's see. This is a bit complicated, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a retiree who owned a 100-acre farm in fee simple absolute. In 1998, he devised the property to his daughter and his friend as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, after the retiree's death in 1998, the daughter and the friend own the entire farm together as joint tenants. That means they both have equal undivided interests in the whole property, and whoever outlives the other gets the entire property.\n\nThe next year, in 1999, the daughter executed a deed conveying \"all of her right, title, and interest in the northeast quarter of the farm\" to her co-worker and his heirs. So, the daughter is giving away her interest in the northeast quarter to her co-worker.\n\nNow, here's where it gets tricky. The daughter and the friend are joint tenants on the entire farm, but the daughter is conveying her interest in just the northeast quarter to someone else. In joint tenancy, if one joint tenant tries to convey their interest in part of the property, it can affect the joint tenancy.\n\nI think that when the daughter conveys her interest in the northeast quarter, it severs the joint tenancy as to that quarter. So, for the northeast quarter, the daughter and the friend were joint tenants, but now the daughter has conveyed her interest to the co-worker. So, the friend still has his interest in the northeast quarter, and now the co-worker has the daughter's interest. They would then be tenants in common in the northeast quarter.\n\nFor the remaining three-quarters of the farm, since the daughter only conveyed the northeast quarter, the joint tenancy should remain intact for the rest of the property. So, the daughter and the friend are still joint tenants on the remaining three-quarters.\n\nThen, in 2008, the daughter defaults on a loan to a lender, and the lender, as a judgment creditor, levies upon and sells the daughter's right, title, and interest in the south half of the farm to the lender's nephew.\n\nNow, the south half of the farm is part of the remaining three-quarters where the daughter and the friend are still joint tenants. So, the daughter has an undivided one-half interest in the south half as a joint tenant.\n\nWhen the lender levies upon and sells the daughter's interest in the south half, it's selling her joint tenancy interest in that south half. After the sale, the nephew owns the daughter's interest in the south half.\n\nNow, in joint tenancy, if one joint tenant sells their interest, it severs the joint tenancy as to that part. So, for the south half, the friend still has his joint tenancy interest, and now the nephew has the daughter's former interest. They would become tenants in common in the south half.\n\nFor the remaining part of the farm\u2014presumably the north half or whatever is left after taking out the northeast quarter and the south half\u2014I'm not entirely sure. Let me map out the quarters.\n\nThe farm is 100 acres. Let's assume it's divided into four quarters: northeast, southeast, northwest, southwest. Each quarter is 25 acres.\n\n- Northeast quarter: conveyed by daughter to co-worker.\n\n- South half: south half of 100 acres is 50 acres, which would include the southeast and southwest quarters.\n\n- So, remaining is the north half: northwest and northeast quarters. But wait, northeast is already conveyed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. The south half is 50 acres, and the northeast quarter is 25 acres.\n\nSo, the south half includes the southeast and southwest quarters, and the north half includes the northwest and northeast quarters.\n\nBut the daughter conveyed the northeast quarter to the co-worker.\n\nSo, for the north half, which is 50 acres: northwest and northeast quarters.\n\nThe daughter conveyed the northeast quarter, so the north half still includes the northwest quarter entirely and half of the northeast quarter (since the daughter only owned half of it after conveying to the co-worker).\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think in terms of interests.\n\nAfter the daughter conveys the northeast quarter to the co-worker, the co-worker and the friend are tenants in common in the northeast quarter.\n\nFor the remaining three-quarters of the farm, the daughter and the friend are still joint tenants.\n\nThen, the lender levies upon and sells the daughter's interest in the south half of the farm to the nephew.\n\nSo, for the south half:\n\n- Before levy: daughter and friend are joint tenants in the south half.\n\n- After levy: friend still has his joint tenancy interest, and the nephew has the daughter's former interest.\n\n- So, friend and nephew are tenants in common in the south half.\n\nFor the north half:\n\n- Before levy: daughter and friend are joint tenants in the north half.\n\n- After levy: since the levy was only on the south half, the north half remains as joint tenants between daughter and friend.\n\n- But wait, the levy was on the south half, so the north half is unaffected by the levy.\n\n- Therefore, daughter and friend remain joint tenants in the north half.\n\nThen, the daughter dies intestate in December 2009, leaving her husband as her sole surviving heir.\n\nAt her death:\n\n- For the northeast quarter: she had conveyed her interest to the co-worker, so nothing changes there.\n\n- For the south half: her interest was levied upon and sold to the nephew, so again, nothing changes there.\n\n- For the north half: she and the friend were joint tenants. Upon her death, since it's joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the friend should get the entire north half.\n\nWait, but the daughter died, and the friend is the surviving joint tenant, so the friend gets the entire north half.\n\nTherefore, after the daughter's death:\n\n- Northeast quarter: co-worker and friend are tenants in common.\n\n- South half: nephew and friend are tenants in common.\n\n- North half: friend owns it in fee simple.\n\nBut wait, the north half was joint tenancy between daughter and friend. Upon the daughter's death, the friend gets the entire north half by right of survivorship.\n\nSo, friend owns the north half in fee simple, and for the northeast quarter and the south half, he's a tenant in common with others.\n\nBut let's check the options:\n\nA. Friend and co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter; friend and husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter; friend and nephew are tenants in common of the south half.\n\nB. Friend and co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter; friend is the owner in fee of the northwest quarter; friend and nephew are tenants in common of the south half.\n\nC. Friend and co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter; friend and husband are tenants in common of the northwest quarter; nephew is the owner in fee of the south half.\n\nD. Friend and co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter; friend is the owner in fee of the remaining three-quarters of the farm.\n\nHmm.\n\nAccording to my analysis:\n\n- Northeast quarter: friend and co-worker are tenants in common.\n\n- South half: friend and nephew are tenants in common.\n\n- North half: friend owns it in fee simple.\n\nBut the north half is 50 acres, and the northeast quarter is 25 acres, so the remaining north half is the northwest quarter and half of the northeast quarter.\n\nWait, no. The northeast quarter is already conveyed to the co-worker, so the north half is just the northwest quarter.\n\nSo, friend owns the northwest quarter in fee simple, and the northeast quarter is held by friend and co-worker as tenants in common.\n\nSouth half is held by friend and nephew as tenants in common.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: friend and co-worker are tenants in common of the northeast quarter; friend is the owner in fee of the northwest quarter; friend and nephew are tenants in common of the south half.\n\nBut wait, in my earlier analysis, I thought that the north half is owned entirely by the friend after the daughter's death, but perhaps I need to consider that the north half consists of the northwest quarter and the northeast quarter.\n\nHowever, the daughter conveyed the northeast quarter to the co-worker, so that's separate.\n\nSo, perhaps the north half is the northwest quarter and the northeast quarter.\n\nDaughter conveyed northeast quarter to co-worker, so friend and co-worker are tenants in common in the northeast quarter.\n\nFor the northwest quarter, daughter and friend were joint tenants, and upon daughter's death, friend gets the entire northwest quarter by right of survivorship.\n\nTherefore, friend owns the northwest quarter in fee simple, and friend and co-worker are tenants in common in the northeast quarter, and friend and nephew are tenants in common in the south half.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\n- Northeast quarter: daughter conveyed to co-worker, so friend (as joint tenant) and co-worker are tenants in common.\n\n- Northwest quarter: joint tenancy between daughter and friend; upon daughter's death, friend gets the entire northwest quarter.\n\n- South half: daughter's interest levied upon and sold to nephew, so friend and nephew are tenants in common.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
