                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Spark Co. buys cordless phones for $125 each and sells them for $200 each. They also pay a sales commission of $25 per phone sold, and their monthly fixed costs are $3000. The goal is to find out how many units Spark needs to sell to achieve a profit that's 10% of their sales.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"profit of 10% of sales\" means. Profit is typically calculated as sales minus costs, and here, they want the profit to be 10% of the sales. So, if S is the total sales, then profit = S - total costs, and they want profit = 0.1S.\n\nLet me denote the number of units sold as Q.\n\nTotal sales, S, would be the selling price per unit times the number of units sold, so S = 200Q.\n\nTotal costs include the cost of goods sold, which is the purchase price per unit times Q, plus the sales commissions per unit times Q, plus the fixed costs. So, total costs = (125Q + 25Q) + 3000 = 150Q + 3000.\n\nNow, profit is S - total costs, which should equal 0.1S.\n\nSo, 200Q - (150Q + 3000) = 0.1(200Q).\n\nSimplifying the left side: 200Q - 150Q - 3000 = 50Q - 3000.\n\nRight side: 0.1 * 200Q = 20Q.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n50Q - 3000 = 20Q.\n\nNow, let's solve for Q.\n\nSubtract 20Q from both sides:\n\n50Q - 20Q - 3000 = 0 => 30Q - 3000 = 0.\n\nAdd 3000 to both sides:\n\n30Q = 3000.\n\nDivide both sides by 30:\n\nQ = 100.\n\nSo, Spark needs to sell 100 units to achieve a profit that's 10% of their sales.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, total sales S = 200Q.\n\nTotal costs = 125Q (cost of goods) + 25Q (commission) + 3000 (fixed costs) = 150Q + 3000.\n\nProfit = S - total costs = 200Q - 150Q - 3000 = 50Q - 3000.\n\nThey want profit = 0.1S = 0.1 * 200Q = 20Q.\n\nSo, 50Q - 3000 = 20Q.\n\nSubtract 20Q from both sides: 30Q - 3000 = 0.\n\nAdd 3000 to both sides: 30Q = 3000.\n\nDivide by 30: Q = 100.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can check by plugging Q = 100 back into the equations.\n\nTotal sales S = 200 * 100 = 20,000.\n\nTotal costs = 150 * 100 + 3000 = 15,000 + 3,000 = 18,000.\n\nProfit = 20,000 - 18,000 = 2,000.\n\n10% of sales is 0.1 * 20,000 = 2,000.\n\nYes, it matches.\n\nSo, the answer should be 100 units.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 600\n\nB. 400\n\nC. 200\n\nD. 100\n\nThe correct choice is D. 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
