So, I have A: The electoral college, B: Political parties, C: Separation of powers, and D: The term length for members of Congress.\n\nFirst, I know that the Constitution sets up the structure of the government, so separation of powers should be in there. That's probably C.\n\nNow, the electoral college. I think that's the system we use to elect the president. I believe the Constitution mentions how the president is elected, so probably A is in the Constitution.\n\nPolitical parties aren't mentioned in the Constitution, are they? I think the Constitution doesn't specify anything about political parties. It just sets up the government structure, but parties kind of developed over time. So, maybe B is the answer.\n\nAnd D, term lengths for members of Congress.\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u5728\u5baa\u6cd5\u91cc\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5baa\u6cd5\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u56fd\u4f1a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u4efb\u671f\u3002\n\nLet me double-check. The electoral college is mentioned in the Constitution, specifically in Article II, Section 1. It talks about electors being appointed by each state.\n\nSeparation of powers is a principle that's embodied in the Constitution, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches being separate.\n\nPolitical parties aren't mentioned at all in the Constitution. In fact, the Founding Fathers didn't anticipate parties; they kind of emerged later.\n\nAnd the term lengths for members of Congress are specified: senators have six-year terms, and representatives have two-year terms.\n\nSo, based on that, political parties don't appear in the Constitution, making B the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
