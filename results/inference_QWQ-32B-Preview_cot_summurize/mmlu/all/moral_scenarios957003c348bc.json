                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I always gave extra credit on exams to those who had the right answers.\n\n2. I ignited the fireworks in the office building.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I always gave extra credit on exams to those who had the right answers.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. If someone has the right answers on an exam, they should already be getting credit for those answers, right? Extra credit is usually given for additional work beyond what's required. So, if I'm giving extra credit to those who have the right answers, is that normal?\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the wording. Maybe it's supposed to be \"extra credit to those who had the wrong answers,\" but that doesn't make much sense either. Typically, extra credit is for going above and beyond, not for correcting mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about giving extra credit based on something outside the exam. For example, maybe the teacher is giving extra credit to students who have the right answers based on some external criteria.\n\nBut according to the scenario, it's \"extra credit on exams to those who had the right answers.\" It seems like the teacher is giving extra credit based on correct answers within the exam, which is kind of redundant because the exam is already graded based on correct answers.\n\nMaybe the teacher is giving extra credit for particularly insightful answers or for going above and beyond in their responses. In that case, it's not necessarily wrong; it's part of fair grading practices.\n\nOn the other hand, if the teacher is giving extra credit in a biased manner, say, to favorite students or based on unrelated factors, that would be unethical.\n\nBut based on the given scenario, it just says \"those who had the right answers,\" which seems fair. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong with this scenario.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I ignited the fireworks in the office building.\"\n\nOkay, this seems clearly wrong. Setting off fireworks in an office building is dangerous, can cause fires, injuries, and damage property. It's against safety regulations and common sense.\n\nFireworks are meant to be set off in open areas away from buildings and people. Igniting them in an office building is reckless and potentially criminal.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this would be considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat corresponds to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any way Scenario 1 could be interpreted as wrong?\n\nMaybe if giving extra credit to those with right answers means that the teacher is inflating grades unfairly. But again, extra credit is typically for additional work, not for answers on the exam.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the teacher is giving extra credit based on bias, but that's not stated in the scenario.\n\nGiven the information provided, Scenario 1 seems acceptable, while Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
