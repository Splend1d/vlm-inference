It's about a way of life that involves breeding and herding animals, and these animals provide food, shelter, and clothing. The options are swidden, subsistence farming, pastoralism, and hunting and gathering. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nSwidden: I think swidden is related to a type of agriculture where land is cleared by cutting and burning vegetation. It's often used in tropical regions. So, it's more about farming than herding animals.\n\nSubsistence farming: This is when people grow just enough food for themselves and their families, not for selling. It's focused on crops, not so much on animals.\n\nPastoralism: I've heard this term before. It seems to be about raising livestock. Pastoral societies move with their herds, depending on them for food, clothing, and other needs.\n\nHunting and gathering: This is the earliest form of human subsistence, where people hunt wild animals and gather plants for food. It doesn't involve breeding or herding animals.\n\nSo, comparing these definitions to the question, which is about breeding and herding animals for food, shelter, and clothing, pastoralism seems to fit best.\n\nLet me double-check. Swidden is about clearing land for farming, not specifically about animals. Subsistence farming is about growing crops for personal use. Hunting and gathering is about taking what's already in the environment, not breeding animals. Pastoralism is all about managing herds of animals and relying on them for various needs.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. pastoralism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
