                    "text": "This question is about the level of understanding we have of the written languages of ancient civilizations. The options are the Indus Valley, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Chinese civilizations. The question is asking which one has a written language that is the least deciphered, meaning we understand it the least.\n\nFirst, let's consider Egyptian writing. Egyptian hieroglyphs were a complex system of writing that was used for religious and ceremonial purposes, while hieratic and demotic scripts were used for more administrative and daily use. The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, was crucial in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs because it had the same text in three scripts: hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek. Since Greek was well understood, scholars could compare the scripts and figure out the meaning of the hieroglyphs. So, Egyptian writing is largely deciphered.\n\nNext, Mesopotamian writing is primarily cuneiform, which was used by various cultures in the region, including the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians. Cuneiform was deciphered in the 19th century through the work of Henry Rawlinson and others, who studied the Behistun Inscription, which contained the same text in three cuneiform scripts and Old Persian. So, Mesopotamian writing is also largely understood.\n\nChinese writing has a long history, dating back to the Shang Dynasty around 1200 BCE. The earliest known Chinese writing is oracle bone script, which was used for divination. Scholars have been able to decipher a significant portion of these characters, and the Chinese writing system has evolved over time but remains largely understood today.\n\nNow, the Indus Valley Civilization, which flourished around 2600-1900 BCE in the northwestern regions of the Indian subcontinent, had its own writing system. The script is found on thousands of seals, tablets, and other artifacts, but it remains undeciphered. There have been many attempts to decipher it, with some scholars proposing connections to various language families, but no consensus has been reached. The main challenge is that the texts are generally very short, and there is no bilingual inscription like the Rosetta Stone to provide a key for translation.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the Indus Valley Civilization's writing system is the least deciphered among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
