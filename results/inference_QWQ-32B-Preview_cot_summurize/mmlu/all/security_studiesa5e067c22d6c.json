Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\nB. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\nC. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\nD. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. Ecological security displays continuity with major interpretations of security, which typically centralize the security of the state.\n"

So, environmental security is a field that looks at how environmental issues can impact security and stability, both at the national and global levels. But, like many concepts in security studies, it's not without its controversies and different interpretations. The question presents four options, and I need to figure out which one best describes the contestation around environmental security.\n\nOption A says that environmental security is about the integrity of the whole ecological system, and the main threat is human activity. It challenges traditional security thinking by shifting the focus from national security interests to the welfare of the entire planet's social-ecological system. This sounds like a pretty radical shift because traditionally, security has been about protecting the state from external threats, like other states or non-state actors. So, moving the focus to the environment and the planet as a whole is indeed a significant departure from that.\n\nOption B presents environmental security as a concern for protecting human welfare from environmental threats, but it frames this within individual and national interests. So, it's still somewhat aligned with traditional security thinking, where the state's interests are paramount. It doesn't seem to push for a global or ecological perspective beyond how it affects humans directly.\n\nOption C suggests that not all problems are global, and not all states contribute equally to environmental issues or face equal risks. It questions whether systemic interdependence can effectively manage these security areas. This seems to be arguing that environmental security is too broad and that approaches need to be more nuanced, considering different levels of responsibility and risk among states.\n\nOption D claims that ecological and human security approaches don't challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security. It suggests that ecological security is consistent with traditional security interpretations that center on state security. This seems contrary to what I know about environmental security, which often expands the notion of security beyond the state to include broader ecological and human dimensions.\n\nLooking back, option A seems to capture a key aspect of the contestation around environmental security. It highlights the shift from state-centric security to a more holistic approach that considers the entire planet's ecological system. This is indeed a radical challenge to traditional security thinking, which has historically been state-focused.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, seems to maintain a more traditional perspective, where environmental security is still about protecting human interests, primarily at the national level. While it acknowledges environmental threats, it doesn't push for the fundamental shift that option A describes.\n\nOption C raises valid points about the complexity of environmental issues, noting that not all problems are global and that states have differing levels of responsibility and risk. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective, which is a important consideration in environmental security policies.\n\nOption D, however, seems misinformed or at least not aligning with my understanding of environmental security. Ecological security, in particular, does challenge traditional security thinking by proposing that the environment itself is an object of security, not just the state.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option A best captures how the concept of environmental security has been contested. It emphasizes the shift from state-centric security to a more comprehensive approach that prioritizes the integrity of the entire ecological system, which is indeed a radical departure from traditional security paradigms.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing something, let's think about this differently. Perhaps the contestation around environmental security involves debates over whether it should be integrated into traditional security frameworks or whether it requires a entirely new approach. Option A seems to support the idea of a new approach, while option B leans towards integration with existing frameworks.\n\nAdditionally, option C touches on the practical challenges of applying environmental security globally, given the varying degrees of involvement and impact by different states. This could be seen as a contestation in terms of how to implement environmental security measures.\n\nOption D, however, suggests that ecological security doesn't challenge existing security thinking, which contradicts much of the literature I've read on the subject. Many scholars argue that environmental security expands the scope of security beyond the state, inclusiong ecosystems and human well-being more broadly.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe option A is the most accurate in describing how environmental security has been contested. It highlights the fundamental challenge to traditional security thinking by proposing that the integrity of the entire ecological system should be the primary concern, rather than just national security interests.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
