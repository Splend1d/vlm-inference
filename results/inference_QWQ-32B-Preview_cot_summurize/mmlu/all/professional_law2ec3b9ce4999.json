                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what the defendant is guilty of in this scenario. There are two charges mentioned: burglary and receiving stolen property. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the burglary. Two men decided to burglarize a homeowner's house while she was away. They asked the defendant to drive them to the house, but they didn't tell him about the plan to burglarize. The defendant drove them there, waited in the car, and then drove them back after they entered the house and stole jewelry.\n\nSo, for burglary, I need to understand if the defendant is complicit in the burglary even though he didn't know about it at the time. Burglary typically involves entering a building without permission with the intent to commit a crime inside, usually theft. Here, the two men entered the house with a master key and stole jewelry.\n\nNow, the defendant drove them there and back, but he was unaware of their intentions. So, is driving them there enough to make him an accomplice to burglary?\n\nI think in criminal law, accomplice liability requires that the person intended to assist in the commission of the crime. Since the defendant didn't know about the burglary plan, he didn't have the intent to assist in the burglary. He just drove them to a house, not knowing what they were going to do.\n\nTherefore, I don't think he should be guilty of burglary.\n\nNext, there's the charge of receiving stolen property. After the burglary, the two men gave the defendant $500 and told him about the burglary two weeks later. The defendant kept the money and didn't report the theft to the police.\n\nReceiving stolen property generally means that someone knows that the property is stolen and still receives it with the intent to benefit from it.\n\nIn this case, the defendant received money ($500) from the proceeds of the burglary. He knew it was from the burglary because they told him about it after the fact. He kept the money and didn't report it.\n\nSo, it seems like he knew the money was from illegal activity and still accepted it, benefiting from it.\n\nTherefore, I think he should be guilty of receiving stolen property.\n\nPutting it all together, the defendant should be found guilty of receiving stolen property but not guilty of burglary.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
