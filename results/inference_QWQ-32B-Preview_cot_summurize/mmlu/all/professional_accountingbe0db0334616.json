                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about how to handle this unrealized gain on an available-for-sale debt investment. I know that available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, and any unrealized gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, but I also remember that taxes play a role here. Let me try to sort this out.\n\nFirst, the unrealized gain is $100,000. Since it's an available-for-sale debt investment, the gain should be reported in other comprehensive income, right? But the question mentions a corporate tax rate of 25%, so I think I need to consider the tax effect on this gain.\n\nI recall that for available-for-sale securities, the unrealized gains and losses are reported net of tax in other comprehensive income. That means I need to calculate the tax impact on this $100,000 gain.\n\nTo find the tax effect, I'll multiply the gain by the tax rate: $100,000 * 25% = $25,000.\n\nSo, the tax effect is $25,000. Now, to find the net amount reported in other comprehensive income, I need to subtract the tax effect from the gross gain: $100,000 - $25,000 = $75,000.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check my understanding.\n\nActually, in accounting, for available-for-sale securities, the unrealized gain is reported in other comprehensive income net of tax. That means the amount reported in other comprehensive income is the gain minus the related tax expense.\n\nSo, other comprehensive income would be $100,000 - $25,000 = $75,000.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the amount of the gain that should be included in net income and other comprehensive income.\n\nSince this is an unrealized gain, it shouldn't affect net income, right? Net income is affected by realized gains and losses, not unrealized ones.\n\nSo, net income should be $0, and other comprehensive income should be $75,000.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is $0 $75,000, which matches my conclusion.\n\nWait, but option C is $25,000 $75,000. Maybe they think that $25,000 should be included in net income.\n\nI need to make sure about this. Unrealized gains on available-for-sale debt investments are supposed to be reported in other comprehensive income, not in net income.\n\nTherefore, net income should not include any part of this unrealized gain.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option D: $0 $75,000.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAvailable-for-sale securities:\n\n- Reported at fair value.\n\n- Unrealized gains and losses go to other comprehensive income, net of tax.\n\n- Realized gains and losses go to net income.\n\nIn this case, it's an unrealized gain, so it should only affect other comprehensive income.\n\nTherefore, net income is $0, and other comprehensive income is $75,000.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nd. $0 $75,000"
