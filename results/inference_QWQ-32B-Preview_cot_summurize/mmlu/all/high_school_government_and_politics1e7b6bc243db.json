                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement is true about delegates to presidential nomination conventions. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Delegates are generally more likely to register as third party voters at some point.\" Hmm, I don't think that's accurate. Delegates to presidential nomination conventions are usually strongly affiliated with one of the major parties, either Democratic or Republican. Third party voters are often those who aren't fully satisfied with the major parties, but delegates are committed to their party's nomination process. So, I doubt this is true.\n\nOption B: \"The majority of the general population is more educated than the delegates.\" I'm not sure about this. I think delegates might be more educated because they are actively involved in politics and the nomination process, which could require certain levels of education or access to information. But maybe the general population has caught up. I'll need to think about this more.\n\nOption C: \"Delegates typically have little interest in politics.\" That seems contradictory. Delegates to presidential nomination conventions are people who are selected to represent their states and vote for their party's presidential candidate. It's hard to believe that people who take on such a role have little interest in politics. They must be quite engaged and interested to be delegates. So, this probably isn't true.\n\nOption D: \"Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates.\" This one seems plausible. Delegates to presidential nomination conventions are often the most committed and ideologically driven members of their parties. They go through a process to become delegates, which likely involves a strong alignment with their party's platform and candidates. The general population, on the other hand, may have a wider range of political views and may not be as ideologically committed. So, maybe delegates are more ideological than the general population.\n\nLet me consider this further. Delegates are selected based on their party involvement and support for certain candidates or positions. They are likely to be more ideological because they are choosing to participate in the nomination process, which is a crucial part of the political system. The general population includes a broader spectrum of political engagement and ideology, including moderates and those who may not align strictly with one ideology.\n\nAlso, considering that delegates are chosen to represent their party's views, they are probably more aligned with their party's ideology compared to the general population, which may have more diverse and less partisan views.\n\nMoreover, studies have shown that political activists and party delegates tend to hold more extreme views than the general electorate. So, delegates might be more ideological.\n\nThinking about recent elections, the delegates at the conventions often showcase their party's platform and candidates, emphasizing the differences between the parties. This suggests that delegates are more ideological and committed to their party's positions.\n\nIn contrast, the general population may have more centrist views or be less consistently ideological in their political beliefs.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate statement among the given options.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A is unlikely because delegates are typically strongly affiliated with major parties.\n\n- Option B is uncertain, but delegates might be more educated due to their political involvement.\n\n- Option C is probably false since delegates are actively involved in politics.\n\n- Option D is plausible because delegates are likely more ideological than the general population.\n\nHence, the true statement is: \"Typically, the general population is less ideological than the delegates.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
