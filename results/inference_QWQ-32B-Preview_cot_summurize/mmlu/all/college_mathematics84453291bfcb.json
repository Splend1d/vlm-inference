I need to figure out which statements about A are true.\n\nFirst, I recall that the determinant of (A - \u03bbI) is the characteristic polynomial of A. So, the characteristic polynomial is p(\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3.\n\nI remember that for a matrix, the trace is the sum of its eigenvalues, and the determinant is the product of its eigenvalues, both taken with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nAlso, for a 3x3 matrix, the characteristic polynomial is generally of the form:\n\np(\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + t\u03bb^2 + c\u03bb + d,\n\nwhere t is the trace of A, and d is the determinant of A, but I need to make sure about the signs.\n\nWait, actually, the characteristic polynomial is det(A - \u03bbI), which for a 3x3 matrix is:\n\np(\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + (trace(A))\u03bb^2 - (sum of the principal minors)\u03bb + det(A).\n\nBut I think for now, I can focus on the trace and determinant.\n\nLet me look at statement I: The trace of A is 3.\n\nFrom the characteristic polynomial, the coefficient of \u03bb^2 is 3, and since the characteristic polynomial is -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3, I believe the trace is equal to the coefficient of \u03bb^2 when the leading coefficient is -1.\n\nWait, more precisely, for a general n x n matrix, the characteristic polynomial is:\n\np(\u03bb) = (-1)^n (\u03bb^n - (trace(A))\u03bb^{n-1} + ... + (-1)^n det(A)).\n\nSo for a 3x3 matrix, p(\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + trace(A) \u03bb^2 - (sum of principal minors) \u03bb + det(A).\n\nComparing this to the given polynomial -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3, I can see that:\n\n- The coefficient of \u03bb^2 is trace(A), which is 3.\n\n- The constant term is det(A), which is -3.\n\n- The coefficient of \u03bb is the sum of the principal minors, which is 1.\n\nSo, statement I says the trace of A is 3, which matches what I have here. So, I think I is true.\n\nNow, statement II says the determinant of A is -3, which also matches the constant term in the characteristic polynomial. So, II is also true.\n\nStatement III says that the matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\n\nWait a minute, eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial p(\u03bb) = 0.\n\nSo, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3 = 0.\n\nLet me try to factor this polynomial.\n\nI can factor by grouping:\n\np(\u03bb) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3\n\n= (-\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2) + (\u03bb - 3)\n\n= -\u03bb^2(\u03bb - 3) + 1(\u03bb - 3)\n\n= (-\u03bb^2 + 1)(\u03bb - 3)\n\n= -(\u03bb^2 - 1)(\u03bb - 3)\n\n= -(\u03bb - 1)(\u03bb + 1)(\u03bb - 3)\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = -1, and \u03bb = 3.\n\nTherefore, the matrix A has eigenvalues 1, -1, and 3.\n\nSo, statement III says that A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\n\nBut from the above, one of the eigenvalues is 3, not -3.\n\nSo, statement III is false because -3 is not an eigenvalue; 3 is.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and II are true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
