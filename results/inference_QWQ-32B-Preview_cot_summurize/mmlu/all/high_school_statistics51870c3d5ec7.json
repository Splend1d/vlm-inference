                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about standardized scores, or z-scores, in an AP Statistics class. The scenario is that students were timed in seconds while solving mathematical brainteasers, and one student had a z-score of z = 2.40. Then, the times are converted to minutes, and I need to find out what the student's z-score will be after this conversion.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a z-score represents. A z-score tells us how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula for calculating a z-score is:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( X \\) is the value of the element,\n\n- \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the set,\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation of the set.\n\nIn this problem, the times are initially in seconds, and then they are converted to minutes. I need to understand how this conversion affects the z-score.\n\nConverting seconds to minutes involves dividing the time in seconds by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute. So, if \\( X \\) is the time in seconds, then the time in minutes, \\( X' \\), is:\n\n\\[ X' = \\frac{X}{60} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the mean in minutes, \\( \\mu' \\), would be:\n\n\\[ \\mu' = \\frac{\\mu}{60} \\]\n\nAnd the standard deviation in minutes, \\( \\sigma' \\), would be:\n\n\\[ \\sigma' = \\frac{\\sigma}{60} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the z-score after the conversion to minutes:\n\n\\[ z' = \\frac{(X' - \\mu')}{\\sigma'} \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( X' \\), \\( \\mu' \\), and \\( \\sigma' \\):\n\n\\[ z' = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{X}{60} - \\frac{\\mu}{60} \\right)}{\\frac{\\sigma}{60}} \\]\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{X}{60} - \\frac{\\mu}{60} = \\frac{X - \\mu}{60} \\]\n\nSo, the z-score becomes:\n\n\\[ z' = \\frac{\\frac{X - \\mu}{60}}{\\frac{\\sigma}{60}} \\]\n\nThe denominators cancel out:\n\n\\[ z' = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as the original z-score:\n\n\\[ z' = z \\]\n\nSo, the z-score remains unchanged when the units are converted from seconds to minutes. That means the student's z-score stays at 2.40, regardless of the unit conversion.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean, and it is unitless because both the numerator and denominator have the same units, which cancel out. Therefore, converting the units should not affect the z-score.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that both the mean and the standard deviation are scaled by the same factor when changing units, so their ratio remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. z = 2.40.\n\nBut let's consider why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption A: z = 0.04 \u2013 This seems too small and doesn't make sense based on the reasoning above.\n\nOption B: z = 0.4 \u2013 Again, this is lower than the original z-score, which doesn't align with the conclusion that z should remain the same.\n\nOption C: z = 1.80 \u2013 This is lower than the original z-score of 2.40, which also doesn't fit with the expectation that z should remain unchanged.\n\nHence, the only logical choice is D. z = 2.40.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**View Solution**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
