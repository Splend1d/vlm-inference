                    "text": "So I've got this case here about a 75-year-old woman who's complaining of band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen that goes around to the midline of her back. She's coming to the office for this issue. Let's see what we've got here.\n\nFirst, physical examination doesn't show any abdominal tenderness when they palpate her belly. That's interesting because sometimes abdominal pain can be accompanied by tenderness, but in this case, there's none. Then, they did an ultrasonography of the gallbladder, and it came back normal. So, no issues found there. Also, her serum amylase level is within the normal range, which rules out some possibilities related to the pancreas, I think.\n\nNow, I need to pick the most likely diagnosis from the options given: A) Acalculous cholecystitis, B) Chronic relapsing pancreatitis, C) Diverticulitis of the cecum, and D) Herpes zoster.\n\nLet me think about each one step by step.\n\nStarting with A) Acalculous cholecystitis. I know that cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually caused by gallstones, which is called calculous cholecystitis. Acalculous means without gallstones, so it's inflammation without stones. But if the ultrasound was normal and showed no issues with the gallbladder, is this still a likely diagnosis? Maybe not, because ultrasound is pretty good at detecting gallbladder issues, including inflammation.\n\nNext, B) Chronic relapsing pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, and chronic relapsing means it comes and goes over time. The pain described is in the upper abdomen and radiates to the back, which is classic for pancreatic pain. However, her serum amylase is normal, which is a marker for pancreatitis. If her amylase was elevated, it would support pancreatitis, but since it's normal, that makes this diagnosis less likely. Maybe it's worth considering still, as sometimes amylase can be normal in chronic cases.\n\nOption C) Diverticulitis of the cecum. Diverticulitis is inflammation of diverticula, which are small pouches that can form in the intestinal wall. Typically, diverticula are more common in the sigmoid colon, but they can occur in the cecum as well. The pain from diverticulitis is usually in the left lower quadrant for sigmoid diverticulitis, but for cecal diverticulitis, it would be in the right lower quadrant. The pain described here is in the right upper quadrant and radiating to the back, which doesn't really match the typical location for cecal diverticulitis. So, probably not the most likely diagnosis.\n\nLastly, D) Herpes zoster. Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox. Shingles typically presents as a painful rash that follows a dermatomal distribution, meaning it affects a specific area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve. The pain can be burning and severe before the rash appears. In this case, the patient is experiencing burning pain in the right upper abdomen and around to the back, which could potentially correspond to a dermatome in that area.\n\nBut here's the thing: there's no mention of a rash in the description. Shingles typically presents with a rash, which is a key diagnostic feature. Without a rash, is it still possible to have zoster? Yes, sometimes the rash can be mild or not present, especially in older adults or those with compromised immune systems. So, it's possible, but it's less likely without a rash.\n\nLet me consider the options again. The pain is band-like and burning, extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. No abdominal tenderness on palpation, normal ultrasound of the gallbladder, and normal serum amylase.\n\nAcalculous cholecystitis is less likely because the ultrasound was normal.\n\nChronic relapsing pancreatitis is possible, but the normal amylase makes it less likely.\n\nDiverticulitis of the cecum doesn't fit the location well.\n\nHerpes zoster is a possibility, especially if it's affecting a dermatome in that area, but the absence of a rash makes it less likely.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider something else. Maybe a musculoskeletal cause? Like a muscle strain or something in the abdominal wall that's causing referred pain. But the pain is described as band-like and burning, which isn't typical for a muscle strain.\n\nAnother possibility could be a gastrointestinal issue, like peptic ulcer disease, but typically ulcers cause more of a gnawing or burning pain in the upper abdomen, and it might not radiate to the back as described here.\n\nCould it be acid reflux or esophageal issues? Sometimes gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause chest pain that radiates to the back, but it's usually more in the central chest area, not specifically in the right upper quadrant.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to think about vascular causes, like an aortic aneurysm, but that's usually in the lower abdomen and can cause back pain, but the pain description doesn't quite match.\n\nWhat about renal colic? Kidney stones can cause severe pain in the flank area, which is the sides of the abdomen, and it can radiate to the back. But again, it's more on the sides, not specifically in the right upper quadrant.\n\nWait, perhaps it's hepatic flexure colon cancer or some colonic issue, but that seems less likely without other symptoms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a referred pain from the diaphragm, like a pleuritic pain from the lung, but that would typically involve the chest more.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps herpes zoster is the most likely diagnosis, even without a rash, because the pain distribution fits with a dermatomal pattern, and it's known to cause burning pain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a type of neuropathic pain affecting that area.\n\nBut among the options provided, herpes zoster seems possible, chronic relapsing pancreatitis is a possibility despite normal amylase, and acalculous cholecystitis is less likely with a normal ultrasound.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the typical presentations of each of these conditions to make a better comparison.\n\nFirst, acalculous cholecystitis: This is inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones. It can occur in certain situations like critical illness, prolonged fasting, or some surgical procedures. The symptoms can include right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Since the ultrasound was normal, it's less likely, but sometimes early or mild cases might not show up on ultrasound.\n\nChronic relapsing pancreatitis: This is persistent inflammation of the pancreas that recurs over time. Symptoms include abdominal pain, often radiating to the back, weight loss, and sometimes diarrhea. Serum amylase can be normal in chronic cases, so that doesn't rule it out completely.\n\nDiverticulitis of the cecum: This is inflammation of diverticula in the cecum, which is in the right lower quadrant. The pain would typically be in the right lower abdomen, not the right upper quadrant. So, that doesn't seem to fit well.\n\nHerpes zoster: As mentioned, it can cause a painful rash in a dermatomal distribution. The pain can precede the rash by a few days, but typically the rash eventually appears.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best answer is B) chronic relapsing pancreatitis, even with normal amylase, because the pain description matches pancreatic pain.\n\nAlternatively, D) herpes zoster could be considered, but the absence of a rash makes it less likely.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that in older adults, zoster can sometimes present without a rash, or with a very mild rash that the patient might not have noticed.\n\nIt's something to consider.\n\nPerhaps the physician should consider ordering an anterograde pancreatogram or other imaging studies to evaluate the pancreas further if pancreatitis is suspected.\n\nAlternatively, they could consider doing a trial of antiviral therapy for zoster if they suspect that, especially if there are any early signs of a rash or if the pain is purely neuralgic in nature.\n\nBut based on the information provided, I think chronic relapsing pancreatitis is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nSo, my answer would be B) chronic relapsing pancreatitis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
