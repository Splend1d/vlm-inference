                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"An investment will pay out $10 p.a. forever. What is that investment worth if the market discount rate is 5%?\" And there are options: A. $100, B. $2, C. $500, D. $200.\n\nAlright, first I need to understand what's being asked. It's about finding the present value of an investment that pays $10 every year forever, and the discount rate is 5%. Okay, so this sounds like a perpetuity, right? Because it's paying out forever.\n\nI remember that the formula for the present value of a perpetuity is PV = C / r, where C is the cash flow per period, and r is the discount rate per period.\n\nSo in this case, C is $10 per year, and r is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal form.\n\nPlugging into the formula: PV = 10 / 0.05 = $200.\n\nSo, according to this, the investment is worth $200.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is $200, so that should be the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this? Well, another way to think about it is to consider the investment as an infinite series of payments, each of $10, starting from next year, and discounting them back to today using the discount rate of 5%.\n\nSo, the present value would be the sum from t=1 to infinity of 10 / (1 + 0.05)^t.\n\nI know that the sum of an infinite geometric series is a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.\n\nIn this case, a = 10 / 1.05 and r = 1 / 1.05.\n\nWait, actually, more precisely, the present value is:\n\nPV = \u2211 [10 / (1.05)^t] from t=1 to infinity.\n\nThis is indeed a geometric series with a = 10 / 1.05 and r = 1 / 1.05.\n\nBut using the perpetuity formula PV = C / r is simpler and should give the same result.\n\nSo, PV = 10 / 0.05 = 200.\n\nAlright, seems consistent.\n\nMaybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could affect the present value, like inflation or changes in the discount rate over time. But the question seems to assume a constant discount rate, so probably not.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The cash flow is per year, and the discount rate is per year, so that's fine.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the first payment is immediate or at the end of the first year. The question says \"p.a. forever,\" which typically means annually, starting next year, not immediately. So, it's an ordinary perpetuity, not an annuity due.\n\nSo, the formula PV = C / r is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the investment is worth $200.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is $200, so that should be the correct answer.\n\nBut why are there other options? Maybe to test if I'm confusing perpetuity with other types of annuities.\n\nFor example, option A is $100, which would be the present value if the discount rate were 10% (since 10 / 0.10 = 100), but it's 5%, so that doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption B is $2, which is too low. That would correspond to a discount rate of 500% (10 / 500 = 0.02), which is not the case.\n\nOption C is $500, which would be the present value if the discount rate were 2% (10 / 0.02 = 500), but again, it's 5%.\n\nSo, yes, D is the correct choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider the concept of the time value of money. The idea is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, because you can invest today's dollar and earn interest on it.\n\nIn this case, since the investment pays forever, the present value is the cash flow divided by the discount rate.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to calculate the present value using the formula for a finite number of periods and then take the limit as the number of periods approaches infinity, I would still get PV = C / r.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the answer should be $200.\n\nI think I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
