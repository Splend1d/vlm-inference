                    "text": "The New Testament consists of 27 books. So, the correct answer is C. 27.\n\nTo provide some additional context, the New Testament is the second part of the Christian Bible, following the Old Testament. It was written in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD and contains accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, as well as early Christian history and letters from apostles to various churches.\n\nThe 27 books are generally categorized into the following groups:\n\n1. **Gospels** (4 books): Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These books narrate the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\n2. **Acts of the Apostles** (1 book): This book describes the early history of the Christian church, focusing on the activities of the apostles Peter and Paul.\n\n3. **Epistles** (21 books): These are letters written by various apostles to early Christian communities and individuals. They provide guidance, teaching, and correction on matters of faith and practice.\n\n4. **Revelation** (1 book): Also known as the Apocalypse, this book contains visionary descriptions of the end times and is considered an apocalyptic text.\n\nIt's worth noting that the number of books in the New Testament has been standardized for many centuries, but there have been variations in the past. Some early Christian communities included additional writings, known as the Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical books, but these are not considered part of the New Testament canon by most Christian denominations today.\n\nIn summary, the New Testament comprises 27 books that are central to Christian theology and practice."
