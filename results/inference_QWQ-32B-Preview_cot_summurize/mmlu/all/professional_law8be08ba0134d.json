Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\nB.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem. It seems a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's a seller who agreed to sell a residential property to a buyer. The agreement says the seller has to give \"good and marketable title.\" That means the title should be free of any issues that could cause problems for the buyer later on.\n\nNow, during a title search, they found an old mortgage from 25 years ago, from a previous owner to a local bank. The mortgagor (the person who took the mortgage) can't be found, and the bank doesn't have any records. So, there's this hanging mortgage that no one knows about.\n\nThe purchase agreement had a provision that if something like this happens, the seller gets an extra 90 days to clear the title by filing a \"quiet title action.\" That's a legal process where the seller asks the court to confirm that they own the property free and clear of any claims.\n\nBut in this case, the seller didn't follow that procedure. Instead, they showed up at settlement with the problematic title and asked for more time to file that quiet title action. The buyer didn't want to wait and asked for their down payment back and to cancel the deal.\n\nNow, the question is: if this goes to court, will the court likely side with the buyer?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure stated in the purchase agreement.\n\nB. No, because the seller always has the right to bring an action for adverse possession against the holder of the open mortgage.\n\nC. Yes, because the open mortgage is so old that it would be declared void by all courts.\n\nD. No, because the buyer did not act in good faith when it refused to give the seller additional time at the closing.\n\nFirst, option A says yes, the court will likely side with the buyer because the seller didn't follow the agreement. That seems plausible. The purchase agreement specified that the seller should have 90 days to clear the title by filing a quiet title action. But the seller didn't do that; instead, they showed up at settlement without having done anything about the mortgage issue. So, by not following the agreed procedure, the seller may have breached the contract.\n\nOption B says no, because the seller can bring an adverse possession action. Adverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land for a certain period and can eventually claim ownership. But in this case, the issue is an old mortgage, not someone occupying the land. So, I don't think adverse possession applies here. This option seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says yes, because the mortgage is so old, it's void. But in reality, mortgages don't necessarily become void just because they're old. Mortgages are typically valid until they're paid off or released, regardless of age. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D says no, because the buyer didn't act in good faith by not giving the seller more time. But the purchase agreement specified a procedure: if there's an issue, the seller gets 90 extra days to fix it. The seller didn't do that; instead, they showed up at settlement without having addressed the issue and asked for more time. The buyer might reasonably feel that the seller hasn't met their obligations, and therefore, they're entitled to cancel the deal and get their money back.\n\nConsidering all this, option A seems the most correct. The seller breached the agreement by not following the procedure outlined for clearing title issues. The buyer is entitled to rely on the agreement and, since the seller didn't meet their obligations, to rescind the deal and get their down payment back.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
