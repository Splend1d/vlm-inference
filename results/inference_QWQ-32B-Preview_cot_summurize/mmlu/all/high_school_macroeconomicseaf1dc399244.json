                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about import quotas and their predictable consequences. Import quotas are limits that a government imposes on the quantity of a particular good that can be imported into the country within a specific time period. These quotas are often used to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.\n\nOption A suggests that import quotas lead to increased competition and lower consumer prices. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If there are quotas on imports, the supply of those goods in the domestic market decreases because less is being imported. With reduced supply, you'd expect prices to rise, not fall, due to the decreased competition from foreign producers. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption B proposes that import quotas increase government tax revenue from imported goods. While it's true that import quotas can be accompanied by tariffs or other taxes on imports, the quota itself is a quantitative limit, not a tax. So, while there might be some tax revenue if imports are still allowed above the quota at higher tax rates, the primary effect of a quota is to limit the quantity, not necessarily to increase tax revenue. This doesn't seem like the most direct or predictable consequence.\n\nOption C suggests that import quotas lead to rising net exports and a rightward shift in aggregate supply. Net exports are calculated as exports minus imports. If imports are reduced due to quotas, net exports would indeed rise, assuming exports remain constant. A rightward shift in aggregate supply typically occurs when the economy's productive capacity increases, leading to more goods and services being supplied at each price level. However, import quotas don't directly affect the economy's productive capacity; they just limit the amount of foreign goods coming in. So, while net exports might rise, the impact on aggregate supply is not straightforward. This option seems a bit vague.\n\nOption D states that import quotas lead to higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers. This seems more plausible. With import quotas, the supply of the good in the domestic market decreases, which can lead to higher prices for consumers. Additionally, if domestic producers are less efficient than foreign producers, the quotas force consumers to buy from less efficient producers, which is a misallocation of resources. This misallocation can make the economy less efficient overall because resources are not being used in the most productive way.\n\nLet me think about this a bit more. Import quotas can protect domestic industries, but they often come at the cost of higher prices for consumers and potential reductions in product variety. Moreover, by shielding domestic producers from competition, quotas can reduce their incentive to become more efficient, which can harm the economy in the long run.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option D seems to be the most accurate description of the predictable consequences of import quotas: higher consumer prices and a misallocation of resources away from efficient producers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
