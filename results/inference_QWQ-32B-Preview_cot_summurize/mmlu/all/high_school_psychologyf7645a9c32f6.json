They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which is a chemical that helps regulate mood, among other things.\n\nSo, if I look at the options:\n\nA. Manic - that sounds like mania, which is part of bipolar disorder where people have elevated moods and energy levels. But SSRIs are not typically used for mania; in fact, they might even make mania worse in some cases. So, probably not A.\n\nB. Depressive - that makes sense. SSRIs are commonly used to treat depression because they help improve mood by increasing serotonin levels. So, this seems like a likely answer.\n\nC. Dissociative identity - that's what used to be called multiple personality disorder. It's a complex psychiatric condition involving distinct identities or personality states. I don't think SSRIs are the first line of treatment for this; maybe therapy is more important. So, probably not C.\n\nD. Conversion - conversion disorder is when physical symptoms occur without a medical explanation, often linked to psychological stress. Again, I don't think SSRIs are typically used for this condition; maybe psychotherapy or other approaches are more appropriate.\n\nSo, based on what I know, I think the answer is B, depressive disorders. SSRIs like Prozac and Paxil are commonly prescribed for conditions like major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and sometimes for anxiety disorders as well.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. SSRIs are known for their use in depression and anxiety. They are not typically used for manic episodes, dissociative identity disorder, or conversion disorder.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is B. depressive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
