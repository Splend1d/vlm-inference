                    "text": "An ideal transformer is a theoretical model of a transformer that doesn't have any energy losses. In reality, transformers have some energy losses due to factors like resistance in the windings and magnetic flux leakage, but in an ideal transformer, we assume that all the energy input is transferred to the output.\n\nSo, in an ideal transformer, the power input should be equal to the power output. That means if you put in 100 watts of power, you should get out 100 watts of power, assuming no losses.\n\nNow, transformers work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. They have two coils: the primary coil and the secondary coil. When an alternating current flows through the primary coil, it creates a varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a voltage in the secondary coil.\n\nThe relationship between the input and output voltages and currents in a transformer is given by the turns ratio. The turns ratio is the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary coil to the number of turns in the primary coil.\n\nIf the transformer is a step-up transformer, it means that the secondary voltage is higher than the primary voltage. In this case, the secondary current is lower than the primary current, such that the power remains the same.\n\nSimilarly, for a step-down transformer, the secondary voltage is lower than the primary voltage, and the secondary current is higher, again maintaining the same power.\n\nSo, in both cases, the power input equals the power output in an ideal transformer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. the same.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
