                    "text": "So I've got this probability problem here, and I need to find the probability that three smaller segments formed by randomly choosing points A and B on a segment of length 10 can form a triangle. The options are 0, 10%, 25%, or 50%. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for three segments to form a triangle. I remember that for any three lengths to form a triangle, they have to satisfy the triangle inequality. That means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. So, if I have segments of lengths x, y, and z, then x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x must all be true.\n\nNow, in this problem, I have a segment of length 10, and I choose two random points A and B that divide it into three smaller segments. Let's denote the positions of A and B on the segment. Since the segment is of length 10, I can think of it as lying on a number line from 0 to 10. I'll let A be at position a and B be at position b, where a and b are random numbers between 0 and 10, and a < b without loss of generality.\n\nWait, actually, I should consider that A and B are chosen randomly without assuming which one is larger. But to make it easier, I can assume that a < b, and then double the probability at the end since the roles are symmetric. Or maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me think about the positions of A and B. Since they are chosen randomly on the segment, their positions can be any real numbers between 0 and 10, uniformly distributed and independently.\n\nThe three segments will have lengths:\n\n- From 0 to A: length a\n\n- From A to B: length b - a\n\n- From B to 10: length 10 - b\n\nSo, the three lengths are a, b - a, and 10 - b.\n\nNow, for these three lengths to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities:\n\n1. a + (b - a) > (10 - b)\n\n2. a + (10 - b) > (b - a)\n\n3. (b - a) + (10 - b) > a\n\nSimplifying these inequalities:\n\n1. a + b - a > 10 - b \u21d2 b > 10 - b \u21d2 2b > 10 \u21d2 b > 5\n\n2. a + 10 - b > b - a \u21d2 2a + 10 > 2b \u21d2 a + 5 > b\n\n3. b - a + 10 - b > a \u21d2 10 - a > a \u21d2 10 > 2a \u21d2 a < 5\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n- b > 5\n\n- b < a + 5\n\n- a < 5\n\nSince a < b, and a < 5, and b > 5, and b < a + 5.\n\nWait, but since a < 5 and b > 5, and b < a + 5, but a < 5, so a + 5 < 10, which is within the segment.\n\nI need to visualize this. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the unit square, but since the segment is of length 10, I need to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of a and b as points chosen uniformly at random in the 10x10 square, with a < b, so actually in the upper triangle where b > a.\n\nThen, the conditions are:\n\n- b > 5\n\n- b < a + 5\n\n- a < 5\n\nSo, in the a-b plane, with a ranging from 0 to 10 and b ranging from a to 10, I need to find the area where b > 5, b < a + 5, and a < 5.\n\nLet me sketch this region.\n\nFirst, the total possible area is the upper triangle where b > a, with a from 0 to 10 and b from a to 10. The area of this triangle is (10)(10)/2 = 50.\n\nNow, within this triangle, I need to find the area where:\n\n- b > 5\n\n- b < a + 5\n\n- a < 5\n\nSo, let's plot these inequalities.\n\nFirst, a < 5 means I'm only considering the left half of the a-b plane, from a=0 to a=5.\n\nThen, within this region, b > 5 and b < a + 5.\n\nSo, for a from 0 to 5, b must be greater than 5 and less than a + 5.\n\nLet's see, when a=0, b < 0 + 5 = 5, but also b > 5, which is impossible. So, for a=0, there is no valid b.\n\nWhen a=5, b < 5 + 5 = 10 and b > 5, so b from 5 to 10.\n\nFor a between 0 and 5, b must be greater than 5 and less than a + 5.\n\nSo, the lower bound for b is 5, and the upper bound is a + 5.\n\nBut remember that b must also be greater than a.\n\nSo, effectively, b ranges from max(a, 5) to a + 5.\n\nBut since a < 5, max(a, 5) = 5.\n\nTherefore, b ranges from 5 to a + 5.\n\nBut a is less than 5, so a + 5 is less than 10.\n\nTherefore, for each a from 0 to 5, b ranges from 5 to a + 5.\n\nNow, to find the area of this region.\n\nLet me set up the integral.\n\nThe area is the integral from a=0 to a=5 of (a + 5 - 5) da = integral from 0 to 5 of a da = [a^2/2] from 0 to 5 = 25/2 = 12.5.\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, no. The total possible area is 50, and the area where a < 5 and b > 5 and b < a + 5 is 12.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 12.5 / 50 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nBut let's double-check this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to think about this.\n\nI recall that for three segments to form a triangle, no one segment can be longer than the sum of the other two.\n\nIn this case, the longest segment cannot be longer than 5, because if any segment is longer than 5, the sum of the other two will be less than or equal to 5, and thus cannot form a triangle.\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nActually, in a triangle, no side can be longer than the sum of the other two.\n\nGiven that the total length is 10, if one segment is greater than 5, then the sum of the other two is less than 5, so they cannot form a triangle.\n\nTherefore, for the three segments to form a triangle, none of them can be longer than 5.\n\nSo, in other words, all three segments must be less than or equal to 5.\n\nGiven that, I need to find the probability that none of the three segments is longer than 5.\n\nNow, the three segments are a, b - a, and 10 - b.\n\nSo, I need:\n\na \u2264 5\n\nb - a \u2264 5\n\n10 - b \u2264 5\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\na \u2264 5\n\nb \u2264 a + 5\n\nb \u2265 5\n\nNow, since a and b are chosen uniformly at random with 0 \u2264 a < b \u2264 10, I need to find the area in the a-b plane where these inequalities hold.\n\nThis seems similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a geometric probability approach.\n\nImagine plotting a and b in a 10x10 square, with a on the x-axis and b on the y-axis, and only considering the region where a < b.\n\nThe total possible area is 50, as before.\n\nNow, the conditions are:\n\na \u2264 5\n\nb \u2264 a + 5\n\nb \u2265 5\n\nSo, the region where all three inequalities hold is the intersection of these areas.\n\nFrom before, the area is 12.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 12.5 / 50 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nBut let's see if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to approach this problem.\n\nI've heard of a problem where two points are chosen at random on a stick of unit length, and the probability that the three resulting pieces form a triangle is 25%.\n\nWait, that sounds familiar.\n\nIn fact, this seems to be a classic problem in probability.\n\nSo, if I recall correctly, the probability is indeed 25%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 25%.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nSuppose I fix one end of the segment at 0 and the other at 10.\n\nI choose two points A and B randomly between 0 and 10.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that A < B.\n\nThen, the three segments have lengths A, B - A, and 10 - B.\n\nFor these to form a triangle, as before, we need:\n\nA + (B - A) > (10 - B) \u21d2 B > 5\n\nA + (10 - B) > (B - A) \u21d2 2A + 10 > 2B \u21d2 A + 5 > B\n\n(B - A) + (10 - B) > A \u21d2 10 - A > A \u21d2 A < 5\n\nSo, A < 5, B > 5, and B < A + 5.\n\nGiven that A < B, and A < 5, and B > 5, and B < A + 5.\n\nNow, to find the probability, I can consider the sample space where A and B are chosen uniformly in the region where 0 \u2264 A < B \u2264 10.\n\nThe area of this region is 50, as calculated before.\n\nNow, the favorable region is where A < 5, B > 5, and B < A + 5.\n\nThis is a subset of the sample space.\n\nTo find its area, I can integrate over A from 0 to 5, and for each A, B ranges from 5 to A + 5, but ensuring that B \u2264 10.\n\nWait, when A < 5, A + 5 < 10, so B ranges from 5 to A + 5.\n\nTherefore, the area is the integral from A=0 to A=5 of (A + 5 - 5) dA = integral from 0 to 5 of A dA = [A^2/2] from 0 to 5 = 12.5.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 12.5 / 50 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the total length is 10, but the problem is scale-invariant, meaning that the probability should be the same regardless of the length of the segment, as long as it's positive.\n\nTherefore, I could assume without loss of generality that the segment has length 1, and scale up or down accordingly.\n\nIn that case, the probability remains 25%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 25%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any mistakes in this reasoning.\n\nOne potential source of error is in assuming that A < B, and then doubling the probability, but since I'm integrating over A < B, and considering that region, I don't need to double it.\n\nAnother potential error is in the limits of integration.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nFor A from 0 to 5, and B from 5 to A + 5, with A + 5 \u2264 10 (since A < 5, A + 5 < 10).\n\nWait, but when A approaches 5, A + 5 approaches 10, but since A < 5, A + 5 < 10.\n\nTherefore, B ranges from 5 to A + 5, which is less than 10.\n\nTherefore, the integral is correctly set up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it differently.\n\nSuppose I choose two points A and B independently and uniformly at random from [0,10], with A \u2260 B.\n\nThen, without loss of generality, assume A < B.\n\nThen, the probability is twice the probability with A < B.\n\nWait, no, in this case, since A and B are distinct, the probability is the same whether A < B or B < A, so I can just compute for A < B and then double it, but in this case, I'm already considering A < B.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the integration, I'm considering A from 0 to 5 and B from 5 to A + 5, given that A < B.\n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach using order statistics.\n\nIf I consider that A and B are two independent uniform random variables on [0,10], then the order statistics are A_(1) and A_(2), where A_(1) < A_(2).\n\nThen, A_(1) and A_(2) have known joint density functions.\n\nBut I think that would complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the differences between the points.\n\nBut I think the approach I took earlier is correct.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the probability is 25%.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 25%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 25\\%} \\]"
