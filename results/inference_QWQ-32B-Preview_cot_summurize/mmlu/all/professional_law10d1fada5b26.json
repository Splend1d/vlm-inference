                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. There's a pregnant woman sitting on her porch watching her husband mow the lawn. Her friend, who has known her for years, shows up with a pistol and threatens to kill the husband, knowing that the woman is watching. The woman gets really upset\u2014she's easily excitable, and she suffers severe emotional distress, which leads to a miscarriage.\n\nNow, the woman is suing her friend for mental anguish that caused her miscarriage. We need to figure out who will win based on the options given.\n\nOption A says she'll lose because the friend didn't intend for her to have a miscarriage. So, is intent necessary in these cases? In law, particularly in torts, intent can be a factor, but it's not always required. There's something called negligent infliction of emotional distress or intentional infliction of emotional distress. So, maybe intent isn't the only thing that matters.\n\nOption B says she'll lose because the friend's actions were directed at the husband, not her. Hmm, but she was the one who saw it and got distressed. Does the fact that the friend wasn't directly targeting her make a difference? Well, in some cases, third parties can sue for emotional distress even if they weren't the direct target, especially if they witnessed something harmful.\n\nOption C says she'll win because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman. This sounds like intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). For IIED, the conduct has to be extreme and outrageous, and cause severe emotional distress. Also, the plaintiff has to have been present and witnessed the event directly in some jurisdictions.\n\nOption D says she'll win because she's the husband's wife. Is there something special about being a spouse that allows her to sue in this situation? Maybe, because spouses have certain rights and duties towards each other.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend's conduct: threatening to kill the husband with a pistol, knowing that the woman is watching. That seems pretty extreme and outrageous. The friend also knew that the woman was easily excitable, which might suggest that the friend was aware that her actions could cause the woman distress.\n\nSecond, the woman suffered severe emotional distress, which led to a miscarriage. So, there's a direct link between the emotional distress and a physical consequence.\n\nNow, in law, for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, generally, the plaintiff has to show:\n\n1. The defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct.\n\n2. The defendant intended to cause emotional distress or knew that emotional distress was likely to result.\n\n3. The plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress.\n\n4. The defendant's conduct was the cause of the plaintiff's distress.\n\nIn this case:\n\n1. Threatening to kill someone with a pistol is certainly extreme and outrageous conduct.\n\n2. The friend knew the woman was watching and likely to be distressed, especially since she knew the woman was easily excitable.\n\n3. The woman suffered severe emotional distress and had a miscarriage.\n\n4. The friend's conduct directly caused the woman's distress, which in turn caused the miscarriage.\n\nSo, based on these elements, it seems like the woman could have a case for IIED.\n\nBut option A suggests she'll lose because the friend didn't intend for her to have a miscarriage. Intent can be specific intent (to cause a miscarriage) or general intent (to cause emotional distress). In IIED, it's usually sufficient if the defendant intended to cause emotional distress or knew that it was likely to occur.\n\nOption B says she'll lose because the friend's actions were directed against the husband, not her. But in IIED, the conduct doesn't have to be directly targeted at the plaintiff; witnessing extreme and outrageous conduct can be sufficient to cause emotional distress.\n\nOption C aligns with the elements of IIED: the friend's conduct was extreme and outrageous, and it was highly probable that it would cause emotional distress to the woman, given her known sensitivity.\n\nOption D suggests that being the husband's wife is the reason she'll win. While being a spouse might provide certain legal protections or rights, it's not the primary reason here. The primary reason is the friend's extreme conduct and its direct impact on the woman.\n\nSo, considering all this, option C seems to be the most accurate. The woman will win because it was highly probable that the friend's extreme and outrageous conduct would cause emotional distress to the woman.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something specific about pregnancy or the miscarriage that could affect the outcome.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, physical harm resulting from emotional distress is treated differently, especially if the plaintiff is pregnant. There might be cases where the emotional distress directly causes a miscarriage, and the law recognizes that as compensable.\n\nAdditionally, the friend knew about the woman's pregnancy and her sensitive nature, which could make the conduct even more outrageous and deliberate in terms of causing distress.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
