                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Thomas Henry Huxley's \"The Physical Basis of Life\" from 1868. He's talking about something called \"protoplasm,\" which is the scientific term for the substance that makes up living things. He mentions that the idea of a \"physical basis of life\" might be new to some people because many think of life as something that works through matter, like a force or energy that uses physical stuff to do its thing.\n\nHuxley seems to be challenging that view. He says that the matter of life breaks down into things like carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogenous compounds when it dies, and these are just ordinary matter without any special properties. So, from this, I need to figure out what Huxley was arguing about the nature of life.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. a force that works through matter\n\nB. essentially a philosophical notion\n\nC. merely a property of a certain kind of matter\n\nD. a supernatural phenomenon\n\nOption A sounds like the common conception he's referring to, where life is a force that works through matter. But he seems to be against that idea, so probably not his argument.\n\nOption B, life being a philosophical notion, doesn't seem to fit with his scientific approach. He's talking about matter and chemicals, so probably not that.\n\nOption C, life being merely a property of a certain kind of matter, aligns with his description of protoplasm and how it breaks down into ordinary matter. So, this might be his argument.\n\nOption D, a supernatural phenomenon, contradicts his scientific perspective. He's discussing chemical breakdowns, so unlikely.\n\nLet me think again. Huxley is known as \"Darwin's bulldog\" for his support of evolution, and he was a prominent scientist in the 19th century. His approach here seems materialistic, focusing on the physical components of life.\n\nHe mentions that some people think of life as something that works through matter, implying that he disagrees and prefers to see life in terms of the properties of matter itself.\n\nSo, his argument is likely that life is not some separate force or energy, but rather a manifestation of the properties of a specific kind of matter, which is protoplasm.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C. merely a property of a certain kind of matter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
