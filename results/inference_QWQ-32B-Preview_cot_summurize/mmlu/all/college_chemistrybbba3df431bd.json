The g-factor is given as 2.05.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), the energy splitting between the spin states is given by the Zeeman effect. For a free electron with g-factor \\( g \\), the energy difference between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin states in a magnetic field \\( B_0 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = g \\mu_B B_0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mu_B \\) is the Bohr magneton.\n\nThe relative occupancy of the two spin states can be described using the Boltzmann distribution:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k_B \\) is the Boltzmann constant and \\( T \\) is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nGiven that \\( g = 2.05 \\), \\( T = 300 \\) K, we need to find \\( \\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} \\) at L-band and W-band frequencies.\n\nFirst, we need to know the magnetic field strengths corresponding to L-band and W-band frequencies. Typically:\n\n- L-band corresponds to microwave frequencies around 1-2 GHz.\n\n- W-band corresponds to frequencies around 80-120 GHz.\n\nHowever, to find the magnetic field strengths, we can use the resonance condition for EPR:\n\n\\[\n\\nu = \\frac{g \\mu_B B_0}{h}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\nu \\) is the frequency and \\( h \\) is Planck's constant.\n\nRearranging for \\( B_0 \\):\n\n\\[\nB_0 = \\frac{h \\nu}{g \\mu_B}\n\\]\n\nBut to find \\( \\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} \\), we need \\( \\Delta E = g \\mu_B B_0 \\), which from the resonance condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = h \\nu\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the relative occupancy becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{h \\nu}{k_B T}}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's plug in the values for L-band and W-band.\n\nFirst, we need the values of the constants:\n\n- Planck's constant, \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\) J\u00b7s\n\n- Boltzmann constant, \\( k_B = 1.381 \\times 10^{-23} \\) J/K\n\n- Temperature, \\( T = 300 \\) K\n\nLet's assume typical frequencies for L-band and W-band:\n\n- L-band: \\( \\nu_L = 1 \\) GHz = \\( 1 \\times 10^9 \\) Hz\n\n- W-band: \\( \\nu_W = 95 \\) GHz = \\( 95 \\times 10^9 \\) Hz\n\nNow, calculate \\( \\frac{h \\nu}{k_B T} \\) for both bands.\n\nFor L-band:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h \\nu_L}{k_B T} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}) \\times (1 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Hz})}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times 300 \\, \\text{K}} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J}}{4.143 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 0.0016\n\\]\n\nFor W-band:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{h \\nu_W}{k_B T} = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J\u00b7s}) \\times (95 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Hz})}{(1.381 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J/K}) \\times 300 \\, \\text{K}} = \\frac{6.30 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}}{4.143 \\times 10^{-21} \\, \\text{J}} \\approx 0.0152\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( e^{-\\frac{h \\nu}{k_B T}} \\) for both bands.\n\nFor L-band:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-0.0016} \\approx 0.9984\n\\]\n\nFor W-band:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-0.0152} \\approx 0.9849\n\\]\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match these values exactly. Let's check if there was a mistake in assuming the frequencies for L-band and W-band.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intends to use the g-factor in the calculation differently. Let's consider the energy splitting:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = g \\mu_B B_0\n\\]\n\nBut from the resonance condition:\n\n\\[\n\\nu = \\frac{g \\mu_B B_0}{h} \\implies \\Delta E = h \\nu\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( \\Delta E \\) is directly proportional to the frequency.\n\nThus, the relative occupancy is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{h \\nu}{k_B T}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that, let's see if the options provided correspond to different frequencies or g-factors.\n\nOption A: 0.9800 at L-band and 0.9509 at W-band\n\nOption B: 0.9950 at L-band and 0.9609 at W-band\n\nOption C: 0.9910 at L-band and 0.9709 at W-band\n\nOption D: 0.9850 at L-band and 0.9809 at W-band\n\nComparing with our calculations:\n\nOur calculated values are approximately 0.9984 for L-band and 0.9849 for W-band.\n\nThese are closer to option B: 0.9950 at L-band and 0.9609 at W-band, but still not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g-factor affects the calculation differently. Let's consider that the g-factor modifies the energy splitting.\n\nGiven that \\( g = 2.05 \\), and the standard g-factor for an electron is approximately 2.0023. However, in many practical cases, g is taken as 2 for simplicity.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to use \\( g = 2.05 \\) in the calculation.\n\nWait, in the resonance condition:\n\n\\[\n\\nu = \\frac{g \\mu_B B_0}{h}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nB_0 = \\frac{h \\nu}{g \\mu_B}\n\\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = g \\mu_B B_0 = g \\mu_B \\left( \\frac{h \\nu}{g \\mu_B} \\right) = h \\nu\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( \\Delta E = h \\nu \\), regardless of g.\n\nTherefore, the relative occupancy remains:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{h \\nu}{k_B T}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the g-factor cancels out in this expression.\n\nThis suggests that our initial calculation is correct, and the relative occupancies should be very close to 1, especially at lower frequencies.\n\nHowever, since the options provided have lower values, perhaps there is a different approach or an additional factor to consider.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the population difference in the context of EPR, where the population difference between the spin states affects the EPR signal.\n\nBut based on the Boltzmann distribution, the relative occupancy should be as calculated.\n\nGiven that, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the effect of the g-factor on the magnetic field strength, thereby affecting the energy splitting.\n\nLet's try calculating the magnetic field strengths for L-band and W-band using the given g-factor.\n\nFor L-band, \\( \\nu_L = 1 \\) GHz:\n\n\\[\nB_{0L} = \\frac{h \\nu_L}{g \\mu_B} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 1 \\times 10^9}{2.05 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}} \\approx \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-25}}{1.901 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 0.0348 \\, \\text{T} = 348 \\, \\text{mT}\n\\]\n\nFor W-band, \\( \\nu_W = 95 \\) GHz:\n\n\\[\nB_{0W} = \\frac{h \\nu_W}{g \\mu_B} = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\times 95 \\times 10^9}{2.05 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24}} \\approx \\frac{6.30 \\times 10^{-23}}{1.901 \\times 10^{-23}} \\approx 3.31 \\, \\text{T}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate \\( \\Delta E \\) using these magnetic fields:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E = g \\mu_B B_0\n\\]\n\nFor L-band:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_L = 2.05 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times 0.348 \\approx 2.05 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times 0.348 \\approx 6.62 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nFor W-band:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta E_W = 2.05 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times 3.31 \\approx 2.05 \\times 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\times 3.31 \\approx 6.30 \\times 10^{-23} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the relative occupancies:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}}\n\\]\n\nFor L-band:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{6.62 \\times 10^{-25}}{4.143 \\times 10^{-21}}} = e^{-0.0016} \\approx 0.9984\n\\]\n\nFor W-band:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} = e^{-\\frac{6.30 \\times 10^{-23}}{4.143 \\times 10^{-21}}} = e^{-0.0152} \\approx 0.9849\n\\]\n\nThese values are the same as before, suggesting that the g-factor cancels out in the calculation of relative occupancy.\n\nGiven that, it seems there might be an error in the options provided or in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the hyperfine splitting or other factors, but that seems unlikely based on the information given.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering the ratio of populations in the context of EPR intensity, which can be related to the population difference.\n\nThe EPR signal intensity is proportional to the population difference between the spin states:\n\n\\[\nN_\\beta - N_\\alpha\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( N_\\alpha + N_\\beta = N \\), the total number of molecules, then:\n\n\\[\nN_\\beta - N_\\alpha = N \\left( \\frac{e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}} - e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}}}{e^{\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}} + e^{-\\frac{\\Delta E}{k_B T}}} \\right) = N \\tanh\\left( \\frac{\\Delta E}{2 k_B T} \\right)\n\\]\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the relative occupancies \\( \\frac{N_\\alpha}{N_\\beta} \\), not the population difference.\n\nGiven that, and based on the calculations above, the relative occupancies should be very close to 1, with small differences due to the energy splitting.\n\nGiven the options provided, none of them match our calculations exactly, but option B (0.9950 at L-band and 0.9609 at W-band) is closer to our calculated values of approximately 0.9984 and 0.9849.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a discrepancy, possibly due to different assumptions about frequency or g-factor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misinterpretation of the g-factor's role in the energy splitting.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I will select option B as the closest match, but I encourage double-checking the calculations and assumptions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
