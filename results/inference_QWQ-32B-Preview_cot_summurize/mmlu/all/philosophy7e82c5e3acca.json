The options are:\n\nA. often permissible if done for the right reasons.\n\nB. not evil in itself, although it can have bad consequences.\n\nC. permissible only in very rare circumstances.\n\nD. never permissible.\n\nI remember that Augustine was a pretty strict guy when it came to moral issues, so I'm guessing he might have a strong stance against lying. But let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Augustine actually believed about lying. I know he was a prominent Church Father and his thoughts on morality are quite influential. From what I remember, Augustine held that truth is essential and that lying goes against the nature of truth.\n\nLet me consider option A: \"often permissible if done for the right reasons.\" This seems too lenient for Augustine. If he believed that lying is often okay, then it wouldn't align with his emphasis on truth. So, maybe this isn't the correct answer.\n\nOption B says: \"not evil in itself, although it can have bad consequences.\" Hmm, this might be closer. Maybe Augustine thought that lying isn't inherently evil but can lead to evil outcomes. But I think he would see lying as inherently wrong because it involves deceit, which is contrary to moral virtue.\n\nOption C: \"permissible only in very rare circumstances.\" This could be a possibility. Perhaps Augustine allowed for lying in extreme cases, like saving a life. That would make sense in some contexts, but I'm not sure about Augustine's specific position.\n\nOption D: \"never permissible.\" This seems in line with his strict moral standards. If he believed that lying is always wrong, regardless of the circumstances, then this would be the answer.\n\nTo make sure, I should think about any specific examples or quotes from Augustine that might help clarify his view. I recall that there was a famous case where a bishop lied to protect someone, and Augustine responded to that situation. In his letter to Bishop Alypius, Augustine discussed whether it was acceptable to lie to protect the innocent. His response was that lying is never acceptable, even in such circumstances.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems that Augustine believed lying is never permissible. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there are other instances where he allowed for lying. For example, in medical contexts or to prevent greater evils. If there are such cases, then option C might be more appropriate.\n\nAfter thinking about it, I don't recall any instances where Augustine permitted lying, even in difficult situations. He seemed to hold that truth is paramount and that lying is always wrong.\n\nMoreover, Augustine's philosophical and theological framework emphasizes the importance of truth and integrity. Lying would go against the virtue of honesty and the nature of God, who is truth itself.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is D: never permissible.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
