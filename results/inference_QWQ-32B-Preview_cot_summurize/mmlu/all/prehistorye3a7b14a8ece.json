                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the spear-thrower and why it was a useful innovation, and also when it dates back to. There are four options, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a spear-thrower is. From what I know, a spear-thrower, also known as an atlatl, is a tool that extends the arm's length, allowing a person to throw a spear with greater force and accuracy. It's like an extension of the arm that increases the leverage and thus the power behind the throw.\n\nOption A says that it made warfare so deadly that it became obsolete beginning in the Middle Paleolithic and Middle Stone Age. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If the spear-thrower was so effective, why would it become obsolete so early? Actually, I think the atlatl was used much later than the Middle Paleolithic. I believe it was more prominent in the Upper Paleolithic and beyond.\n\nOption B mentions that it allowed artistic expression by hunters beginning in the Middle Paleolithic and Middle Stone Age. Artistic expression? I don't recall anything about spear-throwers being related to art. Maybe hunters used them to hunt animals, which they then painted on cave walls, but the spear-thrower itself isn't directly related to artistic expression. This option seems off.\n\nOption C says it launched larger spears more quickly and more frequently beginning in the Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age. Hmm, larger spears, more quickly and more frequently. That sounds plausible because the atlatl does allow for throwing spears with more force, but I'm not sure about launching them more frequently. Maybe it allowed for quicker throwing, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D states that it launched projectiles with greater force and accuracy beginning in the Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age. This aligns with what I know about atlatls. They provide more force and better accuracy to the\u6295\u63b7\u7684spear.\n\nNow, considering the time periods mentioned. The Middle Paleolithic is around 300,000 to 50,000 years ago, and the Upper Paleolithic is from about 50,000 to 10,000 years ago. The Middle Stone Age in Africa corresponds roughly to the Middle Paleolithic, and the Late Stone Age corresponds to the Upper Paleolithic.\n\nGiven that, I think the spear-thrower, or atlatl, was developed later, during the Upper Paleolithic, which is option C and D. Option A mentions it becoming obsolete in the Middle Paleolithic, which doesn't make sense if it was developed later. Option B ties it to artistic expression, which seems unrelated.\n\nBetween options C and D, both mention the Upper Paleolithic and Late Stone Age, which matches what I know. Now, to choose between them:\n\nOption C says it launched larger spears more quickly and more frequently.\n\nOption D says it launched projectiles with greater force and accuracy.\n\nI think option D is more accurate. The atlatl allows for greater force and accuracy in throwing spears, but it doesn't necessarily mean it launches larger spears more quickly and more frequently. In fact, using an atlatl might require more time to load and throw compared to just throwing a spear by hand.\n\nSo, I think option D is the better choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
