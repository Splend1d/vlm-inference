                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is about. So, there's an author who wrote a novel called Quiet Winter, and he adapted it into a screenplay. He wrote down that he was assigning 25% of any future royalties from that screenplay to his friend. This friend had supported him financially when he was starting out as a writer.\n\nThen,\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f, the author died in a car accident shortly after finishing the screenplay. After that, a movie studio bought the screenplay from the executors of the author's estate and made a movie called Quiet Winter, which was a big success.\n\nNow, the friend is suing the executors of the author's estate to get her share of the movie royalties, which is 25%. The question is, will she most likely win or lose, and why?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Lose, because under the circumstances an assignment of future rights is unenforceable.\n\nB. Lose, because the attempted gift of royalties failed for non-delivery.\n\nC. Win, because she was an intended beneficiary.\n\nD. Win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an assignment is in legal terms. An assignment is when someone transfers their rights or interests in something to someone else. In this case, the author is assigning 25% of future royalties to his friend.\n\nNow, future royalties are basically money that will come in the future from the screenplay, depending on whether it's made into a movie or a play. So, these are future earnings.\n\nI need to think about whether assigning future rights like this is enforceable. From what I know, assignments of future rights can be enforceable, but there might be some conditions or limitations.\n\nOption A says she will lose because the assignment of future rights is unenforceable. But option D says she will win because the assignment of future rights is enforceable. So, these are directly opposed.\n\nOption B says she will lose because the attempted gift failed for non-delivery. Hmm, is this assignment considered a gift? Well, the friend did subsidize the author earlier, so maybe it's more like a payment or compensation for that earlier support rather than a gift. But legally, if he's assigning a portion of future royalties to her, it could be seen as a gift.\n\nOption C says she will win because she's an intended beneficiary. This might relate to contract law, where sometimes third parties can enforce contracts if they are intended beneficiaries.\n\nLet me consider the facts again. The author assigned 25% of future royalties to his friend in writing. He died after completing the screenplay, and then the screenplay was sold to a movie studio, which made a successful movie.\n\nSo, the friend is claiming her share of the royalties based on the assignment made by the author before he died.\n\nNow, since the author is dead, the executors of his estate are handling his affairs, including selling the screenplay.\n\nThe question is whether the friend can enforce her right to 25% of the royalties against the executors.\n\nFirst, was the assignment valid? Well, it was in writing, which is good. Assignments are generally enforceable if they're properly executed.\n\nBut these are future royalties. Maybe there was uncertainty about whether the screenplay would ever be produced into a movie or play. However, it turned out it was made into a movie, so the royalties materialized.\n\nI think the key here is whether the assignment of future royalties is enforceable. If it is, then the friend should be entitled to her share.\n\nOption A says it's unenforceable, but option D says it's enforceable. Which one is correct?\n\nI recall that assignments of future expectations can be problematic because the assignor might not have a present right to assign. But in this case, the author had the right to the royalties from the screenplay, and he was assigning a portion of that to his friend.\n\nMoreover, the assignment was in writing, which adds to its enforceability.\n\nAlso, the friend was relying on this assignment, as she had subsidized the author earlier, expecting to get this portion of the royalties in return.\n\nSo, it seems like the assignment should be enforceable.\n\nOption B mentions that the gift failed for non-delivery. But I'm not sure if this is the right way to look at it. If it's considered a gift, then perhaps the delivery of the assignment would be sufficient, even if the royalties haven't been delivered yet.\n\nBut perhaps I'm complicating it.\n\nOption C says she's an intended beneficiary. In contract law, third-party beneficiaries can have rights to enforce contracts if they are intended beneficiaries.\n\nHere, the author and his friend had an agreement: the friend would get 25% of future royalties.\n\nSo, maybe the friend is an intended beneficiary of the agreement between the author and whomever he had contracts with regarding the screenplay.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assignment creates an interest in the royalties that the friend can enforce.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the most likely correct answer: she will win because the assignment of future rights is enforceable.\n\nThe executors of the estate would be bound by the valid assignment made by the author before his death.\n\nTherefore, the friend should be entitled to her 25% of the movie royalties.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) win, because the assignment of future rights is enforceable."
