It's about someone who's rejecting the dominant culture and really believes positively in the minority culture, and it's asking which stage they're in according to Atkinson, Morten, and Sue. The options are Conformity, Dissonance, Resistance and Immersion, and Introspection.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these stages means in their model. Let me think:\n\n1. **Conformity**: This is usually the earliest stage where a person identifies strongly with the dominant culture and may have negative views or stereotypes about their own minority culture.\n\n2. **Dissonance**: In this stage, there's a kind of conflict or discomfort with the dominant culture's values and beliefs, especially if they clash with the individual's own experiences or emerging sense of self.\n\n3. **Resistance and Immersion**: Here, the person starts to reject the dominant culture and immerses themselves in their own minority culture, often developing a strong positive identity within that culture.\n\n4. **Introspection**: This stage involves a deeper self-examination and a more nuanced understanding of both the dominant and minority cultures, leading to a more integrated sense of identity.\n\nGiven that the question describes someone who is actively rejecting the dominant culture and holding rigid, positive beliefs about the minority culture, it sounds like they're in the Resistance and Immersion stage. This makes sense because in this stage, people often swing to the other extreme, embracing their minority culture fully and sometimes rejecting aspects of the dominant culture.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure:\n\n- **Conformity**: This doesn't fit because in conformity, people are aligning with the dominant culture, not rejecting it.\n\n- **Dissonance**: This stage is more about internal conflict and discomfort, not yet about actively rejecting the dominant culture.\n\n- **Introspection**: This seems too advanced because it involves a more nuanced and integrated view, whereas the description mentions rigid beliefs, which might be more characteristic of the Resistance and Immersion stage.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is C. Resistance and immersion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
