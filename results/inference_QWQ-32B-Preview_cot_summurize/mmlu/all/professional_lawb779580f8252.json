                    "text": "This question is about whether an attorney can collect payment from a client for services rendered when there wasn't a formal agreement in place. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the situation:\n\n- The attorney has just finished drafting a will for a client.\n\n- The client sends a note to the attorney, asking if a contract of sale for their boat complies with state law. The client mentions they're leaving town and will be back next week.\n\n- The attorney reviews the document and writes a one-page letter stating that the document complies with state law.\n\n- The attorney bills the client $500, which is a reasonable fee.\n\n- The client refuses to pay, arguing that they never agreed to retain the attorney for this service and that they received nothing of value since the sales transaction wasn't concluded.\n\nThe question is, if the attorney sues the client for $500, is the attorney likely to prevail?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because even if the parties had an agreement, that agreement was discharged under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n\nB. No, because the attorney and the client never agreed on the essential terms of a contract.\n\nC. Yes, because the attorney took action on the client's note to his detriment.\n\nD. Yes, because the client's note and the attorney's performance created an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: frustration of purpose. This is a doctrine in contract law where an unforeseen event occurs after the contract is formed, which undermines the key purpose of the contract, making the performance pointless for one party. In this case, there's no mention of any unforeseen event that frustrated the purpose of the agreement. The sales transaction not being concluded might be relevant, but it's not directly related to frustration of purpose. So, option A seems less likely.\n\nOption B suggests that there was no agreement on essential terms. This could be plausible if there was no meeting of the minds regarding the scope of services or the fee. However, the attorney did provide a service (reviewing the document and providing an opinion), and billed a reasonable fee. So, while there might not have been a formal agreement, there could still be an implied contract.\n\nOption C mentions that the attorney took action to his detriment. This could relate to the concept of promissory estoppel, where a party relies on a promise to their detriment. However, promissory estoppel is not directly mentioned in the options, and it's not clear if the attorney relied on the client's note in a way that constitutes detriment.\n\nOption D proposes that there's an implied-in-fact contract based on the client's note and the attorney's performance. An implied-in-fact contract is one where the terms are not expressed in words but are inferred from the actions of the parties.\n\nGiven that, I think option D is the strongest. The client sought the attorney's advice on a legal matter (the boat sale contract), and the attorney provided that advice. Even without a formal agreement, their actions suggest an implied contract where the attorney would provide legal services in exchange for a reasonable fee.\n\nThe client's argument that they never agreed to retain the attorney for this service might hold some weight, but in practice, attorneys often provide informal advice to clients, and it's reasonable to expect compensation for that service, especially if it's within the attorney's area of expertise.\n\nMoreover, the attorney billed a reasonable fee, which suggests that the charge is commensurate with the service provided.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the attorney would prevail in court, as there was an implied-in-fact contract based on the client's request and the attorney's performance.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
