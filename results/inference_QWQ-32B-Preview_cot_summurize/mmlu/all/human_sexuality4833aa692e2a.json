Lactiferous duct, C. Lactiferous sinus, and D. Dartos muscle.\n\nFirst, I know that the breast is mainly composed of glandular tissue and fatty tissue. The glandular part is responsible for milk production and secretion, especially during lactation.\n\nStarting with option A, the breast lobule. I recall that lobules are the small sacs within the breast where milk is produced. So, that seems to be a part of the breast's internal structure.\n\nOption B is the lactiferous duct. I think these are the tiny tubes that carry milk from the lobules to the nipple. So, that should also be a part of the breast's internal structure.\n\nOption C is the lactiferous sinus. I'm not entirely sure about this one. I think it might be related to a space where milk accumulates before being expressed through the nipple. But I'm not completely sure.\n\nOption D is the dartos muscle. Hmm, I've heard of dartos fascia or dartos muscle in relation to the scrotum in males, but I'm not sure if it's present in the female breast.\n\nMaybe I should look up some information about the anatomy of the female breast to confirm.\n\nAlright, from what I'm reading, the female breast consists of adipose tissue, glandular tissue, and fibrous connective tissue. The glandular tissue is made up of lobes, which are further divided into lobules, and these lobules contain alveoli where milk is produced.\n\nThe milk then travels through lactiferous ducts, which lead to the nipple. Some sources mention lactiferous sinuses as widened areas of the ducts near the nipple where milk can collect.\n\nNow, about the dartos muscle, it seems to be a layer of smooth muscle found in the scrotum of males, helping to regulate temperature for sperm production. I don't see any mention of dartos muscle being part of the female breast structure.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like options A, B, and C are all parts of the female breast's internal structure, while option D, the dartos muscle, is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Dartos muscle.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\n- Breast lobule: part of the glandular tissue for milk production.\n\n- Lactiferous duct: carries milk from lobules to the nipple.\n\n- Lactiferous sinus: a widened part of the lactiferous duct near the nipple.\n\n- Dartos muscle: related to the scrotum in males, not part of the female breast.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
