                    "text": "Let's see. Tisha's riddle says: \"I have 2 faces, no vertices, and I can roll. What am I?\" And the options are a cone, a cylinder, a sphere, or a prism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these shapes looks like and see which one matches the clues.\n\nStarting with the number of faces:\n\n- A cone has one flat face (the base) and one curved face. So that's two faces.\n\n- A cylinder has two flat faces (the top and bottom) and one curved face. So that's three faces.\n\n- A sphere has one curved face.\n\n- A prism has multiple flat faces depending on its type, like a cube has six faces.\n\nBut the riddle says \"2 faces,\" so the cylinder and prism have more than two faces, and the sphere has only one. So, the cone seems to match the two faces.\n\nNext, \"no vertices.\" A vertex is a point where edges meet, like the tip of a cone or the corners of a prism.\n\n- A cone has one vertex at its tip.\n\n- A cylinder has no vertices because it has no points; it's just two circles connected by a curved surface.\n\n- A sphere has no vertices.\n\n- A prism has vertices at the corners.\n\nSo, according to this, neither the cone nor the prism have no vertices, but the cylinder and sphere do.\n\nWait, but the cone has a vertex. So, if the riddle says \"no vertices,\" the cone doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nLet me look up what a face is in geometry to make sure I'm understanding correctly.\n\nA face is a flat surface on a 3D shape. So, in that case:\n\n- Cone: one flat face (the base), one curved face.\n\n- Cylinder: two flat faces (top and bottom), one curved face.\n\n- Sphere: one curved face.\n\n- Prism: all flat faces, depending on the type.\n\nSo, if it's defined as flat faces, then:\n\n- Cone: 1 flat face\n\n- Cylinder: 2 flat faces\n\n- Sphere: 0 flat faces\n\n- Prism: multiple flat faces\n\nBut the riddle says \"2 faces.\" So, the cylinder has 2 flat faces.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cylinder has 3 faces: top, bottom, and curved. But if we're only counting flat faces, then it has 2 flat faces and one curved face.\n\nSimilarly, the cone has 1 flat face and one curved face.\n\nThe sphere has one curved face.\n\nThe prism has only flat faces.\n\nSo, based on \"2 faces,\" it should be the cylinder.\n\nBut wait, the riddle also says \"no vertices.\"\n\n- Cone: 1 vertex\n\n- Cylinder: 0 vertices\n\n- Sphere: 0 vertices\n\n- Prism: multiple vertices\n\nSo, both cylinder and sphere have no vertices.\n\nBut the cylinder has 2 flat faces, and the sphere has no flat faces.\n\nSo, according to the riddle, \"2 faces, no vertices, and I can roll.\"\n\nSphere can definitely roll, cylinder can also roll.\n\nBut the sphere has only one curved face, which might not count as two faces.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the cylinder has two flat faces and one curved face, but the riddle might be considering only flat faces as \"faces.\"\n\nSo, if \"faces\" means flat surfaces, then the cylinder has two faces, no vertices, and can roll.\n\nThe sphere has no flat faces, only one curved face, no vertices, and can roll.\n\nBut the riddle specifies \"2 faces,\" which the sphere doesn't have.\n\nSo, perhaps it's the cylinder.\n\nBut let's check the cone again.\n\nCones can also roll, but they have one flat face and one curved face, and one vertex.\n\nBut the riddle says \"no vertices,\" so cone is out.\n\nPrism has multiple flat faces and vertices, so that's out.\n\nSo, between cylinder and sphere, only the cylinder has two flat faces and no vertices, and can roll.\n\nSphere has no flat faces, but can roll.\n\nBut the riddle specifies \"2 faces,\" which likely means flat faces.\n\nSo, the answer should be the cylinder.\n\nBut let's see the options again:\n\nA. cone\n\nB. cylinder\n\nC. sphere\n\nD. prism\n\nSo, B. cylinder seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources might consider curved surfaces as faces, others might not.\n\nMaybe I should look up the definitions.\n\nIn geometry, a face is a flat surface of a solid object.\n\nSo, in that case, the cylinder has two faces: the top and bottom circles.\n\nThe cone has one face: the base.\n\nThe sphere has no faces, as it has a curved surface without any flat parts.\n\nThe prism has multiple flat faces.\n\nSo, based on this, the cylinder is the only one with exactly two flat faces, no vertices, and it can roll.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. cylinder.\n\nBut let's think about it again.\n\nIf the riddle says \"I can roll,\" both cylinder and sphere can roll.\n\nBut the sphere has no flat faces, so it doesn't have two faces.\n\nCylinder has two flat faces and can roll.\n\nSo, it fits all the criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. cylinder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
