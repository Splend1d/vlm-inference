                    "text": "Neandertals are associated with the Mousterian tool technology. So, the correct answer is C. Mousterian.\n\nTo provide some context, Neandertals lived in Europe and parts of Asia from about 400,000 years ago until they went extinct around 40,000 years ago. During this time, they developed a specific type of stone tool culture known as the Mousterian industry.\n\nThe Mousterian tool kit includes a variety of tools such as scrapers, points, and hand axes, which were made using a technique called the Levallois method. This method allowed for the production of flakes of a predetermined size and shape, making tool production more efficient.\n\nNow, let's look at the other options to understand why they are not correct:\n\nA. Aurignacian: This tool culture is associated with early modern humans, not Neandertals. The Aurignacian industry emerged around 43,000 years ago and is characterized by a wide range of tools, including blades and bone tools. It's linked to the arrival of anatomically modern humans in Europe.\n\nB. Acheulean: This is an older tool tradition that dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period, around 1.76 million to 100,000 years ago. It's most famously associated with Homo erectus and early Homo sapiens. Acheulean tools are characterized by large bifacial hand axes.\n\nD. Both B and C: Since Acheulean is not associated with Neandertals, this option is incorrect.\n\nSo, to summarize, Neandertals are primarily associated with the Mousterian tool technology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
