                    "text": "To determine which of these goods is likely to have the most elastic demand curve, we need to understand the concept of price elasticity of demand. Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nGenerally, the more substitutes a good has, the more elastic its demand is. This is because if the price of a good increases, consumers can easily switch to alternative products. Conversely, if a good has few or no substitutes, its demand is likely to be inelastic, meaning that changes in price have less impact on the quantity demanded.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Demand for white Ford minivans\n\nFord minivans are a specific type of vehicle, and specifying that they are white makes it even more specific. There are many substitutes for white Ford minivans, such as minivans from other manufacturers (like Chrysler, Honda, Toyota), as well as other types of vehicles like SUVs, vans, or even cars, depending on the consumer's needs. Additionally, used minivans can also be substitutes for new ones. Therefore, the demand for white Ford minivans is likely to be highly elastic because consumers have many alternatives to choose from if the price changes.\n\nB. Demand for automobiles\n\nThis category is much broader, encompassing all types of cars, trucks, SUVs, etc., from various manufacturers. While there are substitutes for automobiles, such as public transportation, biking, or walking, these alternatives may not be viable for all consumers, especially those who rely on cars for work or family needs. Therefore, the demand for automobiles as a whole might be less elastic than that for a specific type of vehicle.\n\nC. Demand for Ford automobiles\n\nThis option is narrower than B but broader than A. It includes all Ford vehicles, not just minivans. Ford makes a variety of vehicles, so if the price of Ford vehicles increases, consumers can switch to other manufacturers. However, some consumers may be loyal to the Ford brand or prefer its specific features, which could make the demand less elastic compared to a specific model.\n\nD. Demand for American-made automobiles\n\nThis category includes all vehicles manufactured in the United States, which would include brands like Ford, GM, Chrysler, etc. Again, while there are substitutes from foreign manufacturers, some consumers may prefer American-made products for various reasons, such as supporting the domestic economy. Therefore, the demand might be less elastic than for a specific brand or model.\n\nComparing all these options, the demand for white Ford minivans (option A) is likely to be the most elastic because it is the most specific and has the most substitutes. Consumers can easily switch to other colors, other Ford models, other manufacturers' minivans, or even different types of vehicles if the price changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
