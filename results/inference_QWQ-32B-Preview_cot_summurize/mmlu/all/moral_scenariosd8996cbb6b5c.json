Well, picking mushrooms in the forest could be acceptable if it's allowed in that area and you're not damaging the environment. But maybe there are rules about picking mushrooms in certain forests. However, without specific information that it's forbidden, it seems generally not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I drove my car off the bridge with my family inside.\" This sounds very serious. Driving a car off a bridge with family inside would likely cause harm or death to the family members. That seems clearly morally wrong because it endangers lives intentionally.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong (unless specified otherwise)\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the forest is a protected area and picking mushrooms is prohibited, then it could be considered wrong. But in general, without that context, it's not clearly wrong.\n\nScenario 2 involves putting family members in grave danger, which is clearly wrong.\n\nSo, yes, C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
