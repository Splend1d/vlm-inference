The scenarios are:\n\n1. I put some expired food into the garbage disposal.\n\n2. I clipped her baby's fingernails and toenails.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: putting expired food into the garbage disposal.\n\nExpired food can be tricky. Sometimes, food past its expiration date is still safe to eat, but other times, it's not. Disposing of it in the garbage disposal might not be the best environmental choice, but morally wrong? Hmm.\n\nIn the US, moral standards generally don't consider disposing of expired food in the garbage disposal as morally wrong. It's more of a practical or environmental issue. So, I think this is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: clipping a baby's fingernails and toenails.\n\nClipping a baby's nails is a common practice to prevent them from scratching themselves or others. It's a caretaking activity. Is there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, if done properly, with care, and without harming the baby, it's not wrong. In fact, it's a responsible thing to do. So, this should also be not wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are not morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, could there be a moral issue if the expired food is being disposed of instead of given to someone in need? Well, that might be a consideration, but generally, disposing of expired food that's no longer safe to eat isn't considered morally wrong. It's expected that people handle expired food appropriately.\n\nFor Scenario 2, clipping a baby's nails is standard care. As long as it's done carefully and doesn't hurt the baby, it's fine. If someone were to clip the nails too short or cut the baby, that could be problematic, but assuming it's done properly, it's not wrong.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
