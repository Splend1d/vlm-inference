But then, they found tasks that required the efforts of all the children, and that helped to lessen the hostility. I need to figure out which of these options best describes this approach: integrative demands, superordinate goals, threat reduction, or intergroup contact.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\n**Integrative demands:** This sounds like tasks or situations that require cooperation between groups. Maybe it's about bringing groups together to work towards a common goal.\n\n**Superordinate goals:** I think this refers to goals that are so important that they override smaller group interests. So, if there's a big goal that affects everyone, groups might put aside their differences to achieve it.\n\n**Threat reduction:** This seems straightforward. It's about reducing feelings of threat or danger between groups. Maybe by showing that the other group isn't really a threat, or by making the environment safer.\n\n**Intergroup contact:** This is when members of different groups interact with each other. Maybe through communication, shared activities, etc., to improve relations.\n\nNow, in the study, they found tasks that required all children's efforts. So, it's about creating situations where all the children need to work together. That sounds a lot like integrative demands, where cooperation is necessary.\n\nBut wait, superordinate goals also involve working towards a common goal that overrides group differences. So, is there a difference between integrative demands and superordinate goals?\n\nMaybe integrative demands are more about the process of working together, while superordinate goals are about the end goal that benefits everyone.\n\nIn this case, the focus is on tasks that require all children's efforts, which seems more process-oriented. So, integrative demands might be the better fit.\n\nThreat reduction could be a result of this approach, but it's not the approach itself. And intergroup contact is more about interaction between groups, not necessarily about working together on tasks.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. integrative demands.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIntegrative demands are situations where groups need to work together to achieve a goal that cannot be achieved by any one group alone. This requires cooperation and can reduce intergroup hostility by fostering positive interdependence.\n\nSuperordinate goals are higher-level goals that cut across group boundaries and require cooperation among groups to be achieved.\n\nIn this study, the tasks required the efforts of all children, which sounds like integrative demands, as they need to cooperate directly to complete the tasks.\n\nSo, yeah, I think A. integrative demands is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
