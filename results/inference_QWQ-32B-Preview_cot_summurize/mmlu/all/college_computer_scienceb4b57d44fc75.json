                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this question about directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs for short. The graph G has vertices V and edges E, and it's finite with at least one edge. The question is asking which of the statements I, II, or III must be true for such a graph.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what a directed acyclic graph is. A DAG is a directed graph with no directed cycles, meaning there's no way to start at a vertex and follow a sequence of edges that loops back to the same vertex.\n\nOkay, let's look at statement I: \"G has a vertex with no incoming edge.\" Is this always true in a DAG with at least one edge?\n\nWell, in a DAG, since there are no cycles, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges. This is because in a directed graph without cycles, there's a notion of a \"starting point\" where no edges are pointing to it. If every vertex had at least one incoming edge, there would be a cycle, which contradicts the acyclic property.\n\nSo, I think statement I must be true.\n\nNow, statement II: \"G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.\" Does a DAG always have a vertex with no outgoing edges?\n\nAgain, considering the acyclic nature of the graph, there must be some vertices where the direction of edges doesn't lead to further vertices. These would be vertices with no outgoing edges, or \"sink\" vertices.\n\nIn fact, in any DAG, there must be at least one vertex with no outgoing edges, similar to how there's at least one vertex with no incoming edges. This is because if every vertex had at least one outgoing edge, you could potentially form a cycle, which isn't allowed in a DAG.\n\nTherefore, statement II must also be true.\n\nStatement III: \"G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge.\"\n\nIs this necessarily true in a DAG with at least one edge?\n\nWell, an isolated vertex has no edges connected to it at all, neither incoming nor outgoing. But the graph has at least one edge, so not all vertices can be isolated.\n\nHowever, it's possible to have a DAG where every vertex has either an incoming edge or an outgoing edge or both, but not necessarily a vertex with neither.\n\nFor example, consider a simple DAG with two vertices, A and B, and a single edge from A to B. In this case, A has an outgoing edge, and B has an incoming edge. There are no isolated vertices.\n\nSo, statement III is not necessarily true for all DAGs with at least one edge.\n\nTherefore, only statements I and II must be true, while statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. I and II only\n\nIt seems that D is the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIs there any DAG with at least one edge where statement I or statement II doesn't hold?\n\nLet's try to find a counterexample for statement I.\n\nSuppose we have a DAG where every vertex has at least one incoming edge. But in such a case, wouldn't there be a cycle? Because if every vertex has an incoming edge, you can follow the edges backwards indefinitely, which in a finite graph would eventually lead to a cycle.\n\nWait, but in a DAG, there are no cycles, so there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges to break this cycle formation.\n\nSimilarly, for statement II, if every vertex has at least one outgoing edge, again, in a finite graph, this would lead to a cycle, which contradicts the acyclic property.\n\nTherefore, both statements I and II must be true for any DAG with at least one edge, while statement III is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. I and II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
