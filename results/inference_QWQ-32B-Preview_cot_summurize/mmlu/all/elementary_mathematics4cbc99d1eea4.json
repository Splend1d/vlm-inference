                    "text": "So I have this multiplication problem: negative 8 multiplied by negative 4. I need to find the product and choose the correct answer from these options: A. negative 4, B. 4, C. 32, D. negative 32.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive. So, negative times negative equals positive. That's a rule I learned in math.\n\nLet me verify that. If I have -8 times -4, since both numbers are negative, their product should be positive. So, the answer should be positive 32.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Sometimes I get confused with the signs. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, multiplication of signs:\n\n- Positive times positive equals positive.\n\n- Positive times negative equals negative.\n\n- Negative times positive equals negative.\n\n- Negative times negative equals positive.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, -8 times -4 should be positive 32.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nA. -4\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 32\n\nD. -32\n\nSo, 32 is option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nI know that 8 times 4 is 32. Since both numbers are negative, the result is positive 32.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as -8 multiplied by -4 is the same as 8 multiplied by 4, which is 32.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the multiplication as repeated addition. But with negatives, it's a bit tricky.\n\nFor example, -8 multiplied by -4 can be thought of as the opposite of -8 multiplied by 4.\n\n-8 times 4 is -32, and since we have negative 4, it's the opposite, which is positive 32.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the concept that multiplying two negatives gives a positive because negating a negative amount turns it positive.\n\nSo, in this case, negating -8 four times would involve turning it positive.\n\nWait, maybe that's confusing.\n\nLet me consider another approach. I can use the distributive property.\n\nSuppose I have -8 times -4. I can think of -4 as -4 = -1 times 4.\n\nSo, -8 times -4 = -8 times (-1 times 4) = (-8 times -1) times 4.\n\nNow, -8 times -1 is 8, because negative times negative is positive.\n\nThen, 8 times 4 is 32.\n\nSo, again, I get 32.\n\nAlright, that reinforces my earlier conclusion.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe using real-world examples.\n\nSuppose I have a debt of 8 dollars, and someone cancels my debt four times over.\n\nWell, that's a bit abstract, but essentially, removing a negative is positive.\n\nSo, if I have a negative amount and it's removed multiple times, it should result in a positive outcome.\n\nYes, that aligns with the mathematical rule.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, C. 32 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nOption A: -4. That's too small, and it's negative. But we've established that the product should be positive and larger in magnitude.\n\nOption B: 4. That's positive, which is good, but the magnitude is too small. 8 times 4 is 32, not 4.\n\nOption D: -32. The magnitude is correct, but the sign is wrong. Negative times negative should give positive.\n\nTherefore, the only logical choice is C. 32.\n\nI think I've covered all possible angles here, and I'm confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
