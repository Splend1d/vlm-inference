Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.\"\nW.H.

                    "text": "So I'm looking at this passage about zamindars in Northern India during the Mughal period, and there's a question about why zamindars had the ability to establish a claim to sovereignty. The options are religious toleration, universal taxation, martial law, or suffrage. I need to figure out which of these Mughal policies allowed zamindars to make such claims.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a zamindar is. From what I recall, zamindars were essentially landlords or revenue collectors in the Mughal Empire. They collected taxes from the peasants and were supposed to pay a portion of that revenue to the Mughal authorities. So, their position was one of collecting money and managing the land on behalf of the Empire.\n\nThe passage mentions that a zamindar who paid revenue to the Mughal was dependent, and that refusing or omitting to pay revenue was the first step to claiming sovereignty. This suggests that their relationship with the Mughal Empire was largely based on their payment of revenue. If they stopped paying, they were essentially declaring independence or asserting their sovereignty.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the Mughal Empire's policy that allowed this ability. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Religious toleration - This refers to the Mughal policy of accepting and accommodating different religions. While Akbar was known for his religious tolerance, I'm not sure how directly this relates to zamindars claiming sovereignty. It seems more related to cultural and religious practices rather than political autonomy.\n\nB. Universal taxation - This could be relevant because the Mughal Empire had a system of collecting taxes from all its subjects, including zamindars. The passage talks about paying revenue, which is a form of taxation. So, maybe this is the key policy that allowed zamindars to have this ability.\n\nC. Martial law - This would involve strict military control and possibly suspension of normal laws. If the Mughal Empire enforced martial law, it might suppress any attempts by zamindars to claim sovereignty. But the passage mentions that sometimes the Mughal authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion, suggesting that martial law wasn't always in place or effectively enforced.\n\nD. Suffrage - This refers to the right to vote, which wasn't really a concept in the Mughal Empire. So, this seems irrelevant to the situation.\n\nGiven these considerations, universal taxation seems like the most plausible answer. The Mughal Empire's policy of collecting revenue from zamindars created a system where these landlords had a direct financial obligation to the Empire. By omitting or refusing to pay this revenue, they could signal their desire for independence or sovereignty.\n\nMoreover, the passage suggests that there were many chiefs and tribes in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur who were in an anomalous position, sometimes paying revenue and sometimes not, depending on the circumstances. This implies that the Mughal Empire's control through taxation was not always consistent or fully enforced, allowing these local rulers to maneuver between dependence and independence.\n\nTherefore, the Mughal Empire's policy of universal taxation seems to be the key factor that gave zamindars the ability to establish a claim to sovereignty by simply refusing to pay their revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
