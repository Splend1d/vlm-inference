                    "text": "So I have these two statements about permutations and cycles, and I need to determine which one is true and which one is false. The options are:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nLet me break this down. First, I need to understand what a permutation is and what a cycle is in the context of permutations.\n\nA permutation is an arrangement of all the members of a set into a particular sequence or order. For example, if I have a set with three elements {1, 2, 3}, the permutations of this set are all the different ways I can arrange these three numbers:\n\n1. 1, 2, 3\n\n2. 1, 3, 2\n\n3. 2, 1, 3\n\n4. 2, 3, 1\n\n5. 3, 1, 2\n\n6. 3, 2, 1\n\nSo, there are 6 permutations of three elements.\n\nNow, what is a cycle in permutations? A cycle is a way to represent a permutation by showing the movement of elements in a circular manner. For example, in the permutation where 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, and 3 goes back to 1, this can be written as the cycle (1 2 3). This means that each element is mapped to the next in the cycle, and the last maps back to the first.\n\nAnother example: if I have the permutation where 1 goes to 3 and 3 goes to 1, while 2 remains in place, this can be written as (1 3)(2), or sometimes just (1 3), since 2 is fixed.\n\nSo, cycles are a way to express permutations, focusing on the paths that elements take under the permutation.\n\nNow, let's look at Statement 1: \"Every permutation is a cycle.\"\n\nIs this true? Well, considering the earlier example, take the permutation where 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 1, and 3 remains the same, which can be written as (1 2)(3). This permutation consists of two cycles: a transposition (1 2) and a fixed point (3). It's not a single cycle. Therefore, not every permutation is a single cycle; some are products of multiple disjoint cycles.\n\nHence, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, Statement 2: \"Every cycle is a permutation.\"\n\nIs this true? Well, a cycle is a specific type of permutation where the elements are arranged in a circular order, with each element mapped to the next, and the last mapped back to the first. Since a cycle is a way of arranging elements, it is indeed a permutation. In other words, every cycle is a permutation, but not every permutation is a cycle (as we saw in Statement 1).\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nStatement 1: False\n\nStatement 2: True\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is D. False, True.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider another example. Take the permutation of four elements where 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 1, 3 goes to 4, and 4 goes to 3. This can be written as (1 2)(3 4). This is not a single cycle but a product of two disjoint transpositions. Hence, not every permutation is a cycle, confirming that Statement 1 is false.\n\nOn the other hand, any cycle, like (1 2 3), is indeed a permutation of the set {1, 2, 3}, so Statement 2 holds true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
