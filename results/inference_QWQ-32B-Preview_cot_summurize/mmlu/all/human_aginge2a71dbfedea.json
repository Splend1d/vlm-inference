Mechanistic, B. Organismic, C. Continuity, D. Stability.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each of these terms means in the context of development. I think this is probably related to theories of psychological development or maybe even biological development. Let's see.\n\nStarting with \"mechanistic.\" I recall that mechanistic views often see development as being governed by fixed laws, maybe like a machine. So, changes happen in a predictable, almost automatic way. But does that necessarily mean slowly and steadily throughout life? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nNext, \"organismic.\" This seems opposite to mechanistic, perhaps viewing development as more organic, like a living organism growing and changing in a more fluid way. But again, I'm not sure if that directly relates to the pace of change being slow and steady.\n\n\"Continuity\" sounds promising. If changes occur slowly and steadily, that suggests a continuous process, where development is a smooth progression over time. That makes sense. So, maybe the answer is C. Continuity.\n\nThen there's \"stability.\" Stability would imply that things don't change much over time, which seems contrary to the idea of changes occurring throughout life, even if they are slow and steady. So, probably not D. Stability.\n\nWait a minute, maybe stability refers to certain aspects remaining the same while others change gradually. But the question seems to emphasize that changes are occurring, so perhaps stability isn't the best fit.\n\nLet me think about continuity more deeply. In developmental psychology, the concept of continuity refers to the idea that development is a gradual and cumulative process, with changes happening steadily over time. This aligns well with the description in the question.\n\nOn the other hand, there's also the concept of discontinuity, which suggests that development occurs in distinct stages or phases, with abrupt changes between them. That would be the opposite of continuity.\n\nSo, if someone believes in slow and steady changes throughout life, they are subscribing to a continuity perspective.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Mechanistic and organismic seem more related to the nature of the developmental process\u2014whether it's more like a machine or a living organism\u2014rather than the pace of change. And stability refers more to the absence of change or the preservation of certain traits, which isn't directly about the rate of change.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Continuity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
