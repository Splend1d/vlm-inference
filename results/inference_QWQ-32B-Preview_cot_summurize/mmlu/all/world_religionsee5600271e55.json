The Recitation\n\nThe term \"Qur'an\" literally means \"The Recitation.\" It is derived from the Arabic root word \"qara'a,\" which means \"to read\" or \"to recite.\" The Qur'an is the holy book of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years.\n\nThe Qur'an is not only recited but also memorized and studied extensively by Muslims around the world. Its verses are considered by Muslims to be the direct words of God, and it serves as the primary source of Islamic theology, law, and ethics.\n\nOption A, \"The Holy Book,\" is a general term that could apply to many religious texts, but it is not the literal meaning of \"Qur'an.\" Option B, \"The Narrative,\" does not capture the essence of the term, as it suggests a story or account, which, while the Qur'an contains narratives, is not its primary definition. Option D, \"The Pillars,\" refers to the five pillars of Islam, which are the foundational practices of the religion, but it is not related to the meaning of \"Qur'an.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The Recitation."
