                    "text": "Let's see. So the question is about a fallacy that occurs when someone argues for a two-part proposition, only supports one part, and then claims that the whole proposition is supported. We have to choose among a priori, complex proposition, extension, and appeal to ignorance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a two-part proposition is. I think it means a statement that has two components or parts that need to be true for the whole statement to be true. So, if you have a proposition like \"A and B,\" both A and B need to be true for the whole thing to be true.\n\nNow, the fallacy happens when someone only supports one part, say A, and then claims that the whole proposition \"A and B\" is supported. That seems like they're making a leap without justification, because B hasn't been supported.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. A priori: This is about knowledge that is independent of experience. It doesn't seem directly related to this scenario.\n\nB. Complex proposition: A complex proposition is one that combines simpler propositions, like with \"and,\" \"or,\" etc. So, a two-part proposition would be a complex proposition. But is there a specific fallacy related to only supporting one part of it?\n\nC. Extension: I'm not sure what this refers to in the context of fallacies. Maybe it's about extending an argument beyond its valid scope, but I'm not certain.\n\nD. Appeal to ignorance: This is when someone argues that something must be true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. It doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nHmm. Maybe the fallacy is called \"complex question\" or something similar. Wait, that's not in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to \"affirming the consequent\" or \"denying the antecedent,\" but those are related to conditional statements, not conjunctions.\n\nLet me think differently. If someone presents a proposition with two parts and only supports one, yet claims the whole is supported, they're assuming that the unsupported part is automatically true, which isn't logical.\n\nThis seems similar to \"begging the question,\" where the argument assumes what it's trying to prove, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, it might be related to \"equivocation,\" where a term is used with different meanings in the argument, but that doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nWait, maybe it's a type of \"fallacy of division\" or \"fallacy of composition,\" but those are about properties of parts and wholes, not specifically about propositions.\n\nLet me consider the options again. Since \"complex proposition\" is one of them, perhaps the fallacy is specifically related to handling complex propositions incorrectly.\n\nMaybe the fallacy is called \"complex proposition fallacy,\" but that doesn't sound right. Perhaps it's a specific type of fallacy related to affirming only part of a conjunction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's an \"a priori\" fallacy, where someone assumes something is true based on prior beliefs without evidence.\n\nBut looking back, \"a priori\" is more about the source of knowledge than about the structure of the argument.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to \"affirming conjuncts\" incorrectly.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose someone says, \"To win the race, you need to be fast and have endurance.\" Then they show that a runner is fast, and conclude that therefore, the runner will win the race. But that ignores the need for endurance.\n\nSo, only one part of the requirement is met, but the conclusion depends on both parts.\n\nThis seems similar to only supporting one part of a two-part proposition and claiming the whole is supported.\n\nI think this might be related to the \"fallacy of the undistributed middle\" in syllogisms, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a \"fallacy of composition,\" where properties of parts are incorrectly ascribed to the whole.\n\nBut again, that doesn't seem directly applicable here.\n\nLet me see if any of the standard fallacies fit this description.\n\n- Straw man: Misrepresenting someone's argument to easily dismiss it. No, that's different.\n\n- False dilemma: Presenting only two options when more exist. Not relevant here.\n\n- Appeal to authority: Using an authority to support an argument without proper justification. Not relevant.\n\n- Ad hominem: Attacking the person instead of the argument. Irrelevant.\n\n- Slippery slope: Arguing that one small step will lead to a chain of related events. Not applicable.\n\n- Post hoc ergo propter hoc: Assuming that correlation implies causation. Not relevant.\n\n- Hasty generalization: Making a broad conclusion from a small sample. Not applicable.\n\n- Red herring: Introducing an irrelevant topic to divert attention. Not relevant.\n\n- Circular reasoning: Using the conclusion as a premise. Similar to begging the question.\n\nNone of these seem to fit the specific case described in the question.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a type of \"fallacy of presumption,\" where the argument presumes something that hasn't been established.\n\nIn this case, the argument presumes that the unsupported part of the proposition is true, which it hasn't been shown to be.\n\nBut I don't know if \"fallacy of presumption\" is a standard term in this context.\n\nLooking back at the options, \"complex proposition\" seems the most relevant, as it directly relates to propositions with multiple parts.\n\nMaybe the fallacy is that the arguer is treating the complex proposition as if it were supported when only part of it is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's an \"a priori\" fallacy, where someone assumes something is true based on prior beliefs without sufficient evidence.\n\nBut that seems too broad.\n\nComparing the options, \"complex proposition\" seems the most directly related to the issue described.\n\n\"Appeal to ignorance\" doesn't seem to fit, as it's about lacking evidence, not about supporting only part of a proposition.\n\n\"Extension\" is unclear in this context, so I'll go with \"complex proposition.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B.
