                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract law scenario. It's a bit intricate, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have a builder who wants security systems installed in homes he's building. He asks several companies to submit bids for the work. An alarm company decides to submit a bid and, in turn, requests bids from wholesalers for the burglar alarms they plan to use. One supplier submits a bid to the alarm company, which the alarm company uses to calculate their bid for the builder.\n\nOn September 1, the alarm company sends the builder a bid proposing to install the security systems for $100,000. Then, on September 9, the original supplier notifies the alarm company that they can't supply the burglar alarms. This is a significant development because the alarm company based their bid on the supplier's price.\n\nDespite this, on September 11, the builder sends a fax accepting the alarm company's offer to install the security systems for $100,000. Now, the alarm company has to find another supplier, which costs them $10,000 more than the original supplier's quote. So, they inform the builder that the total price needs to be increased to $110,000.\n\nThe builder responds that he'll hold the alarm company to the initial agreed price of $100,000. The alarm company proceeds to install the security systems but hasn't been paid yet. Now, the alarm company is suing the builder for the services rendered.\n\nThe question is: In this lawsuit, what is the alarm company likely to recover?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\n\nB. $110,000 because of an unanticipated change in circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.\n\nC. Only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.\n\nD. Only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\n- Quantum meruit is a Latin term that means \"as much as he has deserved.\" It's a principle in contract law where a court may imply a contract based on the value of services rendered when no formal contract exists or when there's a breach of contract.\n\n- Commercial frustration is a doctrine that may excuse performance when an event occurs that makes performance impossible or impracticable, and this event was not anticipated by the parties.\n\n- Repudiation is when one party clearly indicates that they won't perform their contractual obligations, which can\u89e3\u9664 the other party's obligations as well.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation.\n\n1. **Contract Formation:**\n\n- On September 1, the alarm company makes an offer to the builder to install security systems for $100,000.\n\n- On September 11, the builder accepts this offer via fax.\n\nAt this point, a contract is formed with a price of $100,000 for the installation work.\n\n2. **Supplier Issue:**\n\n- On September 9, the original supplier cancels their bid, meaning the alarm company has to find another supplier at a higher cost.\n\nThis is an event that occurred after the alarm company made their bid but before the contract was accepted by the builder.\n\n3. **Alarm Company's Response:**\n\n- After finding out about the higher cost from the new supplier, the alarm company informs the builder that the total price needs to be increased to $110,000.\n\n- The builder refuses and insists on the original $100,000 price.\n\n4. **Performance:**\n\n- Despite the price dispute, the alarm company proceeds to install the security systems.\n\nNow, the alarm company is suing for payment.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A: $100,000, because that was the contract price.**\n\n- This seems straightforward. The contract was for $100,000, so the alarm company should recover that amount.\n\n- However, the alarm company incurred additional costs due to the supplier issue, which they might argue should be compensated.\n\n**Option B: $110,000 because of an unanticipated change in circumstances after the parties had entered into their contract.**\n\n- This relates to the doctrine of frustration of purpose or impracticability.\n\n- In contract law, if circumstances change significantly after the contract is formed, making performance excessively difficult or costly, the affected party may be relieved from their obligations or entitled to additional compensation.\n\n- Here, the alarm company faced an unexpected increase in costs due to the supplier's cancellation.\n\n- However, whether this qualifies for an increase in the contract price depends on the specific jurisdiction and the terms of the contract.\n\n**Option C: Only in quantum meruit, because of the doctrine of commercial frustration.**\n\n- Quantum meruit allows recovery based on the reasonable value of services rendered when no contract exists or when there's a breach.\n\n- Commercial frustration may apply if the underlying purpose of the contract is frustrated by unforeseen events.\n\n- In this case, the alarm company's profit margin may be frustrated by the increased costs, but whether this rises to the level of commercial frustration is debatable.\n\n**Option D: Only in quantum meruit, because by demanding $110,000 the alarm company repudiated its contract with the builder.**\n\n- If the alarm company demanded $110,000, which is different from the contracted $100,000, this could be seen as a repudiation of the original contract.\n\n- If the alarm company repudiates the contract, the builder may be relieved from paying the contract price, but the alarm company could still seek quantum meruit for the value of the services provided.\n\nConsidering these points, let's think about the most likely outcome.\n\nFirst, the contract was formed for $100,000. The alarm company faced unexpected costs after the contract was formed due to the supplier issue.\n\nIn contract law, generally, the risk of such supplier issues is on the contractor (the alarm company) unless there's a specific clause in the contract addressing changes in cost.\n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, the doctrine of frustration of purpose or impracticability may allow for adjustment of contract terms when unforeseen events significantly alter the contract's basis.\n\nBut, in this scenario, it's not clear that the increase in costs would meet the high threshold for frustration or impracticability, especially since the alarm company still performed the work.\n\nAlternatively, if the alarm company's demand for $110,000 is considered a repudiation of the original contract, the builder may be able to treat the contract as terminated and only pay the reasonable value of the services rendered, which would be quantum meruit.\n\nHowever, since the alarm company did perform the work, they are entitled to compensation for the value of that work.\n\nGiven that, option D seems plausible: the alarm company may only recover in quantum meruit because their demand for $110,000 repudiated the original contract.\n\nBut, it's also possible that the alarm company is still bound by the original contract price of $100,000, and they have to absorb the additional costs.\n\nOption B suggests that the alarm company could recover $110,000 due to the change in circumstances, but this would require a contractual provision or a legal doctrine allowing for price adjustment, which isn't specified here.\n\nOption C proposes recovery in quantum meruit due to commercial frustration, which might be applicable, but it's not entirely clear if the circumstances meet the requirements for commercial frustration.\n\nConsidering standard contract law principles, I think the most probable outcome is that the alarm company can recover the contract price of $100,000, as per option A.\n\nThe reason is that the alarm company voluntarily accepted the risk of supplier issues by basing their bid on a particular supplier's quote. When that supplier backed out, the alarm company should have either adjusted their bid before acceptance or included a clause in the contract addressing potential increases in cost.\n\nSince they didn't do that, and the builder accepted the $100,000 bid, the alarm company is bound by that price.\n\nTheir demand for $110,000 after the contract was formed could be seen as an attempt to renegotiate the contract, which the builder refused.\n\nBy proceeding to perform the work despite the price dispute, the alarm company may be deemed to have affirmed the original contract, and thus, they can recover the contracted amount.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A. $100,000, because that was the contract price.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
