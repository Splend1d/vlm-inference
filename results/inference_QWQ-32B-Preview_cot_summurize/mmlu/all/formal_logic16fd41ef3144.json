Sk \u2261 Bl\n\nB. Bl \u2261 Sk\n\nC. Bx \u2283 Sy\n\nD. Bl \u2283 Sk\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"only if\" means in logic. I remember that \"only if\" is tricky because it's not as straightforward as \"if.\" In logic, \"P only if Q\" is translated as P \u2283 Q. So, if Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name, that means if Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts his name.\n\nLooking at the options, D is Bl \u2283 Sk, which matches what I just thought. But let me make sure about the other options.\n\nOption A is Sk \u2261 Bl, which means Sk if and only if Bl. That's not the same as only if.\n\nOption B is Bl \u2261 Sk, which is the same as A, just switched. Still, it's an equivalence, not just \"only if.\"\n\nOption C is Bx \u2283 Sy. I think there might be a typo here because the variables are different from the other options. Maybe it's a mistake.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, D seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. \"Only if\" is equivalent to saying \"if not Q, then not P,\" which is the contrapositive of P \u2283 Q.\n\nSo, if DJ Khaled does not shout Leroy's name, then Leroy is not bad. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that for Leroy to be bad, it is necessary that DJ Khaled shouts his name. Meaning, without DJ Khaled shouting, Leroy cannot be bad.\n\nAgain, this aligns with P \u2283 Q, where P is Leroy is bad, and Q is DJ Khaled shouts his name.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the right choice.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider why not equivalence. Equivalence means both things happen together, which isn't what the original statement says. The original statement only says that if Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts his name. It doesn't say that if DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad.\n\nFor example, DJ Khaled could shout Leroy's name for other reasons, but if Leroy is bad, then definitely DJ Khaled shouts his name.\n\nSo, not an equivalence, just a one-way condition.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is D. Bl \u2283 Sk.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
