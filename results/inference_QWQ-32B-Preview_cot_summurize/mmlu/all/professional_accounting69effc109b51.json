                    "text": "To determine whether the exchange has commercial substance, Markson Co. needs to assess whether the exchange is expected to change the company's future cash flows in a significant way. The concept of commercial substance is closely tied to the idea that the exchange should alter the entity's economic position in a meaningful manner.\n\nLet's analyze each option to see which one directly relates to this assessment:\n\nA. Does the book value of the asset given up exceed the fair value of the asset received?\n\nThis option compares book values and fair values but doesn't directly address whether the exchange will affect future cash flows. Book values are historical costs adjusted for depreciation, while fair values reflect current market conditions. The difference between book value and fair value might indicate a gain or loss on the exchange, but it doesn't necessarily speak to the impact on future cash flows.\n\nB. Is the gain on the exchange less than the increase in future cash flows?\n\nThis option suggests comparing the gain recognized from the exchange to the expected increase in future cash flows. While this seems relevant, it phrases the question in a way that might not directly capture the essence of commercial substance. Commercial substance is about whether the exchange is expected to affect future cash flows, regardless of the gain or loss recognized.\n\nC. Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nThis option directly addresses whether the exchange will lead to a significant change in future cash flows. This is the core definition of commercial substance. If the exchange is expected to alter the pattern, timing, or amount of future cash flows, then it has commercial substance.\n\nD. Is the exchange nontaxable?\n\nThe tax treatment of the exchange is important for financial reporting, but it doesn't directly determine whether the exchange has commercial substance. The taxability of the exchange affects the after-tax cash flows, but the concept of commercial substance is primarily concerned with the pre-tax economic impact.\n\nBased on this analysis, the question that Markson Co. needs to answer to determine whether the exchange has commercial substance is:\n\nC. Are the future cash flows expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange?\n\nThis question aligns directly with the definition of commercial substance, focusing on the impact of the exchange on the entity's future cash flows."
