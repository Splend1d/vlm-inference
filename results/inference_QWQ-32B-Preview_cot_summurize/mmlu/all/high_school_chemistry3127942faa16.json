                    "text": "Monatomic ions of the representative elements are often isoelectronic with a noble gas. This is because representative elements, also known as main-group elements, tend to gain or lose electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration similar to that of the nearest noble gas.\n\nLet's look at each option to understand why C is the correct choice:\n\nA. Very soluble: Solubility is a property that describes how well a substance dissolves in a solvent, usually water. While many monatomic ions are indeed soluble in water, solubility isn't a defining characteristic of these ions. Solubility depends on various factors, including the nature of the ion and the solvent.\n\nB. Very electronegative: Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons in a chemical bond. While some representative elements are highly electronegative (like fluorine), others are not (like sodium). Therefore, it's not accurate to generalize that monatomic ions of representative elements are very electronegative.\n\nC. Isoelectronic with a noble gas: This is the correct answer. Representative elements tend to form ions by gaining or losing electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration identical to that of a noble gas. For example, sodium (Na) loses one electron to become Na\u207a, which has the same electron configuration as neon (Ne), a noble gas. Similarly, chlorine (Cl) gains one electron to become Cl\u207b, matching the electron configuration of argon (Ar), another noble gas.\n\nD. Highly colored: Color in chemical species often arises from the absorption of specific wavelengths of light, which can be due to transitions between different energy levels of electrons. While some monatomic ions do have color (like copper ions), many are colorless. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that monatomic ions of representative elements are generally highly colored.\n\nIn summary, the key feature of monatomic ions of representative elements is that they achieve a stable electron configuration by becoming isoelectronic with a noble gas, making option C the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
