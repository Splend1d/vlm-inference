This occurs when a gas cools down and loses energy, causing its molecules to slow down and come closer together, forming a liquid. For example, water vapor in the air condenses into liquid water droplets on a cold surface.\n\nLet's briefly look at the other options to understand why they are not correct in this context:\n\nB. Evaporation: This is the process where a liquid turns into a gas. It typically occurs when a liquid absorbs heat energy, causing its molecules to move faster and escape into the air as gas molecules.\n\nC. Deposition: This is when a gas turns directly into a solid without passing through the liquid phase. An example is water vapor turning into frost on a cold surface.\n\nD. Sublimation: This is the process where a solid turns directly into a gas without becoming a liquid first. Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) sublimating into carbon dioxide gas is a common example.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. condensation."
