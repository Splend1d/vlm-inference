                    "text": "So Ms. Fisher used the expression (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 to find the total number of markers needed for her students' art project. She wants to know which of the given expressions is equal to the one she used. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. 6 + (8 + 12)\n\nB. 6 + (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nC. 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12)\n\nD. 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the original expression means and then see which of these options matches it.\n\nThe original expression is (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12. This means that first, you multiply 6 by 8, and then you take that result and multiply it by 12.\n\nLet me calculate that to get a numerical value.\n\n6 \u00d7 8 is 48.\n\nThen 48 \u00d7 12 is 576.\n\nSo, the total number of markers is 576.\n\nNow, I need to check each option to see which one also equals 576.\n\nStarting with option A: 6 + (8 + 12)\n\nFirst, add 8 + 12, which is 20, then add 6 to get 26. That's not equal to 576.\n\nOption B: 6 + (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nFirst, multiply 8 \u00d7 12, which is 96, then add 6 to get 102. Still not 576.\n\nOption C: 6 \u00d7 (8 + 12)\n\nFirst, add 8 + 12, which is 20, then multiply by 6 to get 120. Not 576.\n\nOption D: 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12)\n\nFirst, multiply 8 \u00d7 12, which is 96, then multiply by 6 to get 576. That matches the original expression.\n\nSo, the expression that is equal to the one used by Ms. Fisher is option D: 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12).\n\nBut wait, let me think about the properties of multiplication. There's something called the associative property, which says that when multiplying numbers, the way you group them doesn't change the product. In other words, (a \u00d7 b) \u00d7 c = a \u00d7 (b \u00d7 c).\n\nIn this case, (6 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 12 should be equal to 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12), which is what option D is.\n\nSo, not only does option D give the same numerical value, but it also aligns with the associative property of multiplication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6 \u00d7 (8 \u00d7 12).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
