'The Desert State'\n\nB. 'Gateway to Paradise'\n\nC. 'Land of Enchantment'\n\nD. 'The Garden State'\n\nHmm, let's think about this. I know that New Mexico is known for its beautiful landscapes and rich culture, so maybe 'Land of Enchantment' fits well. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, I think I've heard the slogan 'Land of Enchantment' associated with New Mexico. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nI recall that New Mexico's license plates have the phrase 'Land of Enchantment,' so that must be its nickname.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A: 'The Desert State'\u2014while New Mexico does have desert areas, I don't think that's its official nickname.\n\nOption B: 'Gateway to Paradise'\u2014that sounds more like a travel slogan than an official nickname.\n\nOption D: 'The Garden State'\u2014I actually think that's New Jersey's nickname, not New Mexico's.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe the correct answer is C. 'Land of Enchantment.'\n\nBut to make sure, maybe I should look it up or think about other sources of information.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that New Mexico is known for its unique blend of cultures, including Native American, Spanish, and Mexican influences, and its stunning natural beauty, which could indeed be called an 'enchantment.'\n\nAlso, I've seen tourism ads that use the 'Land of Enchantment' tagline, which reinforces my belief that this is the correct nickname.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C. 'Land of Enchantment.'\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
