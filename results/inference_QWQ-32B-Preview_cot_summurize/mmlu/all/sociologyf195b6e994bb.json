Social norms are like the unwritten rules that guide how we behave in society. They help us know what is acceptable and what isn't in different situations. For example, waiting in line, saying \"please\" and \"thank you,\" or not interrupting someone when they're talking. These norms help maintain order and make social interactions smoother.\n\nOption A, creative activities like gardening, cookery, and craftwork, are more about personal hobbies and interests, not about regulating social behavior.\n\nOption B, the symbolic representation of social groups in the mass media, is about how different groups are portrayed in TV, movies, and other media. While this can influence norms, it's not the definition of social norms itself.\n\nOption C, religious beliefs about how the world ought to be, is more about moral and ethical guidelines based on religion. While religion can influence social norms, they are not the same thing.\n\nSo, I believe D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
