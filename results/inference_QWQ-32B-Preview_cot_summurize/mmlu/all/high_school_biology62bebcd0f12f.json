                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these evolutionary agents is best at making populations better suited to their environments over time. The options are mutation, non-random mating, gene flow, and natural selection. I need to think about which one consistently helps populations adapt generation after generation.\n\nFirst, let's consider mutation. Mutations are random changes in DNA. They provide the raw material for evolution by introducing new genetic variations. Some mutations might be beneficial, giving an organism an advantage, while others might be harmful or have no effect. However, mutations are random, so they don't necessarily lead to improvements in the population's fitness over time. They're more like the starting point for evolution, but not necessarily the driver of adaptation.\n\nNext, non-random mating. This refers to mating patterns where individuals choose partners based on certain characteristics, which can lead to changes in allele frequencies. For example, if individuals prefer mates with similar traits, this can lead to increased genetic similarity within the population. While this can influence the genetic structure of a population, it doesn't directly relate to how well the population is suited to its environment. It might reinforce certain traits, but it doesn't guarantee that those traits are advantageous in terms of survival and reproduction.\n\nGene flow is the transfer of genetic variation between populations, usually through the movement of individuals or their gametes. This can introduce new alleles into a population, which might be beneficial, neutral, or detrimental. Gene flow can help populations adapt by bringing in advantageous genes from other populations. However, it's not consistently\u5b9a\u5411 towards improving fitness; it depends on the genes that are being exchanged and the environmental context.\n\nFinally, natural selection is the process where organisms with traits that are better suited to their environment have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing. Over generations, this leads to an increase in the frequency of advantageous traits within the population. Natural selection is directly tied to environmental pressures and acts to optimize populations for their specific environments.\n\nComparing all these agents, natural selection stands out as the one that consistently causes populations to become better suited to their environments over generations. It's the mechanism that directly links an organism's traits to its reproductive success, thereby shaping the population over time.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Natural selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
