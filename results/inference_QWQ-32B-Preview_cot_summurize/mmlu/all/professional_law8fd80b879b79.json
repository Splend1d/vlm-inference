                    "text": "This is a tricky question about liability in a situation where someone was hurt by an object thrown from a building, but it's not clear exactly who threw it. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a directed verdict is. In a trial, a directed verdict is a ruling by the judge that there's no need for the jury to decide the case because there's no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for the party that bears the burden of proof\u2014in this case, the pedestrian who was injured.\n\nSo, the defendants are asking the court to say that, based on the evidence presented so far, there's no way the pedestrian can prove that any specific defendant threw the chair. If the court agrees, it will direct a verdict in favor of the defendants, essentially ending the case without going to the jury.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because it is unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which of the defendants caused the harm.\n\nThis option suggests that the court shouldn't grant the directed verdict because it's unfair to require the pedestrian to identify the exact defendant who threw the chair. Maybe there are too many rooms, or the circumstances make it impossible to pinpoint one person.\n\nB. No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nAlternative liability is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to recover damages even if they can't identify exactly which defendant caused the harm, as long as it was one of the defendants. This doctrine was established in cases where multiple parties could have caused the harm, and it's impractical for the plaintiff to determine the exact culprit.\n\nC. Yes, because a plaintiff always has the burden to prove that a particular defendant's conduct was the factual cause of the plaintiff's physical harm.\n\nThis option emphasizes that, in general, a plaintiff must prove which defendant's actions caused the harm. If they can't specify who did it, they shouldn't be able to hold anyone liable.\n\nD. Yes, because the pedestrian has failed to offer evidence that the defendants jointly engaged in tortious conduct.\n\nThis option suggests that the pedestrian needs to show that all the defendants acted together in some way to cause the harm. If they can't prove joint action, then no one should be held liable.\n\nOkay, so we need to think about which of these makes the most sense given the principles of liability in tort law.\n\nFirst, in tort law, the general rule is that a plaintiff must establish causation, meaning they need to show that the defendant's actions directly caused their harm. This is often referred to as factual cause or cause in fact.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to this rule, especially in cases where it's practically impossible for the plaintiff to identify the exact tortfeasor. That's where the doctrine of alternative liability comes into play.\n\nThe doctrine of alternative liability was established in cases like Summers v. Tice, where two hunters both fired shots that could have caused the plaintiff's injury, but it's unclear which one actually did it. The court held that in such situations, both hunters should be held jointly liable, and the burden shifts to them to prove that they didn't cause the harm.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the pedestrian was hit by a chair thrown from one of the upper-story hotel windows, but doesn't know exactly which room it came from. It would be unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to identify the exact room, especially if there are many rooms on upper floors.\n\nTherefore, applying the doctrine of alternative liability, the defendants (the occupants of all the rooms from which the chair might have been thrown) should be held jointly liable, and the burden would shift to them to prove that they didn't throw the chair.\n\nGiven that, options A and B seem more plausible than C and D.\n\nOption C is too rigid; it doesn't account for situations where it's practically impossible for the plaintiff to identify the exact defendant. The law sometimes adapts to practical realities, and the doctrine of alternative liability is one such adaptation.\n\nOption D is also not fitting because it talks about joint engagement in tortious conduct. In this scenario, it's not that the defendants necessarily acted together; it's just that one of them did something wrong, but it's unclear which one.\n\nTherefore, between A and B, B seems more precise because it specifically mentions the doctrine of alternative liability, which is directly applicable here.\n\nOption A is also plausible because it argues that it's unreasonable to expect the pedestrian to prove which defendant caused the harm, but it doesn't reference a specific legal doctrine.\n\nHowever, in legal terms, invoking the doctrine of alternative liability is more accurate and directly applicable.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: No, because of the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\nThis means that the court should not grant the directed verdict because under the doctrine of alternative liability, the pedestrian doesn't need to prove which specific defendant threw the chair; instead, all defendants from whose rooms the chair could have been thrown are held jointly liable, and they must prove their innocence.\n\nSo, the court should deny the motion for a directed verdict and allow the case to proceed to the jury, applying the doctrine of alternative liability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
