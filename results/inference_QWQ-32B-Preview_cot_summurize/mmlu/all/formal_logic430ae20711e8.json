There are those who use predicate variables; the values of these variables are attributes.\n\n2. Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\n\n3. The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\n\n4. If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. There are those who use predicate variables; the values of these variables are attributes.\n\nB. Predicates are wanted in all sentences regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to.\n\nC. The dummy predicate 'F' is wanted generally for expository purposes.\n\nD. If we are going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names for the purposes, and not mixing these up with the predicates.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what a conclusion is in an argument. The conclusion is the main point the argument is trying to establish. It's what the other statements, called premises, are supposed to support.\n\nSo, looking at these statements, I need to figure out which one is the main point, and which ones are providing support for it.\n\nStatement 1 seems to be introducing some background information about predicate variables and their values being attributes. This sounds like a premise that's setting up the context.\n\nStatement 2 is saying that predicates are needed in all sentences, regardless of whether there are attributes to refer to. This also seems like a general claim that might be supporting the main point.\n\nStatement 3 mentions that the dummy predicate 'F' is generally wanted for expository purposes. This might be another supporting point or perhaps part of the conclusion, but it seems a bit specific.\n\nStatement 4 is a conditional: if we're going to quantify over attributes and refer to them, then clarity is served by using recognizable variables and distinctive names, and not mixing them up with predicates. This seems like a specific recommendation based on the previous points.\n\nNow, considering these, I need to determine which one is the conclusion.\n\nOption A is the first statement, which seems more like an introductory point rather than the main conclusion.\n\nOption B is a general claim about predicates being wanted in all sentences. This could be part of the conclusion, but it's not clear yet.\n\nOption C is about the dummy predicate 'F' being wanted for expository purposes. This seems somewhat tangential to the main point.\n\nOption D is a conditional recommendation about how to achieve clarity when dealing with attributes.\n\nThinking about it, it seems like statements 1 and 2 are setting up the context and general principles, statement 3 is a specific tool or practice, and statement 4 is the recommendation based on all of these.\n\nSo, perhaps the conclusion is statement 4, where Quine is advising on how to proceed given the previous points.\n\nBut let's consider another angle. Maybe the conclusion is statement 2, that predicates are wanted in all sentences, and statements 1, 3, and 4 are supporting this claim.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then statement 4 seems a bit too specific to solely support statement 2. It might be better to see statement 2 as a premise that leads to statement 4 being the conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the conclusion is a combination of statements, but the options only allow selecting one.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is the only conditional statement, which might make it stand out as a conclusion because it presents a condition leading to a recommendation.\n\nAlso, in argumentative texts, the conclusion often comes at the end, though that's not always the case.\n\nHere, statement 4 is the last one, which might suggest it's the conclusion.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider the logical structure.\n\nIf statements 1 and 2 are establishing that predicate variables have attribute values and that predicates are needed in all sentences, and statement 3 introduces a dummy predicate for expository purposes, then statement 4 could be the conclusion that follows from these: namely, that when quantifying over attributes, one should use recognizable variables and distinctive names to avoid confusion.\n\nSo, in this light, statements 1, 2, and 3 are premises leading to the conclusion in statement 4.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is option D.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's see if any of the other options make more sense as the conclusion.\n\nIf option A were the conclusion, then statements 2, 3, and 4 would need to be supporting that there are those who use predicate variables with attribute values. But statements 2 and 4 seem to be going beyond that, so it's less likely.\n\nOption B, that predicates are wanted in all sentences, could be a conclusion, but again, statement 4 seems to be building upon that.\n\nOption C is very specific about the dummy predicate 'F,' which seems like a minor point compared to the others.\n\nHence, it appears that option D is indeed the conclusion, as it seems to be the main point that Quine is driving at, based on the preceding statements.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
