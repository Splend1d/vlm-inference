                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. First up, Statement 1: \"RELUs are not monotonic, but sigmoids are monotonic.\"\n\nSo, I need to recall what monotonicity means in the context of functions. A function is monotonic if it's either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. In other words, it's always going up or always going down, without changing direction.\n\nReLU, or Rectified Linear Unit, is a popular activation function in neural networks. It's defined as f(x) = max(0, x). So, for any input x, if x is positive, it outputs x; if x is negative, it outputs zero. Let's think about its monotonicity. As x increases, the output either stays at zero or increases linearly with x, right? It never decreases as x increases. So, it should be monotonic, specifically monotonically increasing.\n\nWait, but the statement says RELUs are not monotonic. That seems contradictory to what I just thought. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps there's a nuanced definition of monotonicity in certain contexts that I'm not aware of.\n\nOn the other hand, the sigmoid function is defined as f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)). It's an S-shaped curve that maps any input to a value between 0 and 1. As x increases, the output increases from 0 to 1, but at a decreasing rate as it approaches 1. However, it's always increasing, never decreasing, so it should also be monotonic, specifically monotonically increasing.\n\nSo, according to my understanding, both RELUs and sigmoids are monotonic, which contradicts Statement 1, which says RELUs are not monotonic but sigmoids are. So, perhaps Statement 1 is false.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"Neural networks trained with gradient descent with high probability converge to the global optimum.\"\n\nOkay, this is a big topic in machine learning. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in neural networks. The idea is to iteratively adjust the weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.\n\nNow, in the context of neural networks, the loss landscape is typically non-convex, meaning there can be multiple local minima and saddle points. In such a landscape, gradient descent is not guaranteed to find the global minimum. In fact, it's known to get stuck in local minima or saddle points, especially in high-dimensional spaces like those encountered in deep learning.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests that in overparameterized neural networks (where the number of parameters is much larger than the number of training examples), the loss landscape has some special properties. For example, all local minima might be global minima, or the landscape might be approximately convex along certain directions.\n\nBut in general, for arbitrary neural networks, it's not accurate to say that gradient descent with high probability converges to the global optimum. There are many cases where it gets stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\nSo, Statement 2 seems false as well.\n\nPutting it all together, both statements appear to be false, which corresponds to option B: False, False.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about Statement 1 regarding monotonicity.\n\nUpon further reflection, perhaps the issue with RELUs not being monotonic has to do with their behavior at x=0, where the function transitions from zero to linear. However, even at that point, the function is continuous and non-decreasing. So, I still think it's monotonic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some contexts, \"monotonic\" requires strict increase or decrease, without plateaus. But even then, the ReLU is strictly increasing for x > 0 and constant for x < 0, so it's monotonic but not strictly monotonic.\n\nBut in standard mathematical definitions, monotonic functions can have flat regions, as long as they don't decrease.\n\nGiven that, I stick with my initial assessment that both statements are false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
