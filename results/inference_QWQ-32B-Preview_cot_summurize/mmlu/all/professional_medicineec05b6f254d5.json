                    "text": "So I have this case here about a 25-year-old woman who's been experiencing numbness in her right hand for two months. Specifically, she has tingling in her right ring and small fingers most of the time. She doesn't have any history of serious illness and isn't taking any medications. She works as a cashier and uses a computer at home. She used to play softball, but stopped two years ago.\n\nVital signs are normal, and during the exam, her muscle strength is full. But when the doctor palpates her right elbow, it causes a jolt of severe pain in her right ring and small fingers. Also, her sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the medial half of her right ring finger and the entire small finger.\n\nThe question is asking about the most likely cause of these findings, and it's entrapment of a specific nerve in a particular location on the right side. The options are:\n\nA. Median nerve at the wrist\n\nB. Musculocutaneous nerve at the forearm\n\nC. Radial nerve at the forearm\n\nD. Ulnar nerve at the elbow\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which nerve supplies the areas that are affected here, and where along its path it might be getting entrapped.\n\nFirst, the symptoms are in the right ring and small fingers. I know that the ulnar nerve supplies the medial one and a half fingers, which would be the ring and small fingers. The median nerve supplies the lateral three and a half fingers, and the radial nerve supplies the back of the hand and the dorsal aspects of the thumb and fingers.\n\nSo, since the symptoms are in the ring and small fingers, especially the small finger, which is entirely supplied by the ulnar nerve, it seems like the ulnar nerve might be involved.\n\nAlso, the examination shows that palpation of the right elbow causes pain in those fingers. I know that the ulnar nerve runs behind the elbow, in the cubital tunnel. That's a common site for nerve entrapment.\n\nIn contrast, the median nerve is entrapped at the wrist, in the carpal tunnel, which would affect the sensation in the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring finger.\n\nThe musculocutaneous nerve innervates the muscles of the anterior arm and the lateral forearm skin, so that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nThe radial nerve innervates the back of the hand and the dorsal aspects of the thumb and fingers, but the problem here is with sensation in the palm side of the fingers.\n\nSo, based on the distribution of the symptoms and the location of tenderness at the elbow, it seems like ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow is the most likely cause.\n\nLet me just double-check. The patient is a cashier who uses a computer at home. Maybe repetitive strain or awkward positioning could be contributing to nerve entrapment.\n\nAlso, she used to play softball, but stopped two years ago. Maybe there was some injury or overuse related to that, but since she stopped playing two years ago, it might not be directly relevant now.\n\nBut the current activities, like using a computer and working as a cashier, could involve positions that put pressure on the ulnar nerve at the elbow.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the symptoms are gradual, over two months, which fits with nerve entrapment due to chronic compression.\n\nSo, overall, I think the answer is D. Ulnar nerve at the elbow.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
