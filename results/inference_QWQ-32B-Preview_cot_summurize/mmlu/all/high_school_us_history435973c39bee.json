There is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in America. That is right here today.\nWe do not propose to divide it up equally. We do not propose a division of wealth, but we do propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted on any man's family. We will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality \u2026 but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guarantee of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, an automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children.\u2026\nWe will have to limit fortunes. Our present plan is that we will allow no man to own more than $50,000,000. We think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program.\n\u2014Senator Huey P.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about Senator Huey P. Long and his \"Share the Wealth Society\" from 1934. I need to figure out why it attracted many followers at that time. The options are:\n\nA. the New Deal had not ended the Great Depression.\n\nB. a flourishing economy and a baby boom had led people to desire greater incomes.\n\nC. the Second World War encouraged an egalitarian ethos.\n\nD. Socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what was happening in 1934. That was during the Great Depression, right? So, the New Deal was already in place, but maybe it wasn't solving all the problems people were facing.\n\nOption A says that the New Deal hadn't ended the Great Depression. That makes sense because the Great Depression was a long and severe economic downturn, and it's possible that people were still suffering even with the New Deal policies in place. So, maybe they were looking for alternative solutions, like Senator Long's plan to share wealth more equally.\n\nOption B mentions a flourishing economy and a baby boom leading people to desire greater incomes. But wait, in 1934, the economy was still depressed, not flourishing. And the baby boom didn't start until after World War II, right? So, this option doesn't seem to fit the time period.\n\nOption C talks about the Second World War encouraging an egalitarian ethos. But World War II started in 1939, and this is 1934, before the war began. So, that doesn't align with the timeline.\n\nOption D suggests that socialistic ideas were becoming popular in the United States. While it's possible that some people were attracted to socialist ideas during the Depression, I need to see if that was the main reason for supporting Senator Long's plan.\n\nLooking back at Senator Long's speech, he talks about ensuring every family has a certain level of wealth, enough for a home, car, radio, and education for children. He proposes limiting fortunes to $50 million while guaranteeing a minimum wealth for families. This sounds like a populist approach, aiming to redistribute wealth to help those who were struggling.\n\nGiven that it was 1934, and the Great Depression was still ongoing, despite the New Deal, many people might have felt that more needed to be done to alleviate poverty and ensure economic security. Senator Long's plan resonated with those who felt left behind by existing policies.\n\nSo, option A seems the most plausible. The New Deal hadn't fully ended the Great Depression, and people were still suffering, leading them to seek alternative solutions like Senator Long's wealth-sharing plan.\n\nI should also consider whether socialistic ideas were popular at the time. While there was some interest in socialist and communist ideas during the Depression, especially among certain groups, the overall political climate in the U.S. was still largely capitalist. So, while option D might have some truth, it may not be the primary reason for the attraction to Senator Long's society.\n\nOption B is clearly\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408 because the economy wasn't flourishing in 1934, and the baby boom hadn't started yet.\n\nOption C is also not relevant because World War II hadn't begun at that point.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A: the New Deal had not ended the Great Depression, leading people to look for other solutions like Senator Long's \"Share the Wealth Society.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
