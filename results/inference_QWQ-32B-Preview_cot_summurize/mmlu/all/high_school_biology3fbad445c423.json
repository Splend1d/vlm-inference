And we need to pick the type of evolution that best describes this scenario. The options are A. Divergent evolution, B. Convergent evolution, C. Parallel evolution, and D. Coevolution.\n\nFirst, let's try to recall what each of these terms means.\n\nA. Divergent evolution, I think, is when species that were once similar start to become different over time, usually because they adapt to different environments or lifestyles. So, it's like they're diverging, moving away from each other in terms of their characteristics.\n\nB. Convergent evolution is when different species evolve similar traits independently, maybe because they face similar environmental challenges, even if they're not closely related. So, it's like they're converging on similar solutions.\n\nC. Parallel evolution is when similar species evolve similar traits in parallel, but they start from a common ancestor and maintain some similarities while evolving. So, it's like they're evolving similarly but still retaining some differences.\n\nD. Coevolution is when two or more species evolve in response to each other, like predators and prey, or plants and pollinators. So, their evolution is interconnected.\n\nNow, in this question, we have two related species becoming less similar. That sounds a lot like they're diverging from each other. So, divergent evolution seems to fit.\n\nLet me double-check. Convergent evolution would be if they were becoming more similar, which is the opposite of what's happening here. Parallel evolution is about evolving similar traits, so again, not about becoming less similar. Coevolution is about\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4eec\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u770b\u6765A. \u5206\u6b67\u8fdb\u5316\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
