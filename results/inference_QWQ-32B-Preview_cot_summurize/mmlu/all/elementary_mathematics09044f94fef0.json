I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I know that multiplying by 0.3 is the same as multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 10 because 0.3 is 3 tenths. So, 0.3 \u00d7 427 = (3 \u00d7 427) \u00f7 10.\n\nLet me calculate 3 \u00d7 427. Three times four hundred is 1200, three times 20 is 60, and three times seven is 21. So, 1200 + 60 + 21 = 1281.\n\nNow, I need to divide that by 10. Dividing by 10 moves the decimal point one place to the left. So, 1281 divided by 10 is 128.1.\n\nLooking at the options, D. 128.1 matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the decimal places. When I multiply a number by 0.3, which has one decimal place, the product should have one decimal place as well. 427 is a whole number, so the product should have one decimal place. Looking at the options, A has four decimal places, B has three, C has two, and D has one. So, D makes sense in terms of decimal places.\n\nAlso, I can estimate. 0.3 is a little less than a third, so multiplying 427 by 0.3 should give me a little less than a third of 427. A third of 427 is approximately 142.333, so a little less than that would be around 128, which is close to option D.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider that 0.3 is 30%, so 30% of 427 should be around 128.1, which again matches option D.\n\nI think D. 128.1 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
