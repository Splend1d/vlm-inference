                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a textbook weighs 30 N at sea level, and I need to estimate its weight on a mountain peak that's 6,000 meters above sea level. Earth's radius is given as 6,400 km. The options are 60 N, 15 N, 30 N, and 7.5 N. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that weight is related to gravity, and gravity changes with altitude. The farther you are from the center of the Earth, the less gravity you experience, and thus the less weight an object has. So, on top of a mountain, the gravity should be slightly less than at sea level, meaning the weight should be slightly less than 30 N.\n\nBut let's think about this more quantitatively. The formula for gravitational force is:\n\n\\[ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( F \\) is the force of attraction between two masses,\n\n- \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant,\n\n- \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two objects,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\nIn this case, \\( m_1 \\) is the mass of the Earth, and \\( m_2 \\) is the mass of the textbook. The weight of the textbook is the force \\( F \\) that the Earth exerts on it.\n\nAt sea level, the distance \\( r \\) is approximately equal to the radius of the Earth, which is 6,400 km. On the mountain peak, the distance \\( r \\) is the radius of the Earth plus the height of the mountain, which is 6,400 km + 6 km = 6,406 km.\n\nSo, the weight at sea level is:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{sea}} = G \\frac{m_{\\text{Earth}} m_{\\text{book}}}{(6400 \\times 10^3)^2} = 30 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nAnd the weight on the mountain is:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{mountain}} = G \\frac{m_{\\text{Earth}} m_{\\text{book}}}{(6406 \\times 10^3)^2} \\]\n\nI need to find \\( W_{\\text{mountain}} \\).\n\nI can set up a ratio of the two weights:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W_{\\text{mountain}}}{W_{\\text{sea}}} = \\frac{(6400 \\times 10^3)^2}{(6406 \\times 10^3)^2} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ \\frac{W_{\\text{mountain}}}{30} = \\left( \\frac{6400}{6406} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nCalculating the fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6400}{6406} = 0.99906 \\]\n\nSquaring that:\n\n\\[ (0.99906)^2 \\approx 0.99812 \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{mountain}} = 30 \\times 0.99812 \\approx 29.94 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nThat's very close to 30 N. But looking at the options, 30 N is one of them, and the others are quite different. However, I feel like there might be a better way to estimate this without doing such precise calculations, especially since this is supposed to be an estimation problem.\n\nLet me think about it differently. Maybe I can use the approximation that gravity decreases with altitude using the formula:\n\n\\[ g(h) = g \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}} + h} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( g(h) \\) is the acceleration due to gravity at height \\( h \\),\n\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity at sea level,\n\n- \\( r_{\\text{Earth}} \\) is the radius of the Earth,\n\n- \\( h \\) is the height above sea level.\n\nThe weight at height \\( h \\) would then be:\n\n\\[ W(h) = m \\cdot g(h) = m \\cdot g \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}} + h} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nAt sea level, \\( W_{\\text{sea}} = m \\cdot g = 30 \\, \\text{N} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ W(h) = W_{\\text{sea}} \\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{Earth}}}{r_{\\text{Earth}} + h} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ W(6000) = 30 \\left( \\frac{6400}{6400 + 6} \\right)^2 = 30 \\left( \\frac{6400}{6406} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nWhich is the same as before. Again, this gives approximately 29.94 N.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way to estimate this without calculating the exact value. Let's consider that the height of the mountain is relatively small compared to the radius of the Earth. The radius is 6,400 km, and the mountain is 6 km high, so the height is about 0.1% of the radius.\n\nIn such cases, for small heights compared to the radius, the percentage change in gravity is approximately proportional to the fractional change in distance from the center.\n\nSo, the fractional change in \\( r \\) is \\( \\frac{6}{6400} = 0.0009375 \\), or about 0.09375%.\n\nSince gravity varies with the inverse square of the distance, the percentage change in gravity would be approximately twice the percentage change in \\( r \\), but in the opposite direction (because as \\( r \\) increases, gravity decreases).\n\nSo, percentage change in gravity is roughly \\( -2 \\times 0.09375\\% = -0.1875\\% \\).\n\nTherefore, the weight on the mountain would be approximately:\n\n\\[ W_{\\text{mountain}} = W_{\\text{sea}} \\times (1 - 0.001875) = 30 \\times 0.998125 \\approx 29.94 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nAgain, this is very close to 30 N.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 30 N is one of them, but I wonder if there's a different way to interpret this. Maybe considering that gravity also decreases with the square of the distance, but in this case, since the height is small compared to the radius, the decrease is negligible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to test something else. Let me read the question again: \"Which of the following is the best estimate of the textbook\u2019s weight on a mountain peak located 6,000 m above sea level?\"\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 60 N\n\nB. 15 N\n\nC. 30 N\n\nD. 7.5 N\n\nGiven that, and my calculations showing that the weight should be approximately 29.94 N, which is very close to 30 N, I would think that the answer is C. 30 N.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a different consideration here. Perhaps the question expects to account for atmospheric pressure or something else, but I don't think that affects weight. Weight is solely due to gravity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is flawed, or perhaps I'm missing something fundamental. Let me think differently.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is about the difference in weight due to the centrifugal force from Earth's rotation, but that seems unlikely, and probably not significant compared to the gravitational effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects to use the approximation that gravity decreases linearly with height, but I don't think that's accurate. Gravity decreases with the square of the distance from the center of the Earth.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I know that weight remains the same regardless of altitude, but that's not correct. Weight does change with altitude, although the change is small for practical heights.\n\nGiven that, and my calculations showing that the weight decreases by only about 0.19% for a 6 km increase in altitude, I think that 30 N is the best estimate among the given options.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option C. 30 N.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
