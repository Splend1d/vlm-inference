                    "text": "So Kate has a coin collection, and she keeps 7 coins in a box. This box contains only 5% of her entire collection. I need to find out the total number of coins in her collection. The options are 12, 14, 120, and 140.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 5% means. Percentage is a way to express a fraction of 100, so 5% is the same as 5 out of 100, or 5/100, which simplifies to 1/20. That means the 7 coins in the box represent 1/20 of her total collection.\n\nSo, if 7 coins are 1/20 of the total, then the total number of coins should be 7 multiplied by 20. Let me do that calculation: 7 times 20 is 140. So, the total number of coins should be 140.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If 7 is 5% of the total, then to find 100%, I can divide 7 by 5% and that should give me the total. So, 7 divided by 5% is the same as 7 divided by 0.05.\n\nLet me calculate that: 7 divided by 0.05. Well, dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20, because 0.05 times 20 is 1. So again, 7 times 20 is 140.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, the total number of coins is 140.\n\nNow, looking at the options, 140 is option D. But there are other options: 12, 14, and 120. I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If 7 coins are 5% of the total, then what is 1% of the total? Well, 1% would be 7 divided by 5, which is 1.4 coins. Then, to find 100%, I multiply 1.4 by 100, which is 140 coins. Again, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up an equation. Let\u2019s let T be the total number of coins. Then, 5% of T is 7 coins. So, 0.05 * T = 7. To find T, I divide both sides by 0.05: T = 7 / 0.05, which is 140.\n\nAll these methods lead me to the same conclusion that the total number of coins is 140.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if 7 is indeed 5% of 140. Well, 5% of 140 is 0.05 times 140, which is 7. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 140, which is option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
