Voltage clamping devices, such as varistors or transient voltage suppressors (TVS diodes), are designed to protect electronic circuits from voltage spikes by diverting the excess voltage away from sensitive components. When an overvoltage occurs, these devices quickly reduce their impedance to allow the current to flow through them, thereby clamping the voltage to a safe level. Therefore, the correct answer is B. low."
