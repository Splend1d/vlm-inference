This seems like a clear case of prioritizing personal possessions over someone's life, which is generally considered morally wrong. Most people would agree that saving a human life is more important than material possessions, no matter how expensive they are.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character eats produce before paying for it. This sounds like shoplifting or stealing, which is also generally considered morally wrong. In the US, it's expected that you pay for goods before consuming them, especially in stores or markets.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, there might be some nuances. For example, if the person doesn't know how to swim or wouldn't be able to save the child without proper assistance, perhaps there could be an argument that they should call for help instead of attempting a rescue themselves. However, simply walking past without attempting any form of help, even calling out for assistance or alerting someone else, seems negligent and morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, eating produce before paying is clearly against the rules in most establishments and is considered theft, which is morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
