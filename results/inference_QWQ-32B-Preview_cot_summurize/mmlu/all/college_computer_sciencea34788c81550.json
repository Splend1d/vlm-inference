                    "text": "Let's see what's being asked here. We have a height-balanced binary search tree, which means that for any node in the tree, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one. We need to determine which of the statements I, II, III, and IV are true for such a tree.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of binary search trees (BSTs) and what it means for them to be height-balanced.\n\nA binary search tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In a BST, the key in each node is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree. This property allows for efficient search operations.\n\nA height-balanced BST is a BST where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This balancing ensures that the tree remains approximately sorted in a way that keeps the tree's height as small as possible.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: Worst-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n\nIn a height-balanced BST, the height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. Since the search operation in a BST takes time proportional to the height of the tree in the worst case, and the height is logarithmic in the number of nodes, the worst-case search time is indeed logarithmic in the number of nodes.\n\nSo, statement I is true.\n\n**Statement II: Average-case search time is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n\nIn a height-balanced BST, the average-case search time is also logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the tree is balanced, and the keys are distributed in a way that minimizes the average search time.\n\nSo, statement II is true.\n\n**Statement III: Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.**\n\nThe best-case search time in any BST occurs when the element being searched for is the root node. In this case, the search time is O(1), which is constant time, not proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nTherefore, statement III is false.\n\n**Statement IV: The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes.**\n\nIn a height-balanced BST, the height is indeed logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is a fundamental property of balanced trees, which ensures that operations like search, insert, and delete can be performed efficiently.\n\nSo, statement IV is true.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. I and III only\n\nB. II and III only\n\nC. II and IV only\n\nD. I, II, and IV\n\nGiven that statements I, II, and IV are true, and statement III is false, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and IV.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check statement III again to make sure.\n\n**Statement III: Best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.**\n\nAs I thought earlier, the best-case search time is when the element is found at the root, which is O(1) time. The height of the tree is log n in a balanced BST, but O(1) is not proportional to log n, except in the case where the tree has only one node, but generally, it's not.\n\nTherefore, statement III is indeed false.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. I, II, and IV.\n\nBut let's see if there's any other perspective.\n\nIs there any scenario where the best-case search time could be proportional to the height of the tree?\n\nWell, if the element is at the root, it's O(1), which is not proportional to the height unless the height is a constant, which it is in a balanced BST, but still, O(1) is considered constant time.\n\nAlternatively, if the element is at the deepest level, the search time would be proportional to the height of the tree, but that would be the worst-case scenario, not the best-case.\n\nTherefore, the best-case search time is O(1), and it's not proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nHence, statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and IV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
