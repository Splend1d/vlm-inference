                    "text": "So I've got this polynomial: 2x^5 + 8x - 7. I need to figure out how many real roots it has. The options are none, one, two, or three. Hmm.\n\nFirst off, I know that for polynomials, the maximum number of real roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial. Here, it's a 5th-degree polynomial, so it could have up to 5 real roots. But the options only go up to three, so maybe some of them are complex.\n\nI recall that complex roots come in conjugate pairs for polynomials with real coefficients. So if there are any complex roots, they have to be even in number.\n\nGiven that, if there are two complex roots, then the number of real roots would be 5 - 2 = 3. If there are four complex roots, then real roots would be 5 - 4 = 1. Or all five could be real.\n\nBut the options are none, one, two, or three. So perhaps the polynomial has either one or three real roots.\n\nWait, option A is none, which would imply all roots are complex. But since the degree is odd (5), and polynomials of odd degree always have at least one real root, because the ends of the graph go off in opposite directions. So, there must be at least one real root. Therefore, option A is impossible.\n\nSo, we can eliminate option A.\n\nNow, between options B, C, and D, which are one, two, or three real roots.\n\nI think I can use Descartes' Rule of Signs to get some information about the possible number of positive and negative real roots.\n\nFirst, let's look for positive real roots.\n\nI'll look at the polynomial: 2x^5 + 8x - 7.\n\nLooking at the signs: +, +, -.\n\nSo, the sign changes from + to - between the last two terms.\n\nThat's one sign change.\n\nAccording to Descartes' Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots is equal to the number of sign changes, or less than that by a multiple of 2.\n\nSo, here, it's 1 sign change, so there is exactly one positive real root.\n\nNow, for negative real roots, I'll look at p(-x).\n\nSo, p(-x) = 2(-x)^5 + 8(-x) - 7 = -2x^5 - 8x - 7.\n\nSigns: -, -, -.\n\nNo sign changes here.\n\nSo, according to Descartes, if there are no sign changes, there are no negative real roots.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial has exactly one positive real root and no negative real roots.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that polynomials of odd degree must have at least one real root, which matches with this analysis.\n\nBut the options include one or three real roots.\n\nWait, but according to this, it's only one real root.\n\nBut perhaps there are more.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think about the derivative to understand the behavior of the function.\n\nThe derivative of p(x) = 2x^5 + 8x - 7 is p'(x) = 10x^4 + 8.\n\nNow, 10x^4 is always non-negative, and 8 is positive, so p'(x) is always positive.\n\nThat means the function is always increasing.\n\nAn always increasing function can cross the x-axis only once.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one real root.\n\nSo, the answer should be option B, one real root.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nSuppose I try to plot the function or evaluate it at some points to see where it crosses the x-axis.\n\nLet's evaluate p(0):\n\np(0) = 2(0)^5 + 8(0) - 7 = -7.\n\np(1) = 2(1)^5 + 8(1) - 7 = 2 + 8 - 7 = 3.\n\nSo, p(0) is negative, p(1) is positive, so there's at least one root between 0 and 1.\n\nSince the function is always increasing, it can only cross the x-axis once.\n\nTherefore, there is only one real root.\n\nSo, the answer is B. One.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
