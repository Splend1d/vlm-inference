                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario involving a plumbing company and one of its workers. So, the worker uses his own truck to go between the warehouse and construction sites, and the company attached a rack to his truck for carrying plumbing pipes. The company pays him for the travel between the warehouse and the sites but not for his commute to and from work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the worker and the company. The question mentions that the worker was hired by the plumbing company to work at various construction sites, and the company paid him for certain travel times. It doesn't specify whether he's an employee or an independent contractor, but option B suggests that he might be considered an independent contractor. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThe company asked the worker if he had a valid driver's license before hiring him because he would be required to haul pipes on his truck between the warehouse and construction sites. The worker falsely claimed to have a valid license, but the company didn't verify this information. It turns out his license was suspended due to reckless driving and causing motor vehicle collisions.\n\nOne morning, while driving to work, the worker carelessly caused a collision that injured a woman. Now, she's suing the plumbing company based on the theory of negligent hiring.\n\nI need to determine whether she is likely to prevail in her lawsuit. The options are:\n\nA. No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.\n\nB. No, because the worker was an independent contractor.\n\nC. Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.\n\nD. Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A suggests that the company's duty of reasonable care in hiring a competent driver only applies to actions within the scope of employment. So, if the worker was driving to work but not yet on the company's time, maybe the company isn't liable. But I need to think about when the scope of employment begins. Generally, traveling to and from work isn't considered within the scope of employment, but once the worker starts their work duties, it is. However, since the worker was driving his truck, which was modified by the company for carrying pipes, and he was en route to the warehouse, it might be arguable that his drive was connected to his employment.\n\nOption B states that the worker was an independent contractor, which might affect the company's liability. If he's an independent contractor, the company may have less control over his actions and therefore less liability for his conduct. But the question doesn't explicitly say he's an independent contractor; it just says \"hired a worker,\" which could mean employee or contractor. Option B seems speculative.\n\nOption C says yes, the company is liable because they fitted the truck with a pipe rack. I'm not sure about this. Modifying the truck for work purposes might indicate that the company had some control over the worker's use of the vehicle, but I don't know if that directly imposes liability for his driving actions outside of work duties.\n\nOption D claims that the company had a duty to ensure workers had valid driver's licenses. If that's the case, and they failed to verify the worker's license, then they might be liable for hiring someone who shouldn't have been driving.\n\nLet me consider the legal principle of negligent hiring. Negligent hiring occurs when an employer hires an employee who they knew or should have known presented an unreasonable risk of harm to others, and that employee causes harm within the scope of their employment.\n\nIn this case, the company asked about the worker's driver's license but didn't verify it. The worker misrepresented having a valid license, which was suspended due to reckless driving. So, the company should have known about the risk if they had verified his license.\n\nThe collision occurred while the worker was driving to work, not yet on the company's time, but he was driving a truck modified by the company and was en route to the warehouse.\n\nI need to consider whether the company owed a duty to ensure that the worker had a valid driver's license, especially since they required him to drive for work purposes.\n\nOption D seems plausible, but I need to think about it more carefully.\n\nAlso, option A mentions that the duty of reasonable care in hiring extends only to actions within the scope of employment. So, if the collision happened before the worker began his work duties, maybe the company isn't liable.\n\nBut, on the other hand, the worker was driving a company-modified vehicle to the workplace, which might be considered part of his employment duties.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps I should look at case law or legal principles related to negligent hiring and scope of employment.\n\nIn general, employers can be liable for the negligent acts of their employees if those acts occur within the scope of employment. The scope of employment generally includes actions that are intended to further the employer's business and that occur during the period of employment.\n\nIn this scenario, the worker was driving to work, which might be considered \"premise activity\" or \"coming to work,\" which is generally not within the scope of employment.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions might hold employers liable for accidents that occur during commute times if the employee is using a company vehicle or is engaged in work-related activities.\n\nIn this case, the worker was using his own vehicle, but it was modified by the company for work purposes. So, maybe there's an argument to be made that the vehicle was being used, at least in part, for work purposes even during the commute.\n\nAdditionally, the company knew that the worker would be driving as part of his job, hence the requirement for a driver's license. By not verifying his license, they may have breached a duty of care in hiring him.\n\nOption D seems attractive, but I need to consider whether the company had a duty to ensure that the worker had a valid license.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, employers who require employees to drive as part of their job have a duty to verify that the employees have valid driver's licenses and a safe driving record.\n\nGiven that the company asked about the license but didn't verify it, and the worker had a history of reckless driving, it seems plausible that the company could be held liable for negligent hiring.\n\nNow, considering that the accident occurred before the worker started his work duties, but he was en route to the workplace in a vehicle modified for work purposes, it's possible that the court could find a sufficient connection between the employment and the accident to impose liability on the company.\n\nTherefore, option D might be the correct answer: yes, the woman is likely to prevail because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses, and they failed to do so.\n\nOption C, about the company fitting the truck with a pipe rack, seems less directly related to the negligent hiring claim. It's more about the company's involvement with the vehicle, but not directly with the hiring decision.\n\nOption B, about the worker being an independent contractor, isn't definitively stated, and even if he were, the company still may have a duty to ensure that contractors they hire have valid licenses if they're required to drive as part of the work.\n\nOption A suggests that the duty of reasonable care only extends to actions within the scope of employment, but given the circumstances, it's possible that the court could find that the accident was sufficiently connected to the employment to fall within the scope.\n\nAfter considering all this, I think option D is the most likely correct answer: yes, the woman is likely to prevail because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses."
