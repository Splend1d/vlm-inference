The options are:\n\nA. manufacturing goods where production costs are the highest.\n\nB. conducting accounting and research services where economical.\n\nC. based on comparative advantage.\n\nD. with headquarters located in LDCs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what transnational corporations (TNCs) are. They are companies that operate in multiple countries, having headquarters in one country and operations spread across others. They aim to maximize profits by taking advantage of differences in costs, markets, and regulations across countries.\n\nOption A suggests that TNCs manufacture goods where production costs are the highest. That doesn't make much sense because generally, companies look to minimize costs to maximize profits. So, manufacturing where costs are highest would be counterintuitive. Maybe this is a trick option to make sure we understand basic economics.\n\nOption B says conducting accounting and research services where economical. This seems plausible. TNCs might locate their back-office functions like accounting and research in places where these services can be provided economically, perhaps in countries with lower labor costs or specific skills.\n\nOption C mentions distributing operations based on comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is an economic concept where a country can produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another country. TNCs often exploit comparative advantages by locating different parts of their operations in countries where they can get the most efficiency or cost savings. This sounds very much like what TNCs do.\n\nOption D says TNCs have headquarters located in LDCs, which stands for Least Developed Countries. LDCs are countries with low income, human resource weaknesses, and high economic vulnerability. It's unlikely for TNCs to have their headquarters in such countries because headquarters usually require a stable business environment, access to talent, and often need to be close to major markets or the home country of the company. So, this seems improbable.\n\nBetween options B and C, both seem reasonable, but I think C is more comprehensive. While B refers to specific services being conducted where economical, C refers to the overall distribution of operations based on comparative advantage, which could include not just services but also manufacturing, R&D, marketing, and more.\n\nMoreover, comparative advantage is a fundamental principle in international trade and investment, and TNCs are known to use this strategy to optimize their global operations.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is C: based on comparative advantage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
