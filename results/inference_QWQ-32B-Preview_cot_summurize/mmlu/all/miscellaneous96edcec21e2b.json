So, if you have a queen and a king, together they would be worth 20 points.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 20.\n\nBut let's make sure we understand this properly. In blackjack, the values of the cards are as follows:\n\n- Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their face value.\n\n- Face cards (jack, queen, king) are each worth 10 points.\n\n- Aces can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the player's hand the most.\n\nSo, in this case, since both a queen and a king are face cards, each is worth 10, making a total of 20.\n\nOption A, 11, might be confusing because it's the value of an ace in some scenarios, but here, we're dealing with face cards, not aces.\n\nOption B, 15, doesn't make sense in this context, as 10 plus 10 is 20, not 15.\n\nOption D, 21, is a common target score in blackjack, but it's not the sum of a queen and a king, which is 20.\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed C. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
