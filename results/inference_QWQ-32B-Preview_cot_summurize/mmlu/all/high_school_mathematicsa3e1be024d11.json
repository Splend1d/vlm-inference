                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a cube with six positive integers written on its faces. Each vertex of the cube is labeled with the product of the three numbers on the faces adjacent to that vertex. The sum of all the vertex products is 1001, and we need to find the sum of the numbers on the faces.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of a cube. A cube has 6 faces and 8 vertices. Each vertex is the intersection of 3 faces.\n\nLet's denote the six faces of the cube as follows:\n\n- Front: a\n\n- Back: b\n\n- Top: c\n\n- Bottom: d\n\n- Left: e\n\n- Right: f\n\nSo, each face has a positive integer assigned to it: a, b, c, d, e, f.\n\nNow, each vertex is the intersection of three faces. There are eight vertices, so let's try to list them and their corresponding products.\n\nLet's visualize the cube:\n\nImagine the cube with front face a, back face b, top face c, bottom face d, left face e, and right face f.\n\nThe vertices can be labeled based on which faces they are adjacent to.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Vertex where front (a), top (c), and left (e) meet: product is a * c * e\n\n2. Vertex where front (a), top (c), and right (f) meet: a * c * f\n\n3. Vertex where front (a), bottom (d), and left (e) meet: a * d * e\n\n4. Vertex where front (a), bottom (d), and right (f) meet: a * d * f\n\n5. Vertex where back (b), top (c), and left (e) meet: b * c * e\n\n6. Vertex where back (b), top (c), and right (f) meet: b * c * f\n\n7. Vertex where back (b), bottom (d), and left (e) meet: b * d * e\n\n8. Vertex where back (b), bottom (d), and right (f) meet: b * d * f\n\nNow, the sum of these vertex products is given as 1001.\n\nSo, we have:\n\na*c*e + a*c*f + a*d*e + a*d*f + b*c*e + b*c*f + b*d*e + b*d*f = 1001\n\nOur goal is to find the sum of the face numbers: a + b + c + d + e + f.\n\nHmm, it seems like there's a relationship here that we can exploit.\n\nLet's see if we can factor the sum of the vertex products.\n\nLooking at the expression:\n\na*c*e + a*c*f + a*d*e + a*d*f + b*c*e + b*c*f + b*d*e + b*d*f\n\nI notice that we can group terms:\n\n= a*c*(e + f) + a*d*(e + f) + b*c*(e + f) + b*d*(e + f)\n\n= (a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d)*(e + f)\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check.\n\nActually, factoring e + f from the first two and last two terms:\n\n= a*c*e + a*c*f + a*d*e + a*d*f + b*c*e + b*c*f + b*d*e + b*d*f\n\n= a*c*(e + f) + a*d*(e + f) + b*c*(e + f) + b*d*(e + f)\n\n= (a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d)*(e + f)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's look at a*c + a*d + b*c + b*d.\n\nWe can factor this further:\n\n= a*(c + d) + b*(c + d)\n\n= (a + b)*(c + d)\n\nSo, the sum of the vertex products is:\n\n(a + b)*(c + d)*(e + f) = 1001\n\nAnd we need to find a + b + c + d + e + f.\n\nAlright, so now we have:\n\n(a + b) * (c + d) * (e + f) = 1001\n\nAnd we need to find a + b + c + d + e + f.\n\nSince a, b, c, d, e, f are positive integers, their sums (a + b), (c + d), (e + f) are also positive integers greater than or equal to 2.\n\nWe need to factor 1001 into three positive integers.\n\nFirst, let's factorize 1001.\n\n1001 divided by 7 is 143, since 7*143 = 1001.\n\n143 divided by 11 is 13, since 11*13 = 143.\n\nSo, 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13\n\nTherefore, (a + b), (c + d), (e + f) are 7, 11, and 13 in some order.\n\nNow, the sum of all face numbers is:\n\na + b + c + d + e + f = (a + b) + (c + d) + (e + f) = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31\n\nWait, but let's check if this makes sense.\n\nIs it possible for (a + b), (c + d), (e + f) to be 7, 11, and 13?\n\nYes, since all are positive integers greater than or equal to 2.\n\nSo, the sum is 7 + 11 + 13 = 31.\n\nBut let's verify if this is indeed correct.\n\nSuppose (a + b) = 7, (c + d) = 11, (e + f) = 13.\n\nThen, a + b + c + d + e + f = 7 + 11 + 13 = 31.\n\nAnd (a + b)*(c + d)*(e + f) = 7*11*13 = 1001, which matches the given sum of vertex products.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose different assignments for (a + b), (c + d), (e + f), such as 11, 13, 7 or any other order, the sum remains the same: 11 + 13 + 7 = 31.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numbers written on the faces is 31.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 18\n\nB. 13\n\nC. 1001\n\nD. 31\n\nThe correct answer is D. 31.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
