                    "text": "This is a tricky situation for Dr. Ryan. She needs to consider ethical guidelines and professional boundaries, especially given her past personal relationship with the man who is seeking therapy.\n\nFirst, it's important to recognize that Dr. Ryan and this man had a sexual relationship in the past. Even though it was several years ago and the relationship ended amicably, there is still a potential for conflict of interest or boundary issues in a therapeutic relationship.\n\nOption A suggests that Dr. Ryan can see the man only if she determines that their past relationship won't interfere with her objectivity. This seems reasonable, but self-assessment can sometimes be unreliable. It's possible for unconscious biases or feelings to influence her judgment, even if she believes she can be objective.\n\nOption B adds a time constraint, suggesting that she can see him only if their relationship ended more than two years ago and she determines it won't interfere with her objectivity. However, the two-year timeframe seems arbitrary, and the core issue remains the potential for bias or conflict, regardless of how much time has passed.\n\nOption C proposes that Dr. Ryan can see the man but should discuss the potential for conflicts with him before beginning treatment. This approach acknowledges the past relationship and allows for open communication about how it might affect the therapeutic process. It could be a way to manage any potential issues, but it still carries risks.\n\nOption D is to refer the man to a colleague. This seems like the most prudent choice to avoid any potential complications arising from their past relationship. By referring him to another therapist, Dr. Ryan avoids any conflict of interest and ensures that the man receives care from someone without this personal history.\n\nConsidering the ethical principles of psychology, such as beneficence, nonmaleficence, and fidelity, it's crucial to prioritize the welfare of the client and maintain professional boundaries. Given that Dr. Ryan had a personal relationship with this individual, even if it was in the past, there is a potential for dual relationships or boundary issues that could compromise the therapeutic relationship.\n\nTherefore, the best course of action would be to refer the man to a colleague, which aligns with option D. This ensures that the man receives appropriate care without the complications that could arise from Dr. Ryan's past involvement with him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
