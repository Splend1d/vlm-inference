                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false, and then see which option matches my conclusions.\n\n**Statement 1:** Every nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of bases.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a free abelian group is. A free abelian group is a group that has a basis, meaning it's isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of the integers, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). The number of copies in the direct sum is the rank of the group.\n\nSo, a nonzero free abelian group has a positive rank, say \\(r\\), and it's isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^r\\).\n\nNow, the question is whether \\(\\mathbb{Z}^r\\) has an infinite number of bases for any \\(r > 0\\).\n\nLet's consider the case when \\(r = 1\\). Then the group is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), and its bases are the generators of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), which are \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\). That's only two bases, which is finite. So, for \\(r = 1\\), the statement is false.\n\nBut wait, the statement says \"every nonzero free abelian group,\" and in this case, for \\(r = 1\\), it doesn't have an infinite number of bases. So, Statement 1 seems to be false.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases.\n\nNow, let's consider free abelian groups with rank \\(r \\geq 2\\). So, the group is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}^r\\) where \\(r \\geq 2\\).\n\nI need to determine if \\(\\mathbb{Z}^r\\) has an infinite number of bases for \\(r \\geq 2\\).\n\nA basis for \\(\\mathbb{Z}^r\\) is a set of \\(r\\) linearly independent vectors over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Two bases are related by an invertible integer matrix (an element of \\(GL(r, \\mathbb{Z})\\)).\n\nThe number of bases is equal to the number of such matrices.\n\nNow, \\(GL(r, \\mathbb{Z})\\), the general linear group over the integers, is infinite for \\(r \\geq 2\\). This is because there are infinitely many integer matrices with determinant \\(\\pm1\\).\n\nFor example, consider \\(r = 2\\). The matrix \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\) has determinant 1 for any integer \\(n\\), and there are infinitely many such matrices as \\(n\\) varies over all integers.\n\nSimilarly, for higher ranks, there are infinitely many such matrices.\n\nTherefore, for \\(r \\geq 2\\), there are indeed infinitely many bases.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
