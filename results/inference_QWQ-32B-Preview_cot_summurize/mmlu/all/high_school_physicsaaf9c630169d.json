In this case, the alarm is the source of sound, and the student is the observer.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The alarm has a frequency of 400 Hz.\n   - It's dropped out of a third-floor window, so it's falling towards the ground.\n   - The student measures the frequency using an oscilloscope.\n\n2. **Understanding the Doppler Effect:**\n   - When the source and the observer are moving towards each other, the observed frequency is higher than the source frequency.\n   - When they are moving apart, the observed frequency is lower.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Scenario:**\n   - As the alarm falls, it's moving towards the student (assuming the student is on the ground or at least stationary relative to the window).\n   - Therefore, the observed frequency should be higher than 400 Hz.\n\n4. **Considering the Motion:**\n   - The alarm is accelerating downwards due to gravity.\n   - Its velocity increases as it falls.\n\n5. **Effect on Frequency:**\n   - Since the source (alarm) is moving towards the observer (student) with increasing speed, the observed frequency should increase over time.\n\n6. **Evaluating the Options:**\n   - A: Higher than 400 Hz and frequency increases as it falls.\n   - B: Higher than 400 Hz but frequency decreases as it falls.\n   - C: Lower than 400 Hz and frequency decreases as it falls.\n   - D: Lower than 400 Hz but frequency increases as it falls.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct choice should be A: appears higher than 400 Hz and the frequency increases as it falls.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any other factor that might affect this.\n\n7. **Frame of Reference:**\n   - The student is measuring the frequency from a stationary position.\n   - The alarm is moving towards the student with increasing velocity.\n\n8. **Doppler Shift Formula:**\n   - For sound, the observed frequency \\( f' \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     f' = f \\left( \\frac{v}{v - u_s} \\right)\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - \\( f \\) is the source frequency (400 Hz),\n     - \\( v \\) is the speed of sound,\n     - \\( u_s \\) is the velocity of the source (positive when moving towards the observer).\n\n   - As \\( u_s \\) increases (alarm falls faster), the denominator \\( v - u_s \\) decreases, making \\( f' \\) increase.\n\nTherefore, the observed frequency increases as the alarm falls faster.\n\n9. **Conclusion:**\n   - The frequency appears higher than 400 Hz.\n   - The frequency increases as the alarm falls.\n\nThus, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
