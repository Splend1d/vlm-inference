In solids, this process primarily involves the vibration of atoms or molecules, as well as the movement of free electrons in metals. Let's consider each option to determine which particles are mainly involved in thermal conduction.\n\nOption A: Electrons\n\nIn metals, thermal conduction is largely due to the movement of free electrons. These electrons carry heat energy as they move from hotter to cooler regions of the material. However, in non-metallic solids, thermal conduction is mainly due to lattice vibrations, not electron movement. So, while electrons play a significant role in thermal conduction in metals, they are not the only particles involved in all materials.\n\nOption B: Protons\n\nProtons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of atoms. They do not move freely within materials like electrons do, and their role in thermal conduction is negligible. Thermal conduction involves the transfer of energy through particle vibrations or movements, but protons are relatively stationary in the lattice structure of solids.\n\nOption C: Neutrons\n\nNeutrons are neutral particles found in the nucleus of atoms. Like protons, they do not move freely and do not participate significantly in the transfer of heat through thermal conduction.\n\nOption D: Ions\n\nIn non-metallic solids, thermal conduction occurs primarily through the vibration of atoms or ions in the lattice structure. When one part of the material is heated, the atoms vibrate more vigorously and transfer this energy to neighboring atoms through interatomic bonds. Therefore, ions play a crucial role in thermal conduction in these materials.\n\nConsidering all options, the particles mainly involved in thermal conduction are both electrons (in metals) and ions (in non-metallic solids). However, since the question asks for the main particles involved in thermal conduction and provides options that are singular, we need to choose the most comprehensive answer.\n\nGiven that ions are involved in thermal conduction in a wider range of materials (including non-metals), and electrons are primarily involved in metals, ions might be considered the main particles involved in thermal conduction across different materials.\n\nBut to be precise, in metals, electrons are the primary carriers of heat through thermal conduction, while in non-metals, ions are the main carriers. Since the question does not specify the type of material, the most accurate answer would be ions, as they are involved in thermal conduction in both metallic and non-metallic solids, whereas electrons are\u4e3b\u8981 in metals only.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. ions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
