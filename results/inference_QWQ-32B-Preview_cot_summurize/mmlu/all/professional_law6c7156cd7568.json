                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what kind of interest the state has in this tract of virgin forest based on the description provided. The environmentalist conveyed the tract \"to the people of the state in fee simple; provided, however, that if any portion of said tract shall ever be used or developed for any commercial purpose or otherwise converted from its natural state (with exception for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes), then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key terms here. A \"fee simple\" is the most complete form of ownership in real property. It's a perpetual ownership interest that can be inherited and passed on. However, in this case, there's a condition attached: the land must not be used for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state, except for recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the best description of the state's interest in the tract. The options are:\n\nA. fee simple determinable.\n\nB. fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nC. easement appurtenant.\n\nD. determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Fee simple determinable.\n\nA fee simple determinable is an estate that automatically terminates when a specified event occurs, without any action required by the grantor. The estate reverts back to the grantor or their heirs immediately upon the occurrence of the condition.\n\nIn this case, the condition is that the land not be used for commercial purposes or converted from its natural state, except for certain allowed purposes. If this condition is violated, according to a fee simple determinable, the ownership would automatically revert to the grantor or their successors.\n\nHowever, in the given scenario, it says that \"the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate.\" This suggests that the grantor has the right to re-enter, which implies that the interest doesn't automatically revert but requires some action by the grantor to reclaim the estate.\n\nTherefore, a fee simple determinable might not be the best fit here because it typically involves an automatic reversion of the estate upon the occurrence of the condition.\n\nOption B: Fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nA fee simple subject to condition subsequent is similar to a fee simple determinable in that it's conditioned on the occurrence of a specified event. However, unlike a determinable fee, the estate doesn't automatically terminate when the condition is breached. Instead, the original grantor or their heirs retain a right of entry, meaning they have the power to reclaim the property upon the breach of the condition.\n\nIn this case, the language \"may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate\" suggests that the grantor has the option to reclaim the property if the condition is violated. This aligns more closely with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, where the grantor retains the right to re-enter upon breach.\n\nOption C: Easement appurtenant.\n\nAn easement appurtenant is a right that allows one party to use another party's land for a specific purpose, and it benefits the land to which it is attached. This doesn't seem to fit the scenario because the conveyance is of the entire tract to the state, not just a right to use it for a specific purpose.\n\nOption D: Determinable fee subject to an executory interest.\n\nThis is a bit more complex. A determinable fee is similar to a fee simple determinable, where the estate automatically terminates upon the occurrence of a specified event. An executory interest is a future interest held by a third party that becomes possessory when a certain condition is met.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no mention of a third party or a future interest vesting in someone else. The interest seems to revert back to the grantor or their successors, which is more consistent with a fee simple determinable or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nHowever, given the language about the grantor's right to re-enter, it seems more akin to a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, where the grantor retains the right to reclaim the property rather than having it automatically revert.\n\nComparing options A and B, the key difference is whether the estate automatically reverts or if the grantor has to take action to reclaim it.\n\nIn this case, since it says \"may re-enter,\" it suggests that the grantor has the option to reclaim the estate, which is characteristic of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. fee simple subject to condition subsequent.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Fee simple determinable: automatic reversion upon condition breach.\n\n- Fee simple subject to condition subsequent: grantor retains right to re-enter upon condition breach.\n\nGiven the language in the conveyance, option B is the most appropriate description of the state's interest in the tract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
