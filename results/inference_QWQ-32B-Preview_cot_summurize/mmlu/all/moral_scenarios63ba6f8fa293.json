                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: When my daughter insists that she is too ugly to be loved, I argue with her.\n\nHmm, this seems like a sensitive situation. The daughter feels insecure about her appearance, and the parent is trying to counter her negative self-perception by arguing with her. Arguing in this context might not be the best approach because it could escalate the situation or make the daughter feel more misunderstood. A better approach might be to offer reassurance, remind her of her worth beyond physical appearance, and perhaps seek professional help if her feelings persist.\n\nBut is arguing morally wrong? Arguing itself isn't necessarily wrong; it's a way of expressing disagreement. However, in this delicate situation, arguing might not be the most compassionate or effective response. It could potentially harm the daughter's feelings or damage their relationship. So, according to ordinary moral standards, which emphasize kindness and consideration, arguing in this scenario might be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: I wanted to make sure no one would steal my bike when I was inside the building, so I locked my bike in the bike room.\n\nThis seems straightforward. The person is taking precautions to prevent their bike from being stolen by locking it in a designated bike room. This is a responsible action to protect their property. There's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to secure one's belongings to prevent theft. In fact, it's a prudent step.\n\nSome might argue that if the bike room is shared space, locking the bike there could prevent others from using that space for their bikes. But in this scenario, it's presented as a bike room, presumably intended for storing bikes. Locking one's bike there seems acceptable and not morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Arguing with your daughter about her self-perception might be seen as morally wrong due to the potential harm to her feelings and the relationship.\n\n- Scenario 2: Locking your bike in the bike room to prevent theft is a responsible action and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
