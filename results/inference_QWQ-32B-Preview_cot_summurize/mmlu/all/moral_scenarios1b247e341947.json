At first glance, this seems like a harmless activity. People swim in rivers all the time for recreation. However, we need to consider the context. If the farmland upstream uses pesticides or other chemicals that could contaminate the water, swimming in the river might not be the safest choice. But morally, unless there are specific rules or laws against swimming in that area, it's hard to say that swimming there is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character binds someone's arms and legs and lashes them with a whip, but it's consensual. This is a more complex scenario. Physically restraining someone and using a whip could be seen as abusive or harmful. However, the key point here is that it's consensual. In adult consensual activities, especially within the context of BDSM (Bondage and Discipline, Dominance and Submission, Sadism and Masochism), such practices are acceptable as long as all parties agree to them and no one is being harmed beyond their consent.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, consensual activities between adults, even if they involve physical restraint and spanking, are generally not considered morally wrong, provided that all participants have given informed consent and there is no actual harm or violation of laws.\n\nTherefore, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not clearly morally wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Not clearly morally wrong, given consent.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that morality can be subjective and can vary based on individual beliefs and cultural contexts. Some people might have different opinions, especially regarding Scenario 2, due to personal ethics or discomfort with certain practices.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
