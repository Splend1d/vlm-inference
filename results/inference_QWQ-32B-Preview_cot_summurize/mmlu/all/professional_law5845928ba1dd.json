A political group got a proposition on the ballot, and a majority of the people voted to eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry. The proposition did not affect any of the other rights that same-sex couples may have possessed from existing state law. Persons affected sued the state government for unconstitutionally taking away the rights that they had and doing it for no legitimate purpose, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Will the court grant the requests of the lawsuit and declare the proposition void and reinstate the rights of same-sex couples to marry?\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\nB. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment it would be an illegal interference against the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.\nC. No, because the people voted to take a provision out of the existing constitution and when that is done by public vote it cannot be altered.\nD. No, because the ballot proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, thus precluding the courts from taking adverse action.\n"

                    "text": "So here's this scenario: In a certain state, the constitution originally guaranteed the right to marry for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. But then, a political group managed to get a proposition on the ballot, and the majority of voters decided to remove that right for same-sex couples. Now, those affected are suing the state, saying that taking away their right to marry violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because there's no legitimate purpose for doing so.\n\nThe question is, will the court side with the plaintiffs and declare the proposition invalid, thereby restoring the right for same-sex couples to marry?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, under the due process clause, no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\n\nB. Yes, because under the Fourth Amendment, it would be an illegal interference with the right of privacy guaranteed to everyone.\n\nC. No, because the people voted to amend the constitution, and once that's done by public vote, it can't be altered.\n\nD. No, because the proposition was properly placed on the ballot and all statutory procedures were followed, which prevents the courts from intervening.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment says. It basically guarantees that states can't deprive people of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. So, if the right to marry is considered a fundamental right (which it is), then taking it away would require a really good reason, a compelling state interest.\n\nOption A suggests that no compelling interest justifies denying same-sex couples the right to marry. That sounds plausible, but I need to think about whether the courts would see it that way.\n\nOption B mentions the Fourth Amendment, which is about protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. That seems unrelated to marriage rights, so I doubt that's the right path.\n\nOption C says that once the people vote to amend the constitution, it can't be altered. But constitutions can be amended, and courts can interpret them. So, maybe not.\n\nOption D says that since the proposition followed all the statutory procedures, the courts can't do anything about it. But courts do review the constitutionality of laws, even if they were properly enacted.\n\nLet me think about the Supreme Court's stance on same-sex marriage. In Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same-sex couples as well, based on the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nBut in this hypothetical, it's about taking away a right that was already recognized in the state constitution. So, even if the state's voters decide to amend their constitution, can they take away a fundamental right without it being unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution?\n\nI think the answer is yes, in the sense that if the state constitution is amended through proper procedures, it's valid unless it violates some federal constitutional guarantee.\n\nGiven that Obergefell established that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry, it would seem that amending the state constitution to take that right away would violate the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTherefore, the court should invalidate the proposition and restore the right to marry for same-sex couples.\n\nSo, option A seems correct: under the due process clause, no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Fourth Amendment isn't about marriage or privacy in that context.\n\nOption C is incorrect because even if the people vote to amend the constitution, if that amendment violates federal constitutional rights, it can still be struck down by the courts.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because following proper procedures doesn't make an unconstitutional law valid.\n\nWait a minute, but in this hypothetical, the proposition didn't affect any other rights that same-sex couples have under state law, except for the right to marry. So, it's specifically about marriage.\n\nGiven that, and considering Obergefell, which established that bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, it would follow that reversing the right to marry for same-sex couples would also be unconstitutional.\n\nTherefore, the court should grant the plaintiffs' request and declare the proposition void.\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the state constitution is amended by voter approval to take away a right that's considered fundamental under the U.S. Constitution, doesn't that amendment conflict with federal law?\n\nAnd doesn't the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution mean that federal law trumps state law in such cases?\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, even if the state amendment process was followed properly, the resulting amendment would still be invalid to the extent that it violates federal constitutional rights.\n\nHence, the court should invalidate the proposition.\n\nOption A correctly identifies that no compelling state interest justifies denying same-sex couples the fundamental right to marry, as per the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
