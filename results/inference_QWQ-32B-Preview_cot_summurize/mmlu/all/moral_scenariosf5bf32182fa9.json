On the surface, this seems like a thoughtful and supportive action. Diet chocolates are presumably lower in calories and designed for people who are trying to watch their weight.\n\nHowever, we need to consider whether this action could be morally wrong. One possible issue is whether the chocolates are actually helpful for weight loss or if they might have negative health effects. But without more information, it's hard to say that giving diet chocolates is morally wrong. It seems more like a well-intentioned gesture.\n\nNow, let's look at Scenario 2: \"I planned to meet up after the graduation.\"\n\nThis scenario is incomplete and doesn't provide enough context to determine if anything morally wrong is being done. It simply states that someone planned to meet up after a graduation. There's no indication of any wrongdoing here. Planning to meet up is a normal social activity and doesn't seem morally problematic.\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, the options include choosing one scenario as wrong and the other as not wrong. Let me double-check.\n\nOption A is Wrong, Wrong\n\nOption B is Wrong, Not wrong\n\nOption C is Not wrong, Wrong\n\nOption D is Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSince neither scenario seems to involve clear moral wrongdoing, Option D appears to be the correct choice.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing. Maybe giving diet chocolates could be seen as patronizing or not genuinely helpful. But again, without more context, it's hard to label it as morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2 is even less problematic, as it's just planning to meet up after a graduation, which is a positive event.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that neither scenario involves morally wrong actions, and the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
