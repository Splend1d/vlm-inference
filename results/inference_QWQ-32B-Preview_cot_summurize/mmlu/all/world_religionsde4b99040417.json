                    "text": "I think the answer is C. Puritans. The Puritans were known for their desire to purify the Church of England from what they saw as Catholic practices and rituals. They preferred a simpler form of worship and religion, focusing more on the Bible and less on ceremonial aspects. So, a \"stripped-down\" Christianity would fit with their beliefs.\n\nBut let me think about the other options too. The Greek Orthodox Church has its own set of traditions and rituals, which might not be as simplified. Roman Catholics have a lot of ceremonies and a structured hierarchy, so that doesn't seem like a stripped-down version. Quakers, on the other hand, are also known for their simple worship services, often conducted in silence, waiting for divine inspiration.\n\nHmm, so both Puritans and Quakers promote a simpler form of Christianity. But the question specifies \"a stripped-down Christianity.\" Maybe Puritans are more about purifying existing structures, while Quakers go for a more minimalist approach, often conducting meetings without any predetermined ritual.\n\nI guess I need to decide which one is more about stripping down Christianity. Perhaps Quakers are more about eliminating all unnecessary elements, focusing solely on the inner light and direct communion with God, without the need for priests or elaborate ceremonies.\n\nOn the other hand, Puritans still maintained many Protestant practices but wanted to remove what they considered corrupt elements from the Church of England.\n\nMaybe Quakers are more about starting from scratch, rejecting all the established structures, while Puritans were about reforming the existing church.\n\nSo, if \"stripped-down Christianity\" means removing as much as possible to get to the essentials, Quakers might be a better fit.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up some information about both.\n\nPuritans were a group within the Church of England who sought to purify the church from what they perceived as Catholic remnants. They emphasized personal piety, moral purity, and strict adherence to biblical teachings. Their worship was simpler compared to the Anglican Church, with a focus on preaching and scripture.\n\nQuakers, or the Religious Society of Friends, were founded in the 17th century by George Fox. They rejected formal religious practices, such as creeds and sacraments, and emphasized the inner light of God within each person. Their meetings are often conducted in silence, waiting for anyone moved by the Spirit to speak.\n\nComparing the two, Quakers seem to have a more stripped-down approach, rejecting many traditional Christian practices altogether.\n\nBut perhaps the question is referring to the Puritans' approach to reforming the Church of England.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Greek Orthodox, but that seems unlikely because Greek Orthodoxy has its own rich traditions and ceremonies.\n\nRoman Catholic is definitely not stripped down, given its extensive rituals and hierarchy.\n\nSo, between Puritans and Quakers, I think Quakers fit the description of stripped-down Christianity better.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be D. Quakers.\n\nWait, but the options are:\n\nA. Greek Orthodox\n\nB. Roman Catholic\n\nC. Puritans\n\nD. Quakers\n\nSo, if I have to choose, I would go with D. Quakers.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing because Puritans also promoted a simpler form of worship.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to trick me by using \"stripped-down,\" which could imply not only simplicity but also a rejection of certain elements.\n\nPerhaps Puritans are more about purifying, while Quakers are more about stripping away traditional structures.\n\nI think Quakers are more about stripping down Christianity to its essentials, rejecting many traditional practices.\n\nSo, I'll go with D. Quakers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
