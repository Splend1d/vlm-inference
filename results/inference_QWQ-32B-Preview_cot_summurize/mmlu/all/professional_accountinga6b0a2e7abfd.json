                    "text": "I've got this question here about decision-making techniques for a manager trying to boost profitability in an area with limited machine capacity. Let's see what options are provided and think through which one would be most helpful in this scenario.\n\nOption A is the Theory of Constraints. I've heard about this before. It's basically about identifying the bottleneck in a system and then optimizing around it to maximize throughput. So, if there's a critical machine that's limiting production, this seems directly relevant. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nOption B is Economic Order Quantity, or EOQ. That's a model used to figure out the optimal order quantity that minimizes total inventory costs, including holding and ordering costs. While it's useful for inventory management, I'm not sure how directly it applies to increasing profitability in an area with limited machine capacity. It might be helpful indirectly, but perhaps not the best choice here.\n\nOption C is the Balanced Scorecard. This is a management tool that provides a framework to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization. It looks at performance from four perspectives: financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth. While it's a comprehensive approach, it might be too broad for addressing a specific issue like limited machine capacity affecting profitability.\n\nOption D is Cost-Variance Analysis. This is a method used to understand the difference between actual and planned costs. It's useful for controlling costs and identifying areas where costs are exceeding expectations. However, in this scenario, the issue is more about capacity constraints limiting production and profitability, not necessarily about cost overruns.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems like the Theory of Constraints (Option A) is the most directly applicable technique for a manager dealing with limited capacity of a critical machine and aiming to increase profitability. By identifying and managing the bottleneck, the manager can optimize the use of that machine and potentially increase overall output and profitability.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\n- Theory of Constraints: Focuses on bottlenecks, which aligns well with the limited capacity issue.\n\n- Economic Order Quantity: More about inventory optimization, which might not directly solve the capacity problem.\n\n- Balanced Scorecard: A broad strategic management tool, not specifically targeted at operational capacity issues.\n\n- Cost-Variance Analysis: Useful for cost control, but the problem seems more about capacity and profitability rather than cost deviations.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A, the Theory of Constraints.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
