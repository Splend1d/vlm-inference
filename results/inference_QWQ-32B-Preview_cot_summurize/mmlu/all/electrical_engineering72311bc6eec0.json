In such systems, the output is monitored and compared to the desired set point, and adjustments are made to minimize the difference between the two. This feedback mechanism is a key characteristic of closed-loop systems, distinguishing them from open-loop systems, which lack this feedback and therefore do not automatically correct for errors."
