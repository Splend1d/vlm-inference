So, the teacher starts by praising the student for playing the correct notes, and then only praises the student when they add proper dynamics and interpretation. Hmm, let's see what each option means.\n\nFirst, negative reinforcement. I think negative reinforcement is when you remove something unpleasant to encourage a behavior. Like, if the student plays correctly, the teacher stops scolding them. But in this case, the teacher is praising, which is more like positive reinforcement.\n\nNext, negative punishment. That's when you take away something good in response to a bad behavior. For example, if the student plays wrong notes, the teacher might stop the praise or take away a privilege. But here, the teacher is gradually changing what they praise, not taking anything away in response to bad behavior.\n\nNow, shaping. I've heard about shaping behavior, where you gradually reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior. So, starting with praising correct notes and then only praising when the student adds dynamics sounds a lot like shaping. The teacher is shaping the student's performance from just hitting the right notes to playing with expression.\n\nLastly, chaining. Chaining is when you teach a series of behaviors in sequence, linking them together. Like teaching the student to first sit at the piano, then open the sheet music, then play the notes, and so on. But in this scenario, it seems more about improving the quality of playing rather than linking separate actions.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like shaping is the most fitting description of the teacher's method. The teacher is gradually raising the standard for praise, moving from correct notes to include dynamics and interpretation, which are more advanced aspects of playing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
