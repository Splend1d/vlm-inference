                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Hall Co. purchasing a machine and depreciating it using the double-declining balance method. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the machine costs $140,000, has a useful life of eight years, and a salvage value of $60,000. They're using the double-declining balance method, and I need to find the carrying amount at the end of the second year.\n\nOkay, so with the double-declining balance method, depreciation is accelerated, meaning more depreciation happens in the early years of an asset's life.\n\nFirst, I need to find the straight-line depreciation rate. Since the useful life is eight years, the straight-line rate would be 100% divided by 8, which is 12.5% per year.\n\nBut for the double-declining balance method, we double that rate. So, 12.5% times 2 is 25% per year.\n\nNow, to find the depreciation for each year, I'll apply this 25% rate to the book value at the beginning of the year.\n\nLet's start with year one:\n\nBook value at the beginning of year 1: $140,000\n\nDepreciation for year 1: 25% of $140,000 = 0.25 * 140,000 = $35,000\n\nSo, at the end of year 1, the book value would be:\n\n$140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000\n\nNow, moving to year two:\n\nBook value at the beginning of year 2: $105,000\n\nDepreciation for year 2: 25% of $105,000 = 0.25 * 105,000 = $26,250\n\nTherefore, at the end of year 2, the book value would be:\n\n$105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that with the double-declining balance method, you can't depreciate below the salvage value. So, I need to check if this $78,750 is above the salvage value.\n\nThe salvage value is $60,000, and $78,750 is greater than $60,000, so that's fine. I don't need to switch to straight-line depreciation yet.\n\nSo, according to this, the carrying amount at the end of the second year should be $78,750.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nYear 1:\n\n$140,000 * 25% = $35,000 depreciation\n\n$140,000 - $35,000 = $105,000 book value end of year 1\n\nYear 2:\n\n$105,000 * 25% = $26,250 depreciation\n\n$105,000 - $26,250 = $78,750 book value end of year 2\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. $60,000\n\nB. $61,250\n\nC. $78,750\n\nD. $80,000\n\nOption C is $78,750, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if the salvage value affects the depreciation in some other way. In double-declining balance, you typically continue depreciating until the book value equals the salvage value.\n\nGiven that $78,750 is still above $60,000, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to calculate this, and that's why there are other options available.\n\nLet me try another approach to see if I get a different result.\n\nAlternatively, some methods might consider the salvage value from the start.\n\nBut in the double-declining balance method, you usually ignore the salvage value until the book value approaches it.\n\nAnyway, based on my calculations, $78,750 seems to be the correct carrying amount at the end of the second year.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. $78,750.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
