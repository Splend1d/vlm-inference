Rat King.\n\nHere's a bit more context: 'The Nutcracker' is a two-act ballet originally composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in the late 19th century. The story is adapted from E.T.A. Hoffmann's tale 'The Nutcracker and the Mouse King.' In the ballet, young Clara receives a nutcracker as a gift from her godfather, Drosselmeyer, who is also a toymaker. On Christmas Eve, Clara falls asleep with the nutcracker under the tree, and her dreams transport her to a magical world.\n\nIn this enchanted realm, the nutcracker comes to life and leads an army of toy soldiers against an army of mice, with the Rat King as their leader. The Nutcracker defeats the Rat King in battle, and subsequently, he is transformed back into a prince. The rest of the ballet often includes various dances and scenes, such as the Land of Sweets, where the Sugar Plum Fairy presides, but the central conflict is between the Nutcracker and the Rat King.\n\nSo, to directly answer your question, the hero defeats the Rat King, which is option B."
