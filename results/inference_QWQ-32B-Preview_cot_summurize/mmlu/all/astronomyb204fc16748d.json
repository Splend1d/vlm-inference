                    "text": "I've got this question about sunspots and their cycle. It says that sunspots are black regions that appear on the Sun, and their number increases every certain number of years, which is called the solar cycle. The options are 9, 11, 13, or 15 years.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about sunspots and their cycles. I remember that sunspots are areas on the Sun's surface that are cooler than the surrounding regions, which is why they appear darker. They are associated with magnetic activity on the Sun.\n\nNow, regarding the cycle, I think it's something like every 11 years, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nI know that the solar cycle is related to the Sun's magnetic field, which reverses every 11 years or so, leading to changes in sunspot activity. So, the number of sunspots increases and decreases in a cyclic pattern.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n\nA. 9 years - That seems a bit short.\n\nB. 11 years - This sounds familiar, but I should make sure.\n\nC. 13 years - That might be too long.\n\nD. 15 years - Even longer, which doesn't seem right.\n\nI think the standard solar cycle is approximately 11 years. I've read about 11-year cycles in astronomy books and articles about the Sun's activity.\n\nMoreover, I recall that the solar cycle affects Earth in various ways, such as influencing climate and causing geomagnetic storms, which can affect satellites and power grids.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, I would go with 11 years, which is option B.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are longer cycles or different patterns. For example, there are longer-term variations in solar activity, like the Maunder Minimum, which was a period of low sunspot activity in the 17th century. However, that's not the regular solar cycle we're talking about here.\n\nThe question specifically mentions the period that the number of sunspots highly increases every certain number of years, which is the solar cycle, and that's well-established as being about 11 years.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. 11 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
