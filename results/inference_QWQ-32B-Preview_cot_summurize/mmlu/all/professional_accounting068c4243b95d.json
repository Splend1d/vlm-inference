                    "text": "To determine the amount the company paid for the new machine, we need to calculate the initial investment based on the given revenues, operating expenses, depreciation, and payback period.\n\nFirst, let's understand the cash flows associated with the machine:\n\n1. **Annual Revenues:** $35,000\n2. **Annual Operating Expenses:** $7,000\n3. **Depreciation Expense:** $4,000 per year\n\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense, meaning it doesn't involve an outlay of cash but reduces the taxable income. However, for payback period calculations, we often consider the after-tax cash flows or the net cash inflow before considering non-cash expenses, depending on the context.\n\nGiven that depreciation is included in the operating expenses, we need to clarify whether the payback period is calculated based on cash flows before or after considering depreciation.\n\nAssuming the payback period is based on the net cash inflow after subtracting only the cash operating expenses (excluding depreciation), we can proceed as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the annual net cash inflow.**\n\nNet Cash Inflow = Annual Revenues - Cash Operating Expenses\n\nFirst, we need to determine the cash operating expenses. Since operating expenses include depreciation, which is non-cash, we should subtract only the cash portion of the operating expenses.\n\nCash Operating Expenses = Total Operating Expenses - Depreciation Expense\n                        = $7,000 - $4,000\n                        = $3,000\n\nTherefore, Net Cash Inflow = $35,000 - $3,000 = $32,000 per year\n\n**Step 2: Use the payback period formula to find the initial investment.**\n\nThe payback period is the time it takes for the initial investment to be recovered from the net cash inflows.\n\nPayback Period = Initial Investment / Annual Net Cash Inflow\n\nGiven that the payback period is 5.2 years, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the initial investment:\n\nInitial Investment = Payback Period \u00d7 Annual Net Cash Inflow\n                   = 5.2 years \u00d7 $32,000\n                   = $166,400\n\nTherefore, the company paid $166,400 for the new machine.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
