                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a rancher, his son, and a man who took possession of their land. It's all about adverse possession and when titles are perfected. I need to figure out who's going to win the ejectment suit brought by the rancher's son against the man who's been living on the land.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key dates and events:\n\n- 1977: Rancher leaves the parcel to move to the city.\n\n- 1978: Man takes possession as an adverse possessor and stays until 1988.\n\n- 1988: Man leaves the property to care for his sick mother for one year.\n\n- 1990: Man returns to the property.\n\n- 1994: Rancher devises the parcel to his son.\n\n- 2010: Rancher dies, and his son brings an ejectment suit against the man, who has been on the property until 2010.\n\nThe statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years.\n\nOkay, so adverse possession is when someone occupies someone else's land openly, notoriously, and continuously for a certain period, and at the end of that period, they can claim title to the property.\n\nNow, the man started possessing the land in 1978 and was on it until 1988, then left for one year in 1988-1989 to care for his mother, and returned in 1990 until 2010.\n\nSo, total time from 1978 to 2010 is 32 years, but with a one-year break in 1988-1989.\n\nIn adverse possession, continuity is important. If there's a break in possession, it might reset the clock.\n\nBut, in some jurisdictions, temporary absences for short periods don't necessarily break the continuity, especially if the possessor intends to return and does so reasonably soon.\n\nHere, the man was absent for only one year due to caring for his mother, and he returned the following year. So, it might be argued that this didn't break the continuity.\n\nAdditionally, the rancher devised the parcel to his son in 1994. So, at that point, the son became the remainderman, but his possessory interest didn't vest until the rancher died in 2010.\n\nNow, the question is whether the man's adverse possession period runs against the rancher or against the son.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the statutory period for adverse possession doesn't start running against a remainderman until their interest becomes possessory, which is upon the death of the life tenant or the occurrence of the condition that triggers their possession.\n\nIn this case, the son's possessory interest didn't vest until the rancher died in 2010.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the man would need to have possessed the land adversely for 20 years after 2010 to perfect his title against the son.\n\nBut that can't be, because the son brought the ejectment suit in 2010, and the man had been there until 2010.\n\nWait, but the man was still on the property in 2010 when the rancher died.\n\nSo, perhaps the son's interest vested in 2010, and from that point onward, the man's possession would be adverse to the son.\n\nBut the man had already been there since 1978, with that one-year break.\n\nNow, option A says the son will lose because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\n\nOption B says the son will win because the statutory period doesn't run against the remainderman until his interest becomes possessory.\n\nOption C says the son will win because the man left the property for one year.\n\nOption D says the son will win because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.\n\nFirst, let's consider option B. If the statutory period doesn't run against the remainderman until his interest becomes possessory, then the man would need to have possessed the land adversely for 20 years after 2010 to perfect his title against the son.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the son is bringing the suit in 2010.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the adverse possession period is tolled or doesn't accrue against the remainderman until their interest vests.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nLet me look up some law on this.\n\nUpon review, it seems that in many jurisdictions, the statute of limitations for adverse possession doesn't begin to run against a remainderman until the remainderman's interest becomes possessory.\n\nIn this case, that would be when the rancher dies in 2010.\n\nSo, from 1978 to 2010 is 32 years, but with the one-year absence.\n\nIf the statutory period is 20 years, and it only starts running against the son in 2010, then the man would have satisfied the time requirement.\n\nBut, considering the one-year absence, it might be argued that the continuity was broken.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, temporary absences for valid reasons might not break the continuity.\n\nI need to check the law on this as well.\n\nUpon further research, it appears that in some jurisdictions, temporary absences without the intent to abandon the property do not break the continuity of possession required for adverse possession.\n\nIn this case, the man left to care for his sick mother and returned the following year, which might be considered a temporary absence without abandonment.\n\nTherefore, his possession might still be considered continuous.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the man has possessed the land adversely for more than 20 years by 2010, and since the statutory period only starts running against the remainderman when their interest vests (i.e., upon the rancher's death in 2010), the man may have perfected his title by adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, option A seems plausible: the son will lose because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\n\nOption B suggests that the son will win because the statutory period doesn't run against the remainderman until his interest becomes possessory.\n\nBut, in this case, since the man had already possessed the land for more than 20 years by the time the son's interest vested, it might not matter that the period didn't run against the son before 2010.\n\nOption C says the son will win because the man left the property for one year.\n\nBut, as discussed, that one-year absence might not break the continuity of possession required for adverse possession.\n\nOption D says the son will win because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.\n\nBut, in this case, the son's title vested upon the rancher's death in 2010, and by that time, the man had been possessing the land adversely for a significant period.\n\nMoreover, adverse possession can defeat even a fee simple absolute title if the requirements are met.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option A is the most correct: the son will lose because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\n\nHowever, I need to consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps the son can argue that the man's possession wasn't hostile to him because the man was possessing the land before the son's interest vested.\n\nBut, in general, adverse possession looks at the possession being hostile to the true owner's interest, which in this case was the rancher until 2010.\n\nOnce the son's interest vests, the man's possession would be adverse to the son's interest, and the 20-year period would need to be satisfied from that point.\n\nWait, but that would mean the man needs to possess for 20 years after 2010 to perfect his title against the son, which isn't possible because the suit is brought in 2010.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nAdverse possession must be hostile, open, notorious, exclusive, continuous, and uninterrupted for the statutory period.\n\nHostility means against the owner's rights; open and notorious mean that the possession is visible and not secretive; exclusive means the possessor treats the land as their own; continuous and uninterrupted mean possession without gaps exceeding the allowable period.\n\nIn this case, the man possessed the land from 1978 to 1988, left for one year, and returned in 1990 until 2010.\n\nSo, from 1978 to 2010 is 32 years, with a one-year gap.\n\nIf the jurisdiction allows tacking of prior possessors under certain circumstances, perhaps the man can tack his initial possession from 1978 to 1988 with his subsequent possession from 1990 to 2010, totaling more than 20 years.\n\nTacking is allowed when there's a unity of possession and the subsequent possessor stands in privity with the prior possessor.\n\nHowever, in this case, the man is the same person possessing the land both times, so he can certainly tack his possession periods together, provided that the break in possession doesn't exceed the maximum allowed period.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a temporary absence doesn't break the continuity if the possessor intends to return and does so within a reasonable time.\n\nHere, the man was absent for only one year due to caring for his mother, which might be considered a reasonable excuse.\n\nTherefore, his possession from 1978 to 1988 and from 1990 to 2010 could be tacked together to exceed the 20-year statutory period.\n\nMoreover, since the son's interest didn't vest until 2010, and the man had possessed the land adversely for more than 20 years by that time, it's possible that the man has perfected his title by adverse possession.\n\nTherefore, in the ejectment suit brought by the son in 2010, the man could successfully defend based on adverse possession, and the son would lose.\n\nHence, option A is likely correct.\n\nHowever, option B is also tempting because it mentions that the statutory period doesn't run against the remainderman until his interest becomes possessory.\n\nThis is generally true, but in this case, since the man had already possessed for more than 20 years by the time the son's interest vested, it might not save the son's position.\n\nOption C suggests that the son will win because the man left the property for one year.\n\nBut, as discussed, that one-year absence might not be sufficient to break the continuity of possession required for adverse possession.\n\nOption D says the son will win because his title was perfected at the time of conveyance.\n\nBut, in this scenario, the son's title vested upon the rancher's death in 2010, and by that time, the man had been possessing the land adversely for a long period.\n\nMoreover, adverse possession can defeat even a fee simple absolute title if the statutory requirements are met.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the man has satisfied the requirements for adverse possession, and the son's attempt to eject him would fail.\n\nThus, the answer is A: lose, because the man has acquired title by adverse possession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
