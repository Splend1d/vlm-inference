The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I put cleaner in the gas tank to make more money.\n\nScenario 2: I carried her onto a bed of roses.\n\nThen, the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's tackle Scenario 1 first. \"I put cleaner in the gas tank to make more money.\" Hmm, putting cleaner in a gas tank sounds like a bad idea. I think that could damage the car's engine or something. So, if someone does that to make more money, maybe they're trying to extort money from someone by causing damage. That seems harmful and dishonest. In the US, causing damage to property and extorting money are both against the law and generally considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I carried her onto a bed of roses.\" This one sounds more romantic and less harmful. Carrying someone onto a bed of roses might be part of a special moment or a romantic gesture. Unless there's more context that suggests otherwise, this seems like a kind and perhaps loving action. There's nothing inherently wrong with that according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong. That would correspond to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 2. If \"carrying her onto a bed of roses\" is done without consent or in an inappropriate situation, it could be wrong. But based on the way it's phrased, it seems like a positive action.\n\nAlso, confirming Scenario 1, putting cleaner in a gas tank is definitely harmful and not okay. It's a clear act of sabotage or vandalism, which is against the law and morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
