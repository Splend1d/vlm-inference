                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question about regression analysis and sampling. The question asks which of the statements is FALSE concerning the regression population and sample. So, I need to carefully evaluate each option to determine which one is not correct.\n\nOption A says: \"The population is the total collection of all items of interest.\" That sounds right. In statistics, the population refers to the entire group of individuals or items that we want to study or draw conclusions about. So, this seems accurate.\n\nOption B states: \"The population can be infinite.\" Hmm, in some theoretical scenarios, like when dealing with continuous variables, the population can indeed be considered infinite because there are infinitely many possible values. However, in practical applications, populations are often finite. But the statement says \"can be infinite,\" which is true in certain contexts. So, this seems correct as well.\n\nOption C says: \"In theory, the sample could be larger than the population.\" This one sounds a bit off. A sample is a subset of the population, so how could it be larger? If the population has, say, 100 items, the largest possible sample would be 100 items, which would essentially be the entire population. I can't think of a scenario where a sample is larger than the population, even theoretically. Maybe in some hypothetical situations, but in general, that doesn't make sense. This might be the false statement.\n\nOption D states: \"A random sample is one where each individual item from the population is equally likely to be drawn.\" This is the definition of a simple random sample, where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. That seems correct.\n\nSo, based on my initial thoughts, option C seems like the false statement. Let me double-check.\n\nIf I consider a finite population, say, all the students in a school, the population is finite, and any sample drawn from it cannot be larger than the population. Even in the case of sampling with replacement, where the same individual can be selected more than once, the sample size can be larger than the population in terms of the number of observations, but the unique items in the sample cannot exceed the population size.\n\nWait a minute, in sampling with replacement, you can have a sample size larger than the population in terms of the number of observations, but the sample would contain duplicates of the population items. So, in terms of the number of observations, yes, the sample can be larger than the population, but in terms of unique items, it cannot.\n\nMaybe that's what option C is referring to\u2014that in theory, the number of observations in a sample can exceed the population size when sampling with replacement. In that case, perhaps it's not false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is considering the sample as a collection of observations, and in that sense, the sample size can be larger than the population, especially in infinite populations. But infinite populations are more of a theoretical construct.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused now. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOption A: Seems correct.\n\nOption B: Seems correct.\n\nOption D: Seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"In theory, the sample could be larger than the population.\" Is this false or not?\n\nIf the population is finite, the sample cannot be larger than the population in terms of unique items, but in sampling with replacement, the sample size can be larger in terms of observations.\n\nIf the population is infinite, then the sample can be larger than any finite subset of the population, but the population itself is infinite.\n\nMaybe the key here is the interpretation of \"larger than the population.\" If it refers to the number of observations, then in sampling with replacement, yes, the sample can be larger than the population.\n\nHowever, typically, when we talk about sample size, we refer to the number of observations, which can indeed be larger than the population size in cases of sampling with replacement or in infinite populations.\n\nPerhaps I was too hasty in considering option C as false. Maybe it's actually true in certain scenarios.\n\nLet me consider another angle. If the population is finite and we sample without replacement, the maximum sample size is equal to the population size. If we sample with replacement, the sample size can be larger than the population size, but it would involve repeating the same items.\n\nIn regression analysis, when we talk about samples, we usually assume sampling with replacement or from an infinite population, especially in the classical linear regression model assumptions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option C is true, and therefore not the false statement.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the FALSE statement. If option C is true in some scenarios, but not in others, maybe it's considered false in a general sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statement is false because a sample cannot be larger than the population, period.\n\nBut I recall that in some statistical treatments, especially in the context of resampling methods like bootstrapping, samples are drawn with replacement, and the sample size can be larger than the population size.\n\nIn bootstrapping, for example, we draw samples of the same size as the population (original sample), but in some variations, the sample size can be larger.\n\nHowever, in standard sampling theory, the sample size is typically smaller than the population size.\n\nGiven that, perhaps in the context of regression analysis, where we usually deal with finite populations and samples that are smaller than the population, option C is false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in theoretical statistics, there are cases where the sample size can exceed the population size, making option C true.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider the other options again.\n\nOption A is clearly correct.\n\nOption B is correct, as populations can be infinite in certain scenarios.\n\nOption D is correct, as it defines a random sample.\n\nOption C is the one in question. If I had to choose, I would say that in most practical applications, the sample cannot be larger than the population, especially in finite populations. Therefore, option C might be false.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, and I don't want to get this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of \"larger than the population.\" If it refers to the sample size being larger than the population size, then in finite populations without replacement, it's not possible. But with replacement, it is possible.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the statement is ambiguous, but in the context of regression analysis, where populations are often considered infinite, or sampling is done with replacement, it could be true.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the FALSE statement, and considering that in most standard scenarios, samples are smaller than the population, perhaps option C is false.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. After considering all options, I believe that option C is the false statement, because in standard sampling practices, especially in finite populations without replacement, the sample cannot be larger than the population.\n\nTherefore, I will go with option C as the false statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
