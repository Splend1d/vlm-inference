But let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nB. Oldism - I'm not familiar with this term. It doesn't sound like a standard term used in discussions about discrimination.\n\nC. Age bigotry - Bigotry is a form of intolerance or prejudice, so \"age bigotry\" could potentially mean prejudice based on age. However, \"ageism\" is the more commonly used and accepted term in social sciences and gerontology.\n\nD. Senilism - I believe senilism is an outdated term that was used to describe symptoms of dementia or mental deterioration in older age. It's not related to prejudice or bias.\n\nSo, while \"age bigotry\" might technically make sense, \"ageism\" is the established term in academia and everyday language. Therefore, the best answer is A. Ageism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
