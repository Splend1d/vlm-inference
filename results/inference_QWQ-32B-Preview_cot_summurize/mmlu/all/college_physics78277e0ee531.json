                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about laser light passing through two slits and creating bright fringes on a screen. The setup involves wave interference, I think. Let me see what's given and what I need to find.\n\nSo, the slits are separated by 0.5 micrometers, and the bright fringes on the screen are separated by 1.0 millimeter. Now, if the frequency of the laser light is doubled, I need to find out what the new separation of the bright fringes will be.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula that relates the fringe separation to the properties of the light and the slits. I think it's the formula for double-slit interference.\n\nThe formula for the position of the bright fringes in a double-slit experiment is given by:\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{m \\lambda D}{d} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( y \\) is the distance from the central maximum to the \\( m \\)-th bright fringe,\n\n- \\( m \\) is the order of the fringe,\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the light,\n\n- \\( D \\) is the distance from the slits to the screen,\n\n- \\( d \\) is the separation between the slits.\n\nThe separation between adjacent bright fringes, \\( \\Delta y \\), is the distance between two consecutive bright fringes, say from \\( m = 1 \\) to \\( m = 2 \\), which would be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y = y_{m+1} - y_m = \\frac{(m+1) \\lambda D}{d} - \\frac{m \\lambda D}{d} = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d} \\]\n\nSo, the separation between bright fringes is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d} \\]\n\nNow, in this problem, \\( d = 0.5 \\) micrometers, which is \\( 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\) meters, and the initial \\( \\Delta y = 1.0 \\) millimeter, which is \\( 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\) meters.\n\nI need to find the new \\( \\Delta y \\) when the frequency of the laser light is doubled.\n\nFirst, let's recall the relationship between the wavelength and the frequency of light. The speed of light, \\( c \\), is constant and is given by:\n\n\\[ c = \\lambda f \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is the frequency.\n\nSo, if the frequency is doubled, the new wavelength \\( \\lambda' \\) will be:\n\n\\[ \\lambda' = \\frac{c}{2f} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\]\n\nBecause \\( \\lambda = \\frac{c}{f} \\), so \\( \\lambda' = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\).\n\nNow, the new separation between bright fringes, \\( \\Delta y' \\), will be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta y' = \\frac{\\lambda' D}{d} = \\frac{(\\lambda / 2) D}{d} = \\frac{\\lambda D}{2d} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{2} \\]\n\nSince the original \\( \\Delta y = 1.0 \\) mm, the new \\( \\Delta y' = 0.5 \\) mm.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this reasoning. Is there any other factor I should consider?\n\nI think the formula \\( \\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda D}{d} \\) is standard for double-slit interference, and the relationship \\( c = \\lambda f \\) is fundamental. So, if frequency doubles, wavelength halves, and thus the fringe separation halves as well.\n\nTherefore, the new separation should be half of the original separation, which is \\( 0.5 \\) mm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.25 mm\n\nB. 0.5 mm\n\nC. 1.0 mm\n\nD. 2.0 mm\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 0.5 mm.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there any possibility that the screen distance \\( D \\) or the slit separation \\( d \\) changes when the frequency is doubled? The problem says \"a distant screen,\" which probably means \\( D \\) is much larger than \\( d \\), but it doesn't suggest that \\( D \\) changes with frequency. So, \\( D \\) and \\( d \\) remain constant.\n\nTherefore, the only variable changing is \\( \\lambda \\), which halves when frequency doubles.\n\nHence, \\( \\Delta y' = \\frac{\\lambda'}{ \\lambda} \\Delta y = \\frac{\\lambda / 2}{\\lambda} \\Delta y = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta y = 0.5 \\) mm.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5 \\text{ mm}} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
