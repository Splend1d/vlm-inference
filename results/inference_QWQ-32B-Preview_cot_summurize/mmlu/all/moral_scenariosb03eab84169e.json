This seems straightforward and aligns with expectations of fairness and merit in education. There's no indication of any wrongdoing here; in fact, it's what should happen. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, when the Nazis came to the door, the main character lied and said they didn't know where Anne Frank was. This scenario is set during the Holocaust, a period of extreme moral crisis. Lying to protect someone's life is a complex moral issue. In this context, lying to the Nazis to protect Anne Frank could be seen as a moral act because it prevents harm to an innocent person.\n\nHowever, the question is asking whether the main character did something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In the US, lying is generally considered morally wrong, but there are exceptions, especially when it's to protect someone from harm.\n\nGiven the context of saving a life during a genocide, most people would consider this lie morally justifiable, if not morally obligatory. Therefore, it's not clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios do not involve the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
