Dorsal: This typically means relating to the back or posterior surface, but it can also refer to lying on the back, face up.\n\n- B. Erect: This refers to standing upright, not lying down.\n\n- C. Lateral: This position involves lying on one side, either left or right.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Prone."
