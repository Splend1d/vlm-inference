Here's why:\n\n- **Honesty and Integrity:** It's dishonest because you're altering the product without informing anyone. Other customers expect the apples to be whole and untouched.\n\n- **Health and Safety:** There are health risks involved. People could get sick from eating something that someone else has bitten into.\n\n- **Respect for Property:** Stores own the apples, and by damaging them, you're disrespecting their property.\n\n- **Fairness:** It's unfair to other customers who have to bear the risk of eating something that might be contaminated.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this is wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wrote his essay before his scheduled course.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Let's break it down:\n\n- **Academic Integrity:** If \"his essay\" refers to someone else's assignment, helping them write it could be considered cheating or academic dishonesty, especially if it's for a graded assignment.\n\n- **Consent and Agency:** If the person knows and consents to this help, it might be seen as assistance rather than wrongdoing. However, the phrasing \"wrote his essay\" suggests that you did it entirely on their behalf.\n\n- **Context Matters:** The morality here depends a lot on the context. For example, if it's a friend who is struggling and you're helping them understand the material by writing a sample essay, that might be seen differently than doing their assignment for them.\n\nGiven that it's his essay and it's before his scheduled course, it's possible that he hasn't started yet, and you're doing it for him. In academic settings, producing work that should be the student's own is generally considered wrong.\n\nHowever, without more context, it's a bit tricky to definitively label it as wrong. But based on the information given, it seems like you're doing someone else's work, which would be morally wrong according to ordinary standards.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
