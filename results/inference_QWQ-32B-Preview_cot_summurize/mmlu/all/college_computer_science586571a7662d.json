                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about recursive procedures that are guaranteed to terminate. The question is asking which of the statements I, II, and III must be true for such a procedure P.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a procedure to be recursive and guaranteed to terminate. A recursive procedure is one that calls itself during its execution. For it to terminate, there must be a base case or cases where the procedure doesn't call itself, and these base cases must be reachable.\n\nNow, let's look at each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: P has a local variable.**\n\nIs this necessarily true? Well, a recursive procedure doesn't necessarily need a local variable to terminate. For example, consider a simple recursive function that counts down from a given number to zero, like this:\n\n```\nprocedure countdown(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    else:\n        print(n)\n        countdown(n-1)\n```\n\nIn this procedure, there's no local variable; just a parameter `n` that's decremented with each recursive call. The procedure terminates when `n` reaches zero. So, without a local variable, recursion can still terminate. Therefore, statement I doesn't have to be true.\n\n**Statement II: P has an execution path where it does not call itself.**\n\nThis seems crucial for termination. In recursion, there must be at least one base case where the procedure doesn't call itself, otherwise, the recursion would continue indefinitely, leading to a infinite loop or stack overflow. So, for a recursive procedure to terminate, it's essential to have at least one execution path that doesn't lead to another recursive call.\n\nLet's consider the previous example. When `n == 0`, the procedure simply returns without making another recursive call. This is the base case that stops the recursion. Therefore, statement II must be true.\n\n**Statement III: P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.**\n\nDoes a recursive procedure need to refer to a global variable or have a parameter to terminate? Let's think about this.\n\nA procedure could be recursive and terminate based solely on its local variables or parameters, without referring to any global variables. For example, the `countdown` procedure above only uses its parameter `n` and doesn't refer to any global variables.\n\nHowever, it's possible to have a recursive procedure that doesn't have any parameters but refers to global variables. For instance:\n\n```\nglobal counter = 0\n\nprocedure decrement_and_stop():\n    global counter\n    if counter == 0:\n        return\n    else:\n        counter -= 1\n        decrement_and_stop()\n```\n\nIn this case, the procedure refers to a global variable `counter` and decrements it until it reaches zero, at which point it stops recursing.\n\nBut the question is whether P must refer to a global variable or have at least one parameter. From the `countdown` example, we see that having a parameter is sufficient for recursion to terminate without needing a global variable. In the second example, it refers to a global variable but doesn't have a parameter.\n\nSo, in general, for a recursive procedure to terminate, it needs some mechanism to track progress towards the base case. This can be achieved through parameters, local variables, or global variables.\n\nHowever, the statement says \"either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.\" So, if a procedure has at least one parameter, or if it refers to a global variable, that's enough.\n\nBut is this necessarily true? Let's consider a procedure that doesn't have any parameters and doesn't refer to any global variables. Could such a procedure be recursive and terminate?\n\nLet's think about it:\n\n```\nprocedure infinite():\n    infinite()\n```\n\nThis procedure is recursive but doesn't have any parameters or refer to any global variables. Clearly, this recursion doesn't terminate because there's no base case.\n\nSo, in order for a recursive procedure to terminate, it needs some way to reach a base case where it doesn't call itself again. This usually involves either parameters that change with each recursive call or global variables that are modified.\n\nTherefore, if a procedure doesn't have any parameters and doesn't refer to any global variables, it's impossible for it to have a base case that stops the recursion, unless perhaps it uses some other kind of state, but in the context of this question, it's safe to assume that it must refer to some variable to terminate.\n\nHence, statement III must be true.\n\nNow, summarizing:\n\n- Statement I: Not necessarily true.\n\n- Statement II: Must be true.\n\n- Statement III: Must be true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
