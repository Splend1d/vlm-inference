Program Counter\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nD. None of these\n\nFirst, we need to understand what each of these registers does and how many bits they consist of.\n\n1. **Stack Pointer (SP):**\n\n   - The Stack Pointer in the 8085 microprocessor is a 16-bit register.\n\n   - It holds the memory address of the top of the stack, which is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure used for storing and retrieving data temporarily.\n\n2. **Program Counter (PC):**\n\n   - The Program Counter is also a 16-bit register in the 8085.\n\n   - It contains the memory address of the next instruction to be executed in the program sequence.\n\nGiven that both the Stack Pointer and the Program Counter are 16-bit registers in the 8085 microprocessor, the correct answer would be:\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nHowever, to ensure completeness, let's briefly review other registers in the 8085 to confirm there are no other 16-bit registers.\n\n- **Accumulator (A):** 8-bit register where arithmetic and logical operations are performed.\n\n- **B, C, D, E, H, L:** These are 8-bit registers often used in pairs to form 16-bit registers, such as BC, DE, and HL.\n\n- **Flags:** Status flags that indicate the results of arithmetic and logical operations.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, both the Stack Pointer and the Program Counter are 16-bit registers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
