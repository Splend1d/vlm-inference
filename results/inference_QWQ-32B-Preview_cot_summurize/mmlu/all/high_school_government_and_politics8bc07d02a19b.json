                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about appellate courts. I think I should go through each option one by one and see which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says: \"Appellate judges never use the stare decisis principle.\" Hmm, stare decisis is a legal principle where courts follow precedent, meaning they make decisions consistent with past decisions. I know that appellate courts often rely on precedent to make their rulings. So, if they use stare decisis, this option seems incorrect because it says they never use it.\n\nOption B says: \"Appellate trials are usually jury trials.\" I think appellate courts don't have juries. Isn't it the trial courts that have juries to decide the facts of a case? Appellate courts, as far as I remember, have judges who review the decisions made by lower courts. So, this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says: \"Appellate judges usually decide the facts of a case.\" Again, I think it's the trial courts that determine the facts based on evidence and testimony. Appellate courts generally review the legal issues and the application of the law, not the facts themselves, unless there's a clear error. So, this doesn't sound accurate.\n\nOption D says: \"Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\" That sounds familiar. Appellate courts are meant to hear appeals from decisions made by trial courts or other lower courts. Their role is to check if the lower courts applied the law correctly and to correct any errors in the legal process. This seems like a plausible statement.\n\nLet me double-check. If appellate judges review decisions of lower courts, that makes sense because they don't retry the case or redetermine the facts unless there's a specific reason to do so. Their main function is to ensure that the law was applied correctly in the lower courts.\n\nComparing all the options, option D seems to be the only correct statement about appellate courts. The others either contradict what I know about their functions or attribute actions to them that are typically performed by trial courts.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Appellate judges review decisions of lower courts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
