I need to figure out which fallacy this is.\n\nFirst, I remember that a fallacy is a mistake in reasoning. There are different types, and I need to match this situation to one of them.\n\nOption A is \"ad nauseam.\" I think that means arguing something repeatedly until people get sick of hearing it, but it's not really about consequences or cause and effect.\n\nOption B is \"self-evident truths.\" That's when something is considered true without needing proof because it's obvious. But in this case, the person isn't claiming it's obvious; they're just asserting consequences without evidence.\n\nOption C is \"slippery slope.\" I think that's when someone argues that one step will inevitably lead to a series of negative consequences, often without providing evidence for that chain of events. That sounds a lot like what's happening here.\n\nOption D is \"suppressed evidence.\" That seems like when someone hides information that would contradict their argument. But in this case, the person isn't hiding evidence; they're just not providing any evidence at all.\n\nComparing these, the slippery slope fallacy seems to fit best because it involves claiming a chain of events will happen without proper evidence for that sequence.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C, slippery slope.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
