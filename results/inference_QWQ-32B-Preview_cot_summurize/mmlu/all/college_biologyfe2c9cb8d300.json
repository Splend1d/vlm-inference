                    "text": "To determine which biological attribute would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution, we need to understand what it means for a species to have a cosmopolitan distribution. A cosmopolitan species is one that is found worldwide or in many parts of the world, often across multiple continents or even globally. Such species are able to inhabit a wide range of environments and can be found in diverse geographical locations.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option to see which one would most facilitate this kind of widespread distribution.\n\n**Option A: Extreme habitat specialization**\n\nHabitat specialization refers to a species' adaptation to a particular type of environment or niche. An extremely habitat-specialized species is highly adapted to a specific set of conditions and may not be able to survive outside of that narrow range. This would actually limit its distribution to areas where those specific conditions are met, making it less likely to become cosmopolitan.\n\n**Option B: K-selected reproductive rate**\n\nK-selected species are those that produce fewer offspring but invest more in the survival of each one. These species typically have longer lifespans and are adapted to stable environments with limited resources. While K-selected species can be successful in their specific environments, their reproductive strategies may not necessarily favor rapid expansion and colonization of new areas, which are important for achieving a cosmopolitan distribution.\n\n**Option C: Limited dispersal abilities**\n\nDispersal is the movement of individuals from their birth site to their breeding site. Species with limited dispersal abilities are those that do not move far from their place of origin. This restricts their ability to colonize new areas and expand their range, making it unlikely for them to become cosmopolitan.\n\n**Option D: Capacity for long-distance dispersal**\n\nLong-distance dispersal is the ability of a species to move over large distances, allowing them to colonize new areas and expand their range. This capability is crucial for a species to become cosmopolitan because it enables them to overcome geographical barriers and reach diverse environments across the globe.\n\nConsidering the above points, the attribute that would most likely allow a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution is the capacity for long-distance dispersal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
