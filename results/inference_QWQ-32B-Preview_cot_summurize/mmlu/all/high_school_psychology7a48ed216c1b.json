This can include a wide range of situations such as open spaces, public transportation, lifts, markets, or being outside the home alone. People with agoraphobia may avoid these situations to prevent the onset of panic symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms.\n\n- **Claustrophobia** is the fear of enclosed or confined spaces.\n\n- **Arachnophobia** is the fear of spiders.\n\n- **Social phobia**, also known as social anxiety disorder, is the fear of social situations where the person is afraid of being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. agoraphobia."
