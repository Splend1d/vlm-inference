                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here: a buyer purchases an item from a merchant, and it turns out the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes. The question is, assuming no other warranties, which warranty can the buyer invoke? The options are:\n\nA. Express warranty\n\nB. Implied warranty\n\nC. Warranty of title\n\nD. Warranty of merchantability\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what each of these warranties entails.\n\nStarting with A, the express warranty. This is basically a warranty that is explicitly stated by the seller. It could be oral or written, but it's a direct promise about the quality or characteristics of the product. Since the question says \"assuming no other warranties,\" I think this might not apply here because an express warranty would be an additional promise beyond the basic expectations.\n\nOption B is the implied warranty. This is a bit broader. Implied warranties are assumptions about the quality of a product that are not explicitly stated. There are different types of implied warranties, like the warranty of merchantability and the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.\n\nWait a minute, warranty of merchantability is actually option D. So maybe B is too general, and D is a specific type of implied warranty.\n\nOption C is the warranty of title. This has to do with the seller's ownership of the item and the right to sell it. It ensures that the buyer gets good title to the goods, meaning no one else has a claim to them. But in this scenario, the issue is with the quality of the item, not with ownership or title. So, probably not C.\n\nOption D is the warranty of merchantability. This is an implied warranty that applies to goods sold by merchants who deal in goods of that kind. It guarantees that the goods are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\n\nGiven that the item is unfit, defective, and unsafe for its ordinary purposes, this seems to directly relate to the warranty of merchantability.\n\nLet me double-check the definitions to make sure.\n\nAn express warranty is an explicit assurance about the goods, either in words or actions, and it's clearly communicated to the buyer.\n\nAn implied warranty is one that is imposed by law because of the nature of the transaction, even if not expressly stated.\n\nWarranty of title ensures that the seller has the right to sell the goods and that they are free from any ownership claims by others.\n\nWarranty of merchantability, as I said, is an implied warranty that the goods are fit for their ordinary purposes.\n\nGiven that the item is defective and unsafe for its ordinary purposes, it seems like the warranty of merchantability has been breached.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's another type of warranty that could apply here.\n\nIs there a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose? That's another type of implied warranty, which applies when the buyer relies on the seller's expertise to select a good for a specific purpose.\n\nHowever, the question mentions \"ordinary purposes,\" not a particular purpose, so I think the warranty of merchantability is more appropriate here.\n\nAlso, since the question specifies \"assuming no other warranties,\" it likely means that there are no express warranties or other specific warranties besides the implied ones.\n\nTherefore, between B and D, D seems more specific and directly applicable to the situation described.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Warranty of merchantability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
