                    "text": "I've got this scenario here about an employee and their employment agreement. Let's break it down step by step to see what's going on and determine which option is correct.\n\nFirst, there's an employee who has been working under an at-will employment arrangement for two years, getting paid $2,000 a month. Then, the owner decides to formalize things and drafts a new written agreement. In this new agreement, the salary goes up to $3,000 per month, and there are some other provisions about termination and non-compete.\n\nSo, the new agreement says that either party can terminate by giving 60 days' notice, and if the employee's employment is terminated, they can't work in the hardware business within 50 miles of the city for two years. Also, if the employee violates this agreement, they have to pay the company $1,500.\n\nNow, the question is asking what this written agreement would most likely be held as: enforceable in all respects, enforceable only regarding salary and termination, enforceable except for the $1,500 penalty, or unenforceable in all respects.\n\nTo answer this, I need to think about the enforceability of each part of the agreement.\n\nFirst, the salary and termination provisions seem pretty standard. Moving from at-will to a contract with specified terms, including a higher salary and a notice period for termination, seems like a mutual agreement that benefits both parties. The employee gets more money and some job security with the 60-day notice requirement, and the employer gets more stability and can plan better with the notice period.\n\nSo, I think these parts are likely enforceable.\n\nNext, there's the non-compete clause. This is where things might get tricky. Non-compete clauses are agreements where one party promises not to compete with the other party in a specified geographic area and for a specified time after the employment ends.\n\nThe enforceability of non-compete clauses varies by jurisdiction, but generally, courts look at whether the restrictions are reasonable in terms of time and geography, and whether they are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of the employer.\n\nIn this case, the non-compete lasts for two years and covers a 50-mile radius around the city. Whether this is enforceable depends on the specific laws of the state where the employment is based, but two years is a pretty long time, and 50 miles might be considered broad, especially depending on the nature of the business and the industry.\n\nSome states are more lenient towards non-compete agreements, while others are more restrictive. For example, California has very strict rules against non-compete clauses, generally making them unenforceable except in very limited circumstances.\n\nSo, without knowing the specific state, it's hard to say definitively, but generally, a two-year, 50-mile non-compete might be considered overbroad and thus unenforceable.\n\nFinally, there's the $1,500 penalty clause for violating the agreement. This seems like a liquidated damages clause, where the parties agree in advance on the amount of damages in case of a breach.\n\nLiquidated damages clauses are enforceable if they represent a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred in case of a breach, and if those damages are difficult to calculate.\n\nIn this case, $1,500 might be seen as a reasonable estimate of the damages the company would suffer if the employee violates the non-compete. However, if the non-compete itself is unenforceable, then the penalty clause related to it might also be unenforceable.\n\nAlternatively, if the non-compete is partially enforceable, the penalty clause might still stand.\n\nGiven all this, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Enforceable in all respects.\n\nThis seems unlikely because of potential issues with the non-compete clause.\n\nB. Enforceable only with respect to the salary and termination provisions.\n\nThis could be possible if the non-compete and the penalty clause are deemed unenforceable.\n\nC. Enforceable in all respects, except with regard to the $1,500 penalty clause.\n\nThis suggests that the non-compete is enforceable, but not the penalty clause. However, if the non-compete is unenforceable, the penalty clause related to it might also be void.\n\nD. Unenforceable in all respects.\n\nThis seems too broad, as the salary and termination provisions seem straightforward and likely enforceable.\n\nConsidering this, option B seems the most plausible: the agreement is enforceable only with respect to the salary and termination provisions, while the non-compete and the penalty clause may be unenforceable due to their potential unreasonableness.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether the penalty clause could be severable from the rest of the agreement. In contract law, if one provision is unenforceable, the rest of the contract may still stand if the unenforceable part can be severed without affecting the overall agreement.\n\nIn this case, if the non-compete is unenforceable, the penalty clause related to it might also fall, but the salary and termination provisions could still be enforceable.\n\nAlternatively, if the penalty clause is severable, the rest of the agreement might stand, but given that the penalty clause is directly tied to the non-compete, it's likely that both would be affected.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the owner drafted the agreement. Sometimes, if one party drafts the contract, there could be arguments about unconscionability or lack of bargaining power, but in this case, both parties signed it, so it seems like they agreed to the terms.\n\nAlso, the fact that the employee was moved from at-will to a contract with specified terms suggests that this is a mutual agreement that benefits both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, while the salary and termination provisions are likely enforceable, the non-compete and penalty clause may not be, depending on the specific laws and the reasonableness of the restrictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is most likely B: enforceable only with respect to the salary and termination provisions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
