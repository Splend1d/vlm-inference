                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand Hohfeld's scheme of jural relations and what he considered to be the fundamental correlatives in legal and moral relationships.\n\nHohfeld identified four main jural correlatives:\n\n1. **Right and Duty**: A right corresponds to a duty. If one person has a right, another person has a duty to respect that right.\n\n2. **Privilege and No-right**: A privilege is the absence of a duty. If one person has a privilege, another person has no-right to prevent that action.\n\n3. **Power and Liability**: A power is the ability to alter legal relations by one's own act. The correlative is liability, meaning that another person is subject to having their legal position changed by the exercise of that power.\n\n4. **Immunity and Disability**: Immunity is the absence of liability, meaning that one cannot have their legal position changed by another's act. The correlative is disability, meaning that another person lacks the power to affect one's legal position.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Right and duty.\n\nThis corresponds directly to Hohfeld's first correlative pair. So, this does not contradict Hohfeld's scheme.\n\nB. Privilege and no-right.\n\nThis matches Hohfeld's second correlative pair. Again, no contradiction here.\n\nC. Power and liability.\n\nThis aligns with Hohfeld's third correlative pair. No issue here.\n\nD. Immunity and disability.\n\nThis corresponds to Hohfeld's fourth correlative pair.\n\nGiven that all these options match Hohfeld's scheme, it might seem like none of them contradict his theory. However, the question is phrased as \"which of the following apparent correlatives contradicts Hohfeld's scheme of 'jural relations'?\" This suggests that one of these options, while appearing to be a correlative pair, actually does not fit into Hohfeld's framework.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Hohfeld's fourth correlative pair is sometimes misunderstood or misapplied. Immunity is indeed the absence of liability, and disability is the absence of power. However, some scholars argue that immunity and disability are not perfect correlatives in all contexts, leading to potential contradictions in certain legal or moral scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Immunity and disability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
