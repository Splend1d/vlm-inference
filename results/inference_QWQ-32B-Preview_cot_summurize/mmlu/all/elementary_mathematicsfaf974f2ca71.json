I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what percent means. I know that \"percent\" means \"per hundred,\" so 7% should mean 7 per 100. That sounds like 7 divided by 100.\n\nSo, 7 divided by 100 is 0.07. Wait, but let me double-check that. If I take 100 and divide 7 by it, it should be 7/100, which is indeed 0.07.\n\nLet me think about another way. I know that 1% is equal to 0.01, because 1% is 1 per 100. So, if 1% is 0.01, then 7% should be 7 times that, which is 0.07.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about moving the decimal point. To convert a percentage to a decimal, I should move the decimal point two places to the left. So, starting from 7%, I move the decimal point two places to the left. 7% is the same as 7.0%, so moving the decimal point one place to the left gives me 0.7, and another place gives me 0.07. So, that also suggests that 7% is 0.07.\n\nLet me check option B, which is 0.07. That seems to match what I've come up with. But just to be thorough, let's look at the other options.\n\nOption A is 0.007. That would be 7 per 1,000, because 0.007 is 7/1,000. But percent is per hundred, so that doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is 0.7. That would be 70 per 100, because 0.7 is 70/100. But 7% is only 7 per 100, so that's too big.\n\nOption D is 7. That would be 700 per 100, which is way bigger than 7%.\n\nSo, clearly, option B, 0.07, is the correct choice.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that sometimes percentages can be confusing, especially when dealing with decimals. Let me make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nSuppose I have a number, say 50, and I want to find 7% of it. Using the decimal form, 0.07 times 50 should give me 3.5, which makes sense because 7% of 50 is 3.5. If I used 0.7, that would be 35, which is too much, and 0.007 would be 0.35, which is too little. So, again, 0.07 seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 10% of a number is equal to moving the decimal point one place to the left. So, 10% of 100 is 10. Therefore, 7% should be 7/10 of 10%, which is 7/10 of 10, which is 7. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 7% of 100 should be 7, but in decimal form, it's 0.07 times 100 equals 7, which matches.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead me back to the same conclusion: 7% is equal to 0.07.\n\nI think I've covered it from a few angles and confirmed that option B is correct. It's important to understand the relationship between percentages and decimals, and this exercise helps reinforce that connection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
