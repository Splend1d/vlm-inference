                    "text": "To determine which acid will have the highest percentage ionization when one mole of each is dissolved in water, we need to consider the strength of each acid. The percentage ionization of an acid is related to its acid dissociation constant, \\( K_a \\). Stronger acids have larger \\( K_a \\) values and thus higher percentages of ionization.\n\nLet's list the acids and their approximate \\( K_a \\) values at 25\u00b0C:\n\nA. Nitrous acid (HNO\u2082): \\( K_a \\approx 4.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\)\n\nB. Perchloric acid (HClO\u2084): \\( K_a \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\)\n\nC. Hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S): \\( K_a1 \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\) (for the first dissociation step)\n\nD. Phosphoric acid (H\u2083PO\u2084): \\( K_a1 \\approx 7.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\) (for the first dissociation step)\n\nFirst, it's important to note that perchloric acid (HClO\u2084) is a strong acid, meaning it completely dissociates in water. Therefore, its percentage ionization is 100%. The other acids are weak acids, and their percentage ionization can be calculated using their \\( K_a \\) values.\n\nFor a weak acid HA dissociating in water:\n\n\\[ HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^- \\]\n\nThe percentage ionization is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{percentage ionization} = \\left( \\frac{[\\text{H}^+]}{\\text{initial concentration of HA}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with one mole of each acid dissolved in water, and assuming the volume of the solution is the same for each, the initial concentrations will be the same. Therefore, the acid with the largest \\( K_a \\) will have the highest concentration of \\( H^+ \\) ions and thus the highest percentage ionization.\n\nComparing the \\( K_a \\) values:\n\n- HNO\u2082: \\( 4.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\)\n\n- HClO\u2084: \\( 1.0 \\times 10^{3} \\)\n\n- H\u2082S: \\( 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\)\n\n- H\u2083PO\u2084: \\( 7.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\)\n\nPerchloric acid has by far the largest \\( K_a \\) value, indicating that it is the strongest acid among the options and will have the highest percentage ionization.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. HClO\u2084.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
