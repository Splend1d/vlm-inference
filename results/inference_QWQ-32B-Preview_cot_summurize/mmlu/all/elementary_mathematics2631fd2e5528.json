                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Andrew wrote the number 186,425 on the board. We need to find another number where the value of the digit 6 is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in Andrew's number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the value of the digit 6 in Andrew's number, which is 186,425. Let's see, the digit 6 is in the thousands place. So, its value is 6,000.\n\nNow, we're looking for a number where the digit 6 has a value that is exactly 10 times 6,000. So, 10 times 6,000 is 60,000. Therefore, we need to find a number where the digit 6 represents 60,000.\n\nIn other words, the digit 6 should be in the ten-thousands place, because that's worth 60,000.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. 681,452\n\nB. 462,017\n\nC. 246,412\n\nD. 125,655\n\nI need to find which of these numbers has a 6 in the ten-thousands place.\n\nLet's check each one:\n\nA. 681,452 - Here, the digit in the hundred-thousands place is 6, which is worth 600,000. That's too big.\n\nB. 462,017 - The digit in the ten-thousands place is 6, which is worth 60,000. That matches what we're looking for.\n\nC. 246,412 - The digit in the thousands place is 6, which is worth 6,000. That's the same as in Andrew's number, not 10 times.\n\nD. 125,655 - The digit in the hundreds place is 6, which is worth 600. That's way smaller than 60,000.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem says \"the value of the digit 6 is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in the number Andrew wrote.\"\n\nWe determined that in Andrew's number, the digit 6 has a value of 6,000. Ten times that is 60,000. In option B, 462,017, the digit 6 is in the ten-thousands place, which is indeed worth 60,000.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's confirm the place values in each option:\n\nA. 681,452:\n\n- 6 is in the hundred-thousands place: 600,000\n\nB. 462,017:\n\n- 6 is in the ten-thousands place: 60,000\n\nC. 246,412:\n\n- 6 is in the thousands place: 6,000\n\nD. 125,655:\n\n- 6 is in the hundreds place: 600\n\nOnly option B has the digit 6 with a value of 60,000, which is exactly 10 times the value of the digit 6 in Andrew's number.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 462,017.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
