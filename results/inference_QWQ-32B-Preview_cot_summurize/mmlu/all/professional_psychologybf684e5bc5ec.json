                    "text": "Let's see. So, the researcher set the criterion for statistical significance to 0.05 and the statistical power to 0.85. I need to figure out which statement is correct regarding the probabilities of type I and type II errors.\n\nFirst, I recall that in hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors:\n\n- Type I error: This is when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The probability of making a type I error is denoted by \u03b1, which is also the significance level.\n\n- Type II error: This is when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. The probability of making a type II error is denoted by \u03b2.\n\nStatistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It is calculated as 1 - \u03b2.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The probability of making a type I error is 0.15.\"\n\nWait, but I thought that the significance level \u03b1 is the probability of making a type I error, and it's set to 0.05 in this study. So, shouldn't the probability of type I error be 0.05, not 0.15? Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nOption B says: \"The probability of making a type II error is higher than the probability of making a type I error.\"\n\nOkay, so \u03b2 is the probability of type II error, and power is 0.85, which is 1 - \u03b2. So, \u03b2 = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.\n\nComparing that to \u03b1 = 0.05, \u03b2 = 0.15 is indeed higher than \u03b1 = 0.05. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C says: \"The probability of making a type II error is 0.85.\"\n\nWait, but power is 0.85, which is 1 - \u03b2, so \u03b2 = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15, not 0.85. So, this is incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"The probability of type I and type II errors cannot be computed from the information given.\"\n\nBut we have \u03b1 = 0.05 and power = 0.85, from which we can compute \u03b2 = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15. So, we can compute both probabilities.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct statement based on the given information.\n\nJust to double-check, let's summarize:\n\n- \u03b1 (type I error) = 0.05\n\n- Power = 0.85\n\n- \u03b2 (type II error) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n\nComparing \u03b1 and \u03b2:\n\n- \u03b1 = 0.05\n\n- \u03b2 = 0.15\n\nIndeed, \u03b2 > \u03b1, so option B is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
