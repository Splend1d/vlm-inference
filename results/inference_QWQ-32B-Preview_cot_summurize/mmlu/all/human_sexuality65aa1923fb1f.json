                    "text": "I'm trying to remember what Bailey and Pillard found in their 1991 study about homosexuality in twins. I think option C says that homosexuality is more likely to be shared by identical twins than by fraternal twins. Does that sound right?\n\nI recall that identical twins have the same genes, while fraternal twins share about half their genes, just like regular siblings. So, if homosexuality has a genetic component, identical twins should be more likely to both be homosexual compared to fraternal twins.\n\nOption A says the concordance rate for identical twins is 100%, but I don't think that's accurate. That would mean that if one identical twin is homosexual, the other always is too, which seems too strong.\n\nOption B says that the concordance rate is about the same for identical and fraternal twins, which would suggest that genetics isn't a big factor, but I think previous studies suggest otherwise.\n\nOption D talks about adoptive brothers and biological brothers, but I think the study was specifically about twins, so maybe that's not directly addressed in this study.\n\nLet me think again. In behavioral genetics, twin studies are used to estimate the heritability of traits. By comparing the concordance rates between identical (monozygotic) twins and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, researchers can estimate how much of the variation in a trait is due to genetic factors.\n\nIf homosexuality has a strong genetic component, you'd expect a higher concordance rate in identical twins compared to fraternal twins, since identical twins share all their genes.\n\nSo, option C seems plausible: the homosexuality concordance rate for identical twins is higher than for fraternal twins.\n\nBut I should double-check the specifics of the Bailey and Pillard study from 1991.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to the original study right now, but I recall that their research did find a higher concordance rate in identical twins compared to fraternal twins for male homosexuality.\n\nIn fact, I think their study reported that the concordance rate for identical twins was around 52% , while for fraternal twins it was around 22%. Something like that.\n\nSo, based on that, option C would be the correct answer.\n\nOption A is too extreme; it's unlikely that the concordance rate is 100% for identical twins, as environmental factors and possibly stochastic genetic events can still lead to differences.\n\nOption B suggests that genetics doesn't play a significant role, which contradicts the findings of many twin studies on behavioral traits.\n\nOption D compares adoptive brothers to biological brothers, which might be relevant for adoptive studies, but in this case, the study was about twins, so it's probably not directly addressed.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C: the homosexuality concordance rate for identical twins is higher than for fraternal twins.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
