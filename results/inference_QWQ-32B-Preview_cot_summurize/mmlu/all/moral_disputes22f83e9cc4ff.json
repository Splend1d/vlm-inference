                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about utilitarian arguments. It says, \"Utilitarian arguments depend heavily on factual claims about...\" and then it gives four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A is \"what a virtuous person ought to do in a particular situation.\" Hmm, that sounds more like virtue ethics, where the focus is on the character of the person and what a virtuous person would do. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is about maximizing happiness or utility. So, I'm not sure if this is the right answer.\n\nOption B is \"what God has commanded or would prefer.\" This seems like it's related to divine command theory, where moral standards are based on God's will. Utilitarianism is a secular ethical theory that doesn't rely on religious beliefs. So, probably not B.\n\nOption C is \"what duties one has inherited through implicit social contracts.\" This sounds a lot like deontological ethics, where duties and rules are central, or maybe social contract theory, which explains morality through agreements in society. Again, utilitarianism focuses on consequences, so this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D is \"the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.\" Okay, this sounds more like utilitarianism. Utilitarians look at different possible actions and evaluate which one will lead to the best overall outcomes, usually in terms of happiness or well-being.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like D is the correct answer. Utilitarian arguments do depend heavily on factual claims about the consequences of actions, comparing which action will lead to the greatest utility.\n\nBut let me think a bit more to make sure. In utilitarianism, the moral rightness of an action is determined by its utility\u2014how much it promotes happiness or reduces suffering. So, to make a utilitarian argument, you need to have factual information about what the outcomes of different actions will be.\n\nFor example, if you're deciding whether to implement a new public policy, a utilitarian would look at the expected benefits and harms of that policy compared to alternative policies or doing nothing. They would need data and evidence to support claims about these effects.\n\nIn contrast, virtue ethics would focus more on the character and intentions of the person making the decision, deontology on the duties and rules that should be followed, and social contract theory on the agreements and norms of society.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that utilitarian arguments depend heavily on factual claims about the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.\n\nI think I've got it. The answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
