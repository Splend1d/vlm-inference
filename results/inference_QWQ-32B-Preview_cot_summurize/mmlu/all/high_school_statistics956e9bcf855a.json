                    "text": "So I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to interpret a 90% confidence interval for the average cost of running for a congressional seat. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, there's a sample of 50 politicians, and from their records, the average cost was $125,000 with a standard deviation of $32,000. So, I need to find the 90% confidence interval for the true average cost.\n\nI remember that a confidence interval gives us an estimated range for the true population parameter based on sample data. In this case, the parameter is the mean cost of running for office.\n\nThe formula for a confidence interval for the mean is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sample mean} \\pm (critical value) \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{standard deviation}}{\\sqrt{\\text{sample size}}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[\n125,000 \\pm z_{0.90} \\times \\left( \\frac{32,000}{\\sqrt{50}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nI need to find the z-score for a 90% confidence level. From the standard normal distribution table, the z-score for 90% confidence is approximately 1.645.\n\nNow, calculating the standard error:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{32,000}{\\sqrt{50}} \\approx \\frac{32,000}{7.071} \\approx 4,523.60\n\\]\n\nThen, the margin of error is:\n\n\\[\n1.645 \\times 4,523.60 \\approx 7,434.75\n\\]\n\nSo, the 90% confidence interval is:\n\n\\[\n125,000 \\pm 7,434.75 \\rightarrow (117,565.25, 132,434.75)\n\\]\n\nFor simplicity, it's given as $117,500 to $132,500.\n\nNow, I need to interpret this interval. The options are:\n\nA. 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nB. 90% of politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount that is between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nC. We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nD. We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\nOkay, let's think about what a confidence interval really means. It's about the uncertainty in estimating the true population mean based on sample data. It's not about the distribution of individual politicians' spending.\n\nOption A says that 90% of politicians spend between $117,500 and $132,500. That would be a statement about the distribution of individual spending, not about the mean. So, that's not correct.\n\nOption B says that 90% of politicians spend a mean amount between $117,500 and $132,500. That doesn't make much sense because mean spending refers to the average, not individual expenditures.\n\nOption C says we are 90% confident that politicians running for office spend between $117,500 and $132,500. This is similar to option A, referring to individual spending, not the mean.\n\nOption D says we are 90% confident that the mean spending is between $117,500 and $132,500. That sounds right. It's about the mean spending, not individual spending.\n\nWait a minute, but I've heard that confidence intervals don't actually tell us the probability that the true mean falls within the interval. So, is saying \"we are 90% confident\" a bit misleading?\n\nTechnically, a 90% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and construct intervals in the same way, about 90% of those intervals would contain the true population mean. It's not that there's a 90% probability that the true mean is in our specific interval.\n\nHowever, in practical terms, we often interpret it as being 90% confident that the true mean lies within the interval we've calculated.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the most appropriate interpretation.\n\nLet me double-check by considering what each option is saying.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it refers to individual spending, not the mean.\n\nOption B is unclear and seems to mix up the concepts.\n\nOption C is similar to A, referring to spending in general rather than the mean.\n\nOption D correctly refers to the mean spending and the level of confidence in the estimate.\n\nTherefore, the best interpretation is option D: We are 90% confident that politicians running for a congressional seat spend a mean dollar amount between $117,500 and $132,500.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
