                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a nonconducting sphere with a positive charge +Q, and it's being brought close to a neutral conducting sphere of the same radius. I need to figure out which of these statements is true based on that setup.\n\nLet's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"An electric field will be induced within the conducting sphere.\"\n\nHmm, I know that when a conductor is placed in an electric field, the charges inside the conductor rearrange themselves until the electric field inside the conductor is zero. That's one of the key properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium. So, if the nonconducting sphere with charge +Q is brought near the conducting sphere, the charges in the conductor will rearrange to cancel out any electric field inside the conductor. That means there shouldn't be an electric field within the conducting sphere.\n\nSo, option A seems false because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero.\n\nOption B says: \"The conducting sphere will develop a net electric charge of \u2013Q.\"\n\nAlright, so the conducting sphere starts off neutral. When you bring a positively charged sphere near it, the charges in the conductor will rearrange: negative charges will be attracted to the side closer to the charged sphere, and positive charges will be repelled to the opposite side.\n\nHowever, since the conductor is neutral overall, it doesn't gain or lose net charge. So, even though there's a separation of charges, the total net charge remains zero.\n\nTherefore, option B is false because the conducting sphere remains neutral, even though there's a charge distribution.\n\nOption C says: \"The spheres will experience an electrostatic attraction.\"\n\nNow, this is interesting. We have a positively charged sphere and a neutral conducting sphere. Will they attract each other?\n\nWell, since the conducting sphere rearranges its charges in response to the electric field from the charged sphere, there will be more negative charge on the side closer to the charged sphere and more positive charge on the opposite side.\n\nThis means that the attractive force between the positive charge on the first sphere and the negative charge on the conducting sphere will be stronger than the repulsive force between the positive charge on the first sphere and the positive charge on the conducting sphere.\n\nAs a result, there should be a net attractive force between the two spheres.\n\nSo, option C seems true.\n\nOption D says: \"The spheres will experience an electrostatic repulsion.\"\n\nGiven what I just thought about option C, this seems unlikely. Since there's an attractive force due to the induced dipole in the conducting sphere, there shouldn't be repulsion.\n\nTherefore, option D is false.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. The nonconducting sphere has a positive charge, and the conducting sphere starts neutral but rearranges its charges. So, the side closer to the positive charge becomes negative, and the opposite side becomes positive.\n\nNow, the attraction between the positive and negative charges is stronger than the repulsion between the positive and positive charges, right? Because the attractive force falls off as 1/r^2, and the closer charges have a smaller r.\n\nSo, yes, overall, there should be an attractive force.\n\nTherefore, option C is correct, and option D is incorrect.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any scenario where there might be repulsion. If both spheres had the same sign of charge, there would be repulsion. But in this case, one is positively charged, and the other starts neutral but induces a dipole, leading to attraction.\n\nSo, no, repulsion shouldn't occur here.\n\nAlright, summarizing:\n\n- Option A is false because the electric field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero.\n\n- Option B is false because the conducting sphere remains neutral, even though charges rearrange.\n\n- Option C is true because there's an electrostatic attraction due to the induced dipole in the conducting sphere.\n\n- Option D is false because the forces result in attraction, not repulsion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
