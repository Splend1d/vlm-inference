                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this bribery case. So, there's a developer who wants to build an office building on land that\u2019s zoned residential. To do that, he needs a variance from the building commission. He meets with one member of the commission and gives this member $10,000 in exchange for his support in approving the variance. Later, the commission approves the variance, and the developer is prosecuted for conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nNow, during the trial, the commission member testifies that he would have approved the variance anyway, even without the money. And the developer presents evidence that all seven members of the commission voted to approve the variance. So, if the jury believes that the commission member would have approved the variance regardless of the $10,000, should the developer be found guilty or not?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the options:\n\nA. Guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.\n\nB. Guilty, because he gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.\n\nC. Not guilty, because the commission member did not receive a thing of value, since he would have approved the variance regardless of receiving any payment from the developer.\n\nD. Not guilty, because there was no true agreement between the parties.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what does the bribery statute say? \"Any person who offers or gives a thing of value to a government officeholder in exchange for official action is guilty of bribery.\"\n\nSo, the key elements here are:\n\n1. Offering or giving something of value.\n\n2. To a government officeholder.\n\n3. In exchange for official action.\n\nNow, in this case, the developer gave $10,000 to a commission member in exchange for his support in approving the zoning variance. So, on the surface, it seems like all elements are present.\n\nBut there's a twist: the commission member testifies that he would have approved the variance anyway, regardless of the money. And the developer presents evidence that all seven members voted to approve the variance.\n\nSo, if the jury believes that the commission member would have approved the variance without the money, does that affect the developer's guilt?\n\nLet's consider option A: Guilty, because the commission member's agreement to accept the $10,000 was sufficient to form a conspiratorial objective.\n\nWell, conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, followed by some overt act. Here, the developer and the commission member agreed to exchange money for the commission member's support. That sounds like a conspiracy to commit bribery.\n\nBut, if the commission member would have approved the variance anyway, does that change anything? Maybe the developer thought he was buying influence, but in reality, the commission member was going to do it without the money.\n\nOption B says guilty because he gave the $10,000 in exchange for approval. Again, that seems to fit the statute. He gave something of value in exchange for official action.\n\nOption C says not guilty because the commission member did not receive a thing of value since he would have approved the variance anyway. This is interesting. It's arguing that since the commission member would have done it without the money, the money didn't really buy any influence or official action; it was just a gratuitous gift.\n\nBut, according to the statute, the key is the exchange. If the developer gave money in exchange for official action, even if that official action would have happened anyway, it's still bribery, right?\n\nOption D says not guilty because there was no true agreement between the parties. But, it seems like there was an agreement: money in exchange for support on the variance.\n\nThis is tricky. I think the crux is whether the official action would have happened anyway, regardless of the payment.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, bribery requires that the payment actually influences the official action. If the official was going to do it anyway, then perhaps it's not bribery.\n\nBut according to the statute here, it's the exchange that matters, not the actual influence.\n\nSo, perhaps the developer is still guilty because he gave something of value in exchange for official action, even if the official action would have happened anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the intent matters. Did the developer intend to influence something that was already going to happen? Maybe he was just covering his bases, thinking that the payment would ensure the outcome.\n\nBut, in legal terms, intent to influence may be enough, regardless of the actual outcome.\n\nI think the correct answer is B: guilty, because he gave the commission member $10,000 in exchange for his approval of the zoning variance.\n\nThe fact that the commission member would have approved it anyway doesn't negate the exchange that occurred.\n\nOption C is tempting, but I don't think it's correct because, according to the statute, the exchange itself is the crime, not necessarily the effect of the exchange.\n\nOption D is also attractive, but there was indeed an agreement between the parties: money for support on the variance.\n\nSo, bottom line, I think the developer should be found guilty because he gave something of value in exchange for official action, as per the bribery statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
