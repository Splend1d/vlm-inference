Nature vs. nurture: This is a classic debate in psychology about whether heredity (nature) or environment (nurture) has a greater influence on development. Nowadays, most psychologists agree that both nature and nurture interact to shape who we are. So, \"both play an important role\" makes sense here.\n\nB. Mechanistic vs. organismic: This seems to refer to different views on how living beings function. Mechanistic views see organisms as machines, governed by physical laws, while organismic views see them as dynamic, adaptive systems. Again, it's possible that both perspectives offer valuable insights, so \"both play an important role\" could apply here as well.\n\nC. Continuity vs. discontinuity: This refers to whether development is a smooth, continuous process or happens in distinct stages with abrupt changes. Many theories suggest that development involves both continuous growth and discontinuous transitions, so once again, \"both play an important role\" seems applicable.\n\nD. All of these questions: Given that \"both play an important role\" seems to fit for A, B, and C, this option would make sense.\n\nSo, the answer is D. All of these questions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
