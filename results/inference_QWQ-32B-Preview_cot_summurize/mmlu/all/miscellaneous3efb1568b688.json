                    "text": "Agent Maxwell Smart's code name in the original 'Get Smart' TV series is Agent 86. So, the correct answer is A. Agent 86.\n\nTo provide some context, 'Get Smart' was a popular American sitcom that aired from 1965 to 1970. The show was created by Mel Brooks and Larry Gelbart and was known for its satire and humor, particularly in its portrayal of the fictional secret organization CONTROL and its efforts to combat the evil organization KAOS.\n\nMaxwell Smart, played by actor Don Adams, was a comically inept secret agent who was often the target of humorous situations and gadgets. His character was endearing despite his frequent mistakes, and he became one of the most recognizable figures in television history.\n\nAgent 99, played by Barbara Feldon, was Smart's partner and love interest within the series. She was known for her intelligence, beauty, and efficiency, often having to save Smart from his own blunders.\n\nLarrabee, played by Bob Denver, was Smart's immediate superior and a source of both support and frustration for Agent 86.\n\nThe Chief, portrayed by William Daniels, was the head of CONTROL and provided the overarching guidance for the agency's operations.\n\nThe show was renowned for its catchphrases, such as \"Would you believe...?\" and \"Missed it by that much,\" as well as its iconic theme song, which featured the memorable line \"Get smart, Agent 86!\"\n\n'Get Smart' has since been adapted into a feature film in 2008, starring Steve Carell as Agent 86 and Anne Hathaway as Agent 99, further cementing its place in popular culture.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: Agent Maxwell Smart's code name is Agent 86."
