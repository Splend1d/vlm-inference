                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the yoga group in Central Park. So, the scenario is that there's a yoga group that practices in Central Park, and they can choose who to accept as members but can't stop other people from using the park. The question is asking which point this example is trying to illustrate.\n\nOption A says that Central Park qualifies as a state. Hmm, Central Park is a public park in New York City, managed by the Central Park Conservancy in partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. It's definitely not a state in the political sense, so I don't think that's the point here.\n\nOption B talks about the difference between rules of membership and rules about settlement within a physical territory. This seems more plausible. The yoga group can set its own membership rules, but they can't control who comes into the park because it's a public space. So, there's a distinction between governing who joins the group and governing who uses the physical space.\n\nOption C says that territorial rights only belong to individuals. Well, in this case, Central Park is public property, so it's not owned by any individual, but rather by the public. The yoga group is just one among many groups that might use the park. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D suggests that Wellman is committed to an absurd theory of group membership. I don't know who Wellman is in this context, but it seems like this might be a critique of someone's theory. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nGiven the options, I think option B is the most relevant. The example is likely trying to show that there's a difference between the internal rules a group sets for its membership and the external rules governing use of the physical space they occupy, especially when that space is public property.\n\nTo elaborate, the yoga group can decide who to allow as a member based on their own criteria, but they can't prevent other people from being present in Central Park, as it's a public space open to everyone. This distinction highlights that membership rules are internal to the group, concerning who is part of it, while territorial rules are external and pertain to the use of space, which in this case is governed by the city.\n\nThis example might be used to argue against certain views on group membership or territorial control, perhaps showing that groups don't have the same rights as private property owners when it comes to controlling access to public spaces.\n\nAlternatively, it could be used to discuss the limits of group autonomy in public spaces.
