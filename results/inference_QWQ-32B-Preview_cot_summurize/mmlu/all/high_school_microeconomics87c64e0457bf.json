                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statement is true for a firm in a perfectly competitive industry. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Total revenue increases and then decreases.\" Hmm, in perfect competition, the firm is a price taker, meaning it accepts the market price. So, total revenue should be price times quantity sold. If the firm sells more, total revenue should increase as long as the price remains constant. In perfect competition, the price is constant regardless of how much the firm sells, at least in the short run. So, total revenue should increase as quantity sold increases. I don't think it would increase and then decrease unless there are some constraints not mentioned here. Maybe I'm missing something, but for now, I'll set this option aside.\n\nOption B says: \"Marginal revenue is decreasing.\" Marginal revenue is the additional revenue from selling one more unit. In perfect competition, since the firm is a price taker, the marginal revenue should be equal to the price, right? Because each additional unit sold brings in revenue equal to the price. So, marginal revenue should be constant, not decreasing. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C says: \"Average revenue is initially negative and then becomes positive.\" Average revenue is total revenue divided by quantity. Again, in perfect competition, average revenue should be equal to the price, since total revenue is price times quantity. Price is typically positive, so average revenue should be positive. It shouldn't be negative initially and then become positive unless there are some costs involved, but average revenue doesn't include costs. It's just total revenue divided by quantity. So, this doesn't make sense to me.\n\nOption D says: \"Average revenue equals marginal revenue.\" Let's think about this. We know that in perfect competition, marginal revenue equals price, and average revenue also equals price. Therefore, marginal revenue should equal average revenue. Let me confirm this.\n\nMarginal revenue (MR) is the change in total revenue from selling one more unit. In perfect competition, since the price is constant, MR equals the price.\n\nAverage revenue (AR) is total revenue divided by quantity, which is also equal to the price in perfect competition.\n\nTherefore, MR = AR = price.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure. In other market structures, like monopoly or monopolistic competition, MR is less than price, and AR decreases as quantity increases. But in perfect competition, because the firm is a price taker, MR equals AR equals price.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct statement.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: Total revenue increases as quantity increases, assuming price is constant, which it is in perfect competition. So, total revenue should increase linearly with quantity sold. It shouldn't increase and then decrease unless there are capacity constraints or something, but that's not typically considered in the basic model.\n\nOption B: MR is constant and equal to price in perfect competition, so it's not decreasing.\n\nOption C: AR is equal to price, which is positive, so it doesn't start negative and become positive.\n\nOption D: AR equals MR, which is true in perfect competition.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
