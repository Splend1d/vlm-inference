Not do anything because duties can't really conflict.\n\nB. Use moral judgment to decide which duty to follow.\n\nC. Ask authorities instead of judging for ourselves.\n\nD. Wait until the conflict goes away by itself.\n\nI need to remember what Ross said about duties. I think he talked about something called prima facie duties, which are duties that seem obligatory at first glance, but they can sometimes conflict.\n\nFor example, suppose I promise to meet a friend, but then I hear that someone is in danger and needs help. Keeping my promise to my friend and helping the person in danger are both duties, but they might conflict in this situation.\n\nRoss would say that in cases like this, I have to use my moral judgment to decide which duty is more important in this particular context. So, maybe the answer is B: use moral judgment to determine which duty should be obeyed.\n\nWait, but option A says duties can't actually conflict. That seems wrong because, in the example, they do seem to conflict. So, A probably isn't right.\n\nOption C suggests consulting authorities instead of relying on my own judgment. But Ross emphasized the importance of individual moral judgment, so maybe C isn't what he would say.\n\nOption D says to wait until the conflict ceases on its own. That doesn't sound practical, especially in urgent situations like the one in my example.\n\nSo, based on this, I think B is the best answer: use moral judgment to determine which duty should be obeyed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
