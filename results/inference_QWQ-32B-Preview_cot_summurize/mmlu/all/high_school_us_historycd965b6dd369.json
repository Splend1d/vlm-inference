After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly. We \u2026 discussed all the difficulties and fascinations of such an undertaking, and on the first of May, 1891, two comfortable apartments near Hull House were rented and furnished. The Settlement was responsible for the furniture and paid the first month's rent, but beyond that the members managed the club themselves.\u2026 At the end of the third year the club occupied all of the six apartments which the original building contained, and numbered fifty members.\n\u2014Jane Addams, Twenty Years at Hull House, 1912\nSettlement houses like Hull House expressed a desire of reformers to do which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Jane Addams about Hull House and this shoe factory strike. It sounds like Hull House was involved in helping these working girls during a tough time. There's this idea that some of the girls were really scared because they were paying board and worried about being evicted if they couldn't pay. So one of them suggests having their own boarding club where they could support each other during strikes or hardships.\n\nIt seems like Hull House helped make this happen by renting apartments, providing furniture, and covering the first month's rent. After that, the members managed the club themselves. By the end of the third year, they had expanded to six apartments and had fifty members. So it was pretty successful.\n\nThe question is asking what settlement houses like Hull House wanted to do, and it gives four options:\n\nA. Convert immigrants to Christianity\n\nB. Prevent political radicalism\n\nC. Provide cheap labor for industry\n\nD. Improve conditions in urban neighborhoods\n\nFirst, I need to understand what settlement houses were about. From what I know, settlement houses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were institutions located in low-income neighborhoods. They were established by middle-class reformers who aimed to help the poor, often immigrants, by providing social and educational opportunities.\n\nOption A suggests converting immigrants to Christianity. While some settlement houses might have had religious affiliations or included religious activities, the primary goal was usually social reform and assistance rather than proselytization. In the passage, there's no mention of religion; it's all about supporting workers during a strike and providing housing.\n\nOption B is about preventing political radicalism. The passage mentions that some of the girls were afraid during the strike, and the boarding club was a way for them to support each other. But there's no indication that Hull House was trying to prevent radicalism; rather, it seems like they were supporting the workers in their struggle.\n\nOption C is to provide cheap labor for industry. That doesn't align with the passage at all. Hull House was helping workers during a strike, which was likely against the factory owners. So, it's unlikely that their goal was to provide cheap labor for industry.\n\nOption D is to improve conditions in urban neighborhoods. This seems to fit well with what's described in the passage. Hull House is helping working girls during a strike by providing housing where they can support each other. This is directly aimed at improving their living and working conditions in the urban area.\n\nMoreover, Jane Addams was one of the founders of Hull House and was known for her social reform work, particularly in improving the lives of immigrants and the poor in urban settings.\n\nSo, considering the context and the options provided, it seems that the primary desire of reformers like those at Hull House was to improve conditions in urban neighborhoods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
