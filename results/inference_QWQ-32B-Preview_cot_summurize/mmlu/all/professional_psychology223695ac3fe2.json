                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about personality theories, but I'm a bit confused. The question is: \"The belief that an unhealthy style of life stems from self-centered, competitive goals is most consistent with the theory of personality proposed by whom? A. Freud B. Jung C. Rogers D. Adler.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to match this idea to one of these psychologists. Let's see what each of them is known for.\n\nFirst, Freud. He's famous for his psychoanalytic theory, which focuses a lot on the unconscious mind, sexual desires, and childhood experiences. He talked about the id, ego, and superego. But I don't remember him specifically linking unhealthy lifestyles to self-centered and competitive goals.\n\nNext, Jung. He was a student of Freud's, but he developed his own theory called analytical psychology. Jung introduced concepts like the collective unconscious and archetypes. He also talked about introversion and extroversion. Again, I don't recall him directly addressing self-centered goals leading to unhealthy lifestyles.\n\nThen there's Rogers. He's associated with humanistic psychology and client-centered therapy. Rogers emphasized self-concept, self-actualization, and unconditional positive regard. He believed that people have the capacity for self-growth and that an unhealthy lifestyle might stem from incongruence between self-image and experiences. But I'm not sure if he specifically pins it on self-centered and competitive goals.\n\nFinally, Adler. He's known for his individual psychology, which emphasizes the importance of feelings of inferiority and the pursuit of superiority or perfection. Adler talked about lifestyle, which includes one's habits, attitudes, and behaviors, and how these are formed in response to perceived inferiorities.\n\nAdler did discuss the concept of striving for significance or superiority as a basic human motivation. He believed that some people develop a lifestyle characterized by self-centeredness and competition, which can lead to social problems and personal distress. He called this a \"striving for personal power\" or \"masculine protest,\" where individuals overcompensate for feelings of inferiority by seeking dominance over others.\n\nComparing this to the question, it seems like Adler's theory aligns well with the idea that an unhealthy style of life stems from self-centered, competitive goals.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nFreud's theory is more about sexual and aggressive instincts, not specifically about self-centered goals leading to unhealthy lifestyles.\n\nJung's theory is about the collective unconscious and personal growth through individuation, not directly about self-centeredness causing unhealthy lifestyles.\n\nRogers' humanistic approach focuses on self-actualization and congruence, but not specifically on self-centered competitive goals as the cause of unhealthy lifestyles.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Adler is the most consistent with the given belief.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Adler.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
