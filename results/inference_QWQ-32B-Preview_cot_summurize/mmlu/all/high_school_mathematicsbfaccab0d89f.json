                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: Evaluate $\\log_3 81$. And there are multiple-choice options: A. 4, B. 0.25, C. -1, D. 27. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that logarithms are kind of like asking, \"To what power do I raise the base to get the number?\" So in this case, $\\log_3 81$ is asking, \"To what power do I raise 3 to get 81?\"\n\nLet me think about that. I know that 3 raised to the first power is 3, to the second power is 9, third power is 27, and fourth power is 81. So, $3^4 = 81$. That means the logarithm should be 4, right?\n\nWait, but let me check the other options to make sure. Option B is 0.25, which is like 1/4. That doesn't seem right because $3^{0.25}$ would be the fourth root of 3, which is definitely not 81. So, that can't be it.\n\nOption C is -1. If I raise 3 to the power of -1, I get 1/3, which is nowhere close to 81. And option D is 27, but $3^{27}$ is an incredibly large number, way bigger than 81.\n\nSo, it seems like option A, which is 4, is the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me verify it another way.\n\nI can use the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula says that $\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_k a}{\\log_k b}$, where k can be any positive number. Maybe I can use natural logarithms or common logarithms to check.\n\nLet's use natural logarithms. So, $\\log_3 81 = \\frac{\\ln 81}{\\ln 3}$. I know that $\\ln 81$ is the natural log of 81, and $\\ln 3$ is the natural log of 3.\n\nIf I calculate $\\ln 81$, that's approximately 4.394, and $\\ln 3$ is approximately 1.0986. So, dividing them, I get about 4.394 / 1.0986, which is roughly 4. That matches my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about expressing 81 as a power of 3. Since $3^4 = 81$, then by definition, $\\log_3 81 = 4$.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. It makes sense both through direct calculation and by using the properties of logarithms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4} \\]"
