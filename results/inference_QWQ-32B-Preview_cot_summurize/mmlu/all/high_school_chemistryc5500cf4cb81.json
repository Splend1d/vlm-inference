                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have this three-step process for forming a solution:\n\n1. Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute.\n\n2. Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent.\n\n3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces.\n\nAnd we need to figure out which of these steps involve exothermic or endothermic processes.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what exothermic and endothermic mean. Exothermic reactions release energy, usually in the form of heat, while endothermic reactions absorb energy.\n\nSo, let's look at step 1: Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute.\n\nWhen solvent molecules are separated, they have to overcome the intermolecular forces holding them together. That means energy has to be input to break those forces. So, this sounds like an endothermic process.\n\nStep 2: Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent.\n\nSimilarly, separating solute molecules would also require breaking intermolecular forces between them, which again needs energy input. So, this should also be endothermic.\n\nStep 3: Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces.\n\nWhen solute and solvent molecules come together and form new interactions, energy is released because new bonds or attractions are formed. So, this seems like an exothermic process.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Step 1: Endothermic\n\n- Step 2: Endothermic\n\n- Step 3: Exothermic\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic.\n\nB. Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.\n\nC. All three steps are exothermic.\n\nD. All three steps are endothermic.\n\nBased on my reasoning, option B seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Sometimes, in some solutions, especially in ideal solutions, the overall process can be endothermic or exothermic depending on the substances involved. But based on the general principles of breaking and forming interactions, my initial reasoning seems sound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the specific types of interactions between solvent and solute. For example, if the solvent and solute interactions are stronger than the original intermolecular forces, perhaps the overall process could be exothermic. But in general, separating molecules requires energy, and forming interactions releases energy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some cases, the energy released in step 3 is greater than the energy absorbed in steps 1 and 2, leading to an overall exothermic solution process. But the question is about each individual step, not the overall process.\n\nWait, the question is about which statement is correct regarding the energy involved in the steps, not about the overall enthalpy change of solution. So, focusing on individual steps:\n\n- Separating solvent molecules: Endothermic\n\n- Separating solute molecules: Endothermic\n\n- Bringing them together: Exothermic\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases.\n\nFor example, in some cases, solute and solvent interactions might be weaker than the original interactions, leading to a different energy profile. However, in general, the principles of separating and bringing together molecules should hold.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps in some associative processes, step 3 could be endothermic, but that seems less common.\n\nAlternatively, maybe step 3 involves both breaking and forming interactions, but overall, forming new interactions releases energy.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B: Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
