So, there's a law student and two friends who are protesting at a mall by handing out flyers against U.S. Middle East policy. The mall owner calls the police, who warn them to stop or face arrest. They come back the next day and keep leafleting, and the police arrest the friends for criminal trespass and loitering. The law student then files a declaratory judgment action in federal court to get a ruling on the constitutionality of these criminal statutes.\n\nThe question is, based on Supreme Court precedent, will the federal district court dismiss this declaratory judgment action? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says yes, the declaratory relief would interfere with existing state prosecutions and would therefore be disallowed for reasons of equity and comity.\n\nOption B says no, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.\n\nOption C says no, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.\n\nOption D says yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.\n\nAlright, so I need to think about when a federal court will allow a declaratory judgment action, especially in the context of challenging the constitutionality of state criminal statutes.\n\nFirst, I remember that declaratory judgments are a way for plaintiffs to get a court to declare their rights or the legality of a situation without having to wait for a penalty or enforcement action to occur. They're useful for getting clarity on legal issues before any actual harm happens.\n\nBut, there are limits to when courts will entertain declaratory judgment actions, especially to avoid unnecessary entanglement in disputes or to prevent premature adjudication.\n\nIn this case, the law student is seeking a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of the criminal statutes under which his friends were arrested. He himself was not arrested, but he left to avoid arrest, and he was warned previously.\n\nSo, let's consider each option.\n\nOption A talks about interference with existing state prosecutions and disallowance for equity and comity. Equity refers to the court's discretionary power to grant relief, and comity refers to courtesy and respect for state court proceedings.\n\nGiven that the friends are already being prosecuted in state court, perhaps the federal court might hesitate to get involved in order not to interfere with those ongoing state proceedings. But, on the other hand, the law student is seeking a declaration on the constitutionality of the statutes, which is a federal question.\n\nMoreover, Supreme Court cases like Younger v. Harris establish abstention doctrines where federal courts should not interfere with ongoing state criminal proceedings, especially when the state provides an adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.\n\nBut in this case, it's the law student who's seeking declaratory relief, not directly interfering with his friends' prosecutions.\n\nHmm, maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption B says no, because a federal plaintiff may seek a declaratory judgment even if he is not threatened with a state prosecution on the state statute.\n\nThis seems too broad. Generally, to have standing to seek declaratory relief, a plaintiff needs to show that they have suffered or are imminently facing a concrete and particularized injury, and that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct, and that a favorable decision could redress the injury.\n\nSo, if the law student isn't facing any immediate threat of prosecution, maybe he doesn't have standing to seek declaratory relief.\n\nBut in this case, he did receive warnings and left to avoid arrest, so perhaps there is a credible threat.\n\nOption C says no, because the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement against him, as evidenced by the arrest of his companions and prior warnings.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the law student can demonstrate that he's facing a real and immediate threat of arrest or prosecution, then he might have standing to seek declaratory relief.\n\nThe fact that his friends were arrested and he was warned previously might be sufficient to show that he's not just speculating about future enforcement but that it's a real possibility.\n\nOption D says yes, the declaratory relief would be premature because the law student's fears of a future arrest are entirely speculative on his part.\n\nThis is similar to Option B, suggesting that the law student hasn't shown a sufficient likelihood of being prosecuted to warrant declaratory relief.\n\nBut given that he was present both days, received warnings, and his friends were arrested, it doesn't seem entirely speculative.\n\nSupreme Court precedent, particularly in cases like Declaratory Judgment Act cases and cases involving challenges to the constitutionality of criminal statutes, often require that the plaintiff show a real and immediate threat of enforcement to have standing.\n\nIn Babbitt v. Farm Workers, the Court held that to challenge a statute on First Amendment grounds, plaintiffs must show a credible threat of enforcement.\n\nIn this scenario, the law student was warned, left to avoid arrest, and his friends were arrested under the same statutes for similar conduct.\n\nThis suggests that there is a genuine threat of enforcement against him if he continues his activities.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the law student has demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of being prosecuted to have standing for declaratory relief.\n\nSo, options A and D seem less plausible because they suggest that the threat is speculative or that there's interference with state prosecutions, which may not be directly applicable here.\n\nOption B seems too broad, as it doesn't consider the need for a genuine threat of enforcement.\n\nOption C aligns best with the idea that the law student can show a genuine threat of enforcement, making it appropriate for the federal court to hear his declaratory judgment action.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
