                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this scenario about a widower and his daughter. It seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, there's this 73-year-old widower who owns a 40-acre farm. He has two kids, a son, and a daughter. The daughter and her husband were living on the farm in a small cottage from 1985 to 1989, helping their dad with farming and maintaining the property. The widower's health was getting worse, so he really needed their help to keep living there.\n\nIn December 1989, the daughter told her dad that she and her husband were planning to move out of state. The widower was worried that he couldn't manage without them, so he made a promise: he told his daughter that if she and her husband stayed and continued to care for him and help with the farming, the farm would be hers when he died.\n\nThe daughter decided to stay and not accept a job offer in another state, agreeing to her dad's request. For nine years, she took care of her father while her husband handled most of the farming. Then, in 1998, the widower died intestate, meaning he didn't leave a will. The daughter and son are his only surviving heirs.\n\nNow, there's a legal dispute about who owns the farm, and it mentions something about adverse possession, which has a seven-year period in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe question is asking about the legal and equitable rights of the daughter and the son, and it's multiple choice:\n\nA. statute of frauds.\n\nB. parol evidence rule.\n\nC. law of adverse possession.\n\nD. doctrine of resulting trusts.\n\nI need to think about which principle or exception applies here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the statute of frauds. That's about which contracts must be in writing to be enforceable. In many jurisdictions, promises involving real estate have to be in writing. Here, the widower made a verbal promise to give the farm to his daughter if she stayed and took care of him. So, maybe the statute of frauds comes into play because there's a promise regarding real estate that wasn't in writing.\n\nBut then there's the parol evidence rule, which is about whether oral statements can be used to change or contradict written contracts. But in this case, there doesn't seem to be a written contract; it's all based on a verbal promise. So, maybe the parol evidence rule isn't directly applicable here.\n\nNext, adverse possession: that's when someone occupies someone else's land openly, continuously, and adversely for a certain period, and at the end of that period, they can claim legal title to the property. In this jurisdiction, the required period is seven years. The daughter and her husband were living on and working the farm for nine years before the widower died. So, perhaps adverse possession could be relevant.\n\nBut then there's the doctrine of resulting trusts, which deals with situations where one party conveys property to another, and there's an implied understanding that the property is held in trust for the original owner or someone else. Maybe that could apply here if the widower intended for the daughter to have the farm, but didn't formalize it legally.\n\nLet me think more about adverse possession. For adverse possession to apply, the possession has to be hostile or adverse to the true owner's interests. But in this case, the widower invited the daughter and her husband to live on the farm and help him. It wasn't unauthorized or against his will. So, it might not meet the criteria for adverse possession because it wasn't hostile.\n\nMoreover, the widower made a verbal promise to give the farm to his daughter if she stayed and took care of him. So, perhaps there's an issue of promissory estoppel or some other equitable doctrine where the daughter relied on her father's promise and gave up a job offer elsewhere, and now she's entitled to the farm based on that promise.\n\nBut since the question is about the application of specific legal principles, I need to see which one fits best.\n\nOption A, the statute of frauds, could be relevant because the promise\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u662f\u53e3\u5934\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u4e66\u9762\u5f62\u5f0f\u624d\u80fd enforceable\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6839\u636e statute of frauds\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53e3\u5934\u627f\u8bfa\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u4e66\u9762\u6587\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6709\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u90e8\u5206\u5c65\u884c\u6216\u8005 reliance by the daughter, which might take the promise out of the statute of frauds requirements.\n\nOption C, adverse possession, might not apply here because the daughter's possession wasn't hostile; it was with the widower's permission.\n\nOption D, the doctrine of resulting trusts, could apply if the widower intended to convey the farm to his daughter, and she did something in return, like staying and taking care of him, but he didn't formalize it legally. In that case, a court might imply a trust whereby the daughter holds the property for the benefit of someone else, perhaps the son, or perhaps the widower's estate.\n\nWait, but the widower died intestate, so without a will, the intestacy laws would probably divide the estate between the son and the daughter.\n\nBut the daughter claims that the widower promised her the farm if she stayed and took care of him.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a claim that there was a contract: daughter agrees to stay and care for father, and in return, father promises to leave her the farm.\n\nBut since the father died intestate, perhaps his intention to leave the farm to his daughter isn't reflected in the intestacy laws, which would divide the estate between the son and the daughter.\n\nTherefore, the daughter might argue that there was a contract, and she should get the whole farm based on that promise.\n\nBut if the statute of frauds requires this kind of agreement to be in writing, and it wasn't, then the daughter might not be able to enforce the promise.\n\nHowever, there might be exceptions to the statute of frauds, such as partial performance or detrimental reliance.\n\nIn this case, the daughter relied on her father's promise by turning down a job offer and staying to care for him for nine years.\n\nCourts might recognize that she substantially performed her part of the bargain, and therefore, equity would require that she be awarded the farm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the doctrine of specific performance could apply, but that's usually for enforceable contracts.\n\nWait, maybe the daughter could argue that there was a gift causa mortis, which is a gift in anticipation of death.\n\nBut typically, gift causa mortis requires delivery of the gift and intent to make a gift upon death, and it's often used for personal property.\n\nMaybe not directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a claim of quantum meruit, where the daughter provided services to her father with the understanding that she would receive the farm in return.\n\nBut again, this might run into statute of frauds issues.\n\nGiven all this, I think the answer is A, the statute of frauds, because it deals with the enforceability of promises regarding real estate that aren't in writing.\n\nThe daughter is trying to enforce a verbal promise concerning the farm, and if the statute of frauds applies, that promise might not be enforceable unless there's an exception, like partial performance.\n\nIn this case, the daughter's nine years of care and assistance could be seen as partial performance, which might take the promise out of the statute of frauds.\n\nTherefore, the result would depend on whether the court applies the statute of frauds and whether any exceptions apply.\n\nOption B, the parol evidence rule, seems less relevant because there doesn't appear to be a written contract that oral evidence is being offered to modify.\n\nOption C, adverse possession, might not apply because the daughter's possession wasn't hostile; it was with the widower's permission.\n\nOption D, resulting trusts, could be a factor, but I think the core issue is the enforceability of the verbal promise in light of the statute of frauds.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
