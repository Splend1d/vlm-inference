                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about light passing through a prism. It says, \"When white light enters a prism, green light is bent more than...\" and then it gives options: A. blue light, B. violet light, C. red light, D. None of these choices is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how light behaves when it passes through a prism. I remember that white light is made up of different colors, and each color bends by a different amount when it passes through the prism. This is why we see a spectrum of colors coming out of the prism.\n\nThe amount of bending, or refraction, depends on the wavelength of the light. Shorter wavelengths bend more than longer wavelengths. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum, followed by blue, green, yellow, orange, and red, which has the longest wavelength.\n\nSo, if violet bends the most, and red bends the least, then green should bend more than red but less than blue and violet.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. blue light - but blue has a shorter wavelength than green, so it should bend more than green, not less.\n\nB. violet light - violet has an even shorter wavelength than blue, so it bends more than green.\n\nC. red light - red has a longer wavelength than green, so it should bend less than green.\n\nD. None of these choices is correct.\n\nGiven this, green light bends more than red light, but less than blue and violet light.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. red light.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The question says, \"green light is bent more than...\" and lists options including red light. Since green bends more than red, choosing C makes sense.\n\nHowever, the question might be tricky because it could be testing whether I know that among the options, green bends more than red, but less than blue and violet.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. blue light - green doesn't bend more than blue; blue bends more than green.\n\nB. violet light - violet bends more than green.\n\nC. red light - green bends more than red.\n\nD. None of these choices is correct.\n\nSo, technically, green does bend more than red light. But perhaps the question expects that green bends more than blue or violet, which is not true.\n\nWait, no. The question is: \"green light is bent more than...\" and we're to choose what it's bent more than.\n\nGiven that green bends more than red but less than blue and violet, the correct comparison is that green bends more than red.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. red light.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any confusion here.\n\nPerhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking that green bends more than blue, which isn't true.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. blue light.\n\nB. violet light.\n\nC. red light.\n\nD. None of these choices is correct.\n\nSince green bends more than red, but less than blue and violet, the statement \"green light is bent more than red light\" is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. red light.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is implying that green is bent more than all of them, which would be incorrect, but that's not what option D suggests.\n\nOption D is \"None of these choices is correct,\" but since C is correct, D wouldn't apply.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. red light.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
