Dixie - I think this refers to the Southern United States. It's more of a cultural or historical region, not really functional.\n\nB. Pennsylvania - That's a state, right? States are political regions, defined by government boundaries. Not functional.\n\nC. The market area of Winn-Dixie - Winn-Dixie is a grocery store chain. So, its market area would be the geographical area where its stores are located and where it attracts customers. That sounds like a functional region because it's defined by the function of the stores serving customers.\n\nD. The Pacific Northwest - This is a geographic region comprising states like Washington and Oregon, and sometimes parts of California and Idaho. It's more of a natural or cultural region, not functional.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the market area of Winn-Dixie is the functional region among the options given.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
