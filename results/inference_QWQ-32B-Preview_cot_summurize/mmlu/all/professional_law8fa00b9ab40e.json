                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, Sarah has lost her Primer Series MBE Review books and she's offering $20 to anyone who can identify the thief. Donna sees Terry taking the books and knows who did it. But Donna doesn't think Sarah will actually pay up, even if she provides the information. So, Donna approaches Sarah and says, \"I know the identity of the thief and promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance.\"\n\nNow, the question is about the effect of Donna's statement. Does it create a unilateral contract, a bilateral contract, no contract, or a contract that's defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable time?\n\nFirst, let's recall what a unilateral contract is. It's a contract where one party makes a promise in exchange for the other party's performance. So, one person promises something if the other does a specific act. In this case, Sarah has essentially offered $20 if someone identifies the thief. That sounds like a unilateral contract because she's promising to pay upon the performance of identifying the thief.\n\nOn the other hand, a bilateral contract involves mutual promises. Both parties promise to do something. For example, if Donna promised to tell Sarah the thief's identity in exchange for Sarah's promise to pay $20, that would be a bilateral contract.\n\nNow, Donna comes to Sarah and says she knows the identity and promises to tell, but wants the $20 in advance. So, Donna is making a promise to reveal the information in exchange for Sarah paying her $20 now.\n\nThis seems more like a bilateral contract because both parties are making promises: Donna promises to tell, and Sarah promises to pay in advance.\n\nBut wait, originally, Sarah had offered a unilateral contract by promising to pay upon identification. Donna is proposing a different arrangement where she gets paid in advance for her promise to reveal the information.\n\nSo, is Donna's statement creating a new contract or accepting Sarah's original offer?\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about this differently. When Donna says, \"I know the identity of the thief and promise to tell you, but I want the $20 in advance,\" she's essentially making a counteroffer. She's not accepting Sarah's original offer to pay after identification; instead, she's proposing that Sarah pays first, and then she'll tell.\n\nIn contract law, when someone makes a new proposal or changes the terms, it's considered a counteroffer, which rejects the original offer.\n\nSo, Sarah's original offer is out there, and Donna is making a new offer: pay first, then I'll tell.\n\nTherefore, Donna's statement is creating a new offer, which is a bilateral contract because both parties are promising to do something: Donna to tell, and Sarah to pay in advance.\n\nBut, is there a contract formed yet? For a contract to be formed, there needs to be an offer and acceptance, plus consideration.\n\nHere, Donna is making an offer to tell Sarah the thief's identity if Sarah pays $20 in advance. If Sarah agrees to this, then a bilateral contract is formed.\n\nHowever, the question is about the effect of Donna's statement, not whether a contract is formed afterward.\n\nSo, Donna's statement is proposing a bilateral contract.\n\nBut, perhaps there's more to it.\n\nLet's look at option D: Create a contract which is defeasible unless Donna makes the required disclosure within a reasonable period of time.\n\nDefeasible means that the contract can be voided or canceled under certain conditions.\n\nIn this case, if Donna promises to tell the identity and gets paid in advance, but doesn't disclose the information within a reasonable time, the contract could be considered voidable by Sarah.\n\nBut, this seems a bit nuanced. The key here is whether Donna's statement creates a contract at all.\n\nWait, maybe there's no contract yet.\n\nDonna is making an offer to tell the identity for $20 in advance. Sarah would need to accept this offer for a contract to be formed.\n\nBut the question is about the effect of Donna's statement, which is making this offer.\n\nSo, is this creating a contract or just proposing one?\n\nI think it's proposing a contract, not creating one.\n\nCreating implies that a contract has been formed, which requires acceptance.\n\nHere, Donna is making a proposal, but Sarah hasn't accepted yet.\n\nTherefore, no contract is formed yet.\n\nSo, option C, \"Create no contract,\" might be correct.\n\nBut, let's consider unilateral contracts again.\n\nIn a unilateral contract, the offeror promises something in exchange for the performance of an act. Here, Sarah originally offered $20 in exchange for identification of the thief.\n\nDonna is now proposing a different arrangement: pay in advance for the promise to reveal.\n\nSo, Donna's statement is not accepting Sarah's original offer but making a new one.\n\nTherefore, no contract is formed by Donna's statement alone; it's just a proposal.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. Create no contract.\n\nBut, let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Donna's statement is creating a unilateral contract where she's offering to tell the identity in exchange for Sarah's payment in advance.\n\nIn that case, it could be seen as a unilateral contract where Donna is promising to tell upon Sarah's payment.\n\nBut, typically, in unilateral contracts, one party promises to pay upon the performance of an act.\n\nHere, Donna is promising to tell (performance) upon Sarah's payment.\n\nSo, it's similar to a unilateral contract, but with the performances reversed.\n\nAlternatively, it could be seen as a bilateral contract where both parties are exchanging promises: Donna to tell and Sarah to pay.\n\nBut, in contract law, for a bilateral contract, there needs to be a mutual exchange of promises.\n\nIn this case, Donna is making a offer: I promise to tell if you promise to pay now.\n\nSo, it's a conditional promise.\n\nIf Sarah accepts by promising to pay, then a bilateral contract is formed.\n\nBut, since Sarah hasn't accepted yet, no contract is formed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Create no contract.\n\nOption A, create a unilateral contract, might not fit as well because Donna is proposing a deal where Sarah pays in advance for the promise to reveal, which is more akin to a bilateral contract.\n\nBut since no acceptance has occurred, no contract is formed yet.\n\nSo, C seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
