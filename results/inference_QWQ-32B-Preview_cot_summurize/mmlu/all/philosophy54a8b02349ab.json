                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to recall what Bentham said about the fecundity of pleasures or pains. I think it's related to how likely they are to be followed by more sensations of the same type. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption A says \"its chance of occurring.\" That sounds more like the probability of a pleasure or pain happening in the first place, not specifically about fecundity.\n\nOption B is \"the degree to which it is felt.\" That might be intensity, right? Like how strongly you experience the pleasure or pain.\n\nOption C is \"its chance of being followed by sensations of the same kind.\" Hmm, this seems plausible. Fecundity might refer to the likelihood that a pleasure or pain will lead to additional pleasures or pains of similar nature.\n\nOption D is \"how long it lasts.\" Oh, that sounds like duration. Bentham does talk about the duration of pleasures and pains, but I don't think that's fecundity.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at Bentham's principles of utility. He discusses various aspects of pleasures and pains to evaluate their overall value. He talks about intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity or remoteness, fecundity, purity, and extent.\n\nOkay, fecundity is one of them. According to Bentham, fecundity refers to the probability that a pleasure or pain will be followed by sensations of the same type. So, if a pleasure is likely to be followed by more pleasures, it has high fecundity. Conversely, if a pain is likely to be followed by more pains, it also has high fecundity.\n\nBut in terms of utility, pleasures with high fecundity are preferable because they lead to more pleasures, and pains with high fecundity are undesirable because they lead to more pains.\n\nSo, going back to the options, option C seems to match this description: \"its chance of being followed by sensations of the same kind.\"\n\nLet me make sure though. Is there any chance that fecundity refers to something else?\n\nOption A is about the chance of occurring, which is more related to the probability of the pleasure or pain happening at all, not about what follows it.\n\nOption B is about the degree to which it is felt, which is intensity.\n\nOption D is about how long it lasts, which is duration.\n\nSo, none of these seem to capture the concept of fecundity as I recall it from Bentham's work.\n\nYes, I think option C is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
