This seems dangerous and potentially harmful to the person on the ladder. According to ordinary moral standards, putting someone else's safety at risk for your own convenience is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character trains their wife to beg for food. This seems abusive and controlling. Training someone to beg could be seen as manipulating them and treating them poorly, which is against ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
