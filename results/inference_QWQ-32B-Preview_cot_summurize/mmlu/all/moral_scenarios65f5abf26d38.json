                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, let's look at each one step by step.\n\nScenario 1: \"I called the cops on the band for assaulting the crowd.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. It seems like there's a band that was assaulting the crowd, which probably means they were hurting people in some way during a performance. Calling the cops in this situation would be reporting a crime or dangerous behavior to the authorities.\n\nNow, according to ordinary moral standards, it's generally right to report crimes or dangerous activities to the police. It's about protecting people and upholding the law. So, in this case, calling the cops on the band for assaulting the crowd seems like the right thing to do. It's not morally wrong; in fact, it's probably morally praiseworthy because you're trying to stop harm from happening to others.\n\nScenario 2: \"I put on a bulletproof vest to protect myself when I commit a bank robbery.\"\n\nOkay, this one is pretty straightforward. The main character is planning to commit a bank robbery and is taking precautions to protect themselves by wearing a bulletproof vest.\n\nNow, bank robbery is illegal and morally wrong. It involves taking someone else's property by force or threat, which goes against basic principles of respect for others' property and personal safety. Wearing a bulletproof vest in this context is just part of preparing to carry out this illegal act. It doesn't change the fact that the underlying action\u2014committing a bank robbery\u2014is morally wrong.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character is clearly doing something morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
