This means that in an organization, there is a hierarchical structure where authority and responsibility flow from higher levels to lower levels. The top-level managers make strategic decisions, and these decisions are implemented by middle and lower-level managers who report to them. This structure ensures clear lines of authority and communication within the organization.\n\nOption A, \"bottom to top,\" suggests that authority flows from lower levels to higher levels, which is not typical in most organizational structures. Option C, \"diagonally,\" and option D, \"laterally,\" do not accurately describe the traditional hierarchical flow of authority in a chain of command.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Top to bottom."
