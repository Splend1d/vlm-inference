The options are A. 10, B. 100, C. 1,000, D. 10,000.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the value of a digit means in a number. I think it's about place value, right? Like, in the number 24,513, the digit 5 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 500. And in 357, the digit 5 is in the tens place, so its value is 50. Is that correct?\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, in 24,513, the 5 is in the hundreds place, which means it's worth 5 times 100, so 500. In 357, the 5 is in the tens place, so it's worth 5 times 10, which is 50.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many times the value of the 5 in 24,513 is compared to the value of the 5 in 357. So, I need to find out how many times 500 is of 50.\n\nWell, that seems straightforward. I can divide 500 by 50 to find out how many times larger 500 is compared to 50. So, 500 divided by 50 is 10.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that. If 500 is 10 times 50, because 50 times 10 is 500. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, the value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is 10 times the value of the digit 5 in 357. Therefore, the answer should be A. 10.\n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other way to interpret this question? Maybe I should consider the actual digits themselves, not just their place values.\n\nWait, no, the question is specifically about the value of the digit, which refers to its place value. So, I think I'm on the right track.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the place values again. In 24,513, the number is twenty-four thousand, five hundred thirteen. The 5 is in the hundreds place, so it's 500. In 357, the number is three hundred fifty-seven. The 5 is in the tens place, so it's 50.\n\nNow, comparing 500 to 50, it's clear that 500 is 10 times 50. So, the answer should be A. 10.\n\nBut why are there options for higher multiples like 100, 1,000, and 10,000? Maybe to test if I'm careful with place value. For example, if I mistakenly thought the 5 in 24,513 was in the thousands place, I might think it's worth 5,000, and then 5,000 divided by 50 would be 100, which is option B. But that's not the case; it's in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, if I misread the numbers, I might get different values. But as long as I'm careful with place value, I should be fine.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe I can express both values in terms of the digit 5 and see the ratio.\n\nThe value of 5 in 24,513 is 5 \u00d7 100 = 500.\n\nThe value of 5 in 357 is 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nSo, the ratio is (5 \u00d7 100) / (5 \u00d7 10) = (500) / (50) = 10.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the value is 10 times larger.\n\nIs there any possibility that the answer could be different based on how you interpret \"value\"? I think the value of a digit is clearly its place value, so I don't see another interpretation.\n\nLet me look at the options again: A. 10, B. 100, C. 1,000, D. 10,000. Only A makes sense based on my calculations.\n\nPerhaps the higher multiples are to test if I'm paying attention to the correct places. For instance, if there was a 5 in the thousands place and one in the tens place, then the ratio would be larger. But in this case, it's hundreds and tens, which gives a ratio of 10.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's consider an example with larger place values. Suppose there's a 5 in the ten thousands place, like in 52,341, and a 5 in the thousands place, like in 15,678. The value of 5 in 52,341 is 50,000, and in 15,678, it's 5,000. The ratio is 50,000 / 5,000 = 10 again. So, even in different place values, the ratio remains 10 when moving from thousands to hundreds, or ten thousands to thousands.\n\nWait, but in this example, both are higher place values, but the ratio is still 10, which matches our previous calculation.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the value of the digit 5 in 24,513 is 10 times the value of the digit 5 in 357.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
