                    "text": "So I have these three premises in propositional logic:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nAnd I need to find which of the options is an immediate consequence of these premises. The options are:\n\nA. E \u2283 F\n\nB. F \u2283 G\n\nC. G \u2283 E\n\nD. ~~F\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what an \"immediate consequence\" means in this context. I think it means that there's a direct logical step from the premises to the conclusion, maybe using a single rule of inference.\n\nLet me recall some rules of inference in propositional logic. There's modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, and so on. Maybe I need to see which of these rules can be applied directly to the premises to get one of the options.\n\nLooking at the premises:\n\n1. E \u2283 ~F\n\n2. ~F \u2283 G\n\n3. ~G\n\nHmm, premise 3 is just ~G, which is a simple statement.\n\nMaybe I can use modus tollens with premise 3 and premise 2.\n\nPremise 2 is ~F \u2283 G. The contrapositive of that would be ~G \u2283 F.\n\nWait, the contrapositive of P \u2283 Q is ~Q \u2283 ~P.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of ~F \u2283 G would be ~G \u2283 F.\n\nAnd premise 3 is ~G.\n\nSo, if ~G is true, then F is true, based on the contrapositive.\n\nWait, but is that an immediate consequence? Maybe.\n\nSo, ~G \u2283 F, and ~G is true, therefore F is true.\n\nBut option D is ~~F, which is equivalent to F.\n\nSo, D is F.\n\nWait, but in classical logic, ~~F is equivalent to F by double negation.\n\nSo, if F is true, then ~~F is also true.\n\nBut option D is ~~F, which is just F.\n\nSo, maybe D is the answer.\n\nBut let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: E \u2283 F\n\nFrom premise 1, E \u2283 ~F.\n\nIf E is true, then ~F is true, which means F is false.\n\nSo, E \u2283 F would be saying if E then F, but actually, if E then ~F.\n\nSo, these are contradictory.\n\nTherefore, A is not a consequence of the premises.\n\nOption B: F \u2283 G\n\nFrom premise 1, E \u2283 ~F, and premise 2, ~F \u2283 G.\n\nSo, if F is true, then ~F is false, which means G could be either true or false, based on premise 2.\n\nWait, premise 2 is ~F \u2283 G, which means if ~F then G.\n\nBut if F is true, ~F is false, so the implication ~F \u2283 G is true regardless of G.\n\nTherefore, F \u2283 G does not directly follow from the premises.\n\nSo, B is not an immediate consequence.\n\nOption C: G \u2283 E\n\nI don't see any direct relationship that would allow me to infer G \u2283 E from the premises.\n\nPremise 1 is E \u2283 ~F, premise 2 is ~F \u2283 G, and premise 3 is ~G.\n\nThese don't seem to lead directly to G \u2283 E.\n\nSo, C is not the answer.\n\nOption D: ~~F, which is F.\n\nEarlier, I thought that from ~G and ~F \u2283 G, by contrapositive, ~G \u2283 F, and since ~G is true, F must be true.\n\nTherefore, ~~F is also true.\n\nSo, D seems to be a direct consequence.\n\nBut wait, is there a single step inference that gets me directly to F from the premises?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nPremise 3: ~G\n\nPremise 2: ~F \u2283 G\n\nThe contrapositive of premise 2 is ~G \u2283 F.\n\nAnd since ~G is true, by modus ponens, F is true.\n\nTherefore, F is a consequence of the premises.\n\nSimilarly, ~~F is just F.\n\nSo, D is correct.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a more immediate step to get to one of the other options.\n\nLooking back, option A is E \u2283 F, which contradicts premise 1, so it can't be a consequence.\n\nOption B, F \u2283 G, doesn't follow from the premises.\n\nOption C, G \u2283 E, doesn't follow either.\n\nSo, indeed, D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
