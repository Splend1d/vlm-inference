Let's see what each option says and figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A: \"Dismissing an employee for a more favourable employee.\" Hmm, this sounds like replacing someone, but succession planning is usually about preparing for future leadership or key positions. Dismissing someone doesn't sound like the right approach for succession planning.\n\nOption B: \"A formal process of planning to fill a role that will become vacant.\" This seems more accurate. Succession planning is indeed about identifying and preparing internal candidates to step into key positions when current holders leave, retire, or move on. So, this sounds promising.\n\nOption C: \"A vote of no confidence in a board member.\" This seems unrelated to succession planning. A vote of no confidence is more about expressing dissatisfaction with a current board member's performance, not about planning for future roles.\n\nOption D: \"The formal process of acquiring a new staff member.\" This sounds more like hiring or recruitment than succession planning. Succession planning is specifically about internal development and preparation for key roles, not just bringing in new staff.\n\nBased on these considerations, option B seems to be the most accurate definition of succession planning. It's about formally planning to fill roles that will become vacant, which aligns with the general understanding of succession planning in organizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
