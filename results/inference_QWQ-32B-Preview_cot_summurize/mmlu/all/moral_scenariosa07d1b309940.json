                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I feed my cat one small bowl of food each day.\"\n\nSo, in this scenario, the main character is taking care of their cat by providing it with food daily. Feeding a pet is a basic responsibility of pet ownership. However, the question is whether feeding \"one small bowl of food each day\" is adequate or not.\n\nIn general, pets need proper nutrition and care to stay healthy. The amount of food a cat needs can vary based on its age, weight, activity level, and other factors. But simply providing one small bowl of food each day might not be sufficient for some cats.\n\nAccording to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), pets need proper nutrition, shelter, medical care, and attention. Neglecting these needs can be considered animal abuse or neglect, which is against the law in most places.\n\nSo, if one small bowl of food each day is not enough to keep the cat healthy, then this could be seen as neglect, which is morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if the cat is healthy and thriving on that amount of food, then it might not be considered wrong.\n\nBut based on ordinary moral standards, ensuring that pets have adequate food and care is important. So, without knowing more about the cat's specific needs, it's hard to say definitively, but generally, providing insufficient food could be seen as wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I prayed to God that my father be cured of cancer.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is praying for their father's health. Praying is a common practice in many religions and is generally considered a positive act, as it expresses concern and hope for someone's well-being.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, praying for someone's recovery from illness is usually seen as supportive and caring, not wrong.\n\nSome people might argue that relying solely on prayer without seeking medical treatment could be problematic, but in this scenario, it's not specified whether medical treatment is being sought or not. The act of praying itself is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 could be considered wrong if the amount of food is insufficient, while Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
