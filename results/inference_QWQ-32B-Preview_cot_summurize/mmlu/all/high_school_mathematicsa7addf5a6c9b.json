                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to find all values of \\( u \\) such that neither \\( 2u \\) nor \\( -20u \\) is in the interval \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\).\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a number to not be in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\). Basically, if a number is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), it means that the number is greater than or equal to -1. So, for \\( 2u \\) and \\( -20u \\), neither should be less than -1.\n\nSo, we have two conditions:\n\n1. \\( 2u \\) is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), which means \\( 2u \\geq -1 \\).\n\n2. \\( -20u \\) is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), which means \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\).\n\nLet's solve these inequalities one by one.\n\nStarting with the first condition:\n\n\\( 2u \\geq -1 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nNow, the second condition:\n\n\\( -20u \\geq -1 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by -20, and remember that dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality:\n\n\\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\)\n\nSo, combining both conditions, we have:\n\n\\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\leq u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\)\n\nWait a minute, but let's check the options provided:\n\nA. \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, 0]\\)\n\nB. \\([-1,1]\\)\n\nC. \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20}]\\)\n\nD. \\([0,2]\\)\n\nNone of these exactly matches the interval I just found, which is \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]\\). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me double-check the second inequality.\n\nWe have \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\). Dividing both sides by -20 should reverse the inequality:\n\n\\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut looking at the options, option A is \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, 0]\\), which is within \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]\\), but it doesn't include positive values up to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nOption C is \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20}]\\), which is a subset of \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]\\), but again, it doesn't include the positive part.\n\nOption D, \\([0,2]\\), includes values greater than \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), which might not satisfy the condition.\n\nOption B, \\([-1,1]\\), is too broad because it includes values less than \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and greater than \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), which might not satisfy the original conditions.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously.\n\nSo, \\( u \\) must satisfy both \\( u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\), which indeed gives \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\leq u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Maybe the problem is that \\( u \\) cannot be positive because if \\( u \\) is positive, then \\( -20u \\) would be negative, and we need to ensure that \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\), which for positive \\( u \\) would require \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nWait, but if \\( u \\) is positive, \\( -20u \\) is negative, and we need \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\), which simplifies to \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( u \\) negative, \\( 2u \\) is negative, and we need \\( 2u \\geq -1 \\), which simplifies to \\( u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSo, combining these, \\( u \\) should be greater than or equal to \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and less than or equal to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly match this. Option A is \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, 0]\\), which is part of the interval I derived, but it doesn't include positive values up to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nOption C is \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20}]\\), which is also part of the interval, but again, missing the positive part.\n\nOption D, \\([0,2]\\), includes some values where \\( u > \\frac{1}{20} \\), which might not satisfy the condition.\n\nOption B, \\([-1,1]\\), is too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that for \\( u \\) in \\([0, \\frac{1}{20}]\\), both conditions are satisfied.\n\nFor \\( u \\) in \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, 0]\\), both conditions are also satisfied.\n\nBut the full interval I derived, \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20}]\\), seems to be the correct one.\n\nMaybe the answer is A, \\([- \\frac{1}{2}, 0]\\), because it's the most inclusive option that fits within my derived interval.\n\nBut I'm not sure why the positive part up to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) is excluded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that \\( u \\) cannot be positive because if \\( u \\) is positive, \\( -20u \\) is negative, and we need \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\), which is \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nBut \\( u \\) can be positive as long as it's less than or equal to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( u \\) can be negative as long as it's greater than or equal to \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSo, the correct interval should be \\( u \\in [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\).\n\nBut since none of the options exactly match this, perhaps the answer is A, \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, 0 ] \\), as it's the largest interval among the options that is fully contained within \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to select the interval where both conditions are met, and option A is the only one that satisfies both conditions without including values that would violate the conditions.\n\nLet me test some values to confirm.\n\nTake \\( u = 0 \\):\n\n\\( 2u = 0 \\), which is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\).\n\n\\( -20u = 0 \\), which is also not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\).\n\nSo, \\( u = 0 \\) is acceptable.\n\nTake \\( u = -\\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n\\( 2u = -1 \\), which is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\) because -1 is the lower limit.\n\n\\( -20u = 10 \\), which is greater than -1.\n\nSo, acceptable.\n\nTake \\( u = -\\frac{1}{20} \\):\n\n\\( 2u = -\\frac{1}{10} \\), which is greater than -1.\n\n\\( -20u = 1 \\), which is greater than -1.\n\nSo, acceptable.\n\nTake \\( u = \\frac{1}{20} \\):\n\n\\( 2u = \\frac{1}{10} \\), which is greater than -1.\n\n\\( -20u = -1 \\), which is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\).\n\nSo, acceptable.\n\nTake \\( u = \\frac{1}{40} \\):\n\n\\( 2u = \\frac{1}{20} \\), greater than -1.\n\n\\( -20u = -\\frac{5}{2} \\), which is less than -1, so this would violate the condition that \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\).\n\nWait, no. Wait, if \\( -20u = -\\frac{5}{2} \\), which is less than -1, then \\( -20u \\) is in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), which we don't want.\n\nSo, \\( u = \\frac{1}{40} \\) is not acceptable.\n\nBut according to my earlier derivation, \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\), but \\( u = \\frac{1}{40} \\) should be acceptable, but according to this test, it's not.\n\nWait, no, \\( u = \\frac{1}{40} \\):\n\n\\( -20u = -\\frac{20}{40} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), which is greater than -1.\n\nWait, actually, \\( -20 \\times \\frac{1}{40} = -\\frac{20}{40} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), which is greater than -1.\n\nWait, earlier I thought \\( -20u = -\\frac{5}{2} \\), but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, no: \\( -20 \\times \\frac{1}{40} = -\\frac{20}{40} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\), which is greater than -1.\n\nSo, \\( u = \\frac{1}{40} \\) should be acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, \\( u = \\frac{1}{20} \\):\n\n\\( -20u = -1 \\), which is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\).\n\nSo, it seems my earlier test was wrong.\n\nTherefore, the interval should indeed be \\( u \\in [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\).\n\nBut since none of the options exactly match this, perhaps the answer is A, \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, 0 ] \\), as it's entirely within the acceptable range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that \\( u \\) cannot be positive because of some other condition, but I don't see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that \\( u \\) cannot be zero, but actually, \\( u = 0 \\) satisfies both conditions.\n\nSo, I'm a bit confused because my derivation suggests \\( u \\in [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\), but the options don't include this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{20} ] \\), but this excludes the positive part up to \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\), which should be included.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the intersection of the two conditions, and the intersection is \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\), but again, options don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"What interval consists of all \\( u \\) such that neither \\( 2u \\) nor \\( -20u \\) is in the interval \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\)?\"\n\nSo, neither \\( 2u \\) nor \\( -20u \\) should be less than -1.\n\nSo, both \\( 2u \\geq -1 \\) and \\( -20u \\geq -1 \\).\n\nWhich leads to \\( u \\geq -\\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( u \\leq \\frac{1}{20} \\), so \\( u \\in [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"neither...nor\" means that both \\( 2u \\) and \\( -20u \\) are not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\), which is what I interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's interpreted as \"not ( \\( 2u \\) is in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\) or \\( -20u \\) is in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\) )\", which by De Morgan's law, is \" \\( 2u \\) is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\) and \\( -20u \\) is not in \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\)\", which is what I did.\n\nSo, I think my interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that \\( u \\) must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, which it does in \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{20} ] \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A, \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, 0 ] \\), and the positive part is excluded for some reason.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misprint in the options.\n\nGiven that, I would go with option A, \\( [ -\\frac{1}{2}, 0 ] \\), as the most reasonable choice among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
