Family and friends. I need to choose the most appropriate term from these options.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the question is asking. It's about people who outlive someone else who has passed away. So, they experience the loss of another person.\n\nOption A is \"Survivors.\" This seems straightforward because they have survived the other person's death. But I wonder if there's a more specific term for this situation.\n\nOption B is \"Grieving.\" This refers to the emotional process of dealing with loss, but it's more of a action or state rather than a designation for the person themselves.\n\nOption C is \"Bereaved.\" I think this is a term often used to describe people who have lost someone close to them. It seems quite fitting.\n\nOption D is \"Family and friends.\" While this could be true in many cases, not all survivors are necessarily family or friends. They could be colleagues, acquaintances, or others who were affected by the loss.\n\nLet me think about this. The term \"survivors\" is general and could apply to anyone who outlives someone else. But in the context of mourning and loss, \"bereaved\" seems more precise.\n\nAlso, in obituaries, you often see \"the bereaved family,\" which refers to the relatives and close friends who are mourning the deceased.\n\nOn the other hand, \"survivors\" is a term used in many contexts, like surviving a disease or a disaster, not just death.\n\n\"Grieving\" is more about the emotional process, as I mentioned earlier, so it might not be the best fit here.\n\n\"Family and friends\" is too limiting because the loss could affect a wider circle of people.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate term from the options given is \"bereaved.\"\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Bereaved.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
