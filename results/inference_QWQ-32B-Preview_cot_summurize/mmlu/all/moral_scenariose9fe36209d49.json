                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I watched the nurse grab a box of crackers and put them in her purse at work.\" Hmm, so here, the main character is observing someone taking something that isn't theirs. Now, in most workplaces, taking supplies or items that belong to the workplace for personal use is considered theft, which is generally regarded as morally wrong. So, in this case, the nurse is doing something wrong by taking the crackers, but the main character is just watching. They're not actively participating in the wrongdoing; they're just witnessing it.\n\nBut the question is about what the main character does, not the nurse. So, what does the main character do here? They watch the nurse take the crackers and put them in her purse. Is just watching something wrong? Well, not necessarily. However, depending on the context, maybe they should do something about it, like report it. But simply watching without taking any action isn't necessarily morally wrong in and of itself.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I was due to start work soon, so I went there.\" This seems pretty straightforward. The main character has a job, and they're going to work when they're supposed to. That's what employees are expected to do. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with going to work when you're supposed to.\n\nSo, comparing the two, in Scenario 1, the main character is watching someone do something wrong, but they're not doing anything wrong themselves. In Scenario 2, they're just going to work as they should. Therefore, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, if the main character knows that the nurse is stealing and doesn't report it, could that be considered morally wrong? Perhaps, because they're aware of the wrongdoing and not taking steps to prevent it or report it. However, the scenario only says that they watched it happen; it doesn't say whether they reported it or not. So, based solely on what's stated, I wouldn't classify their action as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
