When the gods performed a sacrifice with the offering Purusa, spring was its clarified butter, summer the kindling, autumn the oblation.\nIt was Purusa, born in the beginning, which they sprinkled on the sacred grass as a sacrifice. It made the beasts of the air, the forest and the village. From that sacrifice completely offered, the mantras [Rig Veda] and the songs [Samaveda] were born. The sacrificial formulae [Yajurveda] were born from it. From it the horses were born and all that have cutting teeth in both jaws. The cows were born from it, also. From it were born goats and sheep.\nWhen they divided Purusa, how many ways did they apportion him? What was his mouth? What were his arms? What were his thighs, his feet declared to be? His mouth was the Brahman, his arms were the Rajanaya [Ksatriya], his thighs the Vaisya; from his feet the Sudra was born. Thus, they fashioned the worlds. The gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice. These were the first rites.\n\u2014Hymns excerpted and adapted from the Rig Veda, oldest surviving literary work, India, 1500\u20131000 BCE\nWhich of the following would best contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society in the period 600 BCE to 600 CE?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got this passage from the Rig Veda about Purusa-Sukta, which talks about how different parts of society emerged from the different parts of Purusa's body after a sacrifice. It's pretty interesting how it links the caste system to this mythological figure.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option best contradicts the idea that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society between 600 BCE and 600 CE. So, essentially, we're looking for evidence that suggests the caste system wasn't as rigid as people might think during that time period.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. \"For there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than a righteous battle.\" This seems to reinforce the idea that Kshatriyas, who are supposed to be the warrior class, have a specific role in society related to warfare. That sounds pretty rigid to me. So, this doesn't seem like it would contradict the notion of a rigid caste system.\n\nB. \"The four divisions of human society are created by me [Krishna].\" Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism, and if he's saying that the four castes were created by him, that suggests a divine origin for the caste system. That would probably support the idea that the caste system was rigid and divinely ordained, not something flexible. So, this also doesn't contradict the rigidness of the caste system.\n\nC. \"The person traditionally credited with composing the Mahabharata was born to a fisherwoman.\" Hmm, the Mahabharata is one of the\u4e24\u5927\u53f2\u8bd7 in Hinduism, and if its composer was born to a fisherwoman, who might be considered a lower caste, that could suggest some flexibility in social roles. Maybe someone from a lower caste could rise to a position of cultural importance, like composing such a significant text. That might contradict the idea of rigid social roles.\n\nD. \"The Hindu God Shiva is considered to be simultaneously the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer.\" This is about Shiva's roles in the Hindu pantheon. It doesn't directly relate to the caste system or social roles, so it probably isn't the best choice for contradicting the rigidity of the caste system.\n\nSo, between these options, C seems to be the one that suggests some flexibility in the caste system. If someone from a lower caste, like a fisherwoman's child, could compose the Mahabharata, that might indicate that social mobility was possible, which contradicts the idea of strictly rigid roles.\n\nBut, just to make sure, let's think about this a bit more. The passage from the Rig Veda presents a very hierarchical view of society, with Brahmins being the highest caste, followed by Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras. It seems to suggest that each caste has a specific role based on the body parts of Purusa, which implies a rigid structure.\n\nOption C, however, provides an example where someone from a lower caste background could achieve something significant, like composing a major epic. This suggests that perhaps the caste system wasn't as rigid as it's sometimes portrayed, allowing for some degree of social mobility.\n\nTherefore, I think C is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
