                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a function \\( f \\) that's continuously differentiable on the open interval \\((-1, 4)\\), with \\( f(3) = 5 \\) and \\( f'(x) \\geq -1 \\) for all \\( x \\) in that interval. We need to find the greatest possible value of \\( f(0) \\).\n\nFirst, since \\( f \\) is continuously differentiable, it means \\( f' \\) exists and is continuous on \\((-1, 4)\\). The condition \\( f'(x) \\geq -1 \\) tells us that the slope of \\( f \\) is never less than -1. We need to maximize \\( f(0) \\), given that \\( f(3) = 5 \\).\n\nTo approach this, I think about how \\( f(x) \\) changes as \\( x \\) moves from 3 to 0. Since we're moving from \\( x = 3 \\) to \\( x = 0 \\), which is a decrease in \\( x \\) by 3 units, I can use the Mean Value Theorem or think in terms of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nLet's consider the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which states that:\n\n\\[\nf(b) - f(a) = \\int_{a}^{b} f'(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nIn this case, if we let \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 3 \\), then:\n\n\\[\nf(3) - f(0) = \\int_{0}^{3} f'(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nWe know \\( f(3) = 5 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n5 - f(0) = \\int_{0}^{3} f'(x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nOur goal is to maximize \\( f(0) \\), which means minimizing the right-hand side because it's subtracted from 5. Since \\( f'(x) \\geq -1 \\), the smallest value the integral can take is when \\( f'(x) = -1 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([0, 3]\\).\n\nSo, if \\( f'(x) = -1 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{3} f'(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{3} (-1) \\, dx = -3\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n5 - f(0) = -3 \\implies f(0) = 5 + 3 = 8\n\\]\n\nIs it possible for \\( f'(x) \\) to be exactly -1 everywhere from 0 to 3? Since \\( f' \\) is continuous, yes, it's possible. So, the greatest possible value of \\( f(0) \\) is 8.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. If \\( f'(x) = -1 \\) for all \\( x \\) in \\([0, 3]\\), then \\( f(x) = -x + c \\) for some constant \\( c \\). Given that \\( f(3) = 5 \\), we can solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\n5 = -3 + c \\implies c = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = -x + 8 \\). Then, \\( f(0) = 8 \\), which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nBut the problem says \\( f \\) is defined on the open interval \\((-1, 4)\\), so \\( x = 0 \\) is within the domain. Also, \\( f \\) is continuously differentiable, which is satisfied by \\( f(x) = -x + 8 \\).\n\nIs there any way to make \\( f(0) \\) greater than 8 while still satisfying \\( f'(x) \\geq -1 \\)? Let's think about it.\n\nSuppose \\( f'(x) > -1 \\) for some \\( x \\) in \\([0, 3]\\). Then, the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{3} f'(x) \\, dx \\) would be greater than -3, which would make \\( 5 - f(0) \\) greater than -3, implying \\( f(0) < 8 \\). So, to maximize \\( f(0) \\), we need \\( f'(x) \\) to be as small as possible, which is -1, everywhere from 0 to 3.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of \\( f(0) \\) is indeed 8.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any constraint that prevents \\( f'(x) \\) from being -1 everywhere in \\([0, 3]\\). The function \\( f(x) = -x + 8 \\) seems to satisfy all the given conditions: it's continuously differentiable, \\( f(3) = 5 \\), and \\( f'(x) = -1 \\geq -1 \\).\n\nMoreover, the interval is open, so we don't have to worry about behavior at the endpoints \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 4\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 8\n\nThe correct choice is D. 8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8} \\]"
