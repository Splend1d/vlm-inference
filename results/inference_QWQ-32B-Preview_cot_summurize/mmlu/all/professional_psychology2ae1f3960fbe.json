                    "text": "So I've got this question here about unilateral damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, and it's asking which of these options is least likely to be impaired as a result. The left hemisphere is typically considered the dominant one, especially in right-handed people, and it's heavily involved in language and other cognitive functions.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: memorize vocabulary words. Since the left hemisphere is involved in language, it makes sense that damage there could affect vocabulary and memory for words. So, this seems likely to be impaired.\n\nOption B: construct a daily schedule. Constructing a schedule involves planning and organization, which are executive functions. The left hemisphere is involved in these tasks, so damage could affect this ability.\n\nOption C: read a map. Reading a map involves spatial skills and visualization, which are more associated with the right hemisphere. So, if the left hemisphere is damaged, this might be less likely to be impaired.\n\nOption D: use the process of elimination to answer multiple-choice questions. This involves logical reasoning and possibly language processing, both of which are left hemisphere functions. So, damage here could impair this ability.\n\nComparing all these, option C seems like the least likely to be affected because spatial skills are more right hemisphere functions. However, I should consider that some aspects of reading a map might involve language, like understanding place names, but the overall spatial task is probably more right hemisphere.\n\nSo, my answer would be C. read a map.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
