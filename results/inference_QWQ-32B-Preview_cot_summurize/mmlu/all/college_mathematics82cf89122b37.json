                    "text": "So I have this problem: I need to find the minimum value of the expression \\(x + 4z\\) for points in 3D space, but only for those points that lie within or on the surface of a sphere of radius \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) centered at the origin. The expression is \\(x + 4z\\), and the constraint is \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this is asking. I have a function \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\), and I need to find its minimum value over all points \\((x, y, z)\\) that are inside or on the sphere defined by \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\).\n\nSince the constraint is an inequality, I should consider the boundary first, where \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\), because often the extrema of a function subject to a constraint occur on the boundary.\n\nTo find the extrema of \\(f(x, y, z)\\) subject to the constraint \\(g(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2 = 0\\), I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The method states that the gradient of \\(f\\) should be proportional to the gradient of \\(g\\), i.e., \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g\\), for some scalar \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nFirst, compute the gradients:\n\n\\[\\nabla f = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\right) = (1, 0, 4)\\]\\[\\nabla g = \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} \\right) = (2x, 2y, 2z)\\]\n\nSet \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g\\):\n\n\\[(1, 0, 4) = \\lambda (2x, 2y, 2z)\\]\n\nThis gives us the system of equations:\n\n1. \\(1 = 2\\lambda x\\)\n\n2. \\(0 = 2\\lambda y\\)\n\n3. \\(4 = 2\\lambda z\\)\n\n4. \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\) (the constraint)\n\nFrom equation 2, \\(0 = 2\\lambda y\\), which implies that either \\(\\lambda = 0\\) or \\(y = 0\\). If \\(\\lambda = 0\\), then from equations 1 and 3, \\(1 = 0\\) and \\(4 = 0\\), which is impossible. Therefore, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nSo, \\(y = 0\\). Now, equations 1 and 3 become:\n\n1. \\(1 = 2\\lambda x\\)\n\n3. \\(4 = 2\\lambda z\\)\n\nFrom equation 1, \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2x}\\)\n\nFrom equation 3, \\(\\lambda = \\frac{4}{2z} = \\frac{2}{z}\\)\n\nSet them equal: \\(\\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{2}{z}\\), so \\(z = 4x\\)\n\nNow, plug \\(y = 0\\) and \\(z = 4x\\) into the constraint:\n\n\\(x^2 + 0^2 + (4x)^2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(x^2 + 16x^2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(17x^2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(x^2 = \\frac{2}{17}\\)\n\n\\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\)\n\nThen, \\(z = 4x = \\pm 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\)\n\nNow, the corresponding values of \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\):\n\nFor \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), \\(z = 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\):\n\n\\(f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 4(4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 16\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = 17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = \\sqrt{34}\\)\n\nFor \\(x = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), \\(z = -4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\):\n\n\\(f = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 4(-4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}) = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} - 16\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -\\sqrt{34}\\)\n\nSo, on the boundary, the function \\(f\\) takes values \\(\\sqrt{34}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(\\sqrt{34}\\) is approximately 5.83, and \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\) is approximately -5.83. However, the constraint is \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\), which is a closed and bounded set, so the function \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\) achieves its minimum and maximum on this set.\n\nWe have found that on the boundary, the extrema are \\(\\sqrt{34}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\). But we need to check if there are points inside the sphere where \\(f\\) could be smaller than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nTo check this, consider the function \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\). This is a linear function, and for linear functions on convex sets, the extrema occur on the boundary. Therefore, the minimum and maximum values of \\(f\\) on the closed ball \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\) occur on the sphere \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\(f\\) is \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nBut looking at the options, we have:\n\nA. 0\n\nB. -2\n\nC. -\\(\\sqrt{34}\\)\n\nD. -\\(\\sqrt{35}\\)\n\nSo, option C is \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\), which matches our calculation.\n\nWait a minute, but \\(\\sqrt{34}\\) is approximately 5.83, and \\(\\sqrt{35}\\) is approximately 5.92. So, \\(-\\sqrt{35}\\) is more negative than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\). But according to our calculation, the minimum is \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\). Is there a possibility that the minimum is even lower, like \\(-\\sqrt{35}\\)?\n\nI need to double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nWe have \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\), and the constraint \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\leq 2\\).\n\nUsing Lagrange multipliers:\n\n\\(\\nabla f = (1, 0, 4)\\)\n\n\\(\\nabla g = (2x, 2y, 2z)\\)\n\nSet \\(\\nabla f = \\lambda \\nabla g\\):\n\n\\(1 = 2\\lambda x\\)\n\n\\(0 = 2\\lambda y\\)\n\n\\(4 = 2\\lambda z\\)\n\nFrom the second equation, \\(0 = 2\\lambda y\\), so \\(\\lambda = 0\\) or \\(y = 0\\).\n\nIf \\(\\lambda = 0\\), then from the first equation, \\(1 = 0\\), which is impossible. Therefore, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nSo, \\(y = 0\\).\n\nFrom the first equation: \\(1 = 2\\lambda x\\), so \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2x}\\)\n\nFrom the third equation: \\(4 = 2\\lambda z\\), so \\(\\lambda = \\frac{4}{2z} = \\frac{2}{z}\\)\n\nSet them equal: \\(\\frac{1}{2x} = \\frac{2}{z}\\), so \\(z = 4x\\)\n\nNow, plug into the constraint:\n\n\\(x^2 + 0^2 + (4x)^2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(x^2 + 16x^2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(17x^2 = 2\\)\n\n\\(x^2 = \\frac{2}{17}\\)\n\n\\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\)\n\nThen, \\(z = 4x = \\pm 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\)\n\nNow, compute \\(f(x, y, z) = x + 4z\\):\n\nFor \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), \\(z = 4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\):\n\n\\(f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 4(4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 16\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = 17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = \\sqrt{34}\\)\n\nFor \\(x = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\), \\(z = -4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}\\):\n\n\\(f = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} + 4(-4\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}}) = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} - 16\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -17\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{17}} = -\\sqrt{34}\\)\n\nSo, the extrema on the boundary are \\(\\sqrt{34}\\) and \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nSince \\(f\\) is linear, and the constraint is a convex set, the extrema occur on the boundary. Therefore, the minimum value of \\(f\\) on the entire set is \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nBut let's check if there are points inside the sphere where \\(f\\) could be less than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nSuppose \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < 2\\). Since \\(f\\) is linear, and the set is convex, the extreme values still occur on the boundary. Therefore, the minimum value is indeed \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nSo, the answer should be C. -\\(\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nBut the options include D. -\\(\\sqrt{35}\\), which is smaller. Is there a mistake in my reasoning?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the function could take smaller values inside the sphere, but given that \\(f\\) is linear, and the constraint is convex, the extrema are on the boundary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the function could achieve smaller values at the origin or somewhere inside.\n\nLet's check at the origin: \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 0\\), \\(z = 0\\), then \\(f(0,0,0) = 0\\), which is greater than \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nSo, the minimum is indeed \\(-\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. -\\(\\sqrt{34}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{C}\\]"
