It says, \"______________ is a process that leads to specific decisions on how to compete in the marketplace and how the company should best serve its customers.\" And then it gives four options: A. Portfolio analysis. B. Environmental scanning. C. Strategic marketing. D. Marketing research.\n\nOkay, so I need to choose which one of these options best fits the description provided. The description is about a process that helps a company make decisions on competing in the market and serving its customers effectively.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Portfolio analysis. I think portfolio analysis is about evaluating a company's product mix or investment portfolio to make sure it's performing well and aligned with the company's goals. It's more about assessing what you already have rather than deciding how to compete or serve customers.\n\nOption B: Environmental scanning. This seems like it's about monitoring and interpreting external and internal environments that may impact the organization. It's like keeping an eye on trends, competitors, economic conditions, etc., but it's more about gathering information rather than making specific decisions on competition and customer service.\n\nOption C: Strategic marketing. This sounds promising. Strategic marketing is about developing and implementing marketing plans to achieve business goals. It involves understanding the market, identifying target customers, and deciding on the best ways to reach and serve them. It directly relates to how to compete in the marketplace and serve customers.\n\nOption D: Marketing research. This is about collecting and analyzing data to help make informed marketing decisions. It's an important part of the process, but it's more focused on research and less on the overall strategy of competition and customer service.\n\nComparing all these, strategic marketing seems to be the most fitting answer because it encompasses the decisions on how to compete and serve customers, which is exactly what the question is asking for.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Strategic marketing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
