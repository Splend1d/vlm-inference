                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"What is the area of an equilateral triangle whose inscribed circle has a radius of 2?\" And the options are A. 12, B. 16, C. 12 times square root of 3, D. 16 times square root of 3.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some properties of equilateral triangles and their incircles. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. The incircle is the circle that's tangent to all three sides of the triangle.\n\nI remember that the radius of the incircle (inradius) in an equilateral triangle is related to the side length. Let me see if I can find the formula for that.\n\nI think the formula for the inradius (r) of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is:\n\nr = (a \u221a3) / 6\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nActually, I think the area (A) of an equilateral triangle is (a\u00b2 \u221a3)/4, and the semiperimeter (s) is (3a)/2. The inradius is also given by the formula:\n\nr = A / s\n\nSo plugging in the area and semiperimeter:\n\nr = [(a\u00b2 \u221a3)/4] / (3a)/2 = (a\u00b2 \u221a3)/4 * 2/(3a) = (a \u221a3)/6\n\nYes, so r = (a \u221a3)/6\n\nOkay, now I know that r = 2, so I can set up the equation:\n\n2 = (a \u221a3)/6\n\nNow, solve for a:\n\na \u221a3 = 12\n\na = 12 / \u221a3\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\na = (12 \u221a3)/3 = 4 \u221a3\n\nSo the side length a is 4 \u221a3.\n\nNow, I need to find the area of the triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle is:\n\nA = (a\u00b2 \u221a3)/4\n\nPlug in a = 4 \u221a3:\n\nA = [(4 \u221a3)\u00b2 \u221a3]/4 = [16 * 3 * \u221a3]/4 = (48 \u221a3)/4 = 12 \u221a3\n\nSo, the area is 12 \u221a3.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 12 \u221a3, and D is 16 \u221a3. So, it seems like C is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from r = (a \u221a3)/6\n\nGiven r = 2:\n\n2 = (a \u221a3)/6\n\na \u221a3 = 12\n\na = 12 / \u221a3 = 4 \u221a3\n\nThen, area A = (a\u00b2 \u221a3)/4 = (16 * 3 * \u221a3)/4 = (48 \u221a3)/4 = 12 \u221a3\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's see.\n\nI recall that in an equilateral triangle, the centroid, circumcenter, and incenter all coincide at the same point. The inradius (r) is related to the height (h) of the triangle.\n\nThe height h of an equilateral triangle is (a \u221a3)/2.\n\nThe inradius r is one-third of the height, because the incenter is located at a distance of one-third the height from the base.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, in an equilateral triangle, the centroid (which is the same as the incenter) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, with the longer part being closer to the vertex.\n\nSo, the inradius r is one-third of the height h.\n\nTherefore, r = h / 3\n\nWe know r = 2, so h = 6\n\nNow, since h = (a \u221a3)/2, we have:\n\n6 = (a \u221a3)/2\n\na \u221a3 = 12\n\na = 12 / \u221a3 = 4 \u221a3\n\nAgain, same result as before.\n\nNow, calculating the area A = (a\u00b2 \u221a3)/4 = (16 * 3 * \u221a3)/4 = 12 \u221a3\n\nSo, again, I get the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula that relates the area to the inradius.\n\nThe area A is also equal to r * s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nWe have r = 2, and s = 3a/2 = 3*(4\u221a3)/2 = 6 \u221a3\n\nTherefore, A = 2 * 6 \u221a3 = 12 \u221a3\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, I think it's confirmed that the area is 12 \u221a3, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way this could be interpreted.\n\nIs there a possibility that the circle is circumscribed around the triangle, not inscribed?\n\nWait, the problem says \"inscribed circle,\" so it's definitely the incircle.\n\nAlso, confirming the formulas I used are appropriate for equilateral triangles.\n\nI think everything checks out.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 12 \u221a3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
