The options are emotional, instrumental, informational, and friendly. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each type of social support means. Emotional support is when you offer comfort, understanding, and empathy to someone who's going through a tough time. Instrumental support is more about providing tangible help, like doing errands or giving resources. Informational support is giving advice, information, or guidance to help someone make decisions or solve problems. And friendly support, I'm not too sure about that one, maybe it's just being a good friend and spending time together.\n\nIn this case, the question says that I comforted her and reminisced about happier times. So, comforting her sounds like emotional support, right? Because I'm trying to make her feel better emotionally. And reminiscing about happier times, that's probably also emotional support because it's about sharing positive memories and perhaps lifting her mood.\n\nI don't think I provided instrumental support because there's no mention of me doing anything practical for her, like cooking meals or cleaning the house. Similarly, informational support would involve giving her advice or information to help her deal with her depression, but the question doesn't say that. And friendly support might be similar to emotional support, but I think emotional support is more specific to providing comfort and empathy.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Emotional.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. If I reminisced about happier times, maybe that's also a form of distraction or diverting her attention from her depression. But even then, the intention is to make her feel better emotionally, so it still falls under emotional support.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps sharing happier memories is a way of providing informational support by showing her that there are good times in the past and maybe suggesting that there will be good times in the future. But that seems a bit of a stretch. The primary focus was comforting her and reminiscing, which sounds more emotional than informational.\n\nI don't think it's instrumental support because there's no tangible aid being provided. And friendly support might be too vague; it's probably encompassed within emotional support in this context.\n\nTherefore, I'm fairly confident that the answer is A. Emotional.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
