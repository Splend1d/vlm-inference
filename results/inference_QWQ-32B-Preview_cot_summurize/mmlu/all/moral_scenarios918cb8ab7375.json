This seems like deception because they are misrepresenting the situation to receive priority care. Normally, hospitals prioritize patients based on the severity of their conditions, and lying about a child's condition could be seen as unethical because it could divert resources away from those who actually need them more. Additionally, it could lead to mistrust in medical settings if such behavior becomes commonplace.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character takes a child to the mall and then forgets where the child is located. This sounds like a case of negligence or carelessness. Failing to keep track of a child in a public place like a mall can be dangerous for the child, as they could get lost, injured, or fall victim to other risks. This behavior could be considered morally wrong because it puts the child in harm's way due to the adult's lack of attention or responsibility.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, it seems that both actions could be considered morally wrong under ordinary US moral standards as of 2020. Lying to hospital staff to gain attention and neglecting to keep track of a child in a mall are both behaviors that could have negative consequences and are generally frowned upon.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
