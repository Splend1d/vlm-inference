                    "text": "To determine the strength of a 13C 90\u00b0 pulse of duration 1 \u03bcs, we need to use the relationship between the pulse angle, pulse duration, and the B1 field strength in NMR spectroscopy.\n\nThe pulse angle \u03b8 is related to the B1 field strength and the pulse duration \u03c4 by the equation:\n\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 (B1 / \u03c91) \u03c4\n\nwhere \u03c91 is the Larmor frequency of 13C.\n\nFor a 90\u00b0 pulse, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 = \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nSo, \u03c0/2 = 2\u03c0 (B1 / \u03c91) \u03c4\n\nSolving for B1:\n\nB1 = (\u03c0/2) (\u03c91) / (2\u03c0 \u03c4) = \u03c91 / (4 \u03c4)\n\nNow, we need to know the Larmor frequency \u03c91 for 13C. The Larmor frequency is given by:\n\n\u03c91 = \u03b3 B0\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of 13C and B0 is the main magnetic field strength.\n\nThe gyromagnetic ratio \u03b3 for 13C is approximately 67.26 MHz/T.\n\nHowever, in NMR, we often work with the chemical shift referencing, and for 13C, the resonance frequency is typically around 100 MHz in a 1T magnet.\n\nBut to be precise, let's assume a standard magnetic field strength B0 of 1 T for this calculation.\n\nTherefore, \u03c91 = 67.26 MHz = 67.26 \u00d7 10^6 Hz\n\nNow, \u03c4 = 1 \u03bcs = 1 \u00d7 10^-6 s\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nB1 = (67.26 \u00d7 10^6 Hz) / (4 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^-6 s) = 67.26 \u00d7 10^6 / 4 \u00d7 10^-6 = 16.815 \u00d7 10^12 Hz\u00b7s\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I must have messed up the units.\n\nLet me double-check the equation.\n\nActually, the relationship between \u03b8, B1, and \u03c4 is:\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b3 B1 \u03c4\n\nFor a 90\u00b0 pulse: \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 radians\n\nSo, \u03c0/2 = \u03b3 B1 \u03c4\n\nSolving for B1:\n\nB1 = (\u03c0/2) / (\u03b3 \u03c4)\n\nGiven that \u03b3 for 13C is 67.26 MHz/T = 67.26 \u00d7 10^6 Hz/T\n\nAnd \u03c4 = 1 \u03bcs = 1 \u00d7 10^-6 s\n\nTherefore:\n\nB1 = (\u03c0/2) / (67.26 \u00d7 10^6 Hz/T \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10^-6 s) = (\u03c0/2) / (67.26 \u00d7 10^0 Hz\u00b7s/T) = (\u03c0/2) / 67.26 T^{-1}\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\nB1 = (3.1416/2) / 67.26 \u2248 1.5708 / 67.26 \u2248 0.02335 T\n\nConverting Tesla to millitesla:\n\nB1 \u2248 0.02335 T \u00d7 1000 mT/T \u2248 23.35 mT\n\nTherefore, the strength of the 13C 90\u00b0 pulse of duration 1 \u03bcs is approximately 23.3 mT.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 23.3 mT\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
