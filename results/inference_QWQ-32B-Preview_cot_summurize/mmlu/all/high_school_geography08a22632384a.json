                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about where most workers in periphery countries are employed. The options are primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary activities. I need to remember what each of these terms means in terms of economic activities.\n\nPrimary activities are things like agriculture, fishing, and mining\u2014basically, extracting natural resources. Secondary activities involve manufacturing and construction, where raw materials are processed into goods. Tertiary activities are services like retail, banking, and education. Quaternary activities are more knowledge-based, like research and development, IT, and consulting.\n\nNow, periphery countries are typically less developed economies. I think in less developed countries, a larger portion of the workforce is involved in agriculture and other primary activities. Is that right?\n\nLet me think about it. In developed countries, there's a shift towards secondary and tertiary activities as industries develop and economies grow. So, in periphery countries, which are still developing, maybe the majority of workers are still in primary activities.\n\nBut wait, I've also heard that in some developing countries, there's a lot of manufacturing, especially as companies outsource production to places with lower labor costs. So, maybe secondary activities are prominent in periphery countries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a mix of primary and secondary. But the question is asking for the majority.\n\nI should probably look up some statistics or recall from my economics class. I remember that in the early stages of development, a country's economy is dominated by primary activities, but as it industrializes, secondary activities become more important.\n\nMaybe in periphery countries, which are still developing, primary activities still employ the majority of the workforce.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Perhaps I should consider specific examples.\n\nTake, for instance, Sub-Saharan Africa. I know that a large portion of the workforce there is engaged in agriculture. Similarly, in South Asia, like India and Bangladesh, agriculture employs a significant number of people.\n\nOn the other hand, in countries like China and Vietnam, there's been a big push towards manufacturing, so secondary activities might employ more people there.\n\nWait, but China is considered a developing country, but it's more of a developing economy that's rapidly industrializing. Maybe it's moving beyond the periphery stage.\n\nSo, perhaps in poorer, less developed countries, primary activities dominate.\n\nBut I also know that in many developing countries, the service sector is growing. For example, call centers and other business process outsourcing in places like the Philippines and India are part of the tertiary sector.\n\nSo, maybe it's not just primary activities, but a mix of primary and tertiary.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to recall the sectoral shift theory or something like that.\n\nI think the classic model is that in early development, most people are in agriculture, then as economies industrialize, people move to manufacturing, and finally, in post-industrial societies, the service sector dominates.\n\nIf that's the case, then periphery countries, which are less developed, should have a majority in primary activities.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this model applies universally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's different now with globalization. Maybe periphery countries skip some stages and have a mix of primary and secondary activities.\n\nI need to make a guess here. I think the answer is A. Primary, because in less developed countries, agriculture and related activities still employ the largest portion of the workforce.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this. Maybe I should look it up, but since I can't right now, I'll go with primary activities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
