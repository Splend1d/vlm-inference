                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's going on in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person saw a cool movie about a murder and then framed a poster from that movie to put on their wall. Now, movies about murders are pretty common\u2014think thrillers, crime dramas, etc. Just because a movie includes a murder doesn't mean it's promoting or encouraging real-life murder. It's fiction, meant for entertainment. So, enjoying such a movie and displaying a poster from it doesn't seem morally wrong. It's like liking a book about fantasy or historical events; it doesn't mean you want those things to happen in real life.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone trimmed a deer's antlers so the deer could lift its head. This sounds a bit odd. Deer naturally grow antlers, and antlers serve various purposes, including for mating displays and fighting. Altering a deer's antlers could be harmful to the deer, depending on how it's done. If someone is trimming antlers without proper knowledge or permission, it could be considered cruelty to animals or interfering with wildlife. In many places, it's illegal to harm wildlife without a valid reason, like in controlled hunting or veterinary care.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
