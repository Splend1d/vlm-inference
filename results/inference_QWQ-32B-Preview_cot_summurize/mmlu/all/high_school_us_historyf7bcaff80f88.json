We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nThe \"free silver\" campaign of 1896 received its greatest popular support from\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the \"free silver\" campaign of 1896, and it's asking who provided the greatest popular support for it. The options are New England businessmen, Southern women, bankers, or farmers. And there's some context from the Populist Party Platform of 1892.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the \"free silver\" campaign was about. From what I know, it was about expanding the money supply by allowing the unlimited coinage of silver, not just gold, which was the standard at the time. The idea was to increase the amount of money in circulation, which could help farmers and other debtors because it would make it easier to pay off their debts with cheaper dollars.\n\nLooking back at the Populist Party Platform, it mentions \"the demonetization of silver,\" which suggests that silver was being undervalued or not used as much in the monetary system. The Populists were against this and probably favored \"free silver\" to help the \"suffering people\" and \"the plain people,\" especially farmers who were struggling with debt.\n\nSo, among the options:\n\nA. New England businessmen: New England was more industrialized, and businessmen there might have been more tied to the gold standard, which was seen as more stable for trade and industry. So, they might not have supported free silver.\n\nB. Southern women: While women were certainly part of the population and might have supported various reforms, the question is specifically about economic issues related to the money supply. It's possible, but compared to farmers, it might not be the primary group.\n\nC. Bankers: Bankers were generally in favor of the gold standard because it was more stable and favorable to creditors. So, they probably wouldn't support free silver, which would make money easier to come by and potentially lead to inflation, which isn't good for creditors.\n\nD. Farmers: As mentioned in the platform, farmers were among the \"suffering people\" and \"the plain people.\" They were heavily in debt, and an expanded money supply could help them by making debt repayment easier.\n\nGiven this, it seems like farmers would have been the group most supportive of the free silver campaign. They had a lot to gain from an increased money supply that could help alleviate their debt burdens.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again:\n\n- New England businessmen: Less likely, as they were probably more aligned with the established banking system and gold standard.\n\n- Southern women: While they might have supported various reforms, the specific economic issue of free silver might not have been their primary concern compared to farmers.\n\n- Bankers: Definitely against free silver, as it could lead to inflation and devalue their loans.\n\n- Farmers: Directly affected by the money supply and in need of relief from debt.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. farmers, who hoped that a more generous money supply would ease their debt burdens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
