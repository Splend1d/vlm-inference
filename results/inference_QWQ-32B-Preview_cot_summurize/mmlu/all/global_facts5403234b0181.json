                    "text": "I'm trying to remember the percentage of the world's land area that's covered by forests, around 2015. I think it's somewhere around 30%, but I'm not sure. Let me see what I can recall.\n\nFirst, I know that forests are really important for absorbing carbon dioxide and providing habitats for many species. So, their coverage matters a lot for the environment.\n\nI recall that the Earth's total surface area is about 510 million square kilometers, but only about 30% of that is land. So, the land area is roughly 150 million square kilometers.\n\nNow, regarding forest coverage, I seem to remember that about a third of the land area is forested. So, that would be around 30% of the land area.\n\nBut let me double-check. I think in some reports, the forest coverage is higher, maybe around 45%. Wait, is that right?\n\nI need to think carefully. I know that there are different types of forests, like tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. Maybe the total coverage is higher when you include all types.\n\nOn the other hand, I've heard about deforestation and how it's reducing forest areas, so maybe 30% is a bit high.\n\nLet me try to recall some figures. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the global forest area is around 4 billion hectares.\n\nGiven that the total land area is about 13 billion hectares, that would be roughly 30% forest coverage.\n\nWait, but maybe their estimates are different. Perhaps they include different definitions of what constitutes a forest.\n\nI should consider that some areas might be considered forested even if they are not fully covered by trees, like sparse forests or plantations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the percentage is higher, around 45%, as option C suggests.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's lower, around 15%, but that seems too low.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that in some studies, the original forest coverage before human activities was much higher, possibly over 60%, but that's not the case in 2015.\n\nGiven that, perhaps 30% is a reasonable estimate for the forest coverage in 2015.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider other factors.\n\nFor example, different countries have different forest coverage. Countries like Russia and Canada have extensive forest areas, while others like Australia have less.\n\nAlso, there are initiatives to increase forest coverage, like the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 150 million hectares of forests by 2020.\n\nBut even with that, I don't think the global coverage has reached 45%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's lower than 30%. Perhaps 15% is more accurate.\n\nWait, that seems too low. I think it's higher than that.\n\nLet me consider the fact that many countries have protected areas and national parks that include forested lands.\n\nAdditionally, there are tropical rainforests like the Amazon and Congo Basin, which cover large areas.\n\nConsidering all that, I'm leaning towards 30% as the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider the options again.\n\nOption A is 15%, which seems too low.\n\nOption B is 30%, which aligns with my recall.\n\nOption C is 45%, which might be too high.\n\nOption D is 60%, which was perhaps the original coverage before deforestation, but not in 2015.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B, 30%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
