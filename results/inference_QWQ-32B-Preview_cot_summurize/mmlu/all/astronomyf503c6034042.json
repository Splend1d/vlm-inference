                    "text": "So, imagine the Earth is moved suddenly to an orbit that's three times farther from the Sun. We need to figure out how much longer a year would be in this new orbit. The options are:\n\nA. Exactly 3 times longer\n\nB. About 5.2 times longer\n\nC. Not enough information. It depends on the inclination of the new orbit.\n\nD. The length of the year wouldn't change because the Earth's mass stays the same.\n\nHmm, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the length of a year is related to how long it takes for the Earth to orbit the Sun once. So, if the Earth is moved to a farther orbit, it might take longer to go around the Sun.\n\nI recall that there's a relationship between the distance from the Sun and the orbital period. I think it has something to do with Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Specifically, Kepler's third law might be relevant here, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nIn formula terms, that's T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, where T is the orbital period and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nSo, if the Earth is moved to an orbit three times farther from the Sun, that means the semi-major axis a is tripled.\n\nLet's denote the original orbital period as T\u2081 and the new orbital period as T\u2082. Similarly, a\u2081 is the original semi-major axis, and a\u2082 is the new one, which is 3 times a\u2081.\n\nAccording to Kepler's third law:\n\n(T\u2081)\u00b2 / (a\u2081)\u00b3 = (T\u2082)\u00b2 / (a\u2082)\u00b3\n\nSince a\u2082 = 3 * a\u2081, we can substitute that in:\n\n(T\u2081)\u00b2 / (a\u2081)\u00b3 = (T\u2082)\u00b2 / (3*a\u2081)\u00b3\n\nSimplify the denominator on the right side:\n\n(T\u2081)\u00b2 / (a\u2081)\u00b3 = (T\u2082)\u00b2 / (27 * a\u2081)\u00b3\n\nWait, no, (3*a\u2081)\u00b3 is 27*(a\u2081)\u00b3.\n\nSo:\n\n(T\u2081)\u00b2 / (a\u2081)\u00b3 = (T\u2082)\u00b2 / (27 * a\u2081)\u00b3\n\nActually, that should be:\n\n(T\u2081)\u00b2 / (a\u2081)\u00b3 = (T\u2082)\u00b2 / (27 * a\u2081\u00b3)\n\nNow, we can cross-multiply to solve for T\u2082:\n\n(T\u2081)\u00b2 * 27 * a\u2081\u00b3 = (T\u2082)\u00b2 * a\u2081\u00b3\n\nDivide both sides by a\u2081\u00b3:\n\n27 * (T\u2081)\u00b2 = (T\u2082)\u00b2\n\nNow, solve for T\u2082:\n\nT\u2082 = T\u2081 * sqrt(27)\n\nSimplify sqrt(27):\n\nsqrt(27) = sqrt(9*3) = 3 * sqrt(3)\n\nSo, T\u2082 = T\u2081 * 3 * sqrt(3)\n\nBut sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so:\n\nT\u2082 \u2248 T\u2081 * 3 * 1.732 \u2248 T\u2081 * 5.196\n\nThat's roughly 5.2 times longer than the original orbital period.\n\nWait a minute, but option B says about 5.2 times longer, which matches this calculation. But let me double-check if I did everything correctly.\n\nStarting from Kepler's third law: T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3\n\nSo, T\u2082 / T\u2081 = (a\u2082 / a\u2081)^(3/2)\n\nGiven that a\u2082 = 3 * a\u2081, then:\n\nT\u2082 / T\u2081 = (3)^(3/2) = 3^(1.5) = 3 * sqrt(3) \u2248 3 * 1.732 \u2248 5.196\n\nYes, that's approximately 5.2 times longer.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Exactly 3 times longer\n\nB. About 5.2 times longer\n\nC. Not enough information. It depends on the inclination of the new orbit.\n\nD. The length of the year wouldn't change because the Earth's mass stays the same.\n\nOption A suggests exactly 3 times longer, but according to Kepler's law, it's about 5.2 times longer.\n\nOption B matches our calculation.\n\nOption C says not enough information and that it depends on the inclination of the new orbit. But Kepler's laws apply to elliptical orbits, and the period depends on the semi-major axis, not on the inclination. So, inclination shouldn't affect the orbital period.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the mass of the Earth doesn't affect its orbital period around the Sun. The period depends on the mass of the central body (the Sun) and the semi-major axis of the orbit.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. About 5.2 times longer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that could influence the orbital period.\n\nFor example, if the new orbit is highly elliptical rather than circular, the period would still depend on the semi-major axis, according to Kepler's third law. So, the shape of the orbit doesn't affect the period as long as the semi-major axis remains the same.\n\nIn this scenario, the Earth is moved to an orbit three times farther from the Sun. If \"three times farther\" means the semi-major axis is tripled, then the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, if \"three times farther\" means the distance is increased by a factor of three, but the original distance is already one astronomical unit (AU), then the new distance is 3 AU, which would make the semi-major axis three times larger.\n\nTherefore, the orbital period would be approximately 5.2 times longer.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. About 5.2 times longer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
