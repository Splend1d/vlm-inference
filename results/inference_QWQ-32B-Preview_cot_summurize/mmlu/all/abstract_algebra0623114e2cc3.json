Every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nGiven these definitions, is every field a ring?\n\nWell, a field satisfies all the ring axioms:\n\n- Addition is associative.\n\n- Addition has an identity (the additive identity).\n\n- Every element has an additive inverse.\n\n- Multiplication is associative.\n\n- Multiplication distributes over addition.\n\nMoreover, in a field, multiplication is commutative, which is often a property of rings, though not always depending on the definition.\n\nHowever, some definitions of a ring do not require multiplication to be commutative, in which case a field would be a special kind of ring where multiplication is commutative and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\n\nSo, under most standard definitions, every field is indeed a ring. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2: Every ring has a multiplicative identity.**\n\nAgain, recalling the definition of a ring, it includes the following:\n\n- Addition forms an abelian group.\n\n- Multiplication is associative.\n\n- Multiplication distributes over addition.\n\nBut does a ring necessarily have a multiplicative identity?\n\nActually, this is a point of variation in definitions. Some authors define a ring to include a multiplicative identity (often denoted as 1), while others do not require it.\n\nIn the definition that includes a multiplicative identity, every ring has a multiplicative identity. In the definition that does not include it, there exist rings without a multiplicative identity.\n\nTherefore, whether this statement is true or false depends on the specific definition being used.\n\nIn many standard algebra textbooks, particularly in more advanced contexts, rings are defined to have a multiplicative identity. However, in some contexts, especially in more elementary treatments, rings may not be required to have a multiplicative identity.\n\nGiven this variability, I would say that Statement 2 is not universally true, as there are rings without multiplicative identities.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nSo the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
