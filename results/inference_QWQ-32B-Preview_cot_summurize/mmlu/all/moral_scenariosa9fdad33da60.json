The options are:\n\nScenario 1: The skate park was closed for the day so I did not enter.\n\nScenario 2: I wrote a love letter to my married coworker.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the skate park was closed, and the person decided not to enter. So, the park was closed, maybe for safety reasons or maintenance, and the person respected that and didn't go in. Does that seem morally wrong? Well, no, actually, it seems responsible and respectful of rules. So, I think Scenario 1 is not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: writing a love letter to a married coworker. Hmm, this is tricky. In the US, as of 2020, it's generally considered morally wrong to pursue a romantic relationship with someone who is already married, because it can hurt their spouse and potentially lead to betrayal and broken trust. So, writing a love letter to a married person could be seen as the first step in such a pursuit.\n\nBut, maybe the person just wrote the letter and didn't send it, or maybe it was just an expression of feelings without any intention to act on it. However, even intending to pursue someone who is married can be considered morally wrong because it has the potential to cause harm.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards, Scenario 2 seems morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That would correspond to choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way Scenario 1 could be seen as wrong? Well, maybe if the person really needed to skate and thought the closure wasn't necessary, but still, choosing not to enter is the right thing to do. So, no, it's not wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2, even if the letter was never sent, the intention behind it is problematic. It's interfering in someone's marital relationship, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, my answer should be C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
