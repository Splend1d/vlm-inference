                    "text": "So I've got this question here about collective security, and I need to choose the best definition from these options. Let's see what each one is saying.\n\nOption A says: \"The right to self-defence by more than one nation acting in concert.\" Hmm, that sounds like when countries team up to defend themselves if they're threatened. But isn't that more about self-defence than collective security?\n\nOption B says: \"The right of one's allies to defend the victim State.\" This seems similar to A, but it's specifically about allies defending a victim state. Is that different from collective security?\n\nOption C says: \"The authorisation of armed force by the UN Security Council.\" Okay, this brings in the United Nations. The UN Security Council does authorize the use of force in certain situations, like enforcing resolutions or maintaining international peace and security.\n\nOption D says: \"The authorisation of peacekeeping missions by the UN General Assembly.\" So, this is about peacekeeping missions authorized by the UN General Assembly.\n\nNow, I need to think about what collective security really means. Collective security is a concept where states collectively work together to maintain security and prevent aggression. It's based on the idea that if one state is attacked, others will come to its defense, thus detering potential aggressors.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A talks about self-defence by multiple nations, which is part of collective security, but it might not capture the whole picture because collective security is also about prevention and maintaining peace, not just responding to attacks.\n\nOption B is similar, focusing on allies defending a victim state, which again seems more about defense than the broader concept of collective security.\n\nOption C mentions the UN Security Council authorizing armed force. While this is indeed a part of how the international community addresses security threats, it's more about specific actions taken in response to threats, not the overall concept of collective security.\n\nOption D is about the UN General Assembly authorizing peacekeeping missions. Peacekeeping is certainly a part of maintaining international security, but again, it's a specific tool rather than the overarching concept.\n\nI think the best answer is probably C, the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council, because it involves the international community coming together to maintain security and respond to threats, which is at the heart of collective security.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe collective security encompasses more than just the authorization of armed force. Maybe it includes diplomatic efforts, economic sanctions, and other measures too.\n\nWait, the UN Security Council does authorize not just military action but also sanctions and other measures to maintain or restore international peace and security. So, perhaps C is the most accurate choice.\n\nOption D, about the UN General Assembly authorizing peacekeeping missions, is interesting, but I think it's the Security Council that primarily handles such authorizations, not the General Assembly.\n\nMoreover, collective security is often associated with the UN's role in maintaining international peace and security, which is outlined in the UN Charter.\n\nLet me recall, the UN Charter allows for collective security through measures like Article 51, which recognizes the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs, and through Chapter VII, which allows the Security Council to take military and non-military action to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council is a key aspect of collective security.\n\nBut maybe I should consider that collective security is a broader concept that includes not just the UN but also other international agreements and organizations.\n\nFor example, NATO has the principle of collective defense, where an attack against one is considered an attack against all, as stated in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.\n\nSo, in that sense, collective security can involve regional alliances as well as global organizations like the UN.\n\nBut given the options provided, C seems to be the most directly related to collective security at the international level.\n\nOption A and B seem more focused on self-defense and allied defense, which are components of collective security but perhaps not the entire picture.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with C: the authorization of armed force by the UN Security Council as the meaning of collective security.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
