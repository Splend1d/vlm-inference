Menstruation without ovulation\n\nD. Ovulation without menstruation\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nPainful menstruation, also known as dysmenorrhea, is when a person experiences pain or cramps during their period. This is pretty common, but I'm not sure if it's the most common menstrual issue.\n\nAbsence of menstruation is amenorrhea, which means not having periods. This can be primary, meaning never starting menstruation, or secondary, meaning periods stop after they have started. Amenorrhea isn't as common as some other issues.\n\nMenstruation without ovulation refers to having a period without ovulating. This can happen, for example, in cases of anovulatory cycles, which are more common, especially in teenagers and approaching menopause.\n\nOvulation without menstruation seems a bit confusing. If you ovulate but don't have a period, that might indicate pregnancy or some other issue.\n\nLet me think about this. The most common menstrual problem would probably be something that affects a large portion of the population who menstruate.\n\nPainful menstruation is very common. A lot of people experience cramps and pain during their periods. In fact, it's one of the most reported menstrual issues.\n\nAbsence of menstruation, while serious, is not as common as painful periods.\n\nMenstruation without ovulation can happen, especially in younger people or those approaching menopause, but again, not as common as dysmenorrhea.\n\nOvulation without menstruation is less common and usually indicates pregnancy or another issue.\n\nSo, based on this, I would say that the most common menstrual problem is painful menstruation.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I should look up some statistics or recall information from reliable sources.\n\nI remember that dysmenorrhea affects up to 90% of people who menstruate at some point in their lives. That's a huge percentage.\n\nAmenorrhea, on the other hand, affects a smaller percentage of the population. Primary amenorrhea affects about 0.3-0.5% of females by age 16, and secondary amenorrhea affects about 2-5% of women of reproductive age.\n\nAnovulatory cycles are more common in certain populations, like adolescents and perimenopausal women, but overall, dysmenorrhea seems more widespread.\n\nOvulation without menstruation is less common and usually points to pregnancy or other medical conditions.\n\nTherefore, it seems that painful menstruation is the most common menstrual problem among the options given.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
