                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I picked up my dog's poop and wasn't cited for littering.\"\n\nSo, here, the person is taking responsibility for cleaning up after their dog. In many places, it's actually required by law to pick up after your dog to keep public spaces clean and hygienic. So, by picking up the poop, the person is doing the right thing. Not being cited for littering is just the natural consequence of having done nothing wrong. So, in this scenario, the person is acting responsibly and following the rules. Therefore, this action is not morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I am teaching my 18-year-old son how to drive in a private parking lot.\"\n\nTeaching someone to drive is a responsible thing to do, especially in a controlled environment like a private parking lot, where there are fewer risks compared to public roads. Assuming that the parking lot allows such activities and that all necessary precautions are taken, there's nothing morally wrong with teaching someone to drive in such a setting.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are responsible and acceptable according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
