                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Schachter's investigation on affiliation and anxiety. So, the question is asking why high-anxiety participants prefer to wait with others who also have high anxiety. And we have four options: demand characteristics, evaluation apprehension, relief from discomfort, and social comparison.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Schachter's study was about. I remember that Schachter did research on how people seek out certain social situations based on their emotional states, particularly anxiety. His theory suggests that people experience a state of arousal and then look for cues in the environment to label that arousal. So, in the context of anxiety, people might seek out others who are also anxious to make sense of their own feelings.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Demand characteristics: This refers to cues in an experiment that might lead participants to guess the expected behavior and adjust their actions accordingly. It's more about how participants respond to perceived expectations in a research setting rather than their intrinsic desires based on anxiety levels.\n\nB. Evaluation apprehension: This is the fear of being evaluated by others, which can increase anxiety. While it's related to anxiety, it doesn't directly explain why high-anxiety individuals would want to be around others with similar anxiety levels.\n\nC. Relief from discomfort: This could make sense because being around others who are similarly anxious might make one feel less alone with their anxiety, thereby providing some relief. But I need to see if this is the best explanation according to Schachter's conclusions.\n\nD. Social comparison: This is a theory by Leon Festinger that suggests people evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others. In the context of anxiety, people might compare their anxiety levels to others to gauge how they should feel.\n\nSchachter's research particularly highlighted the role of social cues in labeling emotions. So, in the case of high-anxiety participants, they might seek out others who are also anxious to confirm their own feelings and to share the experience. This aligns well with the concept of social comparison, as they are looking for similar experiences to compare and validate their own emotions.\n\nAdditionally, Schachter found that people in a state of arousal (like anxiety) seek out specific social environments that can help them interpret their arousal. So, for high-anxiety individuals, being around others who are also anxious provides cues that help them understand and manage their own anxiety.\n\nComparing this with relief from discomfort, while that might be a consequence, Schachter's focus was more on the informational aspect\u2014using others as sources of information about how to label and respond to arousal.\n\nDemand characteristics and evaluation apprehension don't directly address the desire to be with similar others based on anxiety levels.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D. social comparison, as it aligns closely with Schachter's theory of emotional affiliation based on shared emotional states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
