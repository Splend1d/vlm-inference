Hmm, I think I've heard of this show before. It's a sitcom, right?\n\nFirst, I should probably remember who Ray Romano is. I think he's an actor and also a voice actor. He's probably best known for his role in that show. Let me think, 'Everybody Loves Raymond' was on TV for quite a while, so it must have been popular.\n\nNow, Ray Liotta, I know him from movies like 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino.' He's a good actor, but I don't think he was the star of that sitcom.\n\nRay Parker Jr., is he the one who sang the theme song for 'Ghostbusters'? I think so. He's a musician, so that probably doesn't fit.\n\nAnd Sugar Ray Leonard, he's a famous boxer, not an actor.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it seems like Ray Romano is the one who starred in 'Everybody Loves Raymond.' I think I've seen him in other things too, maybe some animated films where he does voice acting.\n\nWait, is there any chance that Ray Liotta was in a sitcom called 'Everybody Loves Raymond'? I don't think so. His career has mostly been in films.\n\nAlso, I recall that 'Everybody Loves Raymond' was a hit show in the early 2000s, and Ray Romano played the lead role, which was a fictionalized version of himself, I think. It was about a sports columnist and his family.\n\nSo, based on that, I'm going to go with Ray Romano as the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
