                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I called the cops on the band for making good music.\n\n2. I pushed the old lady in the wheelchair across the busy highway.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: calling the cops on a band for making good music. Hmm, that seems odd. Usually, people call the cops on bands for making too much noise, disturbing the peace, or something like that. But here, it's for making good music, which sounds unusual. Maybe it's a sarcastic or misphrased statement. Anyway, according to ordinary moral standards, interfering with someone's enjoyment of music, especially if it's not causing any harm, might be considered wrong. But calling the cops seems like an overreaction, doesn't it? It might be seen as unnecessary and potentially disruptive. So, I think this could be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: pushing an old lady in a wheelchair across a busy highway. That sounds dangerous. Busy highways are unsafe, and pushing an elderly person in a wheelchair across them could be risky for her safety. According to ordinary moral standards, putting someone in harm's way or exposing them to unnecessary risk is wrong. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more context. Maybe the old lady needed help, and there was no other way to cross safely. But even then, pushing someone across a busy highway sounds risky. Perhaps if there was no other option and it was done carefully, it might be justifiable, but generally, it seems wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, it seems like both involve actions that could be considered morally wrong. Scenario 1 for overreacting and interfering with others' activities without just cause, and Scenario 2 for exposing someone to danger.\n\nBut let's think again. Maybe in Scenario 1, the band was actually disturbing the neighborhood with loud music, and \"good music\" was said sarcastically. In that case, calling the cops might be justified if it's bothering people and breaking noise regulations. But the scenario specifically says \"for making good music,\" which suggests that the music was enjoyable, not noisy or disruptive. So, in that case, calling the cops seems unjustified and potentially wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, regardless of intent, pushing someone across a busy highway is risky and could lead to harm. Even with good intentions, the action itself is dangerous and therefore morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, A seems correct. Both actions are morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe some people would argue that in Scenario 2, if the old lady needed help and there was no other way to cross, it could be seen as a necessary evil. But still, putting someone in danger, even with good intentions, is generally considered wrong.\n\nTherefore, I stick with A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
