                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about a resistor dissipating energy. It says that a resistor is dissipating energy at a rate of 1 watt, and then the voltage across it is doubled. I need to figure out what the new rate of energy dissipation will be. The options are 0.25 W, 0.5 W, 1 W, or 4 W.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how power is related to voltage and resistance in a resistor. I know that power dissipated by a resistor can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{V^2}{R} \\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) is the power in watts, \\( V \\) is the voltage across the resistor in volts, and \\( R \\) is the resistance in ohms.\n\nSo, initially, we have:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{V^2}{R} = 1 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nNow, the voltage is doubled, so the new voltage is \\( 2V \\). I need to find the new power dissipation, \\( P_{\\text{new}} \\):\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{(2V)^2}{R} \\]\n\nLet me calculate \\( (2V)^2 \\):\n\n\\[ (2V)^2 = 4V^2 \\]\n\nSo, plugging that back into the power formula:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{4V^2}{R} \\]\n\nBut I know that \\( \\frac{V^2}{R} = 1 \\, \\text{W} \\), so:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = 4 \\times \\frac{V^2}{R} = 4 \\times 1 \\, \\text{W} = 4 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, if the voltage is doubled, the power dissipation quadruples. That means the new power dissipation is 4 watts.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this. I recall that power can also be calculated using Ohm's law, like \\( P = I^2 R \\), where \\( I \\) is the current through the resistor.\n\nInitially:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{initial}} = I^2 R = 1 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nIf the voltage is doubled, the current through the resistor will also double because \\( I = \\frac{V}{R} \\). So, the new current is \\( 2I \\).\n\nTherefore, the new power dissipation would be:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = (2I)^2 R = 4I^2 R = 4 \\times 1 \\, \\text{W} = 4 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nAgain, I get 4 watts. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula \\( P = V I \\). Initially:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{initial}} = V I = 1 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nIf voltage is doubled to \\( 2V \\), and current is doubled to \\( 2I \\), then:\n\n\\[ P_{\\text{new}} = (2V)(2I) = 4 V I = 4 \\times 1 \\, \\text{W} = 4 \\, \\text{W} \\]\n\nOnce more, I arrive at 4 watts.\n\nSo, all these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion that the new power dissipation is 4 watts.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where doubling the voltage wouldn't quadruple the power. For example, if the resistor's value changed with voltage, but the problem doesn't suggest that, so I can assume the resistance remains constant.\n\nAlso, maybe if the resistor was part of a more complex circuit, but the problem seems to present it as a single resistor in a circuit, so I think it's safe to assume that the resistance stays the same.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 4 watts.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 4 W is the choice I should select.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4 \\, \\text{W}} \\]"
