I need to remember the order of operations, which is PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), and Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).\n\nFirst, I look for any parentheses or exponents in the expression. There are none, so I move on to multiplication and division. In the expression, I see a division operation: 8 \u00f7 2.\n\nI perform that first: 8 \u00f7 2 equals 4.\n\nNow, the expression becomes 8 + 4 + 2.\n\nNext, I perform the addition from left to right: 8 + 4 is 12, and then 12 + 2 is 14.\n\nSo, the answer should be 14.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something. Some people might think that addition comes before division, but according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division have the same precedence and are done from left to right.\n\nIn this case, the division comes before the addition when reading from left to right, so I did it correctly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
