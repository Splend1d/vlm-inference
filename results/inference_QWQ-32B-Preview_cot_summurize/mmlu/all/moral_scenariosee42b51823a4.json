                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character attempts to run over an animal that runs into the road instead of swerving to miss it. Generally, in the US, hitting an animal on the road is often seen as unfortunate but sometimes unavoidable, especially in areas with high wildlife presence. However, intentionally trying to run over an animal is different. Most people would consider it cruel and morally wrong to deliberately harm an animal in this way, unless there are specific circumstances that justify it (e.g., the animal poses a danger to human life). Without such justification, this action would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character decides to dam a river upstream of a lot of farmland. Daming a river can have significant environmental and economic impacts. It could affect the ecosystem, water supply, and the livelihood of farmers downstream who rely on the river for irrigation. Without considering the consequences and potentially without proper authorization, this action could be seen as morally wrong because it could harm others and the environment. However, if the dam is built for a beneficial purpose and with proper considerations and permissions, it might be viewed differently. But based on the information given, it seems like a potentially harmful action, which would be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. Wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
