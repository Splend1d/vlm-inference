He began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. One could not have been worse hanged than I was. The executioner of the Holy Inquisition was a sub-deacon, and knew how to burn people marvellously well, but he was not accustomed to hanging. The cord was wet and did not slip properly, and besides it was badly tied; in short, I still drew my breath, when the crucial incision made me give such a frightful scream that my surgeon fell flat upon his back&\u2026[At length he] sewed up my wounds; his wife even nursed me. I was upon my legs at the end of fifteen days&\u2026.\nOne day I took it into my head to step into a mosque, where I saw an old Iman and a very pretty young devotee who was saying her paternosters&\u2026.She dropped her bouquet; I picked it up, and presented it to her with a profound reverence. I was so long in delivering it that the Iman began to get angry, and seeing that I was a Christian he called out for help. They carried me before the cadi, who ordered me a hundred lashes on the soles of the feet and sent me to the galleys. I was chained to the very same galley and the same bench as the young Baron. On board this galley there were four young men from Marseilles, five Neapolitan priests, and two monks from Corfu, who told us similar adventures happened daily. The Baron maintained that he had suffered greater injustice than I&\u2026.We were continually disputing, and received twenty lashes with a bull's pizzle when the concatenation of universal events brought you to our galley, and you were good enough to ransom us.\"\n\"Well, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide to him, \"when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?\"\n\"I am still of my first opinion,\" answered Pangloss, \"for I am a philosopher and I cannot retract, especially as Leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis.\"\nVoltaire, French Enlightenment writer, Candide, 1759\nThe critiques offered by Voltaire through Candide are most closely shared by what other philosopher?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question about Voltaire's \"Candide,\" and it's asking which philosopher shares similar critiques with Voltaire through his character Candide. The options are Cesare Beccaria, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, and David Hume. I need to figure out who aligns most closely with Voltaire's satirical views in \"Candide.\"\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what \"Candide\" is about. It's a satirical novella by Voltaire, published in 1759, during the Enlightenment period. The story follows the adventures of Candide, a naive optimist who is influenced by his tutor, Pangloss, who believes that \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,\" a philosophy attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Throughout the story, Candide and Pangloss experience numerous misadventures and catastrophes, which challenge this optimistic view.\n\nIn the passage provided, Pangloss recounts his own misfortunes, including being hanged, dissected, whipped, and forced into galley slavery. Despite all this suffering, Pangloss remains steadfast in his belief in pre-established harmony and Leibniz's philosophy, which suggests that everything that happens is for the best and part of a grand design.\n\nVoltaire is using Candide and Pangloss to critique this optimistic philosophy, arguing that it's unrealistic and naive given the widespread suffering and evil in the world. So, the critique here is against uncritical optimism and the idea that all events are part of a perfect plan.\n\nNow, I need to see which of the philosophers listed shares similar critiques with Voltaire.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Cesare Beccaria: He was an Italian philosopher known for his work on criminal justice reform, particularly \"On Crimes and Punishments\" (1764). Beccaria critiqued the harsh and arbitrary nature of the criminal justice system of his time, advocating for reforms based on Enlightenment principles like rationality and humanity. While Beccaria was indeed a critic, his focus was more on legal and penal systems, rather than philosophical optimism or metaphysical doctrines like pre-established harmony.\n\nB. Jean-Jacques Rousseau: He was a Swiss philosopher who had complex views that sometimes aligned with and sometimes opposed Enlightenment ideas. Rousseau is known for his critique of civilization and his belief in the inherent goodness of humanity, which is corrupted by society. In \"Discourse on Inequality\" (1755) and \"Emile\" (1762), he argues that natural man is good, but society makes him bad. This seems somewhat similar to Voltaire's critique of optimistic views that everything is for the best, as Rousseau questions the benefits of civilization and progress.\n\nC. Adam Smith: He was a Scottish economist and philosopher, best known for his work \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776), which laid the foundations of classical free-market economics. Smith also wrote \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" (1759), where he explores moral philosophy. While Smith certainly critiqued mercantilist economic policies and advocated for free markets, his work isn't primarily focused on critiquing philosophical optimism or metaphysical systems like Leibniz's.\n\nD. David Hume: He was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist, known for his scepticism and empiricism. Hume critiqued many established beliefs and doctrines, including those in metaphysics and religion. His works, such as \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1739-40) and \"Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding\" (1748), challenge traditional notions of causality, the existence of the self, and the foundations of morality. Hume's sceptical approach aligns with Voltaire's critical stance towards uncritically accepting philosophical doctrines, especially those that claim a perfect order in the universe.\n\nConsidering these brief overviews, I need to determine which of these philosophers most closely shares Voltaire's critiques as expressed through Candide.\n\nBeccaria's critiques are more specific to criminal justice, which doesn't directly align with Voltaire's broader philosophical critique in \"Candide.\"\n\nRousseau questions the benefits of civilization and society, which shares some overlap with Voltaire's skepticism towards optimistic views of the world. However, Rousseau's focus is more on social and political structures, whereas Voltaire is directly challenging a philosophical position.\n\nAdam Smith's critiques are primarily economic and moral, not directly targeting philosophical optimism.\n\nDavid Hume's scepticism and critique of metaphysical doctrines like pre-established harmony align closely with Voltaire's stance in \"Candide.\" Hume's empiricism leads him to question abstract theories that aren't supported by empirical evidence, much like Voltaire is doing by highlighting the disconnect between Leibniz's optimistic philosophy and the harsh realities of life.\n\nTherefore, the philosopher who most closely shares Voltaire's critiques through Candide is David Hume.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
