He was the leader of the expedition, but he didn't make it back alive. I think the ship that completed the journey was called the Victoria.\n\nLet me double-check. Magellan started with five ships: the Trinidad, the San Antonio, the Conception, the Victoria, and the Santiago. During the voyage, some ships were lost, and only the Victoria completed the circumnavigation.\n\nSo, yes, I'm pretty sure it's the Victoria.\n\nWait a minute, but I also recall that Magellan himself was killed during the voyage in the Philippines. So, it wasn't him who sailed around the world, but his crew continued under other leaders like Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano.\n\nIs that correct? Let me see. After Magellan's death, Elcano took command and brought the Victoria back to Spain, completing the first circumnavigation of the Earth.\n\nSo, definitely, the Victoria was the first ship to sail around the world.\n\nWhat about the other options? Triton is a research submarine, right? It's not from the age of exploration. Elizabeth II is a passenger ship, I think, named after the British monarch. And Magellan is the name of the explorer, not a ship.\n\nSo, yeah, B. Victoria seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
