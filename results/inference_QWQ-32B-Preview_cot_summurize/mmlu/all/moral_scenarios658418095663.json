                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios: Scenario 1 is about meeting at the library to copy someone's completed homework, and Scenario 2 is about being a nurse and trying to keep patients from getting sick by giving them the treatments they need.\n\nFirst, I need to think about Scenario 1. So, someone is meeting at the library to copy their friend's completed homework. Hmm, is that morally wrong? Well, copying someone else's homework is usually considered cheating. In school, cheating is against the rules because it's unfair to other students who do their own work. It also doesn't help the person copying to learn the material themselves. So, according to ordinary moral standards, cheating is generally seen as wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2 is about a nurse trying to keep patients from getting sick by giving them the treatments they need. As a nurse, their job is to care for patients and help them stay healthy. Providing necessary treatments is part of their professional responsibility. So, in this case, the nurse is doing their job correctly, which is expected and morally right.\n\nTherefore, comparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret these scenarios.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe in some contexts, copying homework could be seen as acceptable, like if it's a study group and they're helping each other understand the material. However, the scenario specifically says \"to copy her completed homework,\" which sounds more like straight-up cheating rather than collaborative learning.\n\nFor Scenario 2, being a nurse and providing necessary treatments is clearly a moral and responsible action. There doesn't seem to be any wrongdoing there.\n\nSo, yes, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
