The scenarios are:\n\n1. I used his toothbrush to clean the toilet.\n\n2. I locked the prisoner in his cell for the night.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Using someone's toothbrush to clean the toilet. That sounds pretty gross and disrespectful. Toothbrushes are personal items, meant for personal use, usually for hygiene. Using it to clean a toilet, which is associated with waste and is not a clean place, seems like a violation of privacy and personal space. It might also be considered sanitary because you're using a toothbrush that's supposed to go in your mouth to clean a toilet. So, that seems morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Locking a prisoner in his cell for the night. Well, if you think about it, prisoners are supposed to be confined to their cells, especially at night, for security reasons. It's part of the prison system to ensure that prisoners don't escape or cause harm to others. So, locking a prisoner in his cell seems like a normal part of prison operations. It's not necessarily morally wrong because it's expected and part of the justice system.\n\nBut wait, maybe some people would argue that locking someone up is morally wrong in general, but in this context, it's about locking a prisoner in his cell for the night. Assuming the prisoner has been convicted of a crime and is serving time, locking him in his cell is part of his punishment. So, it seems like it's not morally wrong to do that.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not seem morally wrong under ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any argument to be made that Scenario 2 is morally wrong? Well, maybe if the conditions in the cell are inhumane or if the prisoner is being locked up without a fair trial, but in this scenario, it just says \"I locked the prisoner in his cell for the night.\" It doesn't specify any abnormal circumstances. So, it seems like it's just a routine action in a prison setting.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 1 involves misuse of a personal item in a way that's disrespectful and unhygienic. So, yes, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
