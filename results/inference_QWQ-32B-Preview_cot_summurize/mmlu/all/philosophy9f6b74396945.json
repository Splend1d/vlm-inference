                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Feinberg's view on pleasure and psychological egoism. So, the statement is: \"We always feel pleasure when we get what we want.\" And we have to see what Feinberg thinks about this and how it relates to psychological egoism.\n\nFirst off, what's psychological egoism? It's the idea that humans are inherently self-interested and that all our actions are motivated by our own desires and needs. So, if someone does something nice for another person, psychological egoism would say that deep down, they're doing it because it makes them feel good or satisfies their own needs in some way.\n\nNow, the claim is that we always feel pleasure when we get what we want. If this were true, would it support psychological egoism? Well, if every time we get what we want, we feel pleasure, maybe that suggests that our actions are driven by the desire for that pleasure, which aligns with egoism.\n\nBut Feinberg seems to disagree with this claim. So, let's see what he says about it.\n\nOption A says the claim is true and supports psychological egoism. But if Feinberg thinks it's false, then this can't be right.\n\nOption B says the claim is true but doesn't support psychological egoism. But again, if Feinberg thinks it's false, this doesn't fit.\n\nOption C says the claim is false, and even if it were true, it wouldn't support psychological egoism.\n\nOption D says the claim is false, but if it were true, it would support psychological egoism.\n\nSo, we need to figure out two things: Is the claim true according to Feinberg, and does it support psychological egoism if it were true?\n\nFrom the options, it seems that Feinberg thinks the claim is false. So, options A and B are out.\n\nNow, between C and D, the difference is whether the claim, if true, would support psychological egoism.\n\nOption C says that even if the claim were true, it wouldn't support psychological egoism.\n\nOption D says that if the claim were true, it would support psychological egoism.\n\nI need to think about which one makes more sense.\n\nIf we always feel pleasure when we get what we want, does that necessarily mean that our actions are motivated by self-interest, as psychological egoism suggests?\n\nWell, maybe not. Maybe there are cases where we want something not because it gives us pleasure, but for other reasons. For example, maybe we want to help others out of altruism, not because it gives us pleasure. So, even if getting what we want always causes pleasure, it doesn't necessarily mean that the desire is rooted in self-interest.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps feeling pleasure when we get what we want is evidence that, deep down, we're motivated by our own feelings, which aligns with egoism.\n\nThis is a bit tricky.\n\nBut according to the options, Feinberg thinks the claim is false. So, regardless of whether it supports egoism or not, the first part is that it's false.\n\nNow, if it were true, would it support egoism?\n\nIf it did, then option D would be correct.\n\nIf it wouldn't, then option C is correct.\n\nI think Feinberg would argue that even if we always feel pleasure when we get what we want, it doesn't necessarily support psychological egoism because our desires can be altruistic or driven by other factors besides self-interest.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more plausible: the claim is false, and even if it were true, it wouldn't support psychological egoism.\n\nBut to be sure, I should consider whether Feinberg actually says something about this.\n\nFeinberg, in his critique of psychological egoism, likely points out that people can have desires that aren't self-interested, and that getting what they want in those cases doesn't necessarily involve personal pleasure.\n\nFor example, someone might desire that their enemy suffers, not because it gives them pleasure, but out of malice. Or, conversely, someone might desire that their friend is happy, not just because it makes them feel good, but out of genuine concern for the friend's well-being.\n\nSo, in these cases, getting what they want doesn't necessarily involve personal pleasure, which contradicts the claim.\n\nTherefore, Feinberg probably thinks the claim is false.\n\nMoreover, even if the claim were true, it wouldn't necessarily support psychological egoism because the pleasure could be a byproduct of fulfilling any desire, whether self-interested or not.\n\nSo, I think option C is the correct answer: the claim is false, and even if it were true, it wouldn't support psychological egoism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
