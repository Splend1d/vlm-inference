The ring of complex numbers\n\nB. The ring of integers modulo 11\n\nC. The ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0, 1]\n\nD. The ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}\n\nI need to figure out in which of these rings zero divisors can exist. Zero divisors are nonzero elements whose product is zero.\n\nLet's start with option A, the ring of complex numbers. I know that the complex numbers form a field, which means every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. So, if you have two nonzero complex numbers, their product can't be zero because you can always find an inverse for each, and the product would be nonzero. Therefore, there are no zero divisors in the complex numbers.\n\nOption B is the ring of integers modulo 11. Since 11 is a prime number, the integers modulo 11 also form a field. Similar to the complex numbers, in a field, there are no zero divisors. So, in this ring, the product of two nonzero elements can't be zero.\n\nOption C is the ring of continuous real-valued functions on the interval [0,1]. This is interesting. In this ring, the product of two functions is another function, and the product is zero if and only if the product function is the zero function, meaning it's zero for all x in [0,1]. Now, it's possible to have two nonzero functions whose product is zero. For example, consider:\n\nf(x) = x - 0.5, and g(x) = 0.5 - x.\n\nBoth f and g are nonzero functions because neither is zero everywhere on [0,1]. However, their product is f(x) * g(x) = (x - 0.5)(0.5 - x) = -(x - 0.5)^2, which is zero only at x = 0.5 and negative elsewhere. Wait, that's not zero everywhere. So maybe that's not the best example.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I have a function f that is zero on [0, 0.5] and nonzero on (0.5, 1], and another function g that is zero on (0.5, 1] and nonzero on [0, 0.5]. Then, the product f * g would be zero everywhere on [0,1], even though both f and g are nonzero functions. That seems like a proper example of zero divisors in this ring.\n\nSo, in the ring of continuous real-valued functions on [0,1], it is possible to have two nonzero functions whose product is the zero function.\n\nOption D is the ring {a + b * sqrt(2) : a and b are rational numbers}. This ring is actually an integral domain because it's a subring of the real numbers, which is a field. In an integral domain, there are no zero divisors. So, the product of two nonzero elements can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, among the options, only option C allows for the product of two nonzero elements to be zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
