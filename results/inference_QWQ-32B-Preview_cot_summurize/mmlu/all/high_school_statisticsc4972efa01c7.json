                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a bakery and their bread demand. Let me see if I can figure this out. The mean daily demand is 2,500 loaves, and the standard deviation is 225 loaves. The bakery bakes 3,000 loaves every morning, and I need to find the probability that they'll run out of bread today, assuming the demand is normally distributed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a normal distribution is. It's a probability distribution that's symmetric around the mean, and it's often called a bell curve because of its shape. In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same, and about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n\nOkay, so here, the mean demand is 2,500 loaves, and the standard deviation is 225 loaves. The bakery bakes 3,000 loaves daily. I need to find the probability that the demand exceeds the supply, meaning the demand is greater than 3,000 loaves.\n\nTo find this probability, I can use the z-score formula, which tells me how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula for z-score is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the value I'm interested in (in this case, 3,000 loaves)\n\n- \u03bc is the mean (2,500 loaves)\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation (225 loaves)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nz = (3,000 - 2,500) / 225 = 500 / 225 \u2248 2.22\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that the z-score is greater than 2.22, because that corresponds to the demand being greater than 3,000 loaves.\n\nI can look up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table, which will give me the area to the left of the z-score. Since I want the area to the right (the probability of exceeding 3,000 loaves), I'll subtract the table value from 1.\n\nLooking up z = 2.22 in the z-table, I find a value of approximately 0.9868. That means that 98.68% of the time, the demand is less than or equal to 3,000 loaves. Therefore, the probability of running out of bread is:\n\nP(X > 3,000) = 1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132\n\nSo, the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today is approximately 0.0132, or 1.32%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.8333\n\nB. 0.1667\n\nC. 0.9869\n\nD. 0.0132\n\nIt looks like option D is the closest to my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the z-score calculation:\n\nz = (3,000 - 2,500) / 225 = 500 / 225 \u2248 2.222\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNext, looking up z = 2.22 in the z-table, which should give me the cumulative probability up to that z-score. From my reference, z = 2.22 corresponds to a cumulative probability of approximately 0.9868.\n\nThen, to find the probability of exceeding 3,000 loaves, I subtract that value from 1:\n\n1 - 0.9868 = 0.0132\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the standard normal distribution. The mean is 2,500, and they bake 3,000, which is about 2.22 standard deviations above the mean. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, and most of the data is within three standard deviations, being 2.22 standard deviations above the mean should indeed have a relatively low probability of occurrence.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if the mean demand is 2,500 and they bake 3,000, they have a buffer of 500 loaves. Given that the standard deviation is 225, that buffer is a bit more than two standard deviations, which should cover a large portion of the demand distribution, leaving only a small tail probability where demand exceeds supply.\n\nTherefore, the probability of running out of bread should be small, which aligns with my calculation of approximately 1.32%.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 0.0132.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. For example, maybe they bake 3,000 loaves every day, and I need to consider the daily demand variability around the mean.\n\nBut no, the problem is straightforward: find the probability that today's demand exceeds today's supply of 3,000 loaves, given that demand is normally distributed with \u03bc = 2,500 and \u03c3 = 225.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
