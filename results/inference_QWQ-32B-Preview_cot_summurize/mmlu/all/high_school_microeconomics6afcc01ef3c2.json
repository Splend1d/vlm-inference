This indicates that demand is elastic. In other words, consumers are sensitive to price changes, and a small change in price leads to a proportionally larger change in the quantity demanded.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (A):** The price elasticity of demand is 0. Quantity demanded does not change regardless of price changes.\n\n- **Inelastic Demand (C):** The price elasticity of demand is between 0 and 1. The percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price.\n\n- **Unit Elastic Demand (D):** The price elasticity of demand is exactly 1. The percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price.\n\nSo, in this case, the correct answer is B. elastic."
