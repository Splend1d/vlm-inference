                    "text": "Let's see. So, in this scenario, Justin's estate is suing Polly for wrongful death. The estate wants to call Officer Friendly as a witness who interviewed Polly right after the event. Officer Friendly is supposed to testify that Polly said, \"Oops, I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!\" The question is whether this testimony is admissible, and we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what kind of statement this is and whether it falls under any exceptions to the hearsay rule. Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it fits into an exception. Hearsay is defined as an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\n\nSo, Polly's statement to Officer Friendly is an out-of-court statement, and the estate is trying to use it to prove that Polly was negligent and caused Justin's death. That sounds like hearsay to me.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is a statement against interest. That's option A. A statement against interest is an exception where a person makes a statement that is so against their own interest that they wouldn't make it unless they believed it to be true.\n\nIn this case, Polly is saying, \"I was cleaning my pistol and it went off and shot Justin. I sure was negligent!\" That seems pretty against her interest because she's admitting to being negligent and causing Justin's death. So, that might qualify as a statement against interest, making it admissible.\n\nOption B says no, hearsay without an exception. But since it might be a statement against interest, which is an exception, this might not be the correct answer.\n\nOption C is yes, admission by party. I think this might also apply here. An admission by a party opponent is an exception to the hearsay rule. Since Polly is a party to the lawsuit, her out-of-court statements can be admitted against her.\n\nSo, both A and C seem plausible. Maybe the answer is both A and C, but since it's a multiple-choice question with only one correct answer, I need to decide which one is more appropriate.\n\nOption D says no, opinion on an ultimate issue that must be left for the jury. Well, Polly is saying she was negligent, which is an opinion, but in this context, it's more of an admission of fault rather than just an opinion. The jury will have to decide whether her statement is true and whether she was indeed negligent, but her statement can still be admitted as evidence.\n\nGiven that, I think option C, yes, admission by party, is the most accurate. Polly's statement is an admission by a party opponent, and therefore it's admissible.\n\nOption A, statement against interest, could also apply, but since Polly is a party to the lawsuit, the admission by party exception might be more straightforward.\n\nI should also consider whether Polly's statement is considered a present sense impression or an excited utterance, but those don't seem to fit here. She's not describing an event as it's happening or immediately thereafter in a way that suggests spontaneity.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe the correct answer is C: yes, admission by party.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
