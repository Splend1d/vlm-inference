Hmm, I think I've heard of chili con carne before, but I'm not entirely sure what it means.\n\nFirst off, I know that chili is a dish that often includes meat and peppers, especially chili peppers, hence the name. So, maybe it's referring to chili with meat? But isn't chili usually made with meat? Wait, maybe it's something else.\n\nLet me think about the term itself. 'Chili con carne'\u2014I think 'con' is a Spanish word meaning 'with,' and 'carne' means 'meat.' So, chili with meat. That makes sense. But then why is it specified if chili typically has meat in it?\n\nMaybe in some versions, chili doesn't have meat, like vegetarian chili, which might have beans and vegetables instead. So, maybe 'chili con carne' is specifying that it has meat in it, to differentiate it from vegetarian versions.\n\nBut let's consider the other options. Beans are commonly found in chili, but I don't think 'con carne' refers to beans. Cheese is something added to some chili recipes, especially in places like Texas, but I don't think that's what 'con carne' means. And chili peppers are obviously a key ingredient in chili, but again, I don't think that's what's being referred to here.\n\nLooking back, the translation of 'chili con carne' seems pretty straightforward: chili with meat. So, I think the answer is B. meat.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check if 'chili con carne' could refer to something else. Maybe in some regions, it has a different meaning. But based on what I know, it should be chili with meat.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is B. meat.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
