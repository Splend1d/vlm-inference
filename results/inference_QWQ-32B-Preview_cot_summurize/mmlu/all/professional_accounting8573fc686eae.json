                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer. So, we have four options here, and we need to pick the correct one. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"Nonsampling risk arises from the possibility that, when a substantive test is restricted to a sample, conclusions might be different than if the auditor had tested each item in the population.\"\n\nHmm, this sounds a bit confusing. Nonsampling risk is actually related to errors that aren't due to sampling. It's more about the auditor making mistakes in understanding or applying audit procedures, or even not recognizing misstatements. So, this option seems to be mixing up nonsampling risk with sampling risk. Sampling risk is the risk that the auditor's conclusion might be different if the entire population was tested instead of a sample. So, this doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B says: \"Nonsampling risk can arise because an auditor failed to recognize misstatements.\"\n\nOkay, this sounds more accurate. Nonsampling risk includes the risk that the auditor makes an error in evaluating the audit evidence or fails to detect misstatements due to human error or inadequate audit procedures. So, if an auditor fails to recognize misstatements, that's indeed a nonsampling risk. This seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption C states: \"Sampling risk is derived from the uncertainty in applying audit procedures to specific risks.\"\n\nThis one is a bit vague. Sampling risk is related to the variability in the results due to the fact that we're testing a sample instead of the entire population. It's about the possibility that the sample isn't representative of the population. So, saying it's derived from uncertainty in applying procedures to specific risks doesn't quite capture the essence of sampling risk. This doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption D says: \"Sampling risk includes the possibility of selecting audit procedures that are not appropriate to achieve the specific objective.\"\n\nWait a minute, selecting inappropriate audit procedures sounds more like nonsampling risk. Sampling risk is about the sample not being representative, not about the appropriateness of the procedures themselves. So, this seems to be another case of confusing sampling risk with nonsampling risk.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct statement about audit sampling risks for a nonissuer. It correctly identifies that nonsampling risk can arise from the auditor failing to recognize misstatements, which is a human error not related to the sampling process itself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
