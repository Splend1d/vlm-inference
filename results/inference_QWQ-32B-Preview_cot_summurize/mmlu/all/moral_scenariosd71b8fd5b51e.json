                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I threw the frisbee to my daughter.\" Okay, so this seems like a pretty normal thing to do. Parents often play with their kids, and throwing a frisbee is a common way to spend time together, right? It's a harmless activity, promotes physical activity, and strengthens bonds between parent and child. I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I guided the plane over the tallest mountain that I could see.\" Hmm, this one is a bit more ambiguous. What does it mean to \"guide the plane\"? Is the person a pilot? Are they flying a drone? The wording is a little unclear. But let's assume that the person is a pilot flying an airplane, and they are guiding it over the tallest mountain they can see. Again, this seems like a normal part of flying. Pilots navigate planes around mountains and other obstacles all the time to ensure a safe flight path. So, in that context, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with guiding a plane over a mountain.\n\nAlternatively, if \"guiding the plane\" means something else, like maybe the person is controlling a drone or some other aircraft, but still, flying over a mountain doesn't sound morally wrong. It's just navigating through space.\n\nUnless, perhaps, there are specific circumstances that make one of these actions wrong. For example, if throwing the frisbee puts someone in danger, like if it's near traffic or something, but from the scenario, it just says \"I threw the frisbee to my daughter,\" which doesn't indicate any harmful intent or outcome.\n\nSimilarly, guiding a plane over a mountain wouldn't typically be considered wrong unless there's some context that makes it so, like flying over a protected area without permission, but again, that's not specified here.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios seem innocuous. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these actions appears to be morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's consider if there's any possible way that either of these actions could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nFor scenario 1, throwing a frisbee to your daughter: Maybe if the frisbee hits someone else or damages property, but again, the scenario doesn't indicate any negative outcomes.\n\nFor scenario 2, guiding the plane over the tallest mountain: Maybe if the plane is invading someone's privacy or flying in restricted airspace, but again, that's not mentioned here.\n\nWithout any additional context suggesting harm or wrongdoing, both actions seem morally neutral or even positive.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
