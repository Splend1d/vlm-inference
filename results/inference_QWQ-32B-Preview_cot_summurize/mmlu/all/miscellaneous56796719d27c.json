I need to recall my periodic table knowledge here.\n\nFirst, option A is S, which is sulfur. I remember that sulfur is a nonmetal; it's in the same group as oxygen and selenium. Nonmetals are usually on the right side of the periodic table.\n\nOption B is Se, which is selenium. Selenium is also a nonmetal; it's in the same group as sulfur and oxygen. So, that's not a metal either.\n\nOption C is I, which stands for iodine. Iodine is a halogen, and halogens are nonmetals. So, that's not a metal.\n\nOption D is Ga, which is gallium. Gallium is in group 13, also known as the boron group. I think group 13 elements are metals, or at least gallium is a metal. I recall that gallium is a post-transition metal.\n\nLet me double-check the properties of these elements to be sure.\n\nSulfur (S) is a nonmetal; it's a pale yellow solid at room temperature and is essential in biological systems.\n\nSelenium (Se) is also a nonmetal; it's in the same group as sulfur and has some similar properties, including being a semiconductor.\n\nIodine (I) is a halogen and a nonmetal; it's a purple solid at room temperature and is essential for thyroid function.\n\nGallium (Ga) is a metal; it's a post-transition metal in group 13. It's known for its low melting point and is used in semiconductors and other applications.\n\nSo, based on this, the correct answer should be D. Ga, gallium, as it is the only metal among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
