So, they're taking initiative to recycle something that's good for the environment. Recycling is generally encouraged because it helps conserve resources and reduce waste. Plus, they're not doing anything that harms anyone; in fact, they're doing something positive. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this seems like a responsible and considerate action. It doesn't appear to be morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's husband is excited to watch a mystery movie with a twist ending tonight, and she decides to tell him the twist beforehand. Now, this is a different situation. Spoiling a surprise, especially something like a twist in a mystery movie, can ruin the experience for the person who's looking forward to it. It's generally considered impolite or thoughtless to spoil someone's enjoyment without a good reason. In this case, there doesn't seem to be any justification for spoiling the twist; it's just something the main character decides to do. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like a morally wrong action because it disrespects her husband's anticipation and enjoyment of the movie.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
