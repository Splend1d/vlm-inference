Here's why:\n\n1. **Understanding S-P Intervals**: The time difference between the arrival of S-waves and P-waves at a seismic station is called the S-P interval. This interval helps determine the distance from the station to the earthquake's epicenter because S-waves travel slower than P-waves.\n\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Each station can calculate the distance to the epicenter based on its S-P interval. However, this only gives a distance, not a direction.\n\n3. **Locating the Epicenter**: With the distance from one station, the possible location of the epicenter lies on a circle around that station with a radius equal to the calculated distance. With a second station, the epicenter must lie on the intersection of two circles. Typically, two circles intersect at two points.\n\n4. **Resolving Ambiguity**: A third station provides a third circle, which should intersect at one of the two possible points from the first two stations, thus uniquely identifying the epicenter.\n\n5. **Practical Considerations**: In practice, more stations are often used to improve the accuracy and account for measurement errors.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of seismic stations required is three.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
