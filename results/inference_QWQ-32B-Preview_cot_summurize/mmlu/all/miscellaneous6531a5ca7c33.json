During DNA replication, the double helix structure of DNA unwinds, and each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. This process ensures that each new cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Molting: This is a process in which an animal periodically sheds its outer covering, such as skin or exoskeleton, to grow or renew it. It has nothing to do with DNA replication.\n\nC. Diffusion: This is a passive transport mechanism where molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until equilibrium is reached. While diffusion is important for the movement of molecules in cells, it is not directly involved in DNA replication.\n\nD. Peristalsis: This is a series of wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. It is a process specific to the muscular walls of the digestive system and is not related to DNA replication.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. mitosis, as it is the process that involves the replication of DNA to ensure genetic continuity during cell division.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
