The options are A. -19, B. -10, C. 19, and D. 10.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what this function T is. It's a function from Z x Z to Z, where Z represents the set of integers. So, it takes a pair of integers and returns an integer. The values T(1, 0) and T(0, 1) are given, which makes me think that T might be a linear transformation or something similar, where these are the basis vectors.\n\nIn linear algebra, if T is a linear transformation, then T(a, b) can be expressed as a linear combination of T(1, 0) and T(0, 1). That is, T(a, b) = a * T(1, 0) + b * T(0, 1).\n\nLet me check if that makes sense here. If T is linear, then it should satisfy the properties of linearity: T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) and T(cu) = c * T(u), for any integers u, v, and scalar c.\n\nAssuming T is linear, I can use the given values to find T(-3, 2).\n\nSo, T(-3, 2) = -3 * T(1, 0) + 2 * T(0, 1)\n\nGiven that T(1, 0) = 3 and T(0, 1) = -5, plugging these in:\n\nT(-3, 2) = -3 * 3 + 2 * (-5) = -9 + (-10) = -19\n\nSo, the answer should be -19, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if T is indeed a linear transformation. The problem doesn't explicitly state that T is linear, but given that it provides T(1, 0) and T(0, 1), it's likely assuming linearity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe T is defined in a different way, but based on the information given, assuming linearity seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that T maps the standard basis vectors to the given values, and any other vector can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.\n\nSo, in general, for any integers a and b:\n\nT(a, b) = a * T(1, 0) + b * T(0, 1)\n\nUsing this, T(-3, 2) = -3 * 3 + 2 * (-5) = -9 - 10 = -19\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if T is not linear, there might be other possibilities, but with the information given, it's hardest to determine T for other vectors without assuming linearity.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. -19.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-19} \\]"
