                    "text": "So here's this scenario about Breezytown and their local ordinance regarding permits for speaking in the city park. The ordinance gives the mayor a lot of discretion in deciding who gets a permit. It's pretty broad, just saying the mayor can use his discretion. Now, if someone gives a political speech in the park without a permit and gets arrested and convicted, the question is whether this is constitutional.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the ordinance controls.\n\nB. Yes, because he didn't have a permit.\n\nC. No, the ordinance is void on its face.\n\nD. No, because it is a public park.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand what's at stake here. It seems like this is about free speech and the government's ability to regulate it, especially in a public space.\n\nI remember that public parks are often considered traditional public forums where free speech is highly protected. The government can't just restrict speech there without a really good reason. So, option D says \"No, because it is a public park.\" That might be pointing towards the idea that in a public park, free speech rights are strong, and therefore the ordinance might be unconstitutional.\n\nBut then there's the ordinance that allows the mayor to decide who gets a permit. The ordinance is broad and gives a lot of discretion to the mayor. I think there's a legal principle about laws being too vague or giving too much discretion to officials, which can make them unconstitutional.\n\nOption C says \"No, the ordinance is void on its face.\" This might be related to the idea that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it doesn't provide clear standards for the mayor's decision-making. If the ordinance is too vague, it could violate due process rights because people don't know what is expected of them.\n\nOption A says \"Yes, because the ordinance controls.\" But if the ordinance is unconstitutional, then it doesn't control. So, perhaps this is incorrect.\n\nOption B says \"Yes, because he didn't have a permit.\" Well, normally, if there's a permit requirement, you need a permit. But in this case, if the ordinance is unconstitutional, then the permit requirement might not be valid.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the park is a traditional public forum, like a public square or a park, the government can't impose permit requirements that are based on the content of the speech unless they serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly tailored.\n\nBut in this case, the ordinance doesn't seem to have any standards related to the content of the speech; it's just about the mayor's discretion. So, it might be an impermissible prior restraint on speech because it allows the mayor to decide who can speak based on undefined criteria.\n\nAlso, there's a risk that the mayor could abuse this discretion to silence dissenting voices or favor certain groups, which would be a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nSo, perhaps the ordinance is unconstitutional because it gives too much unchecked discretion to the mayor in deciding who can speak in a public park.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem more plausible. C says the ordinance is void on its face, which could be because it's unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. D says it's unconstitutional because it's a public park, implying that the free speech rights outweigh the government's ability to restrict speech there.\n\nI think the best answer is C: No, the ordinance is void on its face, because it's too vague and gives too much discretion to the mayor, which can lead to arbitrary and potentially discriminatory application.\n\nOption D is also tempting, but it's more about the nature of the park being a public forum, which is true, but the core issue here is the ordinance's lack of standards and the excessive discretion it grants to the mayor.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
