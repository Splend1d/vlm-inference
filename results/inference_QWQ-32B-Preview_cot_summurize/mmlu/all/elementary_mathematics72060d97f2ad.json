                    "text": "So Ms. Ling has been living in her home for 4 years, and she knows there are 12 months in each year. She wants to find out the total number of months she's been living there, and she uses the equation 4 \u00d7 12 = m to calculate it. Now, we need to find another equation that also correctly calculates the total number of months, m.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what m represents. Since m is the total number of months Ms. Ling has been living in her home, and she's been there for 4 years, with each year having 12 months, m should be 4 times 12, which is 48 months.\n\nSo, m = 4 \u00d7 12 = 48 months.\n\nNow, we need to look at the options and see which one also gives us m = 48.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nOption A: 12 \u00f7 m = 4\n\nIf we plug in m = 48, we get:\n\n12 \u00f7 48 = 0.25, which is not equal to 4. So, this doesn't work.\n\nOption B: m \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nAgain, plugging in m = 48:\n\n48 \u00d7 4 = 192, which is not equal to 12. So, this isn't correct either.\n\nOption C: 12 \u2013 m = 4\n\nPlugging in m = 48:\n\n12 \u2013 48 = -36, which is not equal to 4. Incorrect.\n\nOption D: m \u00f7 4 = 12\n\nPlugging in m = 48:\n\n48 \u00f7 4 = 12, which matches the right side of the equation. So, this seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about it another way to make sure. If m is the total number of months, and there are 4 years, then dividing the total months by the number of years should give us the number of months per year, which is 12. So, m \u00f7 4 = 12 makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, we can rearrange the original equation to see if we can get to option D.\n\nStarting with 4 \u00d7 12 = m, we can rearrange this equation to solve for m in terms of the other variables.\n\nIf we have m = 4 \u00d7 12, we can express this as m = 4 \u00d7 12.\n\nNow, if we want to solve for 12, we can divide both sides by 4:\n\nm \u00f7 4 = 12.\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nSo, option D is another way to find the total number of months, m, Ms. Ling has been living in her home.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what each option is saying:\n\nOption A: 12 \u00f7 m = 4\n\nThis would mean that 12 divided by the total months equals 4, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B: m \u00d7 4 = 12\n\nThis would suggest that the total months times 4 equals 12, which again doesn't make sense because m should be greater than 12.\n\nOption C: 12 \u2013 m = 4\n\nThis would mean that 12 minus the total months equals 4, which also doesn't make sense because m is 48, and 12 - 48 is -36, not 4.\n\nOption D: m \u00f7 4 = 12\n\nThis makes sense because the total months divided by the number of years equals the number of months per year.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
