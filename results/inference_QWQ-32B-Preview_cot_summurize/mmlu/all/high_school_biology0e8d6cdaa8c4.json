                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the example that best represents a cline. First, I should remember what a cline is. A cline, in biology, refers to a gradient or a gradual change in a particular characteristic across a geographical area. It's like seeing how a trait changes as you move from one place to another.\n\nOption A talks about a hybrid tomato plant being stronger and producing better fruit compared to pure genotypes. This sounds more like hybrid vigor or heterosis, which isn't directly related to a geographical gradient of traits. So, probably not a cline.\n\nOption B mentions two distinct varieties in one population of snails on an island. This sounds like genetic variation within a population, but it doesn't specify a gradient across a geographical area. Maybe not a cline.\n\nOption C is about males in some species having long antlers to fight for females. This seems related to sexual selection and morphology, but again, no mention of a geographical gradient. Probably not a cline.\n\nOption D describes a species of rabbit where those in the cold, snowy north are white, while those in the south are brown. This sounds like a geographical variation in coloration, which could be an adaptation to different environments. White rabbits in the north might blend in with the snow, providing camouflage, while brown rabbits in the south blend in with the soil or vegetation.\n\nThis seems like a classic example of a cline, where a characteristic (in this case, color) changes gradually across a geographical area in response to environmental conditions.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
