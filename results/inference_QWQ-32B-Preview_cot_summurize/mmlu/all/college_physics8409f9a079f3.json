                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a spring and a mass. Let me see if I can figure this out. There's a massless spring attached to a wall, and a mass of 0.30 kg is attached to the other end of the spring. This mass rests on a table, and it's displaced 0.030 meters from its equilibrium position and then released. As it passes through the equilibrium position, it has a speed of 0.040 meters per second. The question is asking for the total mechanical energy of the system in the absence of friction.\n\nOkay, first things first, in the absence of friction, the mechanical energy should be conserved. That means the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant throughout the motion. So, the total mechanical energy (E) is equal to the potential energy (U) plus the kinetic energy (K), and since energy is conserved, E should be constant at all points in the motion.\n\nNow, I need to find the total mechanical energy of the system. I think the best place to calculate this is at the equilibrium position because that's where the potential energy due to the spring is zero. Wait, no, actually, the potential energy is zero at the equilibrium position, so all the energy should be kinetic energy at that point.\n\nLet me double-check that. The potential energy of a spring is given by U = (1/2)kx^2, where k is the spring constant and x is the displacement from the equilibrium position. At the equilibrium position, x is zero, so U is zero. Therefore, all the mechanical energy at that point is kinetic energy.\n\nThe kinetic energy is given by K = (1/2)mv^2, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. So, at the equilibrium position, E = K = (1/2)mv^2.\n\nGiven that m = 0.30 kg and v = 0.040 m/s, I can plug these values into the equation:\n\nE = (1/2)(0.30 kg)(0.040 m/s)^2\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, (0.040)^2 = 0.0016\n\nThen, (1/2)(0.30)(0.0016) = (0.15)(0.0016) = 0.00024 Joules\n\nNow, the question is giving the options in millijoules (mJ), so I need to convert Joules to millijoules. Since 1 Joule = 1000 millijoules,\n\n0.00024 Joules * 1000 = 0.24 mJ\n\nSo, the total mechanical energy is 0.24 mJ.\n\nWait a minute, but let's see if that makes sense. The mass is displaced 0.030 m and released, so initially, it has only potential energy, and no kinetic energy. As it passes through the equilibrium position, all that potential energy should have been converted to kinetic energy.\n\nSo, initially, E = U = (1/2)kx^2, where x = 0.030 m.\n\nAt equilibrium, E = K = (1/2)mv^2, where v = 0.040 m/s.\n\nSo, setting these equal, since energy is conserved:\n\n(1/2)kx^2 = (1/2)mv^2\n\nFrom this, I can solve for the spring constant k:\n\nkx^2 = mv^2\n\nk = (mv^2)/x^2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nk = (0.30 kg)*(0.040 m/s)^2 / (0.030 m)^2\n\nFirst, (0.040)^2 = 0.0016\n\nThen, (0.30)*(0.0016) = 0.00048\n\nAnd (0.030)^2 = 0.0009\n\nSo, k = 0.00048 / 0.0009 = 0.5333 N/m\n\nNow, to find the total mechanical energy, I can use either the initial potential energy or the kinetic energy at equilibrium.\n\nUsing the kinetic energy at equilibrium:\n\nE = (1/2)mv^2 = (1/2)(0.30)(0.040)^2 = (0.15)(0.0016) = 0.00024 J = 0.24 mJ\n\nAlternatively, using the initial potential energy:\n\nE = (1/2)kx^2 = (1/2)(0.5333)(0.030)^2 = (0.26665)(0.0009) = 0.00024 J = 0.24 mJ\n\nSo, both ways, I get the same answer, 0.24 mJ.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A is 0.24 mJ, which matches my calculation.\n\nHowever, I recall that in some similar problems, sometimes the total energy is the sum of potential and kinetic energy at a certain point, but in this case, at equilibrium, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there's any potential energy at the equilibrium position due to other factors, like gravity, but since it's on a horizontal table and friction is absent, gravity only affects the normal force, which doesn't play into the mechanical energy here.\n\nSo, I think 0.24 mJ is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The problem says \"in the absence of friction,\" so no energy is lost to heat, which means mechanical energy is conserved.\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy should indeed be 0.24 mJ.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the units to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. The mass is in kilograms, velocity is in meters per second, so the energy should be in Joules. Then, converting to millijoules by multiplying by 1000, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the maximum potential energy, but no, the question asks for the total mechanical energy of the system, which is constant throughout the motion.\n\nSo, again, 0.24 mJ seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the maximum potential energy when the mass is at maximum displacement, which is 0.030 m.\n\nU_max = (1/2)kx^2 = (1/2)(0.5333)(0.030)^2 = 0.26665 * 0.0009 = 0.00024 J = 0.24 mJ\n\nWhich matches the kinetic energy at equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, the total mechanical energy is indeed 0.24 mJ.\n\nI think option A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.24 \\text{ mJ}} \\]"
