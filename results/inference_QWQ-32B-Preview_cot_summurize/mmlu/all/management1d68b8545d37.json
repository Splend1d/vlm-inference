                    "text": "I think the term we're looking for is \"bounded rationality.\" Let me see why that makes sense.\n\nSo, rationality in decision-making refers to making choices logically and systematically, considering all available information. But in reality, humans have limits to how much information they can process and analyze. We can't always consider every single piece of data or every possible option because our minds just can't handle that much.\n\nThat's where \"bounded rationality\" comes in. It was a concept introduced by Herbert A. Simon, who suggested that our rationality is bounded by the limitations of our cognitive abilities and the constraints of the environment we're in. So, instead of trying to be completely rational, which would require perfect information and infinite processing power, we use heuristics or rules of thumb to make decisions that are good enough, or satisfactory.\n\nLet's look at the other options to make sure:\n\nA. Cognitive rationality - I'm not sure what this specifically refers to. It might be related to cognitive processes in decision-making, but it doesn't capture the idea of limitations.\n\nB. Conscious rationality - This might refer to deliberate, thoughtful decisions, but again, it doesn't emphasize the limits of human capacity.\n\nD. Restricted rationality - This could be similar to bounded rationality, but \"bounded\" is the more standard term in decision theory and economics.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is C. Bounded rationality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
