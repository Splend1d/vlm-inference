Alla prima, C. Impasto, D. Frottage. I need to figure out which one is the correct term for using thick paint.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. I've heard some of these before, but I'm not entirely sure about all of them.\n\nStarting with A. Scumbling. I think scumbling is a technique where you paint a thin, translucent layer over another color to create a certain effect. Maybe to soften edges or to create a particular mood. But that doesn't sound like using thick applications of paint. So, probably not Impasto.\n\nNext, B. Alla prima. I believe Alla prima is a painting method where the artist paints the entire work in one session, while the paint is still wet. It's also known as direct painting. Again, this doesn't specifically refer to the thickness of the paint, but rather the approach to painting quickly and in one go. So, maybe not the answer I'm looking for.\n\nC. Impasto. Now, Impasto sounds familiar. I think it has something to do with applying paint thickly, so that the brushstrokes are visible, and sometimes the paint is built up in layers or even molded with a palette knife. That sounds a lot like using thick applications of paint. This could be the correct answer.\n\nLastly, D. Frottage. I'm not sure what frottage is. I think it's a technique where you place paper over a textured surface and then rub a pencil or crayon over it to capture the texture. It's more related to drawing than painting, and it doesn't involve applying thick paint at all.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, Impasto seems to be the term that refers to using thick applications of paint. Let me just double-check to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nScumbling is about thin, translucent layers, Alla prima is about painting quickly in one session, Impasto is about thick paint application, and Frottage is a texturing technique in drawing. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Impasto.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
