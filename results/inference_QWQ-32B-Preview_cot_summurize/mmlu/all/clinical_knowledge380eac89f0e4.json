Ability to tolerate heavy training without succumbing to illness or injury.\n\nB. Tactics.\n\nC. The diet.\n\nD. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\nI need to identify which one of these does not influence success in sport. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: the ability to tolerate heavy training without getting sick or injured. This seems really important for an athlete. If someone can train hard without getting hurt or ill, they can probably improve their skills and performance more consistently. So, this seems like it would positively influence success in sports.\n\nOption B: tactics. In many sports, having good strategies and tactics can make a big difference. Whether it's game plans in team sports or strategic decisions in individual sports, tactics are often a key component of success. So, this also seems like it would influence success.\n\nOption C: the diet. Nutrition is crucial for athletes. A well-balanced diet can provide the necessary energy, support recovery, and help maintain overall health. Poor nutrition can lead to decreased performance and increased risk of injury or illness. Therefore, diet definitely influences success in sports.\n\nOption D: ingestion of carnitine during exercise. Carnitine is a substance that plays a role in energy production in cells. Some people take carnitine supplements, thinking it might improve exercise performance. However, the research on carnitine supplementation and its effects on performance is mixed. Some studies suggest it may have benefits, while others do not find significant effects. In general, for well-nourished individuals, additional carnitine may not provide a noticeable advantage.\n\nConsidering all these options, it seems like options A, B, and C are all important factors that influence success in sports. Option D, ingestion of carnitine during exercise, might have some impact, but it's not as universally recognized as the others, and its effects are more questionable.\n\nTherefore, the factor that does not influence success in sport, or at least influences it the least, would be option D: ingestion of carnitine during exercise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
