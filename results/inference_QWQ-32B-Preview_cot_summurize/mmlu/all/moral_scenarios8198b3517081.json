This seems like a responsible and helpful action. In US society, it's generally expected that people will assist others in emergencies, especially something as critical as a house fire. So, this action aligns with moral standards and isn't wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character has their old dog put down to end its suffering. This is a more complex situation. Euthanizing a pet is a difficult decision, but it's commonly accepted in the US as a way to prevent unnecessary pain and suffering for animals. Many people consider it to be an act of kindness and compassion. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this isn't wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are not morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
