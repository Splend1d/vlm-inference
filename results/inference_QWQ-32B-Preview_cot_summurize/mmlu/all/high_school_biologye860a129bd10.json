                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"All of the following are stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system EXCEPT\"\n\nAnd then it lists options A through D:\n\nA. dilation of the pupil of the eye\n\nB. constriction of blood vessels\n\nC. increased secretion of the sweat glands\n\nD. increased peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these isn't stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Let me recall what the sympathetic nervous system does. I know it's part of the autonomic nervous system, and it's often associated with the \"fight or flight\" response. So, in stressful situations, it kicks in to help the body react quickly.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: dilation of the pupil of the eye. I think that when you're in a stressful situation, your pupils dilate to let in more light, helping you see better. So, that sounds like something the sympathetic nervous system would do.\n\nOption B: constriction of blood vessels. Hmm, constriction of blood vessels would increase blood pressure, right? That seems like it would also be part of the fight or flight response, to get more blood flowing to muscles and vital organs.\n\nOption C: increased secretion of the sweat glands. Sweating more when you're stressed or in danger makes sense, maybe to cool the body down during physical activity or to make your skin more slippery to predators, I don't know. But it probably is a sympathetic response.\n\nOption D: increased peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Peristalsis is the wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system. I'm not sure if that would be increased during a fight or flight situation. Actually, I think the sympathetic nervous system might do the opposite, maybe slow down digestion so the body can focus on more immediate needs like running away or fighting.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. When you're stressed, do you feel like you're digesting your food better? No, often stress can lead to digestive issues or make you feel like you're not digesting properly. So, maybe the sympathetic nervous system inhibits or decreases peristalsis, not increases it.\n\nLet me check that. I recall that the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for \"rest and digest\" activities, so it would promote digestion and peristalsis. Therefore, the sympathetic nervous system would likely inhibit digestion to conserve energy for more urgent functions.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then increased peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract would not be stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system; instead, it would be inhibited, and the parasympathetic nervous system would be the one promoting it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Increased peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract is not stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nJust to double-check, let's recall what the sympathetic nervous system typically does:\n\n- Dilates pupils\n\n- Increases heart rate and blood pressure (which would involve constriction of certain blood vessels)\n\n- Stimulates sweat glands\n\n- Inhibits digestion (so decreased peristalsis)\n\nSo, yes, option D is the exception.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
