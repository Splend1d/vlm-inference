The question is: \"Plato's view is that true beauty is _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. found in everyday objects\n\nB. nonexistent\n\nC. everywhere in the natural world\n\nD. not of this world\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to remember what Plato believed about beauty. Plato was a philosopher from ancient Greece, and he had some pretty specific ideas about reality and beauty.\n\nI recall that Plato proposed the Theory of Forms or Ideas. According to this theory, the world we perceive with our senses is not the real world; it's just a reflection of the real world, which consists of abstract forms or ideals. These forms are perfect, unchanging, and eternal.\n\nSo, when it comes to beauty, Plato would say that there is an ideal form of beauty, which is the perfect and ultimate concept of beauty. The beautiful things we see in the world are just imperfect copies or reflections of this ideal form.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. found in everyday objects\n\nWell, everyday objects might be beautiful, but according to Plato, their beauty is derived from the ideal form of beauty. So, while they possess beauty, it's not the true, ultimate beauty, which is the form itself.\n\nB. nonexistent\n\nThat doesn't sound right. Plato believed that the forms exist, and beauty is one of them. So, saying that true beauty is nonexistent would contradict his theory.\n\nC. everywhere in the natural world\n\nAgain, while beauty can be found in the natural world, Plato would argue that the beauty in nature is a reflection of the ideal form, not the true beauty itself.\n\nD. not of this world\n\nThis seems promising. Since Plato distinguishes between the world of forms and the physical world, and true beauty resides in the world of forms, which is beyond our physical reality, it makes sense to say that true beauty is not of this world.\n\nLet me think about it another way. In Plato's allegory of the cave, people who are chained in a cave see shadows on the wall, which are reflections of the real world outside the cave. The forms are like the real objects outside the cave, and the shadows are like the physical world we perceive.\n\nSo, applying this to beauty, the beautiful objects we see are like the shadows, while the true beauty is the real object outside the cave, which is not part of this physical world.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D. not of this world.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. found in everyday objects - While everyday objects can be beautiful, their beauty is imperfect and derivative.\n\nB. nonexistent - No, because the form of beauty exists, according to Plato.\n\nC. everywhere in the natural world - Beauty is present in nature, but it's not the true, perfect beauty.\n\nD. not of this world - Correct, because the true form of beauty exists in the world of forms, which is separate from our physical world.\n\nYeah, I think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
