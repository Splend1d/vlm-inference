                    "text": "C. place\n\nThis question is about the theory that explains how different frequencies of sound are perceived based on their impact on the basilar membrane in the inner ear. The correct answer is C. place, which refers to the place theory of hearing.\n\nLet me explain this in more detail. The place theory is a fundamental concept in auditory physiology that suggests the perception of sound pitch is determined by the location along the basilar membrane of the cochlea where the sound waves reach their maximum amplitude. The basilar membrane is a critical structure in the inner ear that vibrates in response to sound waves, and these vibrations are transduced into neural signals that the brain interprets as sound.\n\nThe basilar membrane is tonotopically organized, meaning that different frequencies are mapped to specific places along its length. Higher frequencies cause maximal vibration at the base (the thinner, stiffer part) of the membrane, while lower frequencies cause maximal vibration at the apex (the wider, more flexible part). Therefore, the position on the basilar membrane where the wave reaches its peak corresponds to the frequency of the incoming sound.\n\nNow, let's briefly discuss why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Opponent-process theory: This theory is related to color vision and olfaction, not hearing. It explains how color perception arises from the opposing actions of three types of color receptors.\n\nB. Trichromatic theory: This is another theory of color vision, proposing that three types of cone cells in the retina are responsible for color perception. It doesn't pertain to auditory processing.\n\nD. Volley theory: This is a theory in neuroscience that explains how neurons can encode high-frequency signals by having a group of neurons fire in a sequence or \"volley\" to represent the signal. It's not directly related to the place theory of hearing.\n\nSo, in summary, the place theory is the correct answer because it specifically addresses how different frequencies of sound are localized to specific places on the basilar membrane, which is crucial for our ability to perceive pitch."
