                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which moral theory Carruthers uses when thinking about whether animals have moral rights or not. The options are consequentialism, Kantianism, virtue ethics, or contractualism. I don't remember exactly what each of these theories says, but I think I can recall some basics.\n\nFirst, consequentialism is about looking at the outcomes or consequences of actions to determine their morality. So, if an action leads to good consequences, it's moral, and if it leads to bad consequences, it's immoral. I think Peter Singer is a consequentialist who argues for animal rights based on the principle of minimizing suffering.\n\nKantianism is based on Immanuel Kant's ideas. He believed that morality is about following rational principles and duties. Kant himself didn't think animals had moral standing because he thought morality only applies to rational beings. So, maybe Carruthers is a Kantian if he thinks animals don't have moral rights.\n\nVirtue ethics focuses on the character of the moral agent rather than specific actions. It's about cultivating good character traits like kindness, honesty, and compassion. Some people argue that being virtuous includes being kind to animals, so maybe Carruthers is coming from this perspective.\n\nContractualism is a theory that says morality is about the rules that people would agree to in a hypothetical social contract. So, it's about what rules we would all agree to follow for the benefit of society. I'm not sure how this applies to animals, since animals can't enter into contracts.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these theories Carruthers is using. I recall that Carruthers has written about animal cognition and consciousness, and he might not believe that animals have the same level of consciousness as humans. Maybe he's a Kantian and thinks that only rational beings have moral standing, and since animals aren't rational, they don't have moral rights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's a consequentialist and argues that the consequences of actions towards animals determine their moral standing. But if he doesn't think animals have moral standing, then perhaps he doesn't consider their interests in his moral calculations.\n\nWait, maybe he's a contractualist and thinks that only beings who can enter into moral agreements have moral rights. Since animals can't do that, they don't have moral standing. That seems plausible.\n\nOr perhaps he's a virtue ethicist and thinks that treating animals well is a matter of having virtuous character traits, but that animals themselves don't have inherent moral rights.\n\nI think I need to remember what Carruthers actually says about animals. I recall that he questions whether animals are conscious in the same way humans are. He might argue that moral standing requires certain cognitive abilities, and since animals lack those, they don't have moral standing.\n\nGiven that, I think he might be aligning with Kantianism, since Kant emphasized rationality as the basis for moral standing. If animals aren't rational, they don't have moral rights.\n\nBut maybe he's coming from a contractualist perspective, arguing that moral rights come from being part of a social contract, which animals aren't.\n\nI'm a bit unsure between Kantianism and contractualism.\n\nWait, Kantianism is more about rationality and duty, while contractualism is about agreements and social contracts. Perhaps Kantianism is a better fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's a consequentialist who thinks that the consequences of actions towards animals aren't significant enough to grant them moral standing. But that seems less likely, since consequentialism typically considers the effects on all beings who can experience pleasure and pain.\n\nVirtue ethics seems the least likely, because it's more about the character of the moral agent than about the inherent rights of animals.\n\nSo, between Kantianism and contractualism, I think Kantianism is more aligned with Carruthers' views, especially if he emphasizes rationality as a criterion for moral standing.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Kantianism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
