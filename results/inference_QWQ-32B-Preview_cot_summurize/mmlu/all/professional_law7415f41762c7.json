The contract provided that the construction company would be paid upon completion of the warehouse. The contractor finished the warehouse but it had some minor deviations from the plans due to substitution for certain building materials that were not available in the market. The construction company finished working and demanded payment. The paper company refused to pay based on deviations from the specifications. Will the construction company likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company?\n\nA. Yes, a company that performs construction work can always collect for what it has done on a job.\nB. No, the construction company cannot change the specifications and hope to get paid.\nC. No, the construction company is guilty of fraud and misrepresentation.\nD. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n"

                    "text": "I think the answer is D. Yes, the construction company has substantially performed the contract.\n\nHere's why: The construction company finished the warehouse, which means they completed the main task they were hired to do. The contract said they would be paid upon completion, and that's what happened\u2014they completed the warehouse. Now, there were some minor deviations from the plans because certain building materials weren't available, so they had to substitute others. But since these were minor deviations, it's likely that they still met the overall requirements of the contract.\n\nOption A says that any construction company can always collect for what it has done on a job. That sounds too absolute. There must be some conditions or standards that need to be met for payment.\n\nOption B says the construction company cannot change the specifications and expect to get paid. While it's true that they should follow the specifications, in this case, the deviations were minor and due to unavailability of materials. It's possible that these substitutions didn't affect the overall function or quality of the warehouse.\n\nOption C accuses the construction company of fraud and misrepresentation. That seems pretty severe. Unless there's evidence that they deliberately used inferior materials or hid the substitutions, it's unlikely that they're guilty of fraud.\n\nSo, option D seems the most reasonable. The construction company has substantially performed the contract. In contract law, substantial performance means that even if there are some minor defects or deviations, the essential obligations of the contract have been met, and the party is entitled to payment minus any damages for the defects.\n\nIn this scenario, since the deviations were minor and caused by material unavailability, it's likely that the construction company has substantially performed the contract and should be paid, possibly with a minor deduction for the deviations.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any contract clauses that specifically address substitutions or deviations from specifications. If the contract allowed for substitutions in case of material unavailability, then the construction company is even more justified.\n\nAlso, the fact that the warehouse was completed suggests that these deviations didn't prevent the warehouse from being usable for its intended purpose. So, from a practical standpoint, the paper company should accept the warehouse and pay the construction company, perhaps negotiating a small reduction in price to account for the deviations.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the construction company would likely prevail in a breach of contract action against the paper company because they have substantially performed the contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
