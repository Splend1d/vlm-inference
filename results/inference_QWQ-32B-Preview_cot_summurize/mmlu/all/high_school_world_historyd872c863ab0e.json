Isn't negotiation a better path?\" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word \"tension.\" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.\"\nMartin Luther King, Jr., Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 1966\nSource 2:\n\"We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.\nThe purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.\nWe believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.\"\nNational Organization for Women, Statement of Purpose, 1966\nSource 3:\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's referencing three different sources from the 1960s and '70s, all related to different social movements. The question is specifically asking about Source 3, which is from the Gay Liberation Front Manifesto in 1971. It wants to know what the authors see as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation, and the options are:\n\nA. Rigid societal gender roles\n\nB. Conflicts with the women's rights movement\n\nC. Societal privileging of some races over others\n\nD. Inequity in pay scales\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Source 3 is saying. Let me look back at the text.\n\nSource 3 says:\n\n\"The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.\n\nAs we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender roles is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.\"\n\nOkay, so the main point here is that the Gay Liberation Front sees the gender-role system as the root of their oppression. They want to eliminate the social pressures that force people into rigid gender roles and instead encourage individual expression and development. They also recognize the need to ally with the women's liberation movement because both movements aim to abolish gender roles.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Rigid societal gender roles\n\nThis directly matches what the text is saying. They identify the gender-role system as the root of their oppression and aim to eliminate the pressures to conform to narrowly defined gender roles.\n\nB. Conflicts with the women's rights movement\n\nActually, the text says they want to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement. They see common goals and want to work together. So, conflicts with the women's rights movement aren't presented as an obstacle; rather, forming an alliance is seen as necessary.\n\nC. Societal privileging of some races over others\n\nThere's no mention of race or racial privileges in this source. It's focused on gender roles and sexism.\n\nD. Inequity in pay scales\n\nAgain, this isn't mentioned in the source. The focus is on gender roles and oppression, not on economic issues like pay equity.\n\nSo, based on the text, the clear answer is A. Rigid societal gender roles. The authors see these roles as the root of their oppression and something that needs to be eliminated to achieve Gay Liberation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider why the other options aren't fitting.\n\nOption B mentions conflicts with the women's rights movement, but the text actually talks about forming an alliance with the women's liberation movement. So, it's about cooperation, not conflict.\n\nOption C brings up racial privileges, but race isn't discussed in this source at all. It's entirely focused on gender issues.\n\nOption D is about pay inequity, which is also not addressed in this source. The focus is on social pressures related to gender roles, not on economic disparities.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Rigid societal gender roles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
