                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about women in the labor force. I have four options here:\n\nA. Most women work in agriculture.\n\nB. The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide.\n\nC. The percentage of women in the total labor force declined.\n\nD. Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia.\n\nHmm, let's consider each one step by step.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Most women work in agriculture.\" I think agriculture is still a big sector, but I'm not sure if it's where most women work nowadays. In many developing countries, a lot of women are involved in agriculture, but in developed countries, it's probably different. Maybe overall, it's not accurate to say most women work in agriculture globally. I'll keep this in mind.\n\nOption B: \"The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide.\" Hmm, I've heard that women's participation in the labor force has been increasing over time, especially with more education and career opportunities. So, a decline doesn't sound right to me. Maybe in some regions, but worldwide, I think it's been increasing.\n\nOption C: \"The percentage of women in the total labor force declined.\" This seems similar to option B. Again, I believe that women's participation has been on the rise globally. So, a decline doesn't sound accurate.\n\nOption D: \"Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia.\" This one is interesting. I know that women often spend more time on unpaid work, like household chores and caring for family members, in addition to their paid work. So, in terms of total work hours, including both paid and unpaid work, women might indeed work more hours per day than men in many regions.\n\nBut the statement says \"all regions except Anglo America and Australia.\" I'm not sure about that. Maybe in Anglo America and Australia, there's more equality in how household chores are divided, so women don't spend significantly more hours working overall.\n\nWait, but I've also read that even in developed countries, women still tend to do more unpaid work. So, I'm not sure if even in Anglo America and Australia, women don't spend more hours working in total.\n\nLet me think again. Maybe the statement is trying to say that in Anglo America and Australia, men and women have more equal total work hours, whereas in other regions, women spend significantly more hours working overall.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. I should consider both paid and unpaid work when thinking about total work hours.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the statement is only referring to paid work hours. If that's the case, then it might be different.\n\nWait, the statement says \"working than men,\" which could include both paid and unpaid work.\n\nI think it's important to consider both aspects because women's work often includes a lot of unpaid labor.\n\nLooking back at the options, I see that options A, B, and C are about women's participation in the labor force, particularly in terms of employment sectors and percentages.\n\nOption D is about the hours spent working per day, comparing women and men across different regions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the other options are more directly about the labor force participation, while option D is about the overall work burden.\n\nConsidering that, maybe option D is the correct statement.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Most women work in agriculture. As I recall, agriculture is a significant sector for women's employment, especially in developing countries, but I'm not sure if it's the majority worldwide.\n\nOption B: The percentage of women economically active in the labor force declined worldwide. This seems contrary to trends showing increasing female participation in the labor force.\n\nOption C: The percentage of women in the total labor force declined. Similar to option B, I think this is not accurate.\n\nOption D: Women spend more hours per day working than men in all regions except Anglo America and Australia. This seems plausible, considering the dual burden of paid work and unpaid work that many women carry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in Anglo America and Australia, there is more equality in how work hours are distributed between men and women.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nPerhaps I should look for some data or statistics to confirm.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have access to specific data right now, but based on general knowledge, I would\u503e\u5411\u4e8e choose option D as the true statement.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
