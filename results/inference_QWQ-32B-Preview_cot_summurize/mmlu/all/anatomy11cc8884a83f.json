                    "text": "To determine which substance is found in greater quantity in exhaled air among the options provided, we need to understand the composition of both inhaled and exhaled air.\n\nFirst, let's recall the composition of normal atmospheric air, which is typically inhaled:\n\n- Nitrogen: about 78%\n- Oxygen: about 21%\n- Argon: about 0.93%\n- Carbon dioxide: about 0.04%\n- Trace amounts of other gases\n\nWhen we breathe in this air, our lungs exchange gases with the blood. The primary exchange is oxygen from the air entering the blood and carbon dioxide from the blood entering the air spaces in the lungs to be exhaled.\n\nSo, in exhaled air, we would expect:\n\n- A decrease in oxygen levels because some has been taken up by the blood.\n- An increase in carbon dioxide levels because some has been released from the blood into the lungs.\n- Nitrogen levels remain relatively unchanged because nitrogen is not actively exchanged in the lungs to a significant degree.\n- Other gases like argon and trace gases remain similar to inhaled air.\n\nGiven this background, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Carbon dioxide\n\nIn exhaled air, carbon dioxide levels are higher than in inhaled air. The normal level in exhaled air is around 4-5%, which is significantly higher than the 0.04% in inhaled air.\n\nB. Carbon monoxide\n\nCarbon monoxide is not a normal component of exhaled air in significant quantities. It is a pollutant and its presence indicates inhalation of contaminated air. Under normal circumstances, its level is negligible.\n\nC. Nitrogen\n\nNitrogen levels in exhaled air are similar to those in inhaled air, around 78%, as it is not significantly exchanged in the lungs.\n\nD. Oxygen\n\nOxygen levels in exhaled air are lower than in inhaled air, typically around 16-17%, compared to 21% in inhaled air.\n\nComparing the options:\n\n- Carbon dioxide increases from 0.04% to about 4-5%.\n- Carbon monoxide is negligible.\n- Nitrogen remains at about 78%.\n- Oxygen decreases from 21% to about 16-17%.\n\nTherefore, carbon dioxide is found in a greater quantity in exhaled air compared to its level in inhaled air, more so than any other option provided.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while nitrogen is present in a higher absolute amount in exhaled air (78%), the question seems to be asking for a substance that increases in exhaled air compared to inhaled air. Nitrogen levels stay relatively the same.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A. Carbon dioxide.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
