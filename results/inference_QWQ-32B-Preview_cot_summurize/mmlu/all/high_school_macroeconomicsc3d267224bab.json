                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about household behavior regarding money demand. So, the question is: \"Households demand more money as an asset when...\" and we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what determines the demand for money. Generally, people hold money for transaction purposes, as a store of value, and for precautionary reasons. The demand for money can be influenced by various factors such as the level of income, prices, interest rates, and expectations about future economic conditions.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Nominal GDP falls.\n\nNominal GDP represents the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy, unadjusted for inflation. If nominal GDP falls, it might indicate a decrease in economic activity or deflation. In such a scenario, one might think that people would hold less money because there's less economic activity. However, if prices are falling (deflation), the real value of money increases, which might encourage people to hold more money. But this seems a bit tricky, and I'm not entirely sure.\n\nB. The nominal interest rate falls.\n\nInterest rates are a key factor in money demand. When interest rates are high, holding money, which doesn't earn interest, becomes less attractive compared to investing in interest-bearing assets like bonds. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the opportunity cost of holding money decreases, making it more attractive to hold money. So, if nominal interest rates fall, households might demand more money as an asset.\n\nC. Bond prices fall.\n\nBond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. When bond prices fall, interest rates typically rise, and vice versa. So, if bond prices fall, interest rates rise, which would make holding money less attractive because the opportunity cost increases. Therefore, households might demand less money when bond prices fall.\n\nD. The supply of money falls.\n\nThe supply of money is determined by the central bank's monetary policy, not directly by households. A decrease in the supply of money could lead to higher interest rates, which, as mentioned earlier, would decrease the demand for money. However, this option seems to be about the supply side rather than factors affecting demand directly.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most logical choice. When nominal interest rates fall, the opportunity cost of holding money decreases, leading households to demand more money as an asset.\n\nBut let me double-check. If nominal GDP falls, as in option A, and assuming deflation, people might hold more money because it can buy more goods and services in the future. However, if nominal GDP falls due to a decrease in real output, people might have less income and therefore demand less money. It's a bit ambiguous.\n\nOption C suggests that bond prices falling would lead to higher interest rates, which would decrease money demand. So, if bond prices fall, money demand should decrease, not increase.\n\nOption D is about the supply of money falling, which might increase interest rates and decrease money demand.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward and correct answer seems to be B: the nominal interest rate falls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
