                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about a JK flip-flop in toggle mode. So, first things first, I need to recall what a JK flip-flop is and what toggle mode means for it.\n\nA JK flip-flop is a type of flip-flop that can be set, reset, or toggled based on the values of J and K inputs. It's a versatile flip-flop that can perform the functions of other types like D, S-R, and T flip-flops by setting J and K to appropriate values.\n\nNow, toggle mode specifically refers to the operation where the flip-flop changes its state on each clock pulse. So, if it's in state 0, it goes to 1, and if it's in state 1, it goes to 0, each time the clock triggers it.\n\nSo, the question is asking which combination of J and K inputs puts the JK flip-flop into this toggle mode.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. J = 0, K = 0.\n\nB. J = 1, K = 1.\n\nC. J = 0, K = 1.\n\nD. J = 1, K = 0.\n\nI need to recall the truth table for a JK flip-flop. The next state of the flip-flop depends on the current state and the J and K inputs.\n\nHere's a quick recap of the JK flip-flop behavior:\n\n- If J = 0 and K = 0, the flip-flop retains its current state.\n\n- If J = 0 and K = 1, the flip-flop is reset to 0.\n\n- If J = 1 and K = 0, the flip-flop is set to 1.\n\n- If J = 1 and K = 1, the flip-flop toggles its state.\n\nWait a minute, that last one matches the description of toggle mode. So, if J = 1 and K = 1, the JK flip-flop will toggle its state on each clock pulse.\n\nLet me double-check that. In toggle mode, we want the flip-flop to change its state from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 with each clock pulse. According to the truth table, when J and K are both 1, that's exactly what happens.\n\nLet's verify the other options to make sure:\n\nOption A: J = 0, K = 0. This is the hold condition, where the flip-flop retains its current state. Not toggle mode.\n\nOption C: J = 0, K = 1. This is the reset condition, where the flip-flop is set to 0. Again, not toggle mode.\n\nOption D: J = 1, K = 0. This is the set condition, where the flip-flop is set to 1. Still not toggle mode.\n\nOnly option B: J = 1, K = 1, causes the flip-flop to toggle its state, which is what we're looking for.\n\nI think that's clear, but to be thorough, maybe I should consider the characteristic equation of the JK flip-flop.\n\nThe next state Q(t+1) can be expressed as:\n\nQ(t+1) = J Q'(t) + K' Q(t)\n\nBut for toggle mode, we want Q(t+1) = Q'(t), meaning it flips to the opposite state.\n\nSo, setting Q(t+1) = Q'(t), let's see what J and K should be.\n\nJ Q'(t) + K' Q(t) = Q'(t)\n\nTo satisfy this equation for all current states Q(t), we can set up equations for Q(t) = 0 and Q(t) = 1.\n\nFirst, if Q(t) = 0, then Q'(t) = 1.\n\nSo, J * 1 + K' * 0 = 1\n\nThis simplifies to J = 1.\n\nSecond, if Q(t) = 1, then Q'(t) = 0.\n\nSo, J * 0 + K' * 1 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to K' = 0, which means K = 1.\n\nTherefore, for toggle mode, J must be 1 and K must be 1.\n\nThis confirms that option B is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of the characteristic table:\n\n| J | K | Q(t) | Q(t+1) |\n\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n\n| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |\n\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n\n| 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\nLooking at the last row, when J = 1 and K = 1, the flip-flop toggles its state: from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.\n\nThis again confirms that option B is correct.\n\nI think I've covered this sufficiently. The answer should be B. J = 1, K = 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
