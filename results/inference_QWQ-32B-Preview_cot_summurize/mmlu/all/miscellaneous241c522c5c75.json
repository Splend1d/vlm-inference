The options are Ganymede, Earth's Moon, Pluto, and Europa.\n\nFirst off, I know that Pluto is not a moon; it's a dwarf planet. So, I can eliminate option C.\n\nThat leaves me with Ganymede, Earth's Moon, and Europa.\n\nI think Ganymede is pretty big. I remember hearing that it's larger than Mercury, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should look up the sizes of these moons.\n\nLet me see, Ganymede is a moon of Jupiter, right? And Europa is also a Jupiter moon. Earth's Moon is, well, Earth's moon.\n\nI think Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. I recall that it's even larger than Titan, which is Saturn's largest moon.\n\nWait, is Titan smaller than Ganymede? I might be confusing this.\n\nLet me try to recall some facts. I know that Jupiter has four large moons called the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\n\nAmong these, Ganymede is the largest. In fact, it's larger than Mercury, but I'm not sure about its size compared to other moons in the Solar System.\n\nTitan is known for being massive, with a substantial atmosphere, but I think Ganymede is still larger.\n\nEarth's Moon is also pretty big, but I don't think it's the largest.\n\nSo, comparing Ganymede, Earth's Moon, and Europa:\n\n- Ganymede is the largest of the Galilean moons.\n\n- Earth's Moon is large, but I don't recall it being larger than Ganymede.\n\n- Europa is smaller than Ganymede but still one of the largest moons in the Solar System.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is A. Ganymede.\n\nBut to be sure, maybe I should double-check the sizes.\n\nFrom what I remember:\n\n- Ganymede: diameter around 5,268 km\n\n- Earth's Moon: diameter about 3,474 km\n\n- Europa: diameter around 3,122 km\n\nSo, clearly, Ganymede is larger than both Earth's Moon and Europa.\n\nPlus, Pluto has a diameter of about 2,377 km, which is smaller than all of these moons.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. Ganymede.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
