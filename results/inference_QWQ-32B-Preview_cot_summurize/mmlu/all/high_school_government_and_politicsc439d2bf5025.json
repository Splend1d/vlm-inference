Salaries to employees of the U.S. Post Office\n\nB. Interest payments made to U.S. bondholders\n\nC. Entitlement programs\n\nD. National defense\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"automatic spending\" means. I think it refers to spending that is mandated by existing laws and continues unless changed by new legislation. It's also often called mandatory spending.\n\nSo, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Salaries to employees of the U.S. Post Office: This seems like a regular operating expense for a government agency. I'm not sure if this is considered automatic spending.\n\nB. Interest payments made to U.S. bondholders: The government has to pay interest on the national debt, which is mandated by law. This sounds like automatic spending.\n\nC. Entitlement programs: These are programs like Social Security and Medicare, where benefits are provided to eligible recipients as specified by law. These are definitely considered automatic or mandatory spending because they continue unless the laws are changed.\n\nD. National defense: This is typically considered discretionary spending, meaning it's subject to annual appropriations by Congress. So, I don't think this is automatic spending.\n\nBetween options B and C, I need to determine which is the largest source.\n\nI know that entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare are major components of the federal budget and are automatically spent based on the number of eligible beneficiaries and the formulas set by law.\n\nInterest payments are also significant, but I believe entitlement programs are larger.\n\nLet me see if I can recall some figures. As of recent years, Social Security and Medicare together make up a large portion of the federal budget, something like 40-50% or more.\n\nInterest payments, on the other hand, depend on the level of debt and interest rates. With the national debt being high, interest payments are significant, but probably not as large as entitlement programs.\n\nAlso, the U.S. Post Office is part of the government, but I don't think its salaries are considered automatic spending. Maybe they are, but compared to entitlements and interest payments, they are probably much smaller.\n\nNational defense is a big ticket item, but as I recall, it's discretionary spending, meaning it's approved each year by Congress through the appropriations process.\n\nSo, based on this, I think entitlement programs are the largest source of automatic spending.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Entitlement programs.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check.\n\nLet me consider that automatic spending includes not just entitlements but also interest payments and certain other mandatory programs.\n\nHowever, entitlements like Social Security and Medicare are the biggest components.\n\nInterest payments are substantial but likely less than entitlements.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
