The options are A. 100 and 299, B. 300 and 499, C. 500 and 699, D. 700 and 899.\n\nFirst, I need to add 153 and 44. Let me see, 153 plus 40 is 193, and then plus 4 is 197. So, 153 + 44 equals 197.\n\nNow, I need to see where 197 falls in these ranges. Option A is between 100 and 299. Since 197 is less than 299 and greater than 100, it fits into this category.\n\nOption B is 300 to 499. 197 is less than 300, so it doesn't fit here.\n\nOption C is 500 to 699. Again, 197 is less than 500, so not this one.\n\nOption D is 700 to 899. Way higher than 197.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. 100 and 299.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I should consider if there's a different way to estimate this sum. Estimation usually involves rounding numbers to make the calculation easier.\n\nLet's try rounding 153 to the nearest ten, which is 150, and 44 to the nearest ten, which is 40. Then, 150 plus 40 is 190. That's close to 197, so my initial addition seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I round 153 to 150 and 44 to 50, that would be 200, but that's a bit higher than the actual sum.\n\nEither way, even with estimation, the sum should still fall between 100 and 299.\n\nI think I'm confident with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
