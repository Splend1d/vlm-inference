                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about who proposed the theory that cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth. The options are Rostow, Ravenstein, von Th\u00fcnen, and Harris and Ullmann. I need to remember which one of these came up in class when we were discussing urban growth models.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these people is known for. Rostow is associated with the stages of economic growth, right? He proposed that economies develop through a series of stages, from traditional societies to those with a high mass consumption. So, that seems more related to economic development rather than urban growth patterns.\n\nRavenstein is known for his laws of migration. He proposed that migration happens in stages, from short distances to longer ones, and that there's a concept of gravity in migration, where people are more likely to move to larger cities. While this is related to how people move and settle, it's not specifically about how cities grow outward from a core using nodes.\n\nVon Th\u00fcnen is famous for his von Th\u00fcnen's model, which is a theoretical model of how agriculture is arranged around a central market. He proposed that different types of agriculture would be located at different distances from the market based on transportation costs and profitability. This model is more about land use and agriculture than about urban growth patterns.\n\nHarris and Ullmann are associated with the multiple-nuclei model of urban structure. According to this model, cities don't just grow outward from a single center but develop around several nodes or nuclei, each of which can have its own functions and attractions. This seems to align closely with the description in the question: cities growing outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not confusing anything. The multiple-nuclei model suggests that as cities grow, new areas develop around different points, such as industrial areas, residential areas, or commercial areas, each acting as a focal point for growth. This contrasts with the concentric zone model, which Enrico Fermi proposed, where cities grow in concentric circles from a central business district.\n\nWait, actually, it was not Enrico Fermi who proposed the concentric zone model; it was Ernest Burgess. His model suggests that cities grow in a series of concentric rings, with the central business district in the middle and residential areas expanding outward in rings based on social status and class.\n\nAnother model is the sector model by Homer Hoyt, which proposes that cities grow in sectors or wedges rather than rings, with different functions located in different sectors radiating from the center.\n\nBut the multiple-nuclei model is distinct in that it emphasizes the development of separate nodes or nuclei within the city, each with its own functions and growth patterns.\n\nGiven that, it seems clear that Harris and Ullmann are the ones who proposed the theory that cities grow outward from a core utilizing several nodes of growth.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options could fit. Rostow's stages of growth might influence urban development, but it's not a model specifically about spatial growth patterns. Ravenstein's laws are about migration patterns, which can affect urban growth, but again, not specifically about how cities physically expand. Von Th\u00fcnen's model is about agricultural land use, which is related to urban areas but not directly about urban growth patterns.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Harris and Ullmann.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
