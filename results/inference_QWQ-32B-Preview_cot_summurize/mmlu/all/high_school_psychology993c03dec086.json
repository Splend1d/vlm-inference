                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out the correct order of how visual information is transmitted in the eye. I remember that it starts with light hitting the retina, and then signals are sent to the brain, but I need to recall the specific sequence of cells involved.\n\nFirst, there are rods and cones. Those are the photoreceptor cells in the retina that capture light and convert it into electrical signals. So, the process must start with rods and cones.\n\nNext, after the rods and cones, the signals go to bipolar cells. These cells receive information from the photoreceptors and process it before passing it on.\n\nAfter the bipolar cells, the signals go to ganglion cells. Ganglion cells receive input from multiple bipolar cells and integrate that information. Their axons form the optic nerve, which carries the visual information to the brain.\n\nSo, the order should be: rods and cones, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and then the optic nerve.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Optic nerve; ganglion cells; bipolar cells; rods and cones\n\nThis seems backwards. The optic nerve comes last, not first.\n\nB. Bipolar cells; ganglion cells; fovea; optic nerve\n\nThis doesn't make sense. The fovea is a part of the retina, not a type of cell in the pathway.\n\nC. Rods and cones; retina; optic nerve; ganglion cells\n\nThis is confusing. The retina includes rods, cones, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, so it's not accurate to list it after rods and cones and before ganglion cells.\n\nD. Rods and cones; bipolar cells; ganglion cells; optic nerve\n\nThis matches what I recall. It's the logical sequence from light reception to signal transmission to the brain.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
