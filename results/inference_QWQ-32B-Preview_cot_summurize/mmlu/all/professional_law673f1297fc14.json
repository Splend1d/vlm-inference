                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a mayoral candidate who lost an election after a newspaper article suggested he was a thief. He sued for defamation, and the newspaper says it's true. At trial, the candidate testified he's not a thief, and now the newspaper wants to call a witness to say that three years ago, he committed larceny at his old job.\n\nThe question is about whether this witness's testimony should be allowed or not, and there are four options: exclude because bad acts can't be proved with extrinsic evidence, exclude because it's improper character evidence, admit as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity, or admit as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. This is a defamation lawsuit where the newspaper is defending on the grounds of truth. So, the truth of the statement is at issue here. The candidate is saying he's not a thief, and the newspaper is trying to prove that he is.\n\nNow, let's look at the witness's testimony. The witness is going to say that the candidate committed larceny three years ago at his former job. This seems like it directly relates to whether the candidate is a thief or not.\n\nOption A says to exclude because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. I'm not entirely sure what \"extrinsic evidence\" means in this context, but generally, extrinsic evidence refers to evidence that is not part of the main issue and is used to prove something else. Maybe it's about collateral matters.\n\nOption B says to exclude because it's improper character evidence. Character evidence is tricky because it can be considered prejudicial. In many cases, character evidence is not allowed to prove that someone acted in a certain way on a specific occasion.\n\nOption C says to admit it as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity. Veracity means truthfulness. So, if the witness is testifying about the candidate's past theft, is that relevant to his character for truthfulness?\n\nOption D says to admit it as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief. This seems straightforward because the newspaper is trying to prove that the candidate is a thief, which is what the article implied.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nIn a defamation case where truth is being defended, the defendant (the newspaper) needs to prove that the statement was true. So, if they're saying the candidate is a thief, they need to prove that he is, in fact, a thief.\n\nThe candidate testified that he is not a thief. Now, the newspaper is trying to contradict that by presenting evidence of a specific act of larceny from three years ago.\n\nFirst, is this relevant? Yes, because it directly bears on whether the candidate is a thief or not.\n\nBut, is it allowed in court? That's the question.\n\nIn court, character evidence is generally not admissible to prove that someone acted in a certain way on a particular occasion. For example, you can't usually say, \"Well, he's a thief, so he must have stolen this thing.\" Because that's relying on his character to prove his actions, which can be prejudicial.\n\nHowever, in this case, it's different because the truth of the statement is at issue. The newspaper is defending on the grounds of truth, so they need to prove that the statement was true.\n\nMoreover, the candidate took the stand and denied being a thief. By doing so, he's putting his character at issue. When a party puts their character in issue, it may open the door for the opposing side to introduce evidence regarding that character.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the candidate testified about his character (by denying being a thief), the newspaper may be allowed to introduce evidence to contradict that testimony.\n\nNow, regarding the options:\n\nA. Excluded, because bad acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\n\nI'm not sure about this one. Extrinsic evidence usually refers to evidence that is beyond the scope of the main issue and is used to prove something else. But in this case, the witness's testimony is directly related to the main issue\u2014whether the candidate is a thief.\n\nB. Excluded, because it is improper character evidence.\n\nThis could be a possibility because character evidence is generally disfavored. However, given that the candidate has testified about his character, it might be allowed.\n\nC. Admitted as probative evidence of the candidate's character for veracity.\n\nVeracity refers to truthfulness. So, if the witness is testifying about a past act of larceny, is that directly related to the candidate's character for truthfulness?\n\nWell, theft and truthfulness are related in that someone who steals might be less truthful, but it's not a direct correlation. Maybe it could be considered some evidence of his character for truthfulness, but it's somewhat tenuous.\n\nD. Admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief.\n\nThis seems most straightforward because the newspaper is trying to prove that the candidate is a thief, and this witness testimony directly relates to that.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is D. The witness's testimony should be admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief, especially since the truth of the statement is at issue in the defamation case and the candidate has testified about his character.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any rules of evidence that would exclude this.\n\nFor example, Rule 404 of the Federal Rules of Evidence generally prohibits the introduction of character evidence to prove conduct on a particular occasion. However, there are exceptions, such as when character is directly at issue.\n\nIn this case, because the candidate has testified about his character (denying being a thief), the newspaper can introduce evidence to contradict that testimony.\n\nAdditionally, under Rule 608, a witness's character for truthfulness can be attacked or supported by evidence about the witness's reputation for having a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by evidence in the form of opinion about the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\n\nBut in this case, the witness is testifying about a specific act of larceny, which might be more akin to using specific instances to attack character for truthfulness.\n\nHowever, Rule 608(b) generally prohibits inquiry into specific instances of the witness's conduct except those that are probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.\n\nGiven that, it might be tricky to introduce this specific act of larceny solely to attack the candidate's character for truthfulness.\n\nBut since the newspaper is defending on the grounds of truth, and the statement in question is that the candidate is a thief, the witness's testimony is directly relevant to that issue.\n\nTherefore, it seems most appropriate to admit it as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief (option D).\n\nOption C might also have some merit, but I think D is more direct.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) admitted as relevant evidence of the candidate's character as a thief."
