                    "text": "So I've got this genetics question here. It says that, on average, 46% of the loci in a species' gene pool are heterozygous, and I need to find out what the average homozygosity of the species should be. The options are 23%, 46%, 54%, or 92%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what heterozygosity and homozygosity mean. Heterozygosity refers to a locus having two different alleles, while homozygosity means having two identical alleles. So, in a population, the sum of heterozygosity and homozygosity should add up to 100%, right? Because every locus is either heterozygous or homozygous.\n\nGiven that, if 46% of the loci are heterozygous, then the remaining percentage should be homozygous. So, 100% - 46% = 54%. That seems straightforward. So, the average homozygosity should be 54%.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Maybe I need to consider the Hardy-Weinberg principle or something like that. The Hardy-Weinberg principle relates allele frequencies to genotype frequencies in a population. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p and q are allele frequencies, and p\u00b2 and q\u00b2 are the frequencies of the homozygous genotypes, and 2pq is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype.\n\nIn this case, the heterozygous frequency is given as 46%, which is 2pq = 0.46. If I solve for pq, it would be 0.23. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here, since the question is asking for homozygosity, which is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2.\n\nWait, but p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 can also be expressed as (p + q)\u00b2 - 2pq. Since p + q = 1, then p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1 - 2pq. Given that 2pq = 0.46, then homozygosity = 1 - 0.46 = 0.54 or 54%.\n\nSo, that matches my initial thought. It seems like the answer is 54%.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any other way to interpret this? Maybe the 46% refers to the average number of heterozygous loci per individual, or something like that. But the question says \"loci in a species' gene pool are heterozygous,\" which sounds like it's referring to the frequency of heterozygous loci in the population.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 46% is the heterozygosity at each locus, and I need to consider multiple loci. But the question specifies \"average homozygosity of the species,\" which still seems like it's referring to the overall homozygosity across all loci.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. If heterozygosity is 46%, then homozygosity is 54%. That seems pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me see if there's another perspective. Maybe considering that homozygosity can be further divided into homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive, but in terms of overall homozygosity, it's just the sum of both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to average homozygosity across multiple loci, but again, that shouldn't change the basic calculation.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is 54%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
