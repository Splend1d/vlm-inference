                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement is true about rheumatoid arthritis. I know a bit about this, but I need to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, what is rheumatoid arthritis? It's an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks the joints, causing inflammation and damage. It's different from osteoarthritis, which is more about wear and tear.\n\nOption A says that rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases. Hmm, I thought rheumatoid factor is present in a higher percentage of rheumatoid arthritis patients. I think it's around 70-80% of patients who are rheumatoid factor positive. So, 25% seems too low. Maybe this is incorrect.\n\nOption B says it's an example of an oligoarthropathy. Oligoarthropathy means involving a small number of joints, usually less than five. But I think rheumatoid arthritis typically affects many joints, often in a symmetrical pattern. So, it's more of a polyarthropathy, affecting multiple joints. Therefore, this statement seems wrong.\n\nOption C says anemia is a common finding. I do recall that anemia is common in rheumatoid arthritis. The inflammation from the disease can lead to anemia of chronic disease, which is a type of anemia that occurs in response to long-term inflammation. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D mentions Heberden's nodes are a feature. Heberden's nodes are bony enlargements that occur in the distal interphalangeal joints, which are the joints closest to the fingertips. These are more characteristic of osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the proximal interphalangeal joints, the ones in the middle of the fingers.\n\nSo, based on what I'm remembering, option C seems to be the correct statement.\n\nBut let me double-check. Rheumatoid factor is present in about 70-80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, so option A is incorrect. Rheumatoid arthritis is a polyarthropathy, affecting many joints, so option B is wrong. Heberden's nodes are associated with osteoarthritis, not rheumatoid arthritis, so option D is also incorrect. That leaves option C, which seems to be the right answer.\n\nI should also consider whether anemia is indeed common in rheumatoid arthritis. Yes, inflammation can lead to anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease. So, it makes sense that anemia would be a common finding in these patients.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Anemia is a common finding.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
