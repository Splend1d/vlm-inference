Taking action and implementing ideas\n\nD. Evaluation of the program\n\nI need to figure out which stage involves deciding on the objectives.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each stage entails.\n\nA. Defining the program: This sounds like the initial stage where you figure out what the program is about, its purpose, and maybe set some goals.\n\nB. Planning the program: This seems like the stage where you outline how to achieve those goals, maybe make a schedule, assign tasks, that sort of thing.\n\nC. Taking action and implementing ideas: Here, I think the plans are put into action. People start doing the work as per the plan.\n\nD. Evaluation of the program: This is likely where you assess how well the program did, whether the objectives were met, and maybe make suggestions for improvements.\n\nNow, objectives are specific targets or outcomes that the program aims to achieve. They are kind of the why behind the program.\n\nSo, when are these objectives decided?\n\nIf I think about it, objectives should be decided early on, probably even before planning how to achieve them.\n\nSo, defining the program seems like the right place. That's where you would clarify what the program is trying to accomplish.\n\nPlanning the program would then be about how to achieve those objectives.\n\nTaking action is doing what was planned.\n\nAnd evaluation is looking back to see if the objectives were met.\n\nSo, it makes sense that objectives are decided in the defining the program stage.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other stage where objectives might be decided.\n\nMaybe during evaluation, you set new objectives for future programs, but that's not the same as deciding the objectives for the current program.\n\nIn taking action, you're executing the plan, not deciding objectives.\n\nPlanning the program is about the how, assuming the objectives are already known.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Defining the program.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's think about it another way.\n\nSuppose I'm starting a new project at work. The first thing I need to do is understand what the project is supposed to achieve. That would be setting the objectives.\n\nThen, I would plan how to achieve those objectives, set timelines, assign tasks, etc.\n\nAfter that, the team starts working on the tasks.\n\nFinally, we evaluate whether we met the objectives and perhaps learn from the process.\n\nSo, again, objectives are set in the defining stage.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
