                    "text": "Let's see which option lists the numbers from least to greatest. I have four options, each with the same numbers but in different orders: 1 over 8, 0.75, 1 over 3, and 5 over 6. I need to figure out the correct ascending order.\n\nFirst, I should probably convert all these numbers to the same form to make it easier to compare them. Decimals might be the way to go because they're straightforward to order.\n\nLet's convert each fraction to a decimal:\n\n1 over 8 is 1 \u00f7 8. Let me calculate that: 8 goes into 1 zero times, so 0., then 8 goes into 10 once, subtract 8 to get 2, bring down a zero to make it 20. 8 goes into 20 twice, 16, subtract to get 4, bring down a zero to make it 40. 8 goes into 40 five times exactly. So, 1 over 8 is 0.125.\n\nNext, 1 over 3 is 1 \u00f7 3. I know this is a repeating decimal: 0.333...\n\nThen, 5 over 6 is 5 \u00f7 6. Let's do the division: 6 goes into 5 zero times, so 0., then 6 goes into 50 eight times, 48, subtract to get 2, bring down a zero to make it 20. 6 goes into 20 three times, 18, subtract to get 2, and this pattern repeats. So, 5 over 6 is approximately 0.8333...\n\nNow, I have:\n\n- 1 over 8 = 0.125\n\n- 0.75 = 0.75\n\n- 1 over 3 \u2248 0.333\n\n- 5 over 6 \u2248 0.8333\n\nLet me list them in ascending order:\n\n0.125, 0.333, 0.75, 0.8333\n\nSo, in terms of the original numbers:\n\n1 over 8, 1 over 3, 0.75, 5 over 6\n\nLooking back at the options, this matches option C.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to be sure:\n\nOption A: 1 over 8, 0.75, 1 over 3, 5 over 6\n\nBut according to my ordering, 1 over 3 should come before 0.75.\n\nOption B: 5 over 6, 1 over 3, 0.75, 1 over 8\n\nThis is descending order, not ascending.\n\nOption D: 5 over 6, 0.75, 1 over 3, 1 over 8\n\nAgain, this is not in ascending order.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
