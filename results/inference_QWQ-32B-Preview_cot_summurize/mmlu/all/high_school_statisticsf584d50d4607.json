                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about an employment placement agency and worker retention rates. Let's see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an employer who hires 100 workers at the start of the first year through this agency. Then, at the start of the next year, they hire another 100 workers. So, in total, there are 200 workers over two years.\n\nThe agency has some statistics on worker retention:\n\n- 20% of all placed workers will no longer be in their position after one year.\n\n- Of those who stay beyond the first year, only 5% leave during the next year.\n\nI need to find out how many of these 200 workers are expected to still be on the job at the end of the second year.\n\nLet me try to break this down.\n\nFor the first group of 100 workers hired at the start of the first year:\n\n- After one year, 20% leave. So, 20% of 100 is 20 workers leave.\n\n- Therefore, 80 workers remain at the end of the first year.\n\nNow, of these 80 workers who stayed beyond the first year, 5% leave during the next year.\n\n- 5% of 80 is 4 workers.\n\n- So, 4 workers leave during the second year.\n\n- Therefore, the number of original 100 workers still on the job at the end of the second year is 80 - 4 = 76.\n\nNow, for the second group of 100 workers hired at the start of the second year:\n\n- They've only been hired at the start of the second year, so they haven't reached their first-year mark yet.\n\n- The retention rates apply to workers who have been placed for at least one year.\n\n- So, these 100 workers are still in their first year at the end of the second year.\n\n- Therefore, 20% of them are expected to leave after their first year, but since we're looking at the end of the second year, which is the end of their first year, 20% of them will leave.\n\n- So, 20% of 100 is 20 workers leave.\n\n- Therefore, 80 workers from the second group are expected to still be on the job at the end of the second year.\n\nNow, to find the total number of workers still on the job at the end of the second year, I add the remaining workers from both groups:\n\n76 (from the first group) + 80 (from the second group) = 156 workers.\n\nSo, the answer should be 156.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nFor the first group:\n\n- Start: 100 workers\n\n- After first year: 80 remain (20% leave)\n\n- After second year: 80 - 4 = 76 remain (5% of 80 is 4)\n\nFor the second group:\n\n- Start of second year: 100 workers\n\n- End of second year: 80 remain (20% leave)\n\nTotal remaining: 76 + 80 = 156\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nTotal workers hired: 200\n\nBut they're hired in two batches of 100, each at different times, so their retention periods are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of probabilities.\n\nFor the first group:\n\n- Probability of staying beyond first year: 80%\n\n- Probability of staying beyond second year, given they stayed beyond first year: 95%\n\n- So, probability of staying beyond second year: 80% * 95% = 0.8 * 0.95 = 0.76 or 76%\n\n- So, 76% of the first 100 workers are still on job at end of second year: 76 workers\n\nFor the second group:\n\n- Hired at start of second year, so only need to stay for one year.\n\n- Probability of staying beyond first year: 80%\n\n- So, 80% of the second 100 workers are still on job at end of second year: 80 workers\n\nTotal: 76 + 80 = 156\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it in terms of survival rates or something.\n\nBut I think my approach is solid.\n\nSo, the answer should be 156.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 140\n\nB. 144\n\nC. 152\n\nD. 156\n\nIndeed, D. 156 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{156} \\]"
