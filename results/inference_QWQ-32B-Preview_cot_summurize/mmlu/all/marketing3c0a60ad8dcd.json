The options are:\n\nA. Market share strategy\n\nB. Penetration pricing strategy\n\nC. Strategy that focuses on non-price benefits\n\nD. Strategy to expand the overall market\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these strategies means.\n\nA. Market share strategy: This is when a company focuses on increasing its portion of the total sales in the market. It could involve various tactics like lowering prices, improving\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d28\u91cf, or enhancing marketing efforts.\n\nB. Penetration pricing strategy: This is a pricing strategy where a company sets a low price for its product to attract customers and gain market share quickly. It's often used by new entrants to the market.\n\nC. Strategy that focuses on non-price benefits: This would involve emphasizing aspects of the product other than price, such as quality, features, brand reputation, customer service, etc.\n\nD. Strategy to expand the overall market: This involves trying to grow the total size of the market by attracting new customers or expanding into new geographic areas or customer segments.\n\nNow, the question is about firms that see themselves as leaders in product quality. So, these firms probably prioritize quality above other factors like price.\n\nOption A, market share strategy, is broad and could include focusing on quality, but it's not specifically about quality; it's about increasing share, which could be achieved through various means.\n\nOption B, penetration pricing, is about setting low prices to attract customers. This might not align with a quality leadership position, as quality leaders often charge premium prices for their higher quality products.\n\nOption C, focusing on non-price benefits, seems directly related to quality. Non-price benefits include quality, features, brand, service, etc. So, if a firm is emphasizing its product quality, this strategy makes sense.\n\nOption D, expanding the overall market, is about growing the market size, which could be done through various strategies, including improving quality to attract more customers. However, it's not as directly related to quality leadership as option C.\n\nConsidering this, I think the best answer is C, a strategy that focuses on non-price benefits. This aligns well with firms that see themselves as leaders in product quality, as they would emphasize quality and other non-price aspects to differentiate themselves in the market.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIf a firm is a quality leader, it might also aim for a higher market share (option A), but again, market share can be achieved through different means, not necessarily through quality.\n\nPenetration pricing (option B) is typically the opposite of a quality leadership strategy, as it focuses on low prices to enter the market quickly.\n\nExpanding the overall market (option D) is a good goal, but it's more about market growth than specifically about maintaining quality leadership.\n\nTherefore, focusing on non-price benefits (option C) seems to be the most appropriate strategy for firms that view themselves as market leaders in product quality.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
