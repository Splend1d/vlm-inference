                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about quantum efficiency and photon detection. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nFirst off, quantum efficiency is given as 0.1. That means the detector has a 10% chance of detecting each photon that hits it. So, if I send in 100 photons, one after the other, I'd expect that, on average, it should detect about 10 photons, right? Because 100 times 0.1 is 10.\n\nOkay, so the average number of detections should be 10. That seems straightforward. Now, the question is also asking about the rms deviation. Hmm, rms deviation. I think that has something to do with the variability or uncertainty in the number of detections.\n\nI recall that in statistics, for a binomial distribution, which I think this is, since each photon is like a trial with two outcomes: detected or not detected. For a binomial distribution, the mean is n times p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. So, mean = 100 * 0.1 = 10. That matches what I thought earlier.\n\nNow, the standard deviation for a binomial distribution is sqrt(n * p * (1 - p)). So, plugging in the numbers: sqrt(100 * 0.1 * 0.9) = sqrt(9) = 3. So, the standard deviation is 3.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the rms deviation. Is that the same as the standard deviation? I think rms stands for root mean square, and in this context, it should be the same as the standard deviation.\n\nSo, if the standard deviation is 3, then the rms deviation is also 3.\n\nTherefore, the detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. average of 10 times, rms deviation about 4\n\nB. average of 10 times, rms deviation about 3\n\nC. average of 10 times, rms deviation about 1\n\nD. average of 10 times, rms deviation about 0.1\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut just to double-check, is there any reason why it wouldn't be a binomial distribution? Is there any dependency between photon detections or something like that? The problem says the photons are sent one after the other, but it doesn't suggest any interaction between them, so each detection should be independent.\n\nAlso, quantum efficiency is the probability of detection per photon, which aligns with the probability p in the binomial distribution.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
