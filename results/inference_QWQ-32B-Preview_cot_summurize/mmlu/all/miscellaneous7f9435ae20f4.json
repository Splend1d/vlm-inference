At room temperature, mercury exists in a liquid state, while all other metals are solids under these conditions. This unique property makes mercury useful in various applications, such as thermometers and barometers, where its ability to expand and contract with temperature changes is exploited.\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly look at the other options:\n\nA. Lead - Lead is a heavy metal that is solid at room temperature. It has a melting point of about 327.5 degrees Celsius, which is well above normal room temperature.\n\nB. Antimony - Antimony is also a solid metal at room temperature. Its melting point is around 630.63 degrees Celsius, making it a solid under normal conditions.\n\nC. Uranium - Uranium is a dense, silver-gray metal that is solid at room temperature. Its melting point is approximately 1132 degrees Celsius, which is significantly higher than normal temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Mercury."
