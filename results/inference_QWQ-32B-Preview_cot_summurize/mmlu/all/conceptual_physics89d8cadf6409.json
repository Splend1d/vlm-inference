                    "text": "So I have this question here about nuclear decay, specifically about uranium-238 emitting an alpha particle. I need to figure out what's left behind after that happens. The options are thorium-242, thorium-238, thorium-234, or radium-214.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an alpha particle is. I think an alpha particle is essentially a helium nucleus, which means it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So, when uranium-238 emits an alpha particle, it's losing 2 protons and 2 neutrons.\n\nUranium-238 has an atomic number of 92, which means it has 92 protons. If it loses 2 protons, the new atomic number should be 92 - 2 = 90. Looking at the periodic table, atomic number 90 is thorium. So, the element left behind should be thorium.\n\nNow, for the mass number. Uranium-238 has a mass number of 238, which is the total number of protons and neutrons. If it emits an alpha particle, which has a mass number of 4 (2 protons and 2 neutrons), then the new mass number should be 238 - 4 = 234. So, the isotope left behind should be thorium-234.\n\nLet me double-check that. Uranium-238 decays to thorium-234 by emitting an alpha particle. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. thorium-242 - that would mean the mass number increased, which doesn't make sense because it lost mass.\n\nB. thorium-238 - the mass number should decrease by 4.\n\nC. thorium-234 - that matches what I calculated.\n\nD. radium-214 - radium has an atomic number of 88, which is not what we get by subtracting 2 from uranium's 92.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. thorium-234.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there are any other types of decay that might be involved. Alpha decay is the most common for heavy elements like uranium, and in this case, it's specified that an alpha particle is emitted. So, I don't think there's any need to consider beta decay or anything else here.\n\nAlso, I should remember that in alpha decay, not only does the atomic number decrease by 2, but the mass number decreases by 4, which aligns with losing an alpha particle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. thorium-234.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
