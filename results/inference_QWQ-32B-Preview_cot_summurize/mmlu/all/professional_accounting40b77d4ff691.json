                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about audit evidence and tests of details for a nonissuer's audit. So, the auditor is designing these tests to make sure there's enough evidence to back up something related to the audit. The options are:\n\nA. The planned level of control risk.\n\nB. Management\u2019s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently.\n\nC. The effectiveness of internal controls.\n\nD. The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what tests of details are. These are\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f that auditors perform to directly test the balances in the financial statements. They look at specific transactions or account balances to gather evidence about the assertions made by management.\n\nNow, the question is asking what these tests should ensure sufficient audit evidence for. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. The planned level of control risk.\n\nControl risk is the risk that a material misstatement could occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the entity's internal controls. Auditors assess control risk to determine how much substantive testing they need to do. But tests of details are more about verifying the actual balances and transactions, not directly about the planned level of control risk. So, this seems a bit off.\n\nB. Management\u2019s assertions that internal controls exist and are operating efficiently.\n\nThis sounds similar to option C, but it's specifically about management's assertions about controls. Auditors do test controls to evaluate the operating effectiveness of internal controls, but tests of details are different. Tests of details are focused on the financial statement amounts, not on the controls themselves. So, this might not be the best answer.\n\nC. The effectiveness of internal controls.\n\nAgain, this is about the internal controls, and while auditors do test controls to assess their effectiveness, tests of details are more about verifying the financial data. So, this doesn't seem to be the primary purpose of tests of details.\n\nD. The planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\nThis option is a bit more nuanced. Assurance at the assertion level refers to the level of confidence the auditor wants to have that the financial statement assertions are correct. Auditors plan for a certain level of assurance and design their substantive procedures, including tests of details, to achieve that level.\n\nGiven that tests of details are substantive procedures aimed at providing direct evidence about the amounts in the financial statements, they should be designed to support the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level. This makes sense because the auditor is trying to gather sufficient evidence to support the conclusions about the financial statements' fairness.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Option A is about control risk, which is more related to the controls themselves, not the substantive tests on the balances. Option B is about management's assertions on controls, which again is more related to internal controls testing, not tests of details. Option C is directly about the effectiveness of internal controls, which is assessed through tests of controls, not tests of details.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer. Tests of details should be designed to ensure that there is sufficient audit evidence to support the planned level of assurance at the relevant assertion level.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
