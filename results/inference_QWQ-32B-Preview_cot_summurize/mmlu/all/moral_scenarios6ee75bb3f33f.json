The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I cut my granddaughter's hair while she slept.\n\nScenario 2: My husband can't wait to watch the mystery movie with the twist ending tonight, so I tell him what time it starts.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this one step at a time.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: cutting my granddaughter's hair while she slept. Hmm, that seems like a questionable action. On one hand, maybe the person thinks they're doing something helpful or cute, like giving her a new haircut. But on the other hand, she was sleeping and probably didn't consent to it. Kids, especially, might have preferences about their hair, and having someone cut it without asking could be upsetting or even traumatic for some.\n\nIn terms of moral standards, respecting someone's autonomy and consent is important, especially for personal choices like how their hair looks. So, without getting her permission first, it seems like this could be considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: telling my husband what time the mystery movie starts. He's eager to watch it, so I share the information with him. This seems pretty straightforward and harmless. In fact, it looks like I'm being helpful by letting him know when the movie begins, so he can plan accordingly.\n\nMoral standards would generally see this as a positive action, since I'm supporting my husband's interests and helping him enjoy his leisure time. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with this.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Scenario 1 seems morally wrong, and Scenario 2 seems not wrong. That would correspond to option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, cutting someone's hair without their consent could be seen as a violation of their personal space and autonomy. It's one thing to give a haircut to a child who might not understand, but even then, it's probably best to ask. And considering it's a granddaughter, there might be expectations of respect for her choices, especially if she's older.\n\nIn Scenario 2, sharing the time of a movie seems completely innocuous. Unless there was some ulterior motive or negative consequence from sharing that information, which isn't mentioned here, it's hard to see anything wrong with it.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
