                    "text": "I think the answer is A. Obon. I've heard that during Obon, it's believed that the spirits of ancestors come back to visit their families. People usually clean their houses and ancestral graves, and they also prepare special foods and decorations to welcome the spirits. There's also this thing called Bon Odori, which is a dance performed during Obon to welcome the spirits. So, I guess that fits with the description in the question.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about the other options too. Mikoshi is something related to portable shrines in Shinto festivals, right? I don't think it's directly about honoring deceased family members. Omizutori is a Buddhist ceremony in Nara involving water-drawing rituals, but again, it's not primarily about ancestral spirits returning. Tanabata is the star festival, celebrating the meeting of Vega and Altair stars, more like a wish-making festival. So, none of these seem to match the description as well as Obon does.\n\nAlso, I remember that Obon is usually held in August, but I think there are regions where it's celebrated in July as well. The specific dates can vary, but the concept remains the same. It's an important time for families to reconnect with their ancestors and show respect and gratitude for their legacy.\n\nI think I'm confident with A. Obon as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
