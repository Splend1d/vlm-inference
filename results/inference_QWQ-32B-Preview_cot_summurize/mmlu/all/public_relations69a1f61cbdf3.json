Time-bound.\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what an objective is. An objective is like a goal that you set for yourself or for a project. It's something you want to achieve.\n\nNow, I've heard about something called SMART goals. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. So, according to this, objectives should be measurable, achievable, and time-bound.\n\nLooking at the options, B, C, and D are all part of the SMART criteria. So, that means they are qualities that objectives should have.\n\nOption A is \"Broad.\" Hmm, that's interesting. If objectives should be specific, then being broad might be the opposite of that.\n\nLet me think about this. A broad objective might be something like \"improve sales,\" but that's pretty vague. It doesn't specify by how much or by when. On the other hand, a specific objective would be \"increase sales by 10% by the end of the year.\"\n\nSo, in this case, being broad isn't a good quality for an objective to have. It should be specific so that you know exactly what you're working towards and how to measure your progress.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. Broad.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check the other options.\n\nB. Achievable: Yes, objectives should be achievable. If they're not achievable, they're probably not going to motivate people, and they might lead to frustration.\n\nC. Measurable: Definitely, objectives need to be measurable so that you can track your progress and know when you've achieved them.\n\nD. Time-bound: Yes, having a deadline or a specific time frame helps to create urgency and keeps things on track.\n\nSo, all of these B, C, and D are positive qualities for objectives to have.\n\nTherefore, A. Broad is the one that objectives should NOT be.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
