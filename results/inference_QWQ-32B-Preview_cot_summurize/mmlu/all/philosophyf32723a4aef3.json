                    "text": "I'm going to need to think about this one. I remember that R.M. Hare was a philosopher who wrote about moral language and moral reasoning. In his works, particularly in \"The Language of Morals\" and \"Freedom and Reason,\" he discusses various ways people try to escape moral arguments. So, the question is asking about his view on these escape routes\u2014whether none, some, all, or all at a price are successful.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what these escape routes are. From what I remember, Hare identifies several strategies people use to avoid engaging in moral reasoning or to evade the conclusions of moral arguments. These might include relativism, emotivism, prescriptivism, and perhaps others.\n\nLet me consider option A: none of them are successful. If Hare thought that none of these escape routes work, that would mean he believes that people cannot validly avoid moral arguments using any of these methods. He might argue that each of these strategies fails to provide a genuine alternative to engaging with moral reasoning.\n\nOption B suggests that some, but not all, of them are successful. This would imply that Hare acknowledges that certain escape routes are effective in avoiding moral arguments, while others are not. He might differentiate between strategies based on their logical consistency or their ability to provide a coherent alternative to standard moral reasoning.\n\nOption C states that all are entirely successful. This seems unlikely, given that Hare was a proponent of a form of universal prescriptivism, which emphasizes the importance of universalizability in moral judgments. If all escape routes were successful, it might undermine the very foundations of his own moral theory.\n\nOption D says that all might be successful, but at a price. This suggests that while these escape routes can be used effectively, they come with certain costs or drawbacks. Perhaps they require sacrificing some aspect of moral discourse or lead to undesirable consequences in terms of moral decision-making.\n\nConsidering Hare's philosophical position, I think option D is the most plausible. Hare was known for his emphasis on the rationality of moral discourse and the importance of universalizability. He likely recognized that people could use various strategies to escape moral arguments, but that doing so would come at the cost of coherence, consistency, or the ability to engage in meaningful moral discussion.\n\nIn \"Freedom and Reason,\" Hare discusses the idea that moral statements are prescriptive and that moral reasoning involves considering the implications of universalizing one's prescriptions. He might argue that escaping moral arguments through relativism or emotivism, for example, may allow one to avoid the demands of universalizability, but at the price of undermining the objectivity and universality that are central to moral discourse.\n\nMoreover, Hare was critical of positions that he saw as undermining the rationality of morality, such as extreme forms of emotivism that reduce moral statements to mere expressions of emotion without cognitive content. He would likely view such escape routes as unsuccessful because they fail to capture the rational element of moral discourse.\n\nHowever, he might acknowledge that some escape routes are partially successful in certain contexts, but overall, they come with significant drawbacks. Therefore, option D seems the most aligned with Hare's likely viewpoint.\n\nTo summarize, I believe that Hare would claim that all escape routes from moral arguments might be successful to some extent, but they come at a price, which is why option D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
