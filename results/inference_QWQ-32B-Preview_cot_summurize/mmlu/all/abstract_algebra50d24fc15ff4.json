                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a homomorphism between two groups is. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation. So, if \u03c6: G \u2192 G' is a homomorphism, then for any a, b in G, \u03c6(ab) = \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b).\n\nNow, the statement says that for any two groups G and G', there exists at least one such homomorphism from G to G'. Is this always true?\n\nWell, one obvious candidate for a homomorphism is the trivial homomorphism, which maps every element of G to the identity element of G'. Let's denote the identity of G' as e'. So, define \u03c6: G \u2192 G' by \u03c6(g) = e' for all g in G.\n\nIs this a homomorphism? Let's check: for any a, b in G, \u03c6(ab) = e', and \u03c6(a)\u03c6(b) = e'e' = e'. So, yes, it satisfies the homomorphism property.\n\nTherefore, regardless of what G and G' are, as long as they are groups, there is at least one homomorphism from G to G', namely the trivial homomorphism.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.\n\nNow, I need to recall what it means for a function to be one-to-one, or injective. A function is one-to-one if different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain. In other words, if \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(b), then a = b.\n\nIs this true for every homomorphism?\n\nWell, consider the trivial homomorphism I mentioned earlier, where \u03c6(g) = e' for all g in G. This maps every element of G to the same element in G', which is e'. So, unless G has only one element, this homomorphism is not one-to-one because multiple elements map to e'.\n\nTherefore, not every homomorphism is one-to-one. There exist homomorphisms that are not injective.\n\nHence, Statement 2 is false.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
