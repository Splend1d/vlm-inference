                    "text": "So I've got this problem: \"How many positive numbers x satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x?\" and the options are A. 1, B. 15, C. 31, D. 49. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I know that the cosine function, cos(theta), oscillates between -1 and 1 for all real numbers theta. So, cos(97x) will also oscillate between -1 and 1 as x varies.\n\nNow, the equation is cos(97x) = x. I need to find positive values of x where this equality holds.\n\nSince cos(97x) oscillates between -1 and 1, and x is positive, that means x is also between -1 and 1 for there to be any solutions. But wait, x is positive, so x is between 0 and 1.\n\nWait a second, cosine can be negative, but x is positive, so perhaps there are solutions where cos(97x) is positive and equals x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the graphs of y = cos(97x) and y = x and see where they intersect for x > 0.\n\nSo, plotting y = cos(97x), it's a cosine wave with a period of 2\u03c0/97, because the period of cos(kx) is 2\u03c0/k. So here, period is 2\u03c0/97.\n\nAnd y = x is a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of 1.\n\nI need to find the points where these two graphs intersect for x > 0.\n\nSince cos(97x) oscillates between -1 and 1, and y = x increases linearly from 0 upwards, the intersections will occur where x is between 0 and 1, because beyond x = 1, y = x is greater than 1, while cos(97x) never exceeds 1.\n\nSo, the possible solutions are in the interval x \u2208 (0, 1].\n\nNow, to find how many times they intersect in this interval, I need to consider the number of periods of cos(97x) in this interval.\n\nThe period of cos(97x) is 2\u03c0/97. So, the number of periods in the interval (0, 1] is 1 / (2\u03c0/97) = 97/(2\u03c0).\n\nCalculating that: 97 divided by 2\u03c0 is approximately 97 divided by 6.2832, which is roughly 15.43.\n\nSo, there are about 15.43 periods in the interval from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\nNow, in each period of cos(97x), the function crosses the line y = x twice, once when it's increasing and once when it's decreasing, because y = x is a straight line and cos(97x) oscillates across it twice per period.\n\nTherefore, in 15 full periods, there would be 15 * 2 = 30 intersections.\n\nThen, there's a partial period left over, since 15.43 periods mean there's a partial period at x = 1.\n\nIn that partial period, I need to see how many times they intersect.\n\nTo determine that, I need to find out where in the period the partial part lies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the total number of times y = cos(97x) crosses y = x in the interval (0,1].\n\nGiven that, I can consider the function f(x) = cos(97x) - x, and find its roots in (0,1].\n\nThe number of roots of f(x) = 0 in (0,1] will give me the number of solutions to cos(97x) = x.\n\nTo find the number of roots, I can look at the derivative of f(x), which is f'(x) = -97 sin(97x) - 1.\n\nThe derivative f'(x) tells me about the slope of f(x). To find the critical points, set f'(x) = 0:\n\n-97 sin(97x) - 1 = 0 => sin(97x) = -1/97.\n\nSince sin(97x) ranges between -1 and 1, -1/97 is within that range, so there are solutions to this equation.\n\nThe number of times sin(97x) equals -1/97 in the interval (0,1] is equal to the number of times 97x lies in the arcsin(-1/97) plus multiples of 2\u03c0.\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since cos(97x) oscillates with period 2\u03c0/97, and y = x is a straight line, I can consider how many times the cosine wave crosses the line y = x.\n\nIn one full period of cos(97x), the graph of cos(97x) crosses y = x twice: once on the increasing part and once on the decreasing part.\n\nTherefore, in each period, there are two intersections.\n\nGiven that there are approximately 15.43 periods in the interval (0,1], the total number of intersections would be roughly 15 * 2 = 30, plus the intersections in the partial period.\n\nIn the partial period, since it's 0.43 of a period, and in a full period there are two intersections, in 0.43 of a period, there would be approximately 0.43 * 2 \u2248 0.86 intersections.\n\nBut the number of intersections must be an integer, so I need to determine whether there is 0 or 1 intersection in the partial period.\n\nTo decide this, perhaps I can look at the value of cos(97*1) and compare it to 1.\n\nAt x = 1, cos(97*1) = cos(97), and since 97 is much larger than \u03c0, cos(97) is just some value between -1 and 1.\n\nSince y = x at x = 1 is y = 1, and cos(97) is likely not equal to 1, there is no intersection at x = 1.\n\nTherefore, in the partial period, there is likely only one intersection.\n\nTherefore, total number of intersections is 30 (from 15 full periods) plus 1 (from the partial period), totaling 31 intersections.\n\nTherefore, there are 31 positive numbers x that satisfy cos(97x) = x.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 31.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nI assumed that in each full period, there are two intersections, and in the partial period, there is one intersection.\n\nIs that accurate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a better mathematical approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the function f(x) = cos(97x) - x, and find its roots in (0,1].\n\nThe number of roots of f(x) = 0 in (0,1] is what we're seeking.\n\nTo find the number of roots, we can analyze the behavior of f(x).\n\nWe know that f(0) = cos(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nAs x increases from 0 to 1, f(x) decreases because its derivative f'(x) = -97 sin(97x) - 1 is mostly negative, given that sin(97x) oscillates between -1 and 1, and -97 sin(97x) oscillates between -97 and 97.\n\nSubtracting 1 means f'(x) oscillates between -98 and 96.\n\nSince f'(x) is positive when sin(97x) is negative enough, and negative when sin(97x) is positive.\n\nThis means f(x) is not monotonic; it has ups and downs.\n\nEach time f'(x) crosses zero, f(x) has a local extremum.\n\nThe number of times f'(x) = 0 in (0,1] is equal to the number of times sin(97x) = -1/97.\n\nSince sin(97x) oscillates with period 2\u03c0/97, and in each period, sin(97x) = -1/97 twice (once in each half-period), the number of times sin(97x) = -1/97 in (0,1] is approximately the number of periods times 2.\n\nNumber of periods is 97/(2\u03c0), which is about 15.43, so number of times sin(97x) = -1/97 is about 15.43 * 2 \u2248 30.86, which means 30 times in full periods and 1 in the partial period, totaling 31 extrema.\n\nNow, between each two consecutive extrema, f(x) changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, which could mean it crosses zero once between each pair of extrema.\n\nGiven that, the number of roots is equal to the number of times f(x) changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, which is equal to the number of extrema, minus the number of times f(x) doesn't cross zero between extrema.\n\nHowever, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the intermediate value theorem.\n\nSince f(x) is continuous, if f(x) changes sign between two points, there is at least one root between them.\n\nGiven that f(x) oscillates, and y = x is a straight line, the number of times f(x) crosses zero should be equal to the number of times the oscillating cosine function crosses the straight line.\n\nGiven the earlier reasoning about 15 full periods and one partial period, leading to 31 intersections, this seems reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 31.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
