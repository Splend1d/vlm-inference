                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about religious organizations: the Church of Norway, Islam, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece. I need to find out what they have in common from these options:\n\nA. They are cultures as well as churches.\n\nB. They practice separation of church and state.\n\nC. They exclude women as clergy.\n\nD. They are monotheistic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each of these organizations a bit better.\n\nThe Church of Norway is the national church of Norway and it's Lutheran. Islam is a major world religion based on the teachings of the Quran and the prophet Muhammad. The Church of England is the principal Christian church in England and the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. It's also Protestant, specifically Anglican. The Church of Greece is the national church of Greece and it's Orthodox Christian.\n\nSo, all of these are Christian except for Islam, which is a separate religion.\n\nOption A says they are cultures as well as churches. Well, religion often plays a big role in culture, so that could be true. But I need to see if this is a common characteristic among all of them.\n\nOption B is about separation of church and state. That's interesting. Let's think about each one:\n\n- The Church of Norway is the state church of Norway, so there isn't a separation; quite the opposite.\n\n- Islam as a whole doesn't have a single governing body, but in some countries, like Saudi Arabia, there is no separation, while in others, like Turkey, there is.\n\n- The Church of England is the official church of England, so there is some connection with the state.\n\n- The Church of Greece is the state church of Greece.\n\nSo, it seems that only in some cases is there a separation, but not in others. Therefore, this isn't a common characteristic among all of them.\n\nOption C is about excluding women as clergy. Let's check each one:\n\n- The Church of Norway has had women priests since 1961 and bishops since 2008.\n\n- In Islam, there is diversity, but generally, women can be religious leaders in some capacities, but not imams in many traditions.\n\n- The Church of England ordained its first female priest in 1994 and its first female bishop in 2015.\n\n- The Church of Greece does not ordain women to the priesthood or higher offices.\n\nSo, while some of these organizations do exclude women as clergy, others do not. Therefore, this isn't a common characteristic among all of them.\n\nOption D says they are monotheistic. Let's recall:\n\n- Christianity, which includes the Church of Norway, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece, is monotheistic, believing in one God.\n\n- Islam is also monotheistic, believing in one God, Allah.\n\nSo, all of these religions believe in one God. That seems like a common characteristic.\n\nComparing all the options, option D seems to be the best answer because all of these religious organizations are monotheistic.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check option A. \"They are cultures as well as churches.\" While it's true that religion shapes culture, and these organizations have cultural influences, I think option D is more directly and universally applicable.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. They are monotheistic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
