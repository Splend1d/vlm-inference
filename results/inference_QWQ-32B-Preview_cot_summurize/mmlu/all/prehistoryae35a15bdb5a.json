                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out which of these options wasn't a part of Mayan culture by 1900 B.P. First, I need to make sure I understand what 1900 B.P. means. B.P. stands for \"Before Present,\" right? So, 1900 B.P. would be around 1900 years ago from today. But actually, in scientific terms, B.P. often refers to years before 1950, so 1900 B.P. would be approximately 1950 minus 1900, which is around 50 A.D. or thereabouts. But maybe I should confirm that.\n\nAssuming that 1900 B.P. is roughly 50 A.D., I need to think about what the Mayan culture was like during that time. The Maya are known for their advanced civilization in Mesoamerica, particularly in areas like present-day Guatemala, Belize, Mexico, and Honduras.\n\nOption A says \"stratified societies ruled by kings.\" I know that the Maya had a complex social structure with kings and nobles at the top, followed by priests, merchants, artisans, and farmers. So, by 50 A.D., it's likely that they already had stratified societies ruled by kings. In fact, the Maya city-states were known for their powerful rulers.\n\nOption B mentions \"ritual ball games and a reverence for precious jade.\" The Maya are famous for their ball courts where they played ritualistic ball games, which had religious and political significance. Jade was also highly valued by the Maya for its symbolic and aesthetic qualities, used in jewelry and other artifacts. So, this seems to be accurate for that time period.\n\nOption C is \"a sophisticated bronze producing industry.\" Now, this is where I need to be careful. I know that many ancient civilizations, like those in Europe and Asia, developed bronze technology, which is a combination of copper and tin. However, in Mesoamerica, including the Maya region, there isn't strong evidence for the use of bronze metallurgy during the early periods.\n\nIn fact, the Maya are known more for their work with other materials like jade, obsidian, and stone, rather than metals. There is some evidence of copper use, but bronze, which requires tin, is not prominent in Mayan archaeology. So, this might be the answer.\n\nOption D is \"a hieroglyphic written language and calendar.\" The Maya had a sophisticated writing system consisting of hieroglyphs, and they developed accurate calendars, including the well-known Long Count calendar. This system was in use by at least the 3rd century B.C., so by 50 A.D., they definitely had a hieroglyphic written language and calendar.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, it seems that the sophisticated bronze producing industry was NOT a central element of Mayan culture by 1900 B.P. So, the answer should be C.\n\nBut to make sure, I should double-check. The Maya did have some metallurgy, but it was limited mostly to copper, and they didn't smelt iron or produce bronze, which requires tin. So, yes, bronze production wasn't a part of their technological repertoire during that period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
