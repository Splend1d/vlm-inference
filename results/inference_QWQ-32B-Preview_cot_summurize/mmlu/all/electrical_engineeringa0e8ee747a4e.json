                    "text": "Speed control by variation of field flux is a method used in DC machines, particularly in DC motors, to control their speed. This method involves changing the strength of the magnetic field (flux) in the motor, which in turn affects the speed at which the motor rotates.\n\nTo understand the implications of this method, let's first recall some fundamental relationships in DC motors.\n\n1. **Back EMF (Electromotive Force):** In a DC motor, as the armature rotates, it generates a back EMF that opposes the applied voltage. The back EMF is directly proportional to the speed of the motor and the flux per pole.\n\n   \\[ E_b = k \\cdot \\phi \\cdot N \\]\n\n   where:\n\n   - \\( E_b \\) is the back EMF\n\n   - \\( k \\) is a constant\n\n   - \\( \\phi \\) is the flux per pole\n\n   - \\( N \\) is the speed of the motor\n\n2. **Armature Current:** The armature current (\\( I_a \\)) is determined by the difference between the applied voltage (\\( V \\)) and the back EMF, divided by the armature circuit resistance (\\( R_a \\)).\n\n   \\[ I_a = \\frac{V - E_b}{R_a} \\]\n\n3. **Torque:** The torque (\\( T \\)) produced by the motor is proportional to the product of the armature current and the flux per pole.\n\n   \\[ T = k_t \\cdot I_a \\cdot \\phi \\]\n\n   where \\( k_t \\) is another constant.\n\nNow, when we vary the field flux (\\( \\phi \\)) to control the speed, we are essentially changing \\( \\phi \\) while keeping the applied voltage (\\( V \\)) constant.\n\nLet's see how this affects the speed and torque:\n\n- **Speed Variation:** From the back EMF equation, \\( E_b = k \\cdot \\phi \\cdot N \\). At steady state, \\( E_b \\) is approximately equal to \\( V - I_a R_a \\), which is almost constant if \\( I_a \\) doesn't change much. However, in flux control, we are changing \\( \\phi \\), which directly affects \\( N \\) (speed). Specifically, if \\( \\phi \\) decreases, \\( N \\) increases to maintain the back EMF equation balance, and vice versa.\n\n- **Torque Variation:** From the torque equation, \\( T = k_t \\cdot I_a \\cdot \\phi \\). If we decrease \\( \\phi \\), to maintain the same torque, \\( I_a \\) would need to increase. However, in practice, when we decrease \\( \\phi \\), \\( I_a \\) might not increase proportionally, leading to a decrease in torque.\n\nTherefore, speed control by varying the field flux typically results in a **variable torque drive**. This is because, as the flux is reduced to increase speed, the torque capability of the motor decreases. Conversely, increasing the flux decreases the speed but increases the torque.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. constant power drive.\n\nB. constant torque drive.\n\nC. variable power drive.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nThe correct answer is **C. variable power drive.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n- **Power** in a DC motor is given by the product of torque and speed.\n\n- Since both torque and speed are varying when flux is changed, the power is not constant.\n\n- Specifically, as speed increases with decreased flux, torque decreases, and vice versa. The relationship between torque and speed determines the power output, which is not constant in this scenario.\n\nOption A (constant power drive) would imply that power remains unchanged despite speed variations, which is not the case here.\n\nOption B (constant torque drive) suggests that torque remains constant while speed varies, which is not accurate for flux control, as torque varies with flux.\n\nOption D (none of the above) is not correct because option C is appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is **C. variable power drive.**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
