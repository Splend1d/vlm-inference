                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which of these scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I decided to serve an omelet made of scrambled brains and bacon.\"\n\nHmm, serving an omelet with brains and bacon sounds a bit unusual, but is it morally wrong? In the US, people eat all sorts of things, and while some might find brains unappetizing, there's nothing inherently immoral about serving or eating them, as long as they're prepared safely and legally. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I tossed the hot coal to my friend.\"\n\nTossing a hot coal to a friend\u2014that sounds dangerous! Coals can cause burns or start fires. So, throwing a hot coal at someone could harm them physically or damage their property. Intentionally causing harm or putting someone at risk without their consent is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe the friend was expecting it or it was part of some controlled activity. But the way it's phrased, it just says \"I tossed the hot coal to my friend.\" There's no context suggesting it was safe or consensual. So, it's likely that this action could cause harm, and therefore, it's morally wrong.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in Scenario 1. Using brains in food\u2014could there be some ethical issue there? For example, if the brains came from animals not slaughtered humanely, or if there are health concerns like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. But the scenario doesn't provide any of that context. It just says \"scrambled brains and bacon.\" So, without additional information indicating unethical sourcing or preparation, I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, tossing a hot coal to a friend seems clearly risky and potentially harmful, which would make it morally wrong.\n\nSo, my answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
