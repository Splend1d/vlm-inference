                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option is evidence for interbreeding between modern humans and Neandertals. I know that interbreeding means that the two groups mated and had offspring together, so their genes would have mixed.\n\nOption A says that all modern humans share a major percentage of their genome with Neandertals. Hmm, I think that's not quite right because, while modern humans outside of Africa have some Neandertal DNA, it's a small percentage, not a major one. Also, people from Africa don't have significant Neandertal DNA because Neandertals lived in Europe and Asia.\n\nOption B says that all Neandertals share a major percentage of their genome with modern humans. Again, I think this isn't accurate because Neandertals and modern humans diverged quite a bit before they interbred, so they wouldn't share a major percentage of their genome. Plus, Neandertals went extinct, so their genome is only present in modern humans to a small extent.\n\nOption C says that a small but significant percentage of the genome of modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia originated with Neandertals. This sounds familiar. I recall that when modern humans migrated out of Africa, they encountered Neandertals in Europe and Asia and interbred with them. So, people whose ancestors come from these regions have some Neandertal DNA, maybe around 1-4% on average.\n\nOption D says that a small but significant percentage of the genome of Neandertals is found in anatomically modern humans who trace their ancestry to Africa. Wait, but Neandertals lived in Europe and Asia, right? So, Africans shouldn't have Neandertal DNA, or at least not from direct interbreeding with Neandertals. However, there have been some studies suggesting that there might be ancient gene flow into Africans from other archaic humans, but not directly from Neandertals.\n\nSo, considering all this, option C seems to be the most accurate statement about evidence for interbreeding between modern humans and Neandertals. It acknowledges that only certain modern human populations have Neandertal DNA due to the geographical locations where interbreeding occurred.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about this again. If modern humans and Neandertals interbred in Europe and Asia, then people whose ancestors stayed in Africa wouldn't have Neandertal DNA, or at least very little. That's why option D might not be correct, or at least less accurate than option C.\n\nAlso, option A is too broad by saying \"all modern humans\" share a major percentage of their genome with Neandertals, which isn't the case. It's more precise to say that only non-African modern humans have a small percentage of Neandertal DNA.\n\nOption B is similar; it's not that all Neandertals share a major percentage of their genome with modern humans. Neandertals are distinct from modern humans, and their genomes reflect that they diverged from the modern human lineage around 500,000 to 800,000 years ago.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably C: a small but significant percentage of the genome of modern humans who trace their ancestry to Europe and Asia originated with Neandertals.\n\nWait a minute, but I've also heard about the Denisovans, another group of archaic humans that modern humans interbred with in Asia. So, maybe some Asian populations have DNA from both Neandertals and Denisovans. But the question is specifically about Neandertals, so that should still be okay.\n\nAlso, there's been some research suggesting that even African populations might have some archaic DNA from extinct hominins that lived in Africa, but that's different from Neandertals.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
