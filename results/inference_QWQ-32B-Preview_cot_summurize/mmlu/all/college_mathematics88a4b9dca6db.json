                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about topological spaces and subsets A, B, and C where A is a proper subset of B, and B is a proper subset of C. I need to determine which of the three statements are true regarding connectedness, compactness, and being Hausdorff for these subsets.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these properties means:\n\n1. **Connected**: A space is connected if it cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n\n2. **Compact**: A space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n\n3. **Hausdorff**: A space is Hausdorff if for any two distinct points, there exist disjoint open sets containing each point.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: If A and C are connected, then B is connected.**\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Just because A and C are connected doesn't necessarily mean that B has to be connected. Let me think of some counterexamples.\n\nSuppose X is the real line with the standard topology. Let C be the interval [0, 2], which is connected. Let A be [0, 1], which is also connected. Now, let B be [0, 1] \u222a {1.5}. B is not connected because it can be separated into [0,1] and {1.5}, which are disjoint open sets in the subspace topology of B.\n\nSo, even though A and C are connected, B is not necessarily connected. Therefore, statement I is false.\n\nWait, but the question says A is a proper subset of B, and B is a proper subset of C. In my example, A is [0,1], B is [0,1] \u222a {1.5}, and C is [0,2]. This seems to satisfy A \u2282 B \u2282 C, and A and C are connected, but B is not.\n\nSo, I would say statement I is false.\n\n**Statement II: If A and C are compact, then B is compact.**\n\nAgain, let's think about this. Compactness is a property that is not always inherited by subsets in the way described.\n\nTake X to be the real line again. Let C be [0, 2], which is compact in the standard topology. Let A be [0,1], which is also compact. Now, let B be [0,1) \u222a {1.5}. B is not compact because the open cover consisting of open intervals covering [0,1) and {1.5} doesn't have a finite subcover.\n\nSo, even though A and C are compact, B is not necessarily compact. Therefore, statement II is false.\n\n**Statement III: If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.**\n\nNow, Hausdorff is a separation axiom, and it's inherited by subsets.\n\nRecall that a subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff. So, if C is Hausdorff, then any subset of C, including B, is Hausdorff in the subspace topology.\n\nWait, but A is a subset of B, and B is a subset of C. If C is Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff, and A is Hausdorff as well.\n\nSo, if C is Hausdorff, B is automatically Hausdorff, regardless of what A is. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nBut the question says \"if A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\" Since B being Hausdorff only depends on C being Hausdorff, the condition on A is redundant, but it's still true.\n\nSo, statement III is true.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Statement I is false.\n\n- Statement II is false.\n\n- Statement III is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. III only.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario where A and C are Hausdorff, but B is not?\n\nI can't think of one because if C is Hausdorff, then any subspace of C is Hausdorff.\n\nSo, yes, III is definitely true.\n\nAnd I have counterexamples for I and II being false.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
