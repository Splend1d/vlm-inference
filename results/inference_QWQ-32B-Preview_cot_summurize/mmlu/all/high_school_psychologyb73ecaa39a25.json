When schools work closely with families and the community, it creates a supportive environment that can enhance a student's education. For example, parents can help reinforce what's learned in school at home, and community resources can offer extra learning opportunities like internships or volunteer work. This collaboration seems beneficial for student achievement.\n\nOption B says that school-community partnerships are not important for student success. But research shows that involvement from families and the community positively affects student outcomes, so I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption C suggests that these partnerships reduce student success. That seems counterintuitive because partnerships are generally aimed at supporting students. So, I doubt this is the right answer.\n\nOption D mentions that partnerships take up too much time for the school and community. While it's true that building and maintaining partnerships requires effort, the question is about characteristics of schools with high achievement and family involvement. It's likely that these schools prioritize partnerships despite the time investment because they see benefits in student success.\n\nOverall, I believe A is the correct answer because it aligns with the idea that partnerships enhance learning opportunities and support student achievement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
