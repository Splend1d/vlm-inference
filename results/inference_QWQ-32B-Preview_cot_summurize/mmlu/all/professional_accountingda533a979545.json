                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Bay Co. and their legal fees related to defending their patent rights. So, the scenario is that Bay Co. has incurred legal fees in this process, and we need to determine when these legal fees should be capitalized based on the outcome of the litigation.\n\nFirst off, let's understand what capitalizing means in this context. Capitalizing expenses typically means that instead of recognizing them immediately as an expense on the income statement, they are added to the cost of an asset on the balance sheet. This is usually done when the expense is expected to provide future economic benefits beyond the current period.\n\nNow,\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u7684\u8fa9\u62a4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a interesting situation. Patents are intangible assets, and companies often spend money to defend their patent rights, which can be crucial for maintaining their competitive edge.\n\nThe question is asking about when these legal fees should be capitalized based on the outcome of the litigation: whether it's successful or unsuccessful.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No No\n\nD. No Yes\n\nSo, option A suggests that legal fees should be capitalized regardless of whether the outcome is successful or unsuccessful.\n\nOption B suggests capitalizing only if the outcome is successful.\n\nOption C suggests never capitalizing, regardless of the outcome.\n\nOption D suggests capitalizing only if the outcome is unsuccessful.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider accounting standards, specifically related to the capitalization of costs associated with intangible assets like patents.\n\nUnder GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), for internal research and development costs, only certain costs can be capitalized once specific criteria are met, such as establishing that the intangible asset is probable of being successfully developed and protected.\n\nHowever, in the case of legal fees related to defending patent rights, it's a bit different. These are not part of the initial research and development but rather part of protecting an existing asset.\n\nAccording to GAAP, costs incurred to defend a patent should be capitalized as part of the patent's cost only if the defense is successful. If the defense is unsuccessful, meaning the patent is invalidated or the company fails to maintain its rights, then the legal fees should be expensed in the period they are incurred.\n\nThis makes sense because if the defense is successful, the patent continues to provide future economic benefits, and thus, the legal fees can be considered as extending the life or maintaining the value of the asset. Therefore, capitalizing them would be appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the defense is unsuccessful, the patent may be lost or its value diminished, so there's no future economic benefit from the legal fees, and they should be expensed immediately.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that legal fees should be capitalized only if the outcome of the litigation is successful.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No No\n\nD. No Yes\n\nOption B matches this: Yes (capitalized if successful) and No (not capitalized if unsuccessful).\n\nSo, the answer is B.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- If the defense is successful, capitalize the legal fees as part of the patent's cost.\n\n- If the defense is unsuccessful, expense the legal fees in the current period.\n\nThis approach aligns with the principle of capitalizing costs only when they provide future economic benefits, which in this case is contingent on the success of the defense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nB"
