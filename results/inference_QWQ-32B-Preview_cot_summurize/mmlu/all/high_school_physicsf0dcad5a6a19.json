                    "text": "I've got this problem here: a car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 5 meters per second squared in a straight line. I need to find out how long it takes to cover 200 meters. The options are 9.0 seconds, 10.5 seconds, 12.0 seconds, or 15.5 seconds.\n\nOkay, first things first. The car is starting from rest, which means its initial velocity is zero. It's accelerating uniformly at 5 m/s\u00b2, and it needs to cover a distance of 200 meters. I need to find the time it takes to do that.\n\nI remember there are equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion. One of them relates distance, initial velocity, acceleration, and time. Let's see:\n\nThe equation is:\n\ns = ut + (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nWhere:\n\ns is the distance,\n\nu is the initial velocity,\n\na is the acceleration,\n\nt is the time.\n\nGiven that the car starts from rest, the initial velocity u is 0. So the equation simplifies to:\n\ns = (1/2)at\u00b2\n\nI can plug in the values I know:\n\n200 = (1/2)(5)t\u00b2\n\nLet me solve for t\u00b2:\n\n200 = (5/2)t\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n400 = 5t\u00b2\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\n80 = t\u00b2\n\nFinally, take the square root of both sides:\n\nt = \u221a80\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\u221a80 is the same as \u221a(16*5) = \u221a16 * \u221a5 = 4 * \u221a5\n\nI know that \u221a5 is approximately 2.236, so:\n\nt \u2248 4 * 2.236 = 8.944 seconds\n\nThat's approximately 8.944 seconds, which is closest to option A, 9.0 seconds.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with:\n\ns = (1/2)at\u00b2\n\n200 = (1/2)(5)t\u00b2\n\n200 = (5/2)t\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n400 = 5t\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n80 = t\u00b2\n\nt = \u221a80 \u2248 8.944 s\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the time should be approximately 8.944 seconds, which rounds up to 9.0 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 9.0 seconds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
