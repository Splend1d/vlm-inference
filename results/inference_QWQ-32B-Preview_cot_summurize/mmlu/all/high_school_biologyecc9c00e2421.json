                    "text": "Let's dive into these statements about natural selection and see which one is the most accurate.\n\nOption A says: \"Adaptations beneficial in one habitat should generally be beneficial in all other habitats as well.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Adaptations are usually specific to particular environments. What helps an organism survive in one habitat might be useless or even harmful in another. For example, a camel's hump is great for storing fat in the desert, but it wouldn't help much in a forest. So, A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B: \"Different species that occupy the same habitat will adapt to that habitat by undergoing the same genetic changes.\" This one is tricky. While it's true that different species in the same habitat might develop similar adaptations, like camouflage or certain feeding behaviors, they don't necessarily undergo the same genetic changes to get there. Evolution can take different genetic paths to similar traits. So, B might not be entirely accurate.\n\nOption C: \"Adaptations beneficial at one time should generally be beneficial during all other times as well.\" Again, this doesn't hold up. Adaptations are often suited to specific conditions or seasons. For instance, thick fur might be great in winter but a disadvantage in summer. So, adaptations can be time-specific and may not be beneficial all the time.\n\nOption D: \"Well-adapted individuals leave more offspring, and thus contribute more to the next generation's gene pool, than do poorly adapted individuals.\" This sounds like a solid definition of natural selection. Individuals that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation. This is the very essence of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, D seems to be the most correct statement about natural selection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
