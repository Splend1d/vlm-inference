                    "text": "I've come across this term \"Lotus principle\" in my international law studies, and I'm a bit confused about what it exactly means. There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says that the Lotus principle is about restrictions on state independence not being presumed, meaning that whatever isn't prohibited is permitted in international law. Option B talks about states choosing which court to submit their disputes to. Option C mentions that states aren't prohibited from asserting their enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. And option D says that customary law comes from a combination of state practice and opinio juris.\n\nFirst, I need to recall where the Lotus principle comes from. I think it's related to a legal case involving Lotus, maybe a ship or something. I remember that it's a fundamental principle in international law regarding the balance between a state's sovereignty and the limitations imposed by international law.\n\nLet me think about the case. There was a collision between a French ship called the Lotus and a Turkish vessel in the Sea of Marmara. The French captain was put on trial in Turkey, and this led to a legal dispute between France and Turkey. The International Court of Justice, or maybe it was called something else back then, heard the case and established a principle that has since been known as the Lotus principle.\n\nIn that case, the court held that, in the absence of rules prohibiting a particular action, states are free to act as they wish. So, it's like the idea that in international law, there's no implicit restriction on state actions unless there's a specific rule saying otherwise.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A seems to align with this idea: \"restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed,\" meaning that states are free to do anything that isn't explicitly forbidden by international law.\n\nOption B talks about states choosing which court to submit their disputes to. That sounds more like the principle of consent in international adjudication, where states have to agree to submit to a court's jurisdiction. It doesn't seem directly related to the Lotus principle.\n\nOption C mentions enforcement jurisdiction on the high seas. While the Lotus case did involve actions on the high seas, the principle isn't specifically about enforcement jurisdiction there. It's more general about the freedoms of states in the absence of prohibitive rules.\n\nOption D is about the sources of customary international law, which is state practice combined with opinio juris, meaning that states believe they are bound by a certain rule. That's a separate principle altogether, related to how customary law is formed.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option A seems to be the correct description of the Lotus principle. It's the idea that in international law, unless there's a rule prohibiting a state from doing something, that state is free to act.\n\nBut I should double-check this because sometimes these principles can be a bit nuanced. Maybe I should look up the Lotus case again to confirm.\n\nUpon reviewing, the Lotus case did establish that in international law, there are no restrictions on state actions beyond those expressly prohibited by international law. In other words, unlike domestic law where there are often detailed regulations governing behavior, international law operates on the principle that states have sovereign autonomy unless that autonomy is limited by international agreements or established norms.\n\nSo, to put it simply, in international law, the default is freedom to act, whereas in domestic law, the default is often restraint unless permitted.\n\nGiven that, option A accurately captures the essence of the Lotus principle. It's not about court choices, enforcement jurisdiction specifically on the high seas, or the formation of customary law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: The so-called Lotus principle is that 'restrictions upon the independence of States cannot therefore be presumed', or, as it has been construed, 'whatever is not prohibited is permitted in international law'.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
