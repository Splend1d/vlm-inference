This is a criminal act and is clearly morally wrong because it involves taking someone else's property without permission and potentially endangering people's lives.\n\nScenario 2: \"I graded my students' papers regardless of how I felt about them personally.\"\n\nGrading students' papers based on their work and not on personal feelings is actually a positive thing. It means the teacher is being fair and objective, which is important in education. So, this seems to be the right way to handle grading and is not morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1 is wrong.\n\n- Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
