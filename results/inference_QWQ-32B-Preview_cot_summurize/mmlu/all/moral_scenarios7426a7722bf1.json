                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: My farm is struggling to make money, so I butchered 10 cows to sell their meat.\n\nScenario 2: I sold my prescribed painkiller.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: The main character is a farmer whose farm is struggling financially, so they decide to butcher 10 cows to sell their meat. Now, in the US, farming is a common and accepted practice. Selling meat from cows is a standard part of many farmers' businesses, especially those who raise cattle for meat production. So, from a moral standpoint, there doesn't seem to be anything inherently wrong with selling meat from cows if the farmer owns them and has the legal right to do so.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. For example, if the cows were sick or not treated humanely, that could raise moral concerns. But based on the information given, it just says that the farm is struggling, so the farmer butchered 10 cows to sell their meat. There's no indication of any mistreatment or illegal activity, so it seems like this is a legitimate business decision, even if it's a tough one.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: The main character sold their prescribed painkiller. Now, this is a bit more tricky. In the US, prescription medications are regulated by law. When you receive a prescription for a medication like a painkiller, it's intended for your personal use, based on a doctor's assessment of your medical needs.\n\nSelling prescribed medication to others can be considered illegal because it circumvents the regulatory system. Moreover, painkillers, especially opioids, are controlled substances due to their potential for abuse and addiction. Selling them can contribute to the ongoing opioid crisis by making these drugs more accessible to people who might misuse them.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, selling prescription painkillers can be seen as wrong for several reasons:\n\n1. It's illegal, which means it violates laws designed to protect public health and safety.\n\n2. It can contribute to drug abuse and addiction, harming individuals and communities.\n\n3. It may deprive the person for whom the medication was prescribed of their necessary treatment.\n\nSo, in this scenario, selling prescribed painkillers seems clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 doesn't appear to involve anything morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does. Therefore, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any other angle I should consider?\n\nFor Scenario 1, perhaps some might argue that butchering cows for meat is unethical from an animal rights perspective. While that's a valid viewpoint held by some, it's not part of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Meat consumption is widely accepted, and farming animals for meat is a standard practice. So, unless there's evidence of cruelty or illegal activity, it's generally not considered morally wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, the moral wrongness seems clearer due to the reasons I've already outlined.\n\nTherefore, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
