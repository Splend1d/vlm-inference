                    "text": "This question is about a property conveyance and what happens to the proceeds from a crop after certain events occur. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 2001, a woman executed a deed conveying a tract of land for one dollar to \"my friend for life, but if liquor is ever sold on the tract of land, then to my cousin and his heirs, and if for any reason the interest hereby conveyed to my cousin is not valid, then I reserve the right to re-enter the tract of land and take back my property.\"\n\nSo, the deed creates a life estate in favor of the friend, with a condition subsequent that if liquor is sold on the land, the interest shifts to the cousin and his heirs. Additionally, there's a reversionary clause that allows the woman to retake the property if the interest to the cousin is invalid for any reason.\n\nNow, in 2004, the friend dies intestate before the wheat he had planted could be harvested. We need to determine who is entitled to the proceeds of the crop.\n\nLet's consider the nature of the interest held by the friend. The friend has a life estate in the land. Generally, a life tenant is entitled to the use and enjoyment of the land during their lifetime, including the right to harvest crops planted during their tenure.\n\nHowever, there are conditions attached to this life estate. Specifically, if liquor is sold on the land, the interest shifts to the cousin and his heirs. But according to the scenario, no mention is made of liquor being sold on the land. Therefore, the condition hasn't been triggered, and the cousin hasn't acquired any interest in the land.\n\nSince the friend held a life estate and died, we need to see who succeeds to the interest. In a standard life estate, upon the death of the life tenant, the remainder interest, if any, would vest in the remainderman. But in this case, the deed specifies that if the condition (selling liquor) isn't met, and since it wasn't, the interest should remain with the life tenant's estate or as directed by the life tenant's will. However, the friend died intestate, meaning without a will.\n\nGiven that the friend held a life estate and died intestate, the proceeds from the crop, which are considered personal property, would typically pass according to the laws of intestate succession in the relevant jurisdiction. This means the crop proceeds would go to the friend's heirs as defined by state law.\n\nBut we also have to consider the reversionary clause. The woman reserved the right to re-enter and take back the property if the interest to the cousin is not valid. Since the condition for the cousin to take interest (selling liquor) didn't occur, the cousin has no interest, making the interest to the cousin invalid. Therefore, according to the reversionary clause, the woman has the right to re-enter and take back the property.\n\nHowever, this reversionary right might affect only the future interest in the land, not necessarily the current crop proceeds. The crop proceeds are likely considered personal property generated during the life tenant's tenure.\n\nGiven this, it seems that the friend's heirs would be entitled to the proceeds of the crop, as they inherit the personal property of the life tenant upon his death intestate.\n\nBut let's consider option C, the woman. She conveyed the land with certain conditions. If the interest to the cousin is invalid (which it is, since the condition wasn't met), she has the right to re-enter and take back the property. Maybe this includes the right to the crop proceeds.\n\nOption D suggests dividing the proceeds equally between the friend's heirs and the woman, but there's no clear basis for such division in the deed.\n\nOption B, the cousin, hasn't acquired any interest because the condition wasn't met.\n\nSo, between options A and C, it's a bit tricky. On one hand, the friend's heirs should inherit his personal property, including the crop proceeds. On the other hand, the woman has a reversionary right to take back the property if the cousin's interest is invalid, which it is.\n\nPerhaps the woman's reversionary right includes not only the land but also any proceeds generated from it after she reverts. But legally, the crop proceeds are likely considered personal property belonging to the life tenant at the time of his death.\n\nGiven that, and without more specific legal knowledge about the interaction between life estates, conditions, and reversionary interests in this context, I would\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9A, the friend's heirs, as being entitled to the proceeds of the crop.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
