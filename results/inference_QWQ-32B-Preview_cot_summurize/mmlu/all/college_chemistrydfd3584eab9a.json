                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the g value of a sodium (Na) atom based on its electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum. The EPR spectrum shows four hyperfine lines with resonant field positions at 3074 G, 3174 G, 3274 G, and 3374 G. The g value is a dimensionless quantity that relates the magnetic moment of an electron to its angular momentum.\n\nFirst, let's recall the basic relationship in EPR spectroscopy. The resonant magnetic field \\( B \\) for an electron in a magnetic field is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ h \\nu = g \\beta B \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant,\n\n- \\( \\nu \\) is the microwave frequency,\n\n- \\( g \\) is the g factor,\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the Bohr magneton.\n\nGiven that the EPR spectrum is in the X-band at 9.5 GHz, we can use this frequency to relate to the magnetic field.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are dealing with hyperfine splitting due to the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment of the sodium atom. Sodium has a nuclear spin \\( I = 3/2 \\), which leads to \\( 2I + 1 = 4 \\) hyperfine lines, as observed in the spectrum.\n\nThe hyperfine splitting arises from the interaction between the electron's magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment. The energy levels are split according to the projection of the total angular momentum \\( F = I + S \\), where \\( S = 1/2 \\) for an electron.\n\nThe magnetic field at resonance for each hyperfine line can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{h \\nu}{g \\beta} + \\frac{c}{g \\beta} \\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is a constant related to the hyperfine coupling.\n\nBut to simplify, since all lines correspond to the same frequency, the differences in magnetic fields are due to the hyperfine splitting.\n\nThe splitting between the hyperfine lines is due to the nuclear spin interactions. For a nucleus with spin \\( I \\), the number of hyperfine lines is \\( 2I + 1 \\), which matches the observed four lines for \\( I = 3/2 \\).\n\nThe splitting between adjacent hyperfine lines is equal and can be used to determine the hyperfine coupling constant \\( a \\), which is related to the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and the electron's magnetic moment.\n\nHowever, to find the g value, we can use the fact that the average magnetic field corresponds to the g value of the electron.\n\nFirst, let's find the average magnetic field from the four resonant field positions:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{3074 + 3174 + 3274 + 3374}{4} = \\frac{12896}{4} = 3224 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nNow, using the EPR equation:\n\n\\[ h \\nu = g \\beta B_{\\text{avg}} \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{h \\nu}{\\beta B_{\\text{avg}}} \\]\n\nWe know that:\n\n- \\( \\nu = 9.5 \\text{ GHz} = 9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz} \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1} \\)\n\n- \\( B_{\\text{avg}} = 3224 \\text{ G} = 3224 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ T} = 0.3224 \\text{ T} \\)\n\n- \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\)\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz})}{(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1}) \\times 0.3224 \\text{ T}} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.2947 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{2.987 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\]\n\n\\[ g \\approx 2.099 \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options (2.002, 1.950, 2.250, 2.005). It seems there might be a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet's consider another method. In hyperfine EPR spectra, the g value can be determined from the resonant fields using the formula:\n\n\\[ B_n = \\frac{h \\nu}{g \\beta} + \\frac{a}{g \\beta} m_I \\]\n\nwhere \\( m_I \\) are the nuclear spin projections.\n\nGiven that \\( I = 3/2 \\), \\( m_I \\) can be \\( +3/2, +1/2, -1/2, -3/2 \\).\n\nThus, the four resonant fields correspond to these four values of \\( m_I \\).\n\nLet's denote the resonant fields as:\n\n\\[ B_{3/2}, B_{1/2}, B_{-1/2}, B_{-3/2} \\]\n\nGiven the symmetry, \\( B_{3/2} \\) and \\( B_{-3/2} \\) are the outer lines, and \\( B_{1/2} \\) and \\( B_{-1/2} \\) are the inner lines.\n\nFrom the problem, the resonant fields are 3074 G, 3174 G, 3274 G, and 3374 G. Assuming they are ordered according to increasing \\( m_I \\), we have:\n\n\\[ B_{-3/2} = 3074 \\text{ G} \\]\n\n\\[ B_{-1/2} = 3174 \\text{ G} \\]\n\n\\[ B_{1/2} = 3274 \\text{ G} \\]\n\n\\[ B_{3/2} = 3374 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nThe hyperfine splitting \\( \\Delta B \\) between adjacent lines is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta B = 3174 - 3074 = 100 \\text{ G} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta B = 3274 - 3174 = 100 \\text{ G} \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta B = 3374 - 3274 = 100 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nSo, the splitting is consistent.\n\nNow, the average magnetic field \\( B_0 \\) is:\n\n\\[ B_0 = \\frac{B_{3/2} + B_{-3/2}}{2} = \\frac{3374 + 3074}{2} = \\frac{6448}{2} = 3224 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[ B_0 = \\frac{B_{1/2} + B_{-1/2}}{2} = \\frac{3274 + 3174}{2} = \\frac{6448}{2} = 3224 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nThis confirms the average magnetic field is 3224 G.\n\nNow, using the EPR equation without the hyperfine term:\n\n\\[ h \\nu = g \\beta B_0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{h \\nu}{\\beta B_0} \\]\n\nUsing the same values as before:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz})}{(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1}) \\times 0.3224 \\text{ T}} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.2947 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{2.987 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\]\n\n\\[ g \\approx 2.099 \\]\n\nAgain, this does not match any of the provided options. It seems there is a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet's consider that the hyperfine splitting is due to the nuclear magnetic moment interacting with the electron's magnetic moment. The hyperfine splitting \\( \\Delta B \\) is related to the hyperfine coupling constant \\( a \\) by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta B = \\frac{2 a}{g \\beta} \\]\n\nGiven that the splitting between adjacent lines is 100 G, and knowing that for \\( I = 3/2 \\), the splitting between \\( m_I = +1/2 \\) and \\( m_I = +3/2 \\) is \\( a / (g \\beta) \\), and similarly for other adjacent levels.\n\nWait, actually, for \\( I = 3/2 \\), the splittings should be in the ratios corresponding to the differences in \\( m_I \\).\n\nLet me recall the general expression for hyperfine splitting in EPR.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for hyperfine interaction is:\n\n\\[ H_{\\text{hf}} = a \\mathbf{I} \\cdot \\mathbf{S} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\mathbf{I} \\) is the nuclear spin operator and \\( \\mathbf{S} \\) is the electron spin operator.\n\nThe total angular momentum \\( F = I + S \\), and the possible values of \\( F \\) are \\( F = I + S = 3/2 + 1/2 = 2 \\) and \\( F = |I - S| = 3/2 - 1/2 = 1 \\).\n\nWait, but for sodium, with \\( I = 3/2 \\) and \\( S = 1/2 \\), the possible \\( F \\) values are \\( F = 2 \\) and \\( F = 1 \\).\n\nThe number of hyperfine levels is \\( 2F + 1 \\), so for \\( F = 2 \\), there are 5 levels, and for \\( F = 1 \\), there are 3 levels. But in the problem, only four hyperfine lines are observed. This suggests that some levels may be degenerate or that the spectrum is simplified due to selection rules.\n\nHowever, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should consider that the hyperfine splitting is small compared to the main Zeeman effect, and approximate the g value using the average field.\n\nGiven that, let's try to use the average field again:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{avg}} = 3224 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nAnd the EPR equation:\n\n\\[ h \\nu = g \\beta B_{\\text{avg}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{h \\nu}{\\beta B_{\\text{avg}}} \\]\n\nUsing the values:\n\n- \\( \\nu = 9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz} \\)\n\n- \\( B_{\\text{avg}} = 3224 \\text{ G} = 0.3224 \\text{ T} \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta = 9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1} \\)\n\n- \\( h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\)\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{(6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz})}{(9.274 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1}) \\times 0.3224 \\text{ T}} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.2947 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{2.987 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\]\n\n\\[ g \\approx 2.099 \\]\n\nThis is the same result as before, which doesn't match any of the options. It seems there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me try using the Bohr magneton value more accurately. Sometimes, the gyromagnetic ratio is expressed differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the g factor for a free electron, which is approximately 2.0023, and see if the options are close to that.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. 2.002\n\nB. 1.950\n\nC. 2.250\n\nD. 2.005\n\nGiven that, and considering that sodium has a nuclear spin of 3/2, perhaps the g value is being affected by the hyperfine interaction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the g value is being averaged over the hyperfine levels.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g value can be determined from the slope of the resonant field positions versus the magnetic quantum number.\n\nLet's consider that approach.\n\nFor hyperfine splitting, the resonant field for each line can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ B_n = \\frac{h \\nu}{g \\beta} \\left( 1 + \\frac{a}{h \\nu} m_I \\right) \\]\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference in magnetic fields between the lines can be related to the hyperfine coupling constant.\n\nGiven that the splitting between adjacent lines is 100 G, and knowing that for \\( I = 3/2 \\), the difference in \\( m_I \\) between adjacent levels is 1.\n\nThus, the hyperfine splitting \\( \\Delta B = \\frac{a}{g \\beta} \\), where \\( a \\) is the hyperfine coupling constant.\n\nGiven that \\( \\Delta B = 100 \\text{ G} \\), we have:\n\n\\[ 100 \\text{ G} = \\frac{a}{g \\beta} \\]\n\nBut I don't know \\( a \\), so this doesn't directly help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( a \\) in terms of known constants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the average g value can be determined from the average magnetic field and the EPR equation.\n\nGiven that, let's use the average magnetic field again:\n\n\\[ B_{\\text{avg}} = 3224 \\text{ G} \\]\n\nAnd the EPR equation:\n\n\\[ h \\nu = g \\beta B_{\\text{avg}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{h \\nu}{\\beta B_{\\text{avg}}} \\]\n\nUsing more precise values:\n\n- \\( \\nu = 9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz} \\)\n\n- \\( B_{\\text{avg}} = 3224 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ T} = 0.3224 \\text{ T} \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta = \\frac{e \\hbar}{2 m_e} = 9.274009994 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1} \\)\n\n- \\( h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s} \\)\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{(6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz})}{(9.274009994 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1}) \\times 0.3224 \\text{ T}} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.2947666425 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{2.987212797 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\]\n\n\\[ g \\approx 2.099 \\]\n\nAgain, this does not match any of the provided options.\n\nPerhaps there is a different approach. Let's consider that the g value for a free electron is approximately 2.0023, and maybe the options are slight variations of this value.\n\nGiven that, option A is 2.002, which is close to the free electron g value, but our calculation gives a higher value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g value is being affected by the interaction with the nuclear spin, leading to a different value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the Land\u00e9 g factor for the particular energy level of the sodium atom.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific energy level and angular momentum quantum numbers, this might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the g value to be approximately 2, and the options are just to select the closest value.\n\nGiven that, option A (2.002) is closest to 2, but our calculation gives 2.099, which is further from 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( h \\nu \\):\n\n\\[ h \\nu = (6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}) \\times (9.5 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz}) = 6.2947666425 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nThen, \\( \\beta B_{\\text{avg}} \\):\n\n\\[ \\beta B_{\\text{avg}} = (9.274009994 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J T}^{-1}) \\times 0.3224 \\text{ T} = 2.987212797 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J} \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{6.2947666425 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}}{2.987212797 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ J}} \\approx 2.099 \\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nGiven that this does not match any of the provided options, perhaps there is a different"
