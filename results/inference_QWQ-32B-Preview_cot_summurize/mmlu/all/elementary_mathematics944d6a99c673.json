We need to find out how many gallons of soup she will make this year.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between cups and gallons because the answer choices are in gallons, but the initial measurement is in cups.\n\nI know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. So, to convert cups to gallons, I would divide the number of cups by 16.\n\nLast year, she made 32 one-cup servings. This year, she's making two times that amount. So, this year she will make:\n\n32 cups * 2 = 64 cups\n\nNow, to convert 64 cups to gallons, I divide by 16:\n\n64 cups \u00f7 16 = 4 gallons\n\nSo, Chesa will make 4 gallons of soup this year.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 64\n\nB. 16\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 2\n\nThe correct answer is C. 4 gallons.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I missed something.\n\nStarting again:\n\nLast year: 32 one-cup servings\n\nThis year: 2 times last year's amount\n\nSo, this year: 32 cups * 2 = 64 cups\n\nNow, convert cups to gallons. Since 1 gallon = 16 cups,\n\n64 cups \u00f7 16 cups/gallon = 4 gallons\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, find out how much soup she made last year in gallons.\n\n32 cups \u00f7 16 cups/gallon = 2 gallons\n\nThis year, she's making two times that amount, so:\n\n2 gallons * 2 = 4 gallons\n\nThat matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think answer C. 4 is correct.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"two times the amount of soup that she made last year.\" It's clear that she's doubling the amount of soup.\n\nAlso, it specifies \"one-cup servings,\" so each serving is 1 cup, and she made 32 of them last year.\n\nThis year, twice that amount would be 64 cups.\n\nAnd 64 cups divided by 16 cups per gallon equals 4 gallons.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 4\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
