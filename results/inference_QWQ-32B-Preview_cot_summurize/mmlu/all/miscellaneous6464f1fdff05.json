                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick which one of these is a renewable energy source. The options are wood, oil, natural gas, and coal. Hmm, I think I remember something about renewable energy, but I need to recall what makes an energy source renewable.\n\nSo, renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally in a short period of time. Like, if we use them, they can be replaced easily. Non-renewable sources, on the other hand, take a very long time to form, like millions of years, so once we use them up, they're gone for good.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Wood - Wood comes from trees, right? And trees can be replanted and grown again. So, if we manage forests properly, cutting down trees and planting new ones, it seems like wood could be a renewable energy source.\n\nB. Oil - Oil is a fossil fuel that forms from the remains of ancient plants and animals over millions of years. It takes a really, really long time to form, so once we use it up, it's not coming back anytime soon. That makes it non-renewable.\n\nC. Natural gas - Similar to oil, natural gas is also a fossil fuel that forms over millions of years from the remains of plants and animals. It's not renewable because we can't make more in a short time.\n\nD. Coal - Coal is another fossil fuel that forms from plant material under high pressure over millions of years. Again, it's not renewable because it takes too long to form.\n\nSo, compared to oil, natural gas, and coal, wood seems to be the only option that can be renewed relatively quickly by replanting trees.\n\nBut wait, I've heard that burning wood also produces carbon dioxide, which isn't great for the environment. Does that mean it's not a good energy source?\n\nWell, even though burning wood releases CO2, if the wood comes from a sustainably managed forest where new trees are planted to replace the ones that are cut down, the overall carbon emissions can be balanced. The new trees absorb CO2 as they grow, offsetting the emissions from burning the wood.\n\nMoreover, wood is considered a renewable resource because it can be replenished relatively quickly, especially compared to fossil fuels.\n\nSo, in this list, wood is the only renewable energy source.\n\nLet me just double-check. Is there any other option that could be considered renewable?\n\nOil, natural gas, and coal are all fossil fuels that take millions of years to form, so they're definitely non-renewable.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
