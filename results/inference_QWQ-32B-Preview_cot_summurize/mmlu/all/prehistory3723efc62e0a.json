It's asking which development none of them seem to have achieved, and the options are:\n\nA. monumental works.\n\nB. irrigation technology.\n\nC. a written language.\n\nD. significant armies.\n\nI need to think about the civilizations that were in South America before the arrival of Europeans, like the Inca, Moche, Nazca, and others. Let's consider each option one by one.\n\nOption A: monumental works. I know that the Inca built Machu Picchu, which is a massive stone complex, and the Moche had pyramids and temples. The Nazca are known for their geoglyphs, which are huge designs on the ground. So, it seems like they did create monumental works.\n\nOption B: irrigation technology. South American civilizations needed to manage water for agriculture in often arid environments. The Inca had an extensive network of aqueducts and canals. The Nazca also had sophisticated irrigation systems to support their crops in the desert. So, it appears they did develop irrigation technology.\n\nOption C: a written language. This is tricky. The Incas are famous for their quipus, which were knotted strings used for record-keeping, but it's debated whether this was a true writing system. Other South American cultures, like the Moche, left behind pottery with symbols, but a full writing system like that of the Maya in Mesoamerica isn't evident. So, perhaps this is the answer.\n\nOption D: significant armies. The Inca Empire was known for its large and organized military. Other civilizations also had military structures to maintain order and defend their territories. So, it seems like they did have significant armies.\n\nGiven this, option C, a written language, seems to be the development that none of the ancient South American civilizations developed. But I need to be careful because the Maya, who were in Mesoamerica, did have a written language, but the question is about South America.\n\nWait, the question specifies \"ancient South America,\" so Maya isn't relevant here. Let me confirm about the Inca and other South American cultures.\n\nThe Inca used quipus for record-keeping, which was an advanced system of knotted cords, but it wasn't a writing system in the traditional sense. It could record numbers and perhaps some basic information, but not full texts or histories.\n\nOther South American cultures, like the Moche and Nazca, didn't have a known writing system either. They had iconography and symbols in their art, but no extensive written records like those found in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Mesoamerica.\n\nSo, it seems accurate to say that none of the ancient South American civilizations developed a written language.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. a written language.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
