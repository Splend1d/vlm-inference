And we need to figure out which fallacy that might be.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these fallacies is about.\n\nA. Special pleading: This is when someone applies rules or criteria to others but makes an exception for themselves without proper justification. It's like, \"Everyone should recycle, but I don't have to because I'm too busy.\"\n\nB. Amphiboly: This fallacy arises from ambiguous sentence structure, where the wording can be interpreted in multiple ways. It's more about the syntax than the emotion.\n\nC. Equivocation: This is when a word or phrase is used with more than one meaning in an argument, causing confusion. For example, using the word \"bank\" to mean both the side of a river and a financial institution in the same argument.\n\nD. Loaded language: This is using emotionally charged language to influence people's feelings or beliefs, often without providing rational support for the argument.\n\nGiven that the question is about using highly emotionally charged terms without giving reasons why they fit the subject, it sounds like the person is trying to appeal to emotions rather than logic. That seems a lot like loaded language.\n\nSpecial pleading is about making exceptions for oneself, which doesn't really fit here. Amphiboly is about ambiguous wording, not emotional appeal. Equivocation is about confusing different meanings of a word.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. Loaded language.\n\nBut let me double-check. Loaded language is indeed about using emotionally loaded terms to sway opinions without substantive argumentation. It matches the description in the question.\n\nYes, I'm pretty sure it's D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
