                    "text": "So I have this problem about radioactive decay. The material has a half-life of 36 minutes, and I start with 10.00 grams. I need to find out how much is left after 2 hours. The options are 1.00 gram, 1.5 times 10 to the power of -4 grams, 3.33 grams, and 0.25 gram. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what half-life means. Half-life is the time it takes for half of the material to decay. So, every 36 minutes, the amount of material is halved.\n\nNow, the time given is 2 hours. I need to convert that into minutes because the half-life is in minutes. 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes.\n\nSo, total time is 120 minutes, and half-life is 36 minutes. I need to find out how many half-lives are there in 120 minutes.\n\nNumber of half-lives (n) = total time / half-life = 120 / 36 \u2248 3.333\n\nSo, n is approximately 3.333.\n\nNow, the formula for the amount left after n half-lives is:\n\nAmount left = initial amount * (1/2)^n\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAmount left = 10.00 * (1/2)^3.333\n\nHmm, (1/2)^3.333, that seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the exponential decay formula:\n\nAmount left = initial amount * e^(-lambda * t)\n\nWhere lambda is the decay constant, and t is time.\n\nThe decay constant lambda is related to the half-life by:\n\nLambda = ln(2) / half-life\n\nSo, lambda = ln(2) / 36 minutes\n\nFirst, calculate lambda:\n\nLn(2) is approximately 0.6931\n\nSo, lambda = 0.6931 / 36 \u2248 0.01925 per minute\n\nNow, t = 120 minutes\n\nSo, amount left = 10.00 * e^(-0.01925 * 120)\n\nFirst, calculate -0.01925 * 120 = -2.31\n\nNow, e^(-2.31), which is approximately 0.1004\n\nTherefore, amount left = 10.00 * 0.1004 \u2248 1.004 grams\n\nThat's approximately 1.00 grams.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 1.00 gram, which matches.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check with the first method to confirm.\n\nUsing the first method:\n\nAmount left = 10.00 * (1/2)^3.333\n\n(1/2)^3.333, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, (1/2)^3 = 0.125\n\nThen, (1/2)^0.333, which is approximately 0.8\n\nSo, 0.125 * 0.8 = 0.100\n\nThus, amount left = 10.00 * 0.100 = 1.00 gram\n\nIt matches the first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula with logarithms.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\nAmount left = initial amount * (1/2)^(t / half-life)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAmount left = 10.00 * (1/2)^(120 / 36) = 10.00 * (1/2)^3.333\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to 1.00 gram.\n\nSo, it seems consistent.\n\nBut let's look at the options again.\n\nA. 1.00 grams\n\nB. 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 grams\n\nC. 3.33 grams\n\nD. 0.25 gram\n\nOption A matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but option D is 0.25 gram, which is different from 1.00 gram.\n\nMaybe I should check if there's any mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate (1/2)^3.333.\n\n(1/2)^3 = 0.125\n\n(1/2)^0.333, since 2^0.333 is approximately 1.2599, so 1/1.2599 \u2248 0.7937\n\nTherefore, (1/2)^3.333 = 0.125 * 0.7937 \u2248 0.0992\n\nThus, amount left = 10.00 * 0.0992 \u2248 0.992 grams, which is still approximately 1.00 gram.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is tricky, and I need to consider significant figures or something.\n\nBut the initial amount is given to four significant figures (10.00 grams), and the time is given in whole numbers, so 1.00 gram should be precise enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nWait, option B is 1.5 \u00d7 10^-4 grams, which is 0.00015 grams, which seems too small.\n\nThat would imply almost complete decay, but with the given half-life and time, it shouldn't be that low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mis calculated the decay constant.\n\nLet me recalculate lambda.\n\nLambda = ln(2) / half-life = 0.6931 / 36 \u2248 0.01925 per minute\n\nThen, for t = 120 minutes, amount left = 10.00 * e^(-0.01925 * 120)\n\n-0.01925 * 120 = -2.31\n\ne^(-2.31) \u2248 0.1004\n\nThus, 10.00 * 0.1004 = 1.004 grams\n\nStill, 1.00 grams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the half-life is in hours, not minutes.\n\nWait, the problem says the half-life is 36 minutes, not hours.\n\nSo, my initial conversion is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time is in hours, and I need to convert it properly.\n\nWait, 2 hours is 120 minutes, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the formula with base 2 exponent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more accurate way to calculate it.\n\nLet me try using logarithms.\n\nLet the amount left be N(t) = N0 * 2^(-t / t_half)\n\nWhere N0 is initial amount, t is time, t_half is half-life.\n\nPlugging in:\n\nN(t) = 10.00 * 2^(-120 / 36) = 10.00 * 2^(-3.333)\n\n2^(-3.333), calculating that.\n\n2^3 = 8\n\n2^0.333 is approximately 1.2599\n\nSo, 2^3.333 \u2248 8 * 1.2599 \u2248 10.079\n\nThus, 2^(-3.333) \u2248 1 / 10.079 \u2248 0.0992\n\nTherefore, N(t) = 10.00 * 0.0992 \u2248 0.992 grams, which is approximately 1.00 gram.\n\nSo, option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are misleading, and I need to consider more decimal places.\n\nBut given the precision of the given data, 1.00 gram is accurate enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options, and the correct answer isn't listed.\n\nBut based on my calculations, 1.00 gram is the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use a more precise value for ln(2) or the exponent.\n\nUsing a calculator, e^(-2.31) is approximately 0.1004, which gives 1.004 grams.\n\nRounded to three significant figures, it's 1.00 grams.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1.00 grams.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nIs the decay continuous or discrete?\n\nRadioactive decay is a continuous process, so the exponential decay formula is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula with base 2 exponent.\n\nBut as I've shown, both methods lead to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing if I can recognize that 2 hours is 120 minutes, and 120 divided by 36 is approximately 3.333 half-lives.\n\nAnd then calculating the remaining amount accordingly.\n\nBut I've already done that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use a different formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options.\n\nBut based on my calculations, 1.00 gram is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider units.\n\nBut the half-life is in minutes, and time is in hours, but I converted hours to minutes, so units are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the decay constant is in different units.\n\nBut I used per minute for consistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have used per hour.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the issue.\n\nLet me try calculating lambda in per hour.\n\nFirst, convert half-life to hours.\n\n36 minutes is 36/60 = 0.6 hours.\n\nThen, lambda = ln(2) / 0.6 hours \u2248 1.155 per hour.\n\nThen, for t = 2 hours, amount left = 10.00 * e^(-1.155 * 2) = 10.00 * e^(-2.31) \u2248 10.00 * 0.1004 \u2248 1.004 grams.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is indeed 1.00 grams.\n\nThus, the correct option is A. 1.00 grams.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.00 \\text{ grams}} \\]"
