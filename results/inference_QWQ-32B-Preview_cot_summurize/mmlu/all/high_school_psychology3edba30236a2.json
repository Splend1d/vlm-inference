A. panic disorder, B. hypochondriasis, C. agoraphobia, D. post-traumatic stress disorder.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one doesn't belong to the anxiety disorder category.\n\nFirst, I know that anxiety disorders involve excessive fear or anxiety that interferes with a person's life. So, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Panic disorder: This is when someone has recurrent panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear that peak within minutes. Yeah, that sounds like an anxiety disorder.\n\nB. Hypochondriasis: This is when people are excessively worried about having a serious illness, even when there's no evidence to support it. I think this is related to anxiety because it's about excessive worry. So, probably an anxiety disorder.\n\nC. Agoraphobia: This is the fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available if things go wrong, like being in open spaces or public places. That seems like an anxiety disorder too.\n\nD. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This develops after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event, like combat, a natural disaster, or sexual assault. It includes symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety.\n\nNow, while PTSD involves anxiety and stress, I'm not sure if it's classified solely as an anxiety disorder. I think it might have its own category. Let me think about this.\n\nIn the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), anxiety disorders and trauma- and stressor-related disorders are separate categories. PTSD falls under trauma- and stressor-related disorders. So, perhaps PTSD is not considered purely an anxiety disorder.\n\nBut, PTSD does involve anxiety symptoms, so there might be some overlap. However, based on the DSM-5 classification, it's in a different category.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, PTSD might be the one that's not strictly an anxiety disorder.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nPanic disorder is definitely an anxiety disorder. Hypochondriasis, now often referred to as illness anxiety disorder, is also in the anxiety disorders category. Agoraphobia is also an anxiety disorder.\n\nSo, yes, PTSD is the one that doesn't fit into the anxiety disorder category, as it's classified under trauma- and stressor-related disorders.\n\nWait a minute, but in some older classifications, PTSD was considered an anxiety disorder. Maybe in DSM-IV it was, but in DSM-5, it's been reclassified.\n\nI should make sure which version of the DSM is being referred to here, but since DSM-5 is the latest, I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
