The patient loudly rants that he makes too much money to be subjected to treatment by a half-trained associate.

                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. There's a middle-aged businessman who's really upset because he had to see the dental hygienist instead of the dentist. He's making a big scene, saying he makes too much money to be treated by someone who's only half-trained. The clerk explains that he was 40 minutes late and the only opening now is with the hygienist. The patient replies that his time is worth more than anyone else's in the office.\n\nSo, we need to figure out which personality disorder this patient might be exhibiting based on his behavior and statements. The options are:\n\nA. Histrionic\n\nB. Narcissistic\n\nC. Paranoid\n\nD. Obsessive-compulsive\n\nFirst, let's recall what each of these personality disorders is characterized by.\n\nHistrionic personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior. People with this disorder often feel comfortable only when they're the center of attention and may use their physical appearance or behavior to get attention.\n\nNarcissistic personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of grandiosity, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy for others. People with this disorder often believe they're superior to others and entitlement to special treatment.\n\nParanoid personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of distrust and suspicion of others, where people with this disorder believe that others are out to harm them or take advantage of them.\n\nObsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of perfectionism, control, and orderliness, often at the expense of flexibility and openness. People with this disorder are preoccupied with details, rules, and efficiency.\n\nNow, looking back at the patient's behavior:\n\n- He's irate and creating a scene, which could suggest he's seeking attention, but let's see if there's more to it.\n\n- He's upset about seeing the hygienist instead of the dentist because he thinks he's too important due to his high income.\n\n- He's 40 minutes late but seems to think his time is more valuable than others in the office.\n\nThese behaviors suggest a sense of entitlement and an exaggerated sense of self-importance, which aligns with narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nLet's consider each option more closely.\n\nA. Histrionic: While the patient is creating a scene and seeking attention, the primary motivation seems to be related to his sense of entitlement and importance rather than just seeking attention for its own sake.\n\nB. Narcissistic: This seems to fit well with his behavior. He believes he deserves special treatment because of his status and wealth, and he's unwilling to accept seeing anyone other than the dentist, even though he was late.\n\nC. Paranoid: There's no indication here that the patient is suspicious or distrustful of others. He's angry about being made to see the hygienist, but that's more about his sense of entitlement than paranoia.\n\nD. Obsessive-compulsive: While he might be particular about who treats him, there's no information suggesting that he's preoccupied with details, rules, or perfectionism in a way that's characteristic of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.\n\nTherefore, the most likely personality disorder exhibited by this patient is narcissistic personality disorder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
