Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Prions - I think prions are misfolded proteins that can cause other proteins to misfold, like in mad cow disease. So, they're not DNA.\n\nB. Cistrons - I'm not entirely sure what cistrons are. I think they might be another term for genes, but I'm not positive.\n\nC. Introns - I know introns are parts of DNA that are transcribed into RNA but then spliced out before the final mRNA is made. They don't really move around in the genome.\n\nD. Transposons - I've heard of these before. They're often called \"jumping genes\" because they can move from one location in the genome to another.\n\nSo, based on what I know, transposons seem like the most likely answer. They are mobile DNA sequences that can insert themselves into different parts of the genome.\n\nBut let me double-check. Prions are proteins, not DNA, so that can't be right. Cistrons are units of genetic information, like genes, but they don't move around. Introns are parts of genes that get spliced out, but again, they don't typically move around in the genome. Transposons, on the other hand, are known for their ability to change position within the genome.\n\nI think the answer is D. Transposons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
