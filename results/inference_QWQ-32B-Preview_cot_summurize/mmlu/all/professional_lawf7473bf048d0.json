He contacted an architect, who designed plans and specifications for a major \"facelift\" of the homeowner's home. The homeowner was very pleased with the plans and specifications. He showed the plans and specifications to his neighbor, who agreed that the facelift would greatly enhance the value of the homeowner's home. The homeowner contacted a contractor, who was considered to be the best in the area, to rebuild his house according to the plans and specifications. The contractor reviewed the plans and specifications and told the homeowner that he could do all the work called for by the plans and specifications for $100,000. The homeowner replied, \"That's a little more than I can afford. I really can only free up $80,000 for this project. Would you do it for that amount?\" The contractor responded, \"That's awfully low. I'll have to think about it,\" and then left. The next day, the neighbor telephoned the contractor. The neighbor explained to the contractor that he realized the value of his home would be enhanced by the improvement done to the homeowner's property. For that reason, the neighbor told the contractor he would pay him $10,000 if he would accept the homeowner's proposal and do the work called for by the plans and specifications. The contractor agreed. The next day the contractor informed the homeowner that he would accept his $80,000 offer.

                    "text": "So here's this scenario about a homeowner, an architect, a contractor, and a neighbor, all involved in some home improvement project. Let's break it down step by step to understand what's going on and who should win in this breach of contract action.\n\nFirst, the homeowner wants to change his home's look and hires an architect to design plans and specs for a major facelift. He's pleased with the designs and even his neighbor thinks it'll enhance the home's value. So far, everything seems straightforward.\n\nNext, the homeowner contacts a contractor, known to be the best in the area, to execute the plans. The contractor reviews the plans and initially quotes $100,000 for the job. But the homeowner says he can only afford $80,000. The contractor finds this too low and needs to think about it.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. The neighbor steps in and calls the contractor, explaining that the improvement to the homeowner's property will enhance his own property value. So, the neighbor offers to pay the contractor $10,000 if he accepts the homeowner's $80,000 offer. The contractor agrees to this.\n\nThe next day, the contractor tells the homeowner he'll accept the $80,000 offer. He proceeds to do all the work as per the plans and specs, collects his $80,000, but the neighbor refuses to pay the promised $10,000. Now, the contractor is suing the neighbor for breach of contract. We need to decide who should win based on the given options.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says the contractor should win because his signing the contract with the homeowner and completing the work was legally sufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise to pay him $10,000.\n\nNow, consideration in contract law is something of value exchanged between parties. Typically, it's what each party promises to do or not do in exchange for the other's promise. Here, the neighbor promised to pay $10,000 to the contractor if he accepted the homeowner's $80,000 offer.\n\nBut was there sufficient consideration from the contractor to support the neighbor's promise? The contractor had already been negotiating with the homeowner and had initially quoted $100,000. When the homeowner offered $80,000, the contractor wasn't immediately agreeing; he said it was too low and needed to think about it.\n\nThen, the neighbor steps in and offers $10,000 to induce the contractor to accept the $80,000 offer. The contractor agrees to this. So, the neighbor's promise to pay $10,000 is in exchange for the contractor accepting the $80,000 job.\n\nNow, the question is whether the contractor's acceptance of the lower price is sufficient consideration for the neighbor's promise. In contract law, consideration must be something of value, and it must be bargained for.\n\nIn this case, the contractor is agreeing to perform the work for $80,000 instead of $100,000, which means he's giving up $20,000 in potential revenue. The neighbor is offering $10,000 to make up part of that difference. So, the contractor's consideration is his agreement to accept less money for the same work.\n\nThis seems like sufficient consideration because the contractor is suffering a detriment by accepting a lower price, and the neighbor is promising to compensate him for part of that loss.\n\nHowever, we need to consider if this promise is enforceable. There's a doctrine called \"pre-existing duty\" which holds that if someone promises to do something they're already obligated to do, that promise isn't sufficient consideration for a new contract.\n\nIn this case, once the contractor agreed to do the work for $80,000, he had a duty to perform the work as per the contract with the homeowner. So, if the neighbor promised to pay $10,000 for the contractor to perform his pre-existing duty, that might not be sufficient consideration.\n\nBut wait, the neighbor's promise was conditional on the contractor accepting the $80,000 offer, which was not yet accepted when the neighbor made the offer. So, the contractor was considering whether to accept a lower price, and the neighbor's offer influenced his decision.\n\nIn this context, the contractor's agreement to accept a lower price can be seen as new consideration for the neighbor's promise to pay $10,000.\n\nOption B says the contractor should win provided the neighbor realizes an increase in his property value as a result of the work done by the contractor.\n\nThis introduces the concept of benefit received, which is relevant in contract law. If the neighbor benefits from the contractor's work, that could strengthen the contractor's position.\n\nHowever, in contract law, the existence of a contract generally doesn't depend on whether one party actually benefits from the other's performance; it's about the mutual promises exchanged.\n\nSo, while the neighbor might benefit from the increased property value, that's not directly relevant to whether there was consideration for the neighbor's promise to pay $10,000.\n\nOption C says the neighbor should win because his promise to the contractor was illusory.\n\nAn illusory promise is one where the promisor doesn't actually commit to do anything. For example, if someone says, \"I might pay you if I feel like it,\" that's illusory because there's no binding obligation.\n\nIn this case, the neighbor promised to pay $10,000 if the contractor accepted the homeowner's $80,000 offer and performed the work. This seems like a clear and binding promise, not illusory.\n\nOption D says the neighbor should win because, at the moment the contractor accepted the homeowner's offer, he came under a pre-existing obligation, which is insufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise.\n\nThis ties back to the pre-existing duty rule. The contractor had negotiated with the homeowner and was considering accepting a lower price.\n\nWhen the neighbor offered $10,000 to induce the contractor to accept the lower price, and the contractor agreed, it's arguable that the contractor's agreement to accept less money is new consideration.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once the contractor agreed to the $80,000 contract, he had a pre-existing duty to perform the work, and the neighbor's promise to pay $10,000 for him to perform that duty isn't sufficient consideration.\n\nBut, considering that the neighbor's promise was made before the contractor finalized the agreement with the homeowner, and that the contractor's acceptance of the lower price was influenced by the neighbor's offer, it's plausible that the contractor's agreement to accept less money is sufficient consideration.\n\nMoreover, the neighbor's promise was conditional on the contractor accepting the lower price and performing the work, which suggests that there was a quid pro quo between the parties.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that option A is the most accurate: the contractor should win because his signing the contract with the homeowner and completing the work according to the plans and specifications was legally sufficient consideration to support the neighbor's promise to pay him $10,000.\n\nThe key here is that the contractor agreed to accept a lower price, suffering a detriment, in exchange for the neighbor's promise to pay $10,000. This exchange constitutes consideration in contract law, making the neighbor's promise enforceable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
