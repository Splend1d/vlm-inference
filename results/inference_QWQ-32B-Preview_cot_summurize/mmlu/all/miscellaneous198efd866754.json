                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out which of these minerals is the hardest on the Mohs scale. I remember that the Mohs scale is a way to measure the hardness of minerals, and it goes from 1 to 10, with 1 being the softest and 10 being the hardest.\n\nOkay, so let's list out the options:\n\nA. Corundum\n\nB. Quartz\n\nC. Apatite\n\nD. Calcite\n\nI think I need to recall where each of these minerals falls on the Mohs scale.\n\nStarting with corundum, I think that's a 9 on the Mohs scale. That's pretty hard. Quartz, I believe, is a 7. Apatite is, I think, a 5, and calcite is a 3. So, if I'm right, corundum is the hardest among these options.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. I know that diamonds are the hardest mineral, with a Mohs hardness of 10, but that's not in the list. So, between corundum at 9, quartz at 7, apatite at 5, and calcite at 3, corundum seems to be the hardest.\n\nMaybe I should remember some common reference points for the Mohs scale. For example, fingernail is about 2.5, copper penny is around 3, glass is around 5.5, and a steel file is around 6.5. So, quartz at 7 is harder than glass and steel file, apatite at 5 is softer than glass, and calcite at 3 is softer than a copper penny.\n\nBut to confirm, let me think about corundum. I know that corundum includes minerals like ruby and sapphire, which are very hard and durable stones used in jewelry and industry. So, it makes sense that it would be higher on the Mohs scale.\n\nQuartz is also pretty hard; it's used in a lot of industrial applications because of its hardness and resistance to wear. But according to the Mohs scale, it's lower than corundum.\n\nApatite is a mineral that's often used in phosphate fertilizers, and I recall that its hardness is around 5, which is medium on the scale.\n\nCalcite is even softer, with a hardness of 3. It's a common mineral found in limestone and marble, and it's relatively soft, scratching easily.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that corundum is the hardest among the options given.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
