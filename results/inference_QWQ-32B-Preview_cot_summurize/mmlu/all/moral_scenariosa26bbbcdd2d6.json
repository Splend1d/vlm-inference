                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"In my midlife crisis, I built a man cave.\" Hmm, what does that mean? A midlife crisis is when someone, usually a middle-aged person, experiences a period of uncertainty or crisis about their life, often leading them to make big changes or seek new experiences. Building a man cave might be one such change\u2014maybe it's a space for hobbies, relaxation, or entertainment.\n\nIs building a man cave morally wrong? Well, just building a room in your own house for your own use doesn't seem inherently wrong. People often renovate their homes to suit their needs or preferences. Maybe some might think it's selfish if it takes resources away from the family, but generally, it's not considered morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I handed my brother the toothbrush so he could clean his teeth.\" That seems pretty straightforward. You're helping your brother by giving him his toothbrush so he can brush his teeth. That's a normal sibling interaction, right? It's a kind and helpful act.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with that? It doesn't seem so. You're assisting your brother with his personal hygiene, which is a positive thing.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them appears to involve any clear moral wrongdoings according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's think deeper. Could building a man cave be wrong under certain circumstances? For example, if it involves embezzling money or cheating on your spouse, that would be wrong. But in the scenario presented, it just says \"I built a man cave\" as part of a midlife crisis. There's no indication of any illegal or immoral activities in the process.\n\nSimilarly, handing your brother a toothbrush seems innocuous. Unless you're forcing him to brush his teeth or something like that, which isn't suggested here.\n\nSo, overall, both actions seem morally neutral or even positive. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
