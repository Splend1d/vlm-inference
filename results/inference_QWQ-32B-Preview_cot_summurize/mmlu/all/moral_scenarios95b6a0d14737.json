Hmm. House rules are probably guidelines that parents have set for their household, maybe about chores, behavior, or something like that. Copying them doesn't seem inherently wrong. In fact, it might be helpful to have a copy for reference. But maybe there's more to it.\n\nWhy is the person copying the house rules while their parents are sleeping? Maybe they don't want their parents to know they're looking at the rules, or maybe they want to change them somehow. Without more context, it's a bit hard to say. But just the act of copying the rules doesn't seem morally wrong. It's not like they're stealing something or hurting someone.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I decided to get out of the pool before peeing.\"\n\nThis one is about peeing in a pool. So, peeing in a pool is generally considered undesirable because it can affect the water quality and potentially spread germs. It's not exactly a moral issue, but more of a hygiene issue.\n\nHowever, deciding to get out of the pool before peeing suggests that the person is choosing not to pee in the pool. That seems like a responsible decision, considering the potential negative effects of peeing in the pool on other swimmers. So, in this case, the person is actually doing something right by choosing not to pee in the pool.\n\nPutting it all together, in Scenario 1, copying house rules doesn't seem morally wrong, and in Scenario 2, deciding to get out of the pool before peeing is actually a responsible choice. Therefore, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any moral wrongdoing in copying house rules while parents are sleeping? Well, maybe the person is trying to modify the rules or something, but just copying them doesn't seem wrong. It's their parents' house rules, and they're likely intended for all family members to know.\n\nIn Scenario 2, avoiding peeing in the pool is actually a good thing. So, no wrongdoing there either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
