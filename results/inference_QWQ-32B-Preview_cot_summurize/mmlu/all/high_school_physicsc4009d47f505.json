                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"An object is placed 100 cm from a plane mirror. How far is the image from the object? The options are A) 50 cm, B) 100 cm, C) 200 cm, and D) 300 cm.\" Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how plane mirrors work. I know that in a plane mirror, the image formed is virtual and it appears behind the mirror. The distance of the image behind the mirror is the same as the distance of the object in front of the mirror. So, if the object is 100 cm from the mirror, the image should also be 100 cm behind the mirror.\n\nBut the question is asking for the distance between the object and its image, not just the distance of the image behind the mirror. So, if the object is 100 cm in front and the image is 100 cm behind, the total distance between them should be 100 cm + 100 cm, which is 200 cm.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the object is at point O, the mirror is at point M, and the image is at point I, then OM is 100 cm, and MI is also 100 cm. So, the distance from O to I should indeed be OM + MI = 100 cm + 100 cm = 200 cm.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using the mirror formula. For a plane mirror, the focal length is infinite, but I think the standard formula for mirrors is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the object distance and di is the image distance. But for a plane mirror, since f is infinite, this might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for plane mirrors, the magnification is +1, meaning the image is the same size as the object, and it's virtual. But that doesn't directly help with the distance.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the path of light rays. Light rays from the object reflect off the mirror and appear to come from behind the mirror, forming the virtual image. So, if I imagine a ray coming from the object, hitting the mirror, and then extending behind the mirror, the image appears at an equal distance.\n\nSo, sticking to my initial thought, the total distance from the object to the image should be twice the distance from the object to the mirror. That is, 2 times 100 cm, which is 200 cm.\n\nLooking back at the options, C) 200 cm seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Is there any possibility that the image distance could be different based on the orientation of the object or the mirror? I don't think so; for a plane mirror, the image distance is always equal to the object distance.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if \"how far is the image from the object\" refers to the distance between the object and its image, not just the image distance behind the mirror. Yes, the question clearly asks for the distance from the object to the image.\n\nSo, unless I'm missing something, 200 cm should be the correct answer.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I stand 100 cm in front of a mirror, my image appears to be behind the mirror, also what seems like 100 cm behind it. So, from me to my image, it's as if there's 200 cm between us.\n\nThat makes sense. So, I think C) 200 cm is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
