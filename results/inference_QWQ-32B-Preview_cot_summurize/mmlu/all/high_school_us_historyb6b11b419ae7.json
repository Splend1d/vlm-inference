Men who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will cheat a Negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a Negro they do not deem murder; to debauch a Negro woman they do not think fornication; to take the property away from a Negro they do not consider robbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own hands, to use their own classic expression, 'the niggers will catch hell.'\n\"The reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the blacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit that the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the war and the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just as their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\"\n\u2014Congressional testimony of Col.

                    "text": "I'm a bit confused here. The question is referring to a quote from Colonel Samuel Thomas in 1865 about the treatment of African Americans after emancipation, but then it asks about a specific development that contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15. Federalist #15 was written in 1787 by Alexander Hamilton, discussing the inadequacies of the Articles of Confederation and advocating for a stronger federal government.\n\nSo, there's a bit of a mismatch here because the quote is from the post-Civil War era, while Federalist #15 is from the period when the U.S. Constitution was being ratified. Maybe the question is asking about sentiments related to the need for a stronger central government, as expressed in Federalist #15, but in the context of post-emancipation America?\n\nLet me try to make sense of this. Federalist #15 highlights problems arising from the weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, such as inability to enforce laws, manage relations with foreign nations, and maintain national security. Similarly, the quote from Colonel Thomas describes a situation where there is widespread disregard for the rights of African Americans, with local whites treating freedmen according to their own interests without regard for federal laws or moral considerations.\n\nPerhaps the general sentiment being referred to is the inability of the federal government to enforce its laws and protect the rights of all citizens, which was also a concern expressed by Hamilton in Federalist #15. In that case, the question might be asking which of the developments listed contributed to the idea that a stronger federal government was needed to address such issues.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n\nThese all seem to be examples of foreign policy challenges faced by the early United States, which could indeed have contributed to the sentiment that a stronger federal government was necessary to deal with external threats and assert national sovereignty.\n\nHowever, given that the quote is about the treatment of African Americans after emancipation, perhaps the question is trying to draw a parallel between the need for a stronger federal government to handle external affairs in the 1780s and the need for a stronger federal government to enforce civil rights and oversee Reconstruction in the 1860s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the question, and it should be referring to a different document or period.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to consider which of these developments would have contributed to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, which argues for a stronger federal government due to the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nOption A, Britain's refusal to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region, was indeed a problem under the Articles of Confederation. The U.S. lacked the military strength and diplomatic clout to force Britain out of these forts, which were strategic points that could be used against American interests. This situation highlighted the need for a stronger federal government that could negotiate and enforce treaties effectively.\n\nOption B, Spanish forces retaking Florida from the United States, also points to difficulties in asserting national authority over territorial claims. The Articles of Confederation did not provide for an effective means to secure and govern territories, leading to such losses.\n\nOption C, French forces aiding American Indians in raids on New England, suggests problems with foreign interference in domestic affairs and difficulties in defending the nation's frontiers. Again, this points to the need for a stronger federal government to deal with external threats.\n\nOption D, Dutch traders forcing American ships to extend tribute payments, indicates issues with commerce and diplomacy. The weak central government under the Articles could not effectively protect American merchants or negotiate favorable trade terms.\n\nAll of these options could be seen as contributing to the general sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, which argues that the current government is inadequate and that a stronger union is necessary.\n\nHowever, since the question mentions a quote from 1865 about post-emancipation treatment of African Americans, perhaps there's a misalignment in the question itself. Maybe it's intended to relate to a different document or period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about developments that led to a similar sentiment of needing a stronger central government to address domestic issues, such as enforcing civil rights after the Civil War.\n\nIn that case, none of the options directly relate to post-emancipation America, as they all pertain to the late 18th century.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume that the question is simply asking about which development contributed to the sentiments expressed in Federalist #15, which argues for a stronger federal government due to the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nAmong the options, A seems most directly related, as Britain's refusal to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region was a prominent issue in the 1780s that demonstrated the weakness of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation.\n\nTherefore, I would choose A. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider each option again:\n\nA. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\nThis was a direct violation of the Peace of Paris treaty that ended the Revolutionary War, and it posed a significant threat to American security. The federal government under the Articles of Confederation was unable to compel Britain to comply with the treaty terms, highlighting the need for a stronger central government.\n\nB. Spanish forces retook Florida from the United States.\n\nThis also points to difficulties in asserting and maintaining national territory, which was a challenge under the Articles of Confederation due to the lack of a strong central authority.\n\nC. French forces aided American Indians in conducting raids on New England.\n\nThis suggests entanglements with foreign powers and domestic security issues that the weak federal government was unable to adequately address.\n\nD. Dutch traders forced American ships to extend tribute payments in order to dock in Holland.\n\nThis indicates problems with commerce and diplomacy, areas where the federal government under the Articles of Confederation lacked sufficient power to protect American interests.\n\nAll of these options could be seen as contributing to the sentiment expressed in Federalist #15, but option A is perhaps the most directly related and well-known issue of the post-Revolutionary period that demonstrated the need for a stronger federal government.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Great Britain refused to evacuate forts in the Great Lakes region.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
