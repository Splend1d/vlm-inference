                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** In a finite-dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a basis is. A basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that is both linearly independent and spans the vector space. In a finite-dimensional vector space, every basis has the same number of vectors, which is the dimension of the space.\n\nNow, consider a linearly independent set of vectors in such a space. Can this set be extended to a basis? I think yes, because if the set is already linearly independent, I can keep adding vectors to it, making sure that each new vector is not in the span of the previous ones, until the set spans the entire space. At that point, it becomes a basis.\n\nIs there any case where this wouldn't work? Maybe if the original set is already a basis, then it's already maximal in the sense that adding any other vector would make it linearly dependent. But in that case, the set is already contained in a basis\u2014it's contained in itself.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If B\u2081 and B\u2082 are bases for the same vector space, then |B\u2081| = |B\u2082|.\n\nThis sounds like it's getting at the idea that all bases for a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of elements, which is the definition of the dimension of the space.\n\nSo, if B\u2081 and B\u2082 are both bases for the same vector space, then indeed, they must have the same number of vectors, provided the space is finite-dimensional.\n\nBut the statement doesn't specify that the vector space is finite-dimensional. What if it's infinite-dimensional?\n\nIn infinite-dimensional vector spaces, bases can have different cardinalities, but in the context of linear algebra, when we talk about bases, we usually assume finite dimensions unless specified otherwise.\n\nHowever, to be precise, the statement as written doesn't specify finite-dimensionality, so in the general case, it's not necessarily true that |B\u2081| = |B\u2082| for bases of the same vector space if the space is infinite-dimensional.\n\nBut perhaps in the context of this question, we're supposed to assume finite-dimensionality. If that's the case, then Statement 2 is true.\n\nGiven that Statement 1 specifies \"finite-dimensional vector space,\" it's likely that Statement 2 is also intended to be in the context of finite-dimensional spaces.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\nSo, the answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
