Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"trying to make an opponent's argument seem ridiculous.\" Hmm, that sounds like maybe ad absurdum or something similar, but I think appeal to emotions is different.\n\nOption B: \"defending wrongdoing by claiming the opposing arguer does the same thing.\" That sounds more like the tu quoque fallacy, where someone dismisses criticism by accusing the critic of hypocracy.\n\nOption C: \"arguing that an argument should be rejected because the source of the argument.\" Wait, that seems incomplete. It should probably say \"because of the source of the argument.\" That might be appealing to authority or ad hominem, but not specifically appeal to emotions.\n\nOption D: \"trying to get someone else to agree to a claim only by arousing that person's feelings about the subject.\" Okay, this sounds like playing on someone's emotions to accept a conclusion without proper reasoning.\n\nSo, appeal to emotions, or emotional appeal, is a type of logical fallacy where someone tries to persuade others to accept a conclusion based on emotional responses rather than logical evidence or reasoning. It's about triggering feelings like fear, pity, anger, or happiness to influence opinion or decision, rather than presenting factual arguments.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to fit best. It directly states that the fallacy involves trying to get someone to agree to a claim by arousing their feelings about the subject, which aligns with the definition of appeal to emotions.\n\nOption A sounds more like a straw man fallacy, where you misrepresent someone's argument to make it easier to attack, perhaps by making it seem ridiculous.\n\nOption B, as I thought earlier, is more akin to the tu quoque fallacy, which is a red herring and ad hominem combined, where the argument is dismissed by accusing the other party of hypocrisy.\n\nOption C seems cut off, but if it's referring to arguing that an argument should be rejected based on the source, that's appealing to authority or genetic fallacy, depending on the context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D, as it accurately describes the fallacy of appeal to emotions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
