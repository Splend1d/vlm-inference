                    "text": "So I've got this audit question here about testing the existence assertion for property, plant, and equipment (PPE). I need to pick which procedure an auditor would most likely complete to test that the PPE recorded in the financial statements actually exists. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Obtaining a listing of all current-year additions, vouching significant additions to original invoices, and determining that they have been placed in service.\" Hmm, so this is about checking new additions to PPE. Vouching to original invoices would help confirm that these additions were actually purchased and that the costs are accurate. Also, checking if they've been placed in service suggests that the auditor is verifying that these assets are indeed in use and not just on paper. That sounds relevant to testing existence.\n\nOption B: \"Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring items are appropriately capitalized.\" A fixed-asset register is a list of all PPE, including details like acquisition cost, depreciation, and so on. Ensuring items are appropriately capitalized means making sure that expenditures are correctly classified as capital expenditures rather than expenses. While this is important for the financial statements, it might not directly test the existence of the assets. It's more about the classification and recording of expenditures.\n\nOption C: \"Obtaining a listing of current-year additions and verifying that items are recorded in the proper period.\" This seems similar to option A, but it's narrower. It's focused on making sure that additions are recorded in the correct accounting period, which is important for timing, but may not directly address whether the assets actually exist.\n\nOption D: \"Obtaining a detailed fixed-asset register and ensuring depreciation methods are applied consistently.\" This is about verifying that the company is using consistent methods for depreciating its assets. While consistency is important for comparability, it doesn't directly speak to whether the assets exist.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems to be the most directly related to testing the existence assertion. By obtaining a listing of current-year additions, vouching them to original invoices, and determining that they've been placed in service, the auditor is gathering evidence that these assets were actually acquired and are in use. This should provide reasonable assurance that the assets exist.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are more about the recording and classification of PPE, but not specifically about verifying their existence. So, I think A is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
