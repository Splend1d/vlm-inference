                    "text": "Let's see. I remember that NASA had a mission called NEAR, which stands for Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous. It was launched in 1996, and its main goal was to study near-Earth asteroids. Specifically, it was targeted to orbit and eventually land on an asteroid.\n\nNow, the question is about Valentine's Day 2000, and what asteroid the NEAR spacecraft began orbiting for a year. The options are Eros, Cupid, Aphrodite, and Venus.\n\nFirst, I know that Eros is an asteroid, and it was indeed the target of the NEAR mission. In fact, I think NEAR entered orbit around Eros on Valentine's Day, which is February 14, 2000. That seems to match the date in the question.\n\nCupid is also related to Valentine's Day, as Cupid is the god of desire and erotic love in Roman mythology, often depicted with a bow and arrow. However, I don't think Cupid is an asteroid.\n\nAphrodite is the Greek goddess of love and beauty, equivalent to Venus in Roman mythology. While there might be asteroids named after these goddesses, I don't recall them being associated with the NEAR mission.\n\nVenus is a planet, not an asteroid, so that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nGiven that, I believe the correct answer is A. Eros. The NEAR spacecraft, later renamed NEAR Shoemaker, entered orbit around the asteroid Eros on February 14, 2000, and went on to study it for about a year before landing on its surface in 2001.\n\nTo double-check, I recall that the NEAR mission was significant because it was the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid and also the first to land on one. Eros is a near-Earth asteroid, which aligns with the mission's name, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that the answer is Eros.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
