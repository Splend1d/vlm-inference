                    "text": "So I've got this partnership tax question here, and I need to figure out the proper tax treatment when the partnership sells land that one of the partners contributed. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, partner Acre contributed land with a fair market value (FMV) of $100,000 and a tax basis of $60,000 in exchange for a one-third interest in the partnership. The partnership agreement says that all partners will share equally in profits and losses.\n\nThen, the partnership sells that land to an unrelated third party for $160,000. I need to determine how the gain from this sale is allocated for tax purposes.\n\nOkay, so let's recall some partnership tax rules. When a partner contributes property to a partnership, the partnership takes on the tax basis of that property equal to the partner's basis, and the FMV at the time of contribution becomes the partnership's FMV basis.\n\nSo, in this case, the partnership's basis in the land is $60,000 (Acre's basis), and the FMV is $100,000.\n\nNow, the land is sold for $160,000. So, the gain on sale is $160,000 minus the partnership's basis of $60,000, which equals $100,000.\n\nNormally, in a partnership, gains and losses are allocated according to the partnership agreement. Here, the agreement says that profits and losses are shared equally among the partners. Since there are three partners (AQR), each partner would typically get one-third of the gain.\n\nHowever, there's a twist here because Acre contributed the land with built-in gain. The built-in gain is the difference between the FMV at contribution ($100,000) and the basis ($60,000), which is $40,000.\n\nIn partnership tax rules, when a partner contributes property with built-in gain, and that property is later sold, the built-in gain is allocated to the contributing partner to the extent of the gain recognized on the sale.\n\nSo, in this case, the built-in gain is $40,000, and the total gain on sale is $100,000. Therefore, $40,000 of the gain should be allocated to Acre, and the remaining $60,000 should be shared equally among all partners.\n\nWait, but let's check the options:\n\nA. Each partner reports a capital gain of $33,333.\n\nThis would be $100,000 divided by 3, which is $33,333 per partner. But this doesn't account for the built-in gain that should be allocated to Acre.\n\nB. The entire gain of $100,000 must be specifically allocated to Acre.\n\nThat doesn't sound right because only the built-in gain should be allocated to Acre, not the entire gain.\n\nC. The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners.\n\nThis seems partially correct, but it says the remaining $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners, meaning Acre doesn't share in that part.\n\nD. The first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining gain of $60,000 is shared equally by all the partners in the partnership.\n\nThis seems more accurate because it allocates the built-in gain to Acre and then shares the remaining gain equally among all partners.\n\nLet me double-check the rules. When a partner contributes property with built-in gain, and the property is sold, the built-in gain is allocated to the contributing partner. Any gain in excess of the built-in gain is allocated according to the partnership agreement.\n\nHere, the built-in gain is $40,000, and the total gain is $100,000, so $60,000 is in excess. Since the partnership agreement says profits and losses are shared equally, that $60,000 should be split among all three partners.\n\nTherefore, Acre gets $40,000 plus one-third of $60,000, which is $20,000, totaling $60,000. The other two partners each get one-third of $60,000, which is $20,000 each.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option D says the remaining $60,000 is shared equally by all partners, which would mean each partner gets $20,000 of that portion, plus Acre gets the additional $40,000, totaling $60,000 for Acre and $20,000 for each of the other partners.\n\nThat seems consistent with the rules.\n\nOption C says the remaining $60,000 is shared equally by the other two partners, which would mean they each get $30,000, and Acre gets $40,000. That would total $40,000 + $30,000 + $30,000 = $100,000, which is correct, but according to the partnership agreement, profits should be shared equally, which suggests that the excess gain should be divided among all partners equally.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. Is there any limitation on how the built-in gain is allocated?\n\nI think the key point is that the built-in gain is allocated to the contributing partner, and any gain in excess of that is allocated according to the partnership agreement.\n\nIn this case, the partnership agreement says profits and losses are shared equally, so the excess gain should be shared equally among all partners.\n\nTherefore, the first $40,000 of gain is allocated to Acre, and the remaining $60,000 is shared equally by all partners.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
