According to the World Bank data, Brazil's life expectancy in 2019 was approximately 74.7 years.\n\nNext, I'll check China's life expectancy for the same year. The World Bank indicates that China had a life expectancy of about 76.1 years in 2019.\n\nNow, for Mexico, the life expectancy in 2019 was around 75.6 years, based on World Bank figures.\n\nLastly, I'll find Iran's life expectancy in 2019. The World Bank data shows that Iran had a life expectancy of approximately 75.2 years that year.\n\nComparing these figures:\n\n- Brazil: 74.7 years\n\n- China: 76.1 years\n\n- Mexico: 75.6 years\n\n- Iran: 75.2 years\n\nAmong these, Brazil has the lowest life expectancy at 74.7 years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Brazil.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
