                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). I need to determine which of the statements are true regarding these functions in the context of ARIMA models.\n\nFirst, let's recall what ACF and PACF are:\n\n- **Autocorrelation Function (ACF):** Measures the linear dependence between observations at different time lags. It shows the correlation between the series and its lagged values.\n\n- **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):** Measures the direct correlation between observations at a particular lag, controlling for the correlations at all shorter lags. It helps identify the order of an AR model.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement (i): The ACF and PACF will always be identical at lag one whatever the model.**\n\nTo check this, let's consider the definitions and properties at lag one.\n\nAt lag one:\n\n- The ACF at lag one is simply the correlation between \\( y_t \\) and \\( y_{t-1} \\).\n\n- The PACF at lag one is also the correlation between \\( y_t \\) and \\( y_{t-1} \\), since there are no shorter lags to control for.\n\nTherefore, at lag one, ACF and PACF should indeed be identical regardless of the model.\n\nSo, statement (i) is true.\n\n**Statement (ii): The PACF for an MA(q) model will in general be non-zero beyond lag q.**\n\nFor an MA(q) model, the theoretical ACF cuts off after lag q, meaning that beyond lag q, the ACF is zero. However, the PACF for an MA(q) model typically tails off gradually and may not be zero beyond lag q.\n\nSo, in general, the PACF for an MA(q) model will not be zero beyond lag q, which means statement (ii) is true.\n\n**Statement (iii): The PACF for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p.**\n\nFor an AR(p) model, the theoretical PACF cuts off after lag p, meaning that beyond lag p, the PACF is zero. This is a key property used in identifying the order of an AR model.\n\nTherefore, statement (iii) is true.\n\n**Statement (iv): The ACF and PACF will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model.**\n\nFor an MA(1) model, the ACF and PACF have different behaviors:\n\n- The ACF for an MA(1) model tails off exponentially beyond lag one.\n\n- The PACF for an MA(1) model typically shows a gradual decline and may not be zero beyond lag one.\n\nTherefore, at lag two, the ACF and PACF for an MA(1) model are not necessarily the same. So, statement (iv) is false.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nSince statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true, and statement (iv) is false, the correct choice is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
