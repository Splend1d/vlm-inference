                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. Rich has two cardboard strips. One is 5/6 feet wide, and the other is 2/3 feet wide. The question is asking me to estimate the combined width of these two strips. And there are options to choose from: 2 feet, 1 and 1/2 feet, 1 foot, or 3 feet.\n\nAlright, so first things first, I need to understand what it's asking. It's not asking for an exact measurement, but an estimate. That means I don't need to do precise calculations; I just need to get a rough idea of what the total width would be.\n\nLet's look at the widths given: 5/6 feet and 2/3 feet. I need to add these two fractions to find the total width.\n\nBut since it's an estimation, maybe I can approximate these fractions to something simpler.\n\nLet's see, 5/6 is almost 1, right? Because 6/6 is 1, so 5/6 is just a bit less than 1.\n\nSimilarly, 2/3 is less than 1/2. Wait, is that right? Let me think. 1/2 of 6 is 3, so 2/3 is actually more than 1/2. Because 1/2 would be 3/6, and 2/3 is 4/6. Wait, no, that's not correct. 2/3 is actually equal to 4/6, and 1/2 is 3/6. So yes, 2/3 is more than 1/2.\n\nSo, 5/6 is almost 1, and 2/3 is a bit more than 1/2.\n\nIf I add almost 1 and a bit more than 1/2, that should be a little more than 1 + 0.5, which is 1.5 feet.\n\nLooking at the options, 1 and 1/2 feet is option B.\n\nBut wait, let me see if there's a better estimation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert both fractions to decimals to make it easier.\n\n5/6 is approximately 0.833 feet.\n\n2/3 is approximately 0.666 feet.\n\nAdding those up: 0.833 + 0.666 is about 1.499, which is almost 1.5 feet.\n\nSo, again, that points to option B, 1 and 1/2 feet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add the fractions directly.\n\n5/6 + 2/3.\n\nFirst, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 6 and 3. The least common denominator is 6.\n\nSo, 2/3 is equal to 4/6.\n\nTherefore, 5/6 + 4/6 = 9/6.\n\nSimplify 9/6, which is 1 and 3/6, which is 1 and 1/2 feet.\n\nSo, again, I get 1 and 1/2 feet.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 1 and 1/2 feet.\n\nBut the question is about estimation. Maybe there's a way to estimate it differently.\n\nLet's think about it differently. If I consider that 5/6 is roughly 0.8 and 2/3 is roughly 0.7, then 0.8 + 0.7 is 1.5, which is again 1 and 1/2 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of halves, 5/6 is a bit less than 1 (since 6/6 is 1), and 2/3 is about 0.67, which is less than 0.75.\n\nSo, again, adding them up gives roughly 1.5 feet.\n\nI don't see any reason to choose another option. The other options seem way off.\n\nOption A is 2 feet, which would be if both were around 1 foot each, but 5/6 and 2/3 are less than that.\n\nOption C is 1 foot, but adding 5/6 and 2/3 should be more than 1 foot.\n\nOption D is 3 feet, which is way too big, as even adding 5/6 and 2/3 doesn't reach 3 feet.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is 1 and 1/2 feet, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
