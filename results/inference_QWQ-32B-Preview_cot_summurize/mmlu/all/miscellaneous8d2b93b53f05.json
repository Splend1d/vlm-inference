                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these words can't be decoded just by knowing the sounds that letters make. The options are flight, said, things, and lamp. I think I need to look at each word and see if the spelling matches the sounds in a straightforward way.\n\nLet's start with \"flight.\" If I sound out each letter, it's f-l-i-g-h-t. But I know that in English, sometimes letters combine to make different sounds. Here, \"igh\" often makes a long i sound, like in \"high\" or \"light.\" So, if I know that \"igh\" says \"eye,\" then \"flight\" would be f plus igh (eye) plus ght (which might be silent or something). Actually, \"ght\" in \"flight\" is tricky because the \"h\" is silent, and the \"g\" and \"t\" might not be pronounced separately. So, maybe \"flight\" isn't completely straightforward.\n\nNext, \"said.\" This one is tricky because the \"a\" in \"said\" is pronounced like a short e sound, but the letter is \"a.\" So, if I just look at the letters, I might think it's pronounced \"sayed\" or \"sahid,\" but actually, it's \"said.\" So, there's a discrepancy between the spelling and the sound. That suggests that \"said\" can't be decoded just by knowing letter-sound relationships.\n\nNow, \"things.\" Let's break it down: t-h-i-n-g-s. The \"i\" and \"g\" together might be tricky. \"Ing\" often makes an \"ing\" sound, like in \"sing\" or \"ring.\" So, \"things\" would be \"th\" (like in \"think\") plus \"ing\" plus \"s\" for plural. So, if I know that \"ing\" makes that sound and \"th\" is a specific sound, then maybe \"things\" can be decoded through letter-sound relationships.\n\nLastly, \"lamp.\" L-a-m-p. Each letter seems to correspond to its standard sound: l, a short a, m, p. So, \"lamp\" should be straightforward to decode.\n\nComparing all these, \"said\" seems to be the word that doesn't match its pronunciation based on letter-sound relationships. \"Flight\" has some complexities, but if you know about \"igh\" and \"ght,\" you might be able to decode it. \"Things\" has \"ing,\" which is a common sound, and \"lamp\" is straightforward.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Said.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
