                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about taxicabs and their mileage. It says that the average miles driven per year is 75,000 with a standard deviation of 12,000 miles, and it's normally distributed. The question is asking for the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles, given that it's already known to have been driven over 80,000 miles. The options are A. 0.06, B. 0.34, C. 0.66, and D. 0.94.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. It's a conditional probability problem because it's asking for the probability of one event given that another event has occurred. In probability terms, it's P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000), where X is the miles driven.\n\nI recall that for normal distributions, we can use Z-scores to standardize the values and then use a Z-table to find probabilities. So, I think I need to find the Z-scores for 100,000 and 80,000 miles and then find the conditional probability between those two points.\n\nLet me first calculate the Z-scores.\n\nThe formula for Z-score is:\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the value\n\n- \u03bc is the mean\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation\n\nGiven:\n\n\u03bc = 75,000 miles\n\n\u03c3 = 12,000 miles\n\nFirst, Z-score for 100,000 miles:\n\nZ1 = (100,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 25,000 / 12,000 \u2248 2.083\n\nNext, Z-score for 80,000 miles:\n\nZ2 = (80,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 5,000 / 12,000 \u2248 0.417\n\nNow, I need to find P(X < 100,000 | X > 80,000), which is the same as P(Z < 2.083 | Z > 0.417).\n\nI know that conditional probability formula is:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B)\n\nIn this case:\n\nA is X < 100,000 (or Z < 2.083)\n\nB is X > 80,000 (or Z > 0.417)\n\nSo, P(Z < 2.083 | Z > 0.417) = P(Z < 2.083 and Z > 0.417) / P(Z > 0.417)\n\nThe intersection A \u2229 B is simply the area between Z = 0.417 and Z = 2.083.\n\nTherefore:\n\nP(Z < 2.083 | Z > 0.417) = [P(Z < 2.083) - P(Z < 0.417)] / [1 - P(Z < 0.417)]\n\nNow, I need to look up the Z-table for these values.\n\nFirst, find P(Z < 2.083). From the Z-table, for Z = 2.08, it's approximately 0.9812. Since 2.083 is a bit more, I'll take 0.9817 (interpolating if needed).\n\nNext, P(Z < 0.417). For Z = 0.41, it's about 0.6604. For Z = 0.42, it's 0.6628. So, for Z = 0.417, it should be around 0.6616.\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\nNumerator: 0.9817 - 0.6616 = 0.3201\n\nDenominator: 1 - 0.6616 = 0.3384\n\nTherefore, P(Z < 2.083 | Z > 0.417) = 0.3201 / 0.3384 \u2248 0.946\n\nRounding this, it's approximately 0.95.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 0.94, which is closest to my calculation.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, Z-scores:\n\nZ1 = (100,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 25,000 / 12,000 = 2.0833... okay, that's correct.\n\nZ2 = (80,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 5,000 / 12,000 = 0.4167... that's correct.\n\nZ-table values:\n\nFor Z = 2.08, P(Z < 2.08) = 0.9812\n\nFor Z = 2.09, P(Z < 2.09) = 0.9817\n\nSince 2.083 is closer to 2.08 than to 2.09, maybe I should take 0.9812.\n\nSimilarly, for Z = 0.41, P(Z < 0.41) = 0.6604\n\nFor Z = 0.42, P(Z < 0.42) = 0.6628\n\nSo, for Z = 0.417, it's between 0.6604 and 0.6628.\n\nLet me interpolate more accurately.\n\nThe difference between Z = 0.41 and Z = 0.42 is 0.0024 (0.6628 - 0.6604).\n\nSo, for Z = 0.417, which is 0.7 of the way from 0.41 to 0.42, the increase would be 0.7 * 0.0024 = 0.00168.\n\nTherefore, P(Z < 0.417) \u2248 0.6604 + 0.00168 = 0.66208.\n\nSimilarly, for Z = 2.083, between 2.08 and 2.09.\n\nDifference is 0.0005 (0.9817 - 0.9812).\n\nFor Z = 2.083, which is 0.3 of the way from 2.08 to 2.09, the increase would be 0.3 * 0.0005 = 0.00015.\n\nTherefore, P(Z < 2.083) \u2248 0.9812 + 0.00015 = 0.98135.\n\nNow, plug these back in:\n\nNumerator: 0.98135 - 0.66208 = 0.31927\n\nDenominator: 1 - 0.66208 = 0.33792\n\nTherefore, P(Z < 2.083 | Z > 0.417) = 0.31927 / 0.33792 \u2248 0.9447\n\nStill approximately 0.94.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 0.94.\n\nBut wait, let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the conditional probability in terms of standardizing the distribution given the condition.\n\nGiven that X > 80,000, the conditional distribution of X is normal with the same standard deviation but truncated below 80,000.\n\nBut that seems more complicated, and my initial approach seems to match the standard way to solve such problems.\n\nMoreover, the options provided seem to suggest that the answer is indeed around 0.94.\n\nTherefore, I think D. 0.94 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
