The question is asking what this is an example of, and the options are tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon, chunking, deductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon. I've heard of this before. It's when you feel like you're really close to remembering something, maybe a word or a name, but it just won't come to mind immediately. It's that frustrating sense where you know you know it, but it's just not accessible at that moment. So, in this case, Tonya couldn't recall the name when she saw her schoolmate, which sounds like tip-of-the-tongue.\n\nThen, there's chunking. I think that's a memory technique where you group information together to make it easier to remember. Like, remembering a phone number by breaking it into smaller parts, such as area code, first three digits, and last four. But in this scenario, there's no mention of grouping or organizing information in a particular way, so I don't think that's it.\n\nDeductive reasoning is when you start with general principles and apply them to a specific case to reach a logical conclusion. For example, if all men are mortal, and Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal. That doesn't seem related to remembering a name, so probably not that.\n\nInductive reasoning is the opposite, where you make broad generalizations from specific observations. Like, if you've seen many swans and they're all white, you might conclude that all swans are white. Again, not directly related to remembering a name.\n\nSo, going back to the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon, it fits the scenario where Tonya couldn't recall the name immediately but later remembered it out of the blue. It's that common experience where the memory seems to be just out of reach, and then suddenly pops into your mind later.\n\nI think the answer is A, the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
