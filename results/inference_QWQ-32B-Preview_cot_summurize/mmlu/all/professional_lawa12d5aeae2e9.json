                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about a camping trip gone wrong, and I need to figure out the defendant's strongest defense against a burglary charge. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what burglary is. Burglary typically involves entering a building without permission, usually with the intent to commit a crime inside, like theft. In this case, the defendant broke into a cabin, slept there, ate some food, and took a gold watch. So, it seems like he did enter without permission and took something valuable.\n\nNow, the defendant was intoxicated when he did all this. He was so drunk that he got lost and ended up at the cabin. He broke a window to get in and spent the night there. In the morning, he had breakfast and then took a watch from the bedroom.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. He was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\n\nB. The crime wasn't completed until the morning hours.\n\nC. He didn't have the requisite intent at the time of breaking and entering.\n\nD. The cabin was empty when he entered it.\n\nI need to figure out which of these is his strongest defense.\n\nOption A: He was drunk when he broke into the cabin.\n\nIntoxication can be a defense in some cases, but it's not always effective. In some jurisdictions, voluntary intoxication isn't a defense for general intent crimes, and burglary might be considered a general intent crime. So, this might not be the strongest defense.\n\nOption B: The crime wasn't completed until the morning hours.\n\nBurglary usually occurs at the moment of entry with the intent to commit a crime inside. So, even if the taking of the watch happened in the morning, the burglary was completed when he entered the cabin with the intent to commit a crime. This doesn't seem like a strong defense.\n\nOption C: He didn't have the requisite intent at the time of breaking and entering.\n\nThis seems promising. For burglary, there needs to be intent to commit a crime inside. If the defendant didn't have that intent when he broke in, maybe his defense could be that he only planned to take shelter for the night and didn't intend to steal anything until later.\n\nOption D: The cabin was empty when he entered it.\n\nWhether the cabin was occupied or not might not be directly relevant to the burglary charge. The ownership and occupancy status might not affect the legality of his entry or his intent.\n\nLet's think about option C in more detail. When he broke into the cabin, was his intent to commit a crime inside? At that point, he was just looking for shelter. He didn't plan to steal anything; he just wanted a place to sleep. The intent to steal seems to have come later, after he woke up and decided to take the watch.\n\nIn legal terms, if he didn't have the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry, that could potentially be a defense against burglary charges. However, if he formed the intent to steal after being inside, it might still constitute burglary.\n\nBut in many jurisdictions, the intent to commit a crime inside needs to be present at the time of entry for it to be considered burglary. So, if he didn't have that intent when he broke in, that could be a strong defense.\n\nComparing this with option A, intoxication might not excuse his actions, especially if he's voluntarily intoxicated. Whereas lacking the requisite intent at the time of entry could potentially exonerate him.\n\nOption B seems weak because burglary is generally considered complete upon entry with intent, not upon completing the intended crime.\n\nOption D about the cabin being empty might not be relevant to the charge of burglary, which focuses on unauthorized entry and intent to commit a crime, not on whether anyone was home.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the strongest defense for the defendant.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. He did take the watch eventually. So, even if he didn't have intent to steal when he broke in, he did form that intent later while inside.\n\nIn some legal systems, forming the intent to commit a crime while inside can still constitute burglary. So, this complicates things.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, burglary requires the intent to commit a crime at the time of entry. If the intent arises only after entry, it might not meet the definition of burglary.\n\nTherefore, arguing that he didn't have the intent to commit a crime at the time of breaking and entering could be his strongest defense.\n\nOption A, intoxication, might not hold up as well, especially since he was voluntarily intoxicated.\n\nSo, in conclusion, option C seems to be the best defense for the defendant in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
