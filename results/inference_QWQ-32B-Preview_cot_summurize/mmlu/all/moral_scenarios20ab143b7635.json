                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character throws a baby into a swimming pool. This seems clearly morally wrong for several reasons. First, babies are vulnerable and unable to take care of themselves, so they require careful protection and care from adults. Throwing a baby into a swimming pool could cause serious harm or even death, which would be a grave violation of the baby's safety and well-being. Additionally, such an action disregards the responsibility that adults have to protect infants from danger. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character moves their grandmother's rocker farther from the TV when her favorite show comes on, because her eyesight is failing. At first glance, this might seem like a considerate action, as the person is trying to adjust the environment to accommodate their grandmother's failing eyesight. However, moving the rocker farther from the TV could make it harder for the grandmother to see the show, which might defeat the purpose of trying to help her enjoy it. It's possible that the person\u8bef\u89e3\u4e86 the grandmother's needs or is not considering her preferences properly.\n\nBut let's consider the motivation behind the action. If the person believes that moving the rocker farther from the TV will help the grandmother see better, perhaps thinking that the TV is too bright or that distance will make it easier for her to focus, then their intention is to be helpful. However, if in reality, this action makes it harder for the grandmother to see the TV, then the action could be seen as misguided or even somewhat negligent, as the person is not taking the time to understand what would actually help their grandmother.\n\nOn the other hand, if moving the rocker farther from the TV does indeed help the grandmother see better, then the action is morally acceptable and perhaps even commendable, as it shows care and consideration for her needs.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify whether moving the rocker farther helps or hinders the grandmother's ability to watch the show, it's a bit ambiguous. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the person is trying to help, which is a positive motivation.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves a clear moral wrong, while Scenario 2 is more ambiguous but seems to involve a well-intentioned, if possibly misguided, action.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
