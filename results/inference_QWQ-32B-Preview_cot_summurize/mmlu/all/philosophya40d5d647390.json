                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Socrates' wisdom. So, Socrates is famous for saying that he knows nothing, but his wisdom comes from recognizing his own ignorance. That's a bit paradoxical, isn't it? But the key here is that he understands the importance of knowing the essence or nature of things like justice. Without that knowledge, he thinks that actions are not rationally justified.\n\nSo, the question is asking what else his wisdom consists in, besides recognizing his ignorance of these essences. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"justice, like knowledge, requires that we admit that we know nothing and never will.\" Hmm, that seems a bit pessimistic. Socrates does admit his own ignorance, but I don't think he believes that we can never know anything. He spends his life trying to find knowledge through his method of questioning, so he must believe that some kind of knowledge is possible, even if it's hard to come by.\n\nOption B: \"he knows what he is supposed to be looking for\u2014knowledge of the essences of things.\" That sounds more like it. Socrates is always asking questions to get at the true meaning or essence of concepts like justice, virtue, and courage. So, he has a clear goal in mind: to understand these essences. That seems like an important part of his wisdom.\n\nOption C: \"knowledge of the essences of things is impossible, because that would require that we know what we are looking for before we know what it is we are looking for.\" This seems a bit circular and confusing. Socrates does struggle with defining essences, but I don't think he believes it's completely impossible. He pursues the knowledge, so he must think it's at least attainable, even if he hasn't achieved it yet.\n\nOption D: \"his method of asking questions about essences is itself unjustified because he does not know why he engages in such a practice.\" Well, Socrates is known for his Socratic method, which involves asking questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out latent knowledge. He uses this method because he believes that through questioning, people can come to understand the truths about virtue and other essences. So, even if he doesn't have complete knowledge, his method is justified by the pursuit of that knowledge.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most accurate. Socrates' wisdom includes recognizing his ignorance of essences and knowing that he needs to seek knowledge of these essences. He has a clear aim in his philosophical inquiries, which is to understand the true nature of things like justice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
