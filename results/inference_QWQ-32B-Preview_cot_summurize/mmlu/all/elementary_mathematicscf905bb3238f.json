Since 6 goes into 7 once (because 6*1=6), you write down 1 and subtract 6 from 7, which leaves you with 1.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 16.\n\nNow, see how many times 6 goes into 16. 6 goes into 16 two times (because 6*2=12), so you write down 2 and subtract 12 from 16, which leaves you with 4.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 42.\n\nSee how many times 6 goes into 42. 6 goes into 42 seven times (because 6*7=42), so you write down 7 and subtract 42 from 42, which leaves you with 0.\n\nSo, 762 divided by 6 equals 127.\n\nTherefore, each team has 127 students.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 110\n\nB. 120\n\nC. 127\n\nD. 137\n\nThe correct answer is C. 127.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{127} \\]"
