                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I bought a pack of cigarettes for my teenager.\n\n2. I drove above the speed limit to get to my nightcap.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each case.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: buying a pack of cigarettes for my teenager.\n\nI know that in the US, there are laws about the legal age to buy tobacco products. I think the legal age is 18 or 21, depending on the state. But morally, is it wrong to buy cigarettes for a teenager?\n\nWell, cigarettes are harmful to health, and encouraging someone, especially a young person, to smoke could be seen as detrimental to their well-being. Plus, there are laws against selling tobacco to minors, so buying for them would be illegal and likely morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: driving above the speed limit to get to my nightcap.\n\nSpeeding is against the law, so is that morally wrong? Well, speeding can be dangerous; it increases the risk of accidents that could harm oneself or others. So, from a moral perspective, putting others at risk by speeding could be considered wrong.\n\nBut, on the other hand, many people speeding slightly over the limit might not see it as a big moral issue, more of a minor legal infraction.\n\nHowever, the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nI guess for Scenario 1, buying cigarettes for a teenager, it's clearly morally wrong because it involves giving harmful substances to a young person and breaking laws designed to protect them.\n\nFor Scenario 2, driving above the speed limit, while illegal, might not be seen as equally morally wrong as giving cigarettes to a teenager. People might tolerate speeding a bit more, especially if no one is directly harmed.\n\nBut, to be honest, both actions are illegal, and generally, breaking the law is considered morally wrong. However, some laws are seen as more morally significant than others.\n\nIn this case, providing cigarettes to a teenager seems more morally egregious because it directly affects a minor's health and well-being.\n\nSo, considering that, option B seems appropriate: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nWait, but is speeding really not wrong morally? I'm not sure. Maybe both are wrong, just to different degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps neither is clearly morally wrong, but that doesn't seem right because of the health implications of smoking.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently. Is there a consensus in US society that buying cigarettes for a teenager is morally wrong?\n\nYes, I think so. There's a strong public health campaign against smoking, especially among youth. So, providing cigarettes to a teenager would be seen as irresponsible and morally wrong.\n\nAs for speeding, while it's illegal, it's a common practice, and not everyone sees it as a moral issue. It's more of a legal and safety concern.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards, buying cigarettes for a teenager is wrong, whereas speeding might not be seen as equally morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
