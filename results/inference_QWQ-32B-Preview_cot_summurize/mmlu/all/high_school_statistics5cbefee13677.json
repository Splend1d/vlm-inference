This is because larger samples provide more information about the population, reducing uncertainty.\n\n2. **Confidence Level:** The confidence level determines the critical value (z-score or t-score) used in calculating the margin of error. Higher confidence levels correspond to larger critical values, which in turn lead to wider confidence intervals. This is because higher confidence requires capturing more of the possible values, thus widening the interval.\n\nGiven these relationships:\n\n- A larger sample size tends to narrow the confidence interval.\n\n- A higher confidence level tends to widen the confidence interval.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Small sample size and 95% confidence:**\n\n- Small n: Larger margin of error.\n\n- 95% confidence: Moderate critical value.\n\n- Overall: Likely a wider interval due to small sample size.\n\nB. **Small sample size and 99% confidence:**\n\n- Small n: Larger margin of error.\n\n- 99% confidence: Higher critical value.\n\n- Overall: Even wider interval compared to option A due to both small n and higher confidence level.\n\nC. **Large sample size and 95% confidence:**\n\n- Large n: Smaller margin of error.\n\n- 95% confidence: Moderate critical value.\n\n- Overall: Narrower interval compared to options A and B.\n\nD. **Large sample size and 99% confidence:**\n\n- Large n: Smaller margin of error.\n\n- 99% confidence: Higher critical value.\n\n- Overall: Wider than option C but narrower than options A and B.\n\nBetween options C and D, option C has a lower confidence level, which means a smaller critical value, leading to a smaller margin of error and thus a narrower confidence interval.\n\nTherefore, the narrowest confidence interval would be achieved with a large sample size and 95% confidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
