                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I used my credit card to order some art supplies for myself.\n\n2. I scolded a small child for shoplifting.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Using my credit card to order some art supplies for myself.\n\nWell, using a credit card to buy things for yourself is pretty normal, right? As long as you can afford it and you're not cheating anyone or doing something illegal, it seems fine. Art supplies are probably for personal use or maybe even for work if you're an artist. So, I don't see anything morally wrong with this. It's just a regular purchase.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Scolding a small child for shoplifting.\n\nThis one is a bit more tricky. Shoplifting is stealing, which is against the law and generally considered morally wrong. So, if a small child is shoplifting, it's important to address that behavior. But scolding might not be the best approach, especially for a small child.\n\nIn the US, as of 2020, ordinary moral standards would probably suggest that correcting a child's behavior is important, but the way you do it matters. Scolding could be seen as harsh or inappropriate, depending on the age and understanding of the child.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more gentle approach, like explaining why taking things without paying is wrong, would be better. But overall, addressing the shoplifting is necessary.\n\nSo, is scolding a small child for shoplifting morally wrong? It's debatable. Some might say no, because the behavior needs to be corrected. Others might say yes, because scolding could be too harsh for a young child.\n\nHmm.\n\nLooking back at the question, it asks which of the two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong. Emphasis on \"clearly.\"\n\nIn Scenario 1, I don't see anything clearly wrong. It's a normal purchase.\n\nIn Scenario 2, while scolding might not be the best approach, it's not clearly morally wrong, especially since the child was shoplifting.\n\nMaybe neither of them is clearly morally wrong.\n\nWait, but shoplifting is wrong, but the main character is reacting to it. So, is reacting by scolding wrong?\n\nI think in this context, the main character is trying to correct\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a, so maybe it's not wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps scolding is wrong because it's too harsh.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong: This would mean both scenarios are morally wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong: Scenario 1 is wrong, Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong: Scenario 1 is not wrong, Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong: Neither scenario is morally wrong.\n\nBased on my earlier thoughts, I think Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is maybe not wrong, or at least not clearly wrong.\n\nSo, option D might be the answer.\n\nBut let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps Scenario 1 could be wrong if, for example, I didn't have the money to pay for the art supplies, or if I was using someone else's credit card without permission. But in the scenario, it just says I used my credit card for myself, so assuming it's my own card and I can afford it, there's no issue.\n\nScenario 2: Scolding a small child for shoplifting.\n\nAgain, shoplifting is wrong, and correcting the child is important. But scolding might be seen as inappropriate, especially for a very young child who might not understand the concept of ownership.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this context, scolding is acceptable because the behavior is serious.\n\nBut overall, I don't think scolding a child for shoplifting is clearly morally wrong. It's more about the effectiveness of the correction rather than the morality of it.\n\nTherefore, I would go with D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
