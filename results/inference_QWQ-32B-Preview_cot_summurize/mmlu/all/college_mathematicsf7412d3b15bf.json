                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a circle C in the yz-plane with the equation \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\). This circle is being revolved around the z-axis to generate a torus, and we need to find the equation of this torus from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to revolve this circle around the z-axis. Revolving a shape around an axis creates a surface of revolution. In this case, since we're revolving a circle in the yz-plane around the z-axis, we should get a torus (a doughnut shape) where the circular cross-section is perpendicular to the z-axis.\n\nLet me recall the general equation of a torus. A standard torus generated by revolving a circle of radius \\(r\\) centered at \\((R, 0, 0)\\) around the z-axis can be described by the equation:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2\\]\n\nBut in this problem, the circle is in the yz-plane, and its center is at \\((0, 3, 0)\\), with radius 1. So, the setup is a bit different from the standard torus equation I just recalled.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, the circle is in the yz-plane centered at \\((0, 3, 0)\\) with radius 1. When we revolve this around the z-axis, the distance from the z-axis to the center of the circle is 3 units (since the center is at \\(y=3\\), and the z-axis is at \\(y=0, x=0\\)).\n\nSo, in this scenario, the major radius \\(R\\) of the torus is 3, and the minor radius \\(r\\) is 1.\n\nTherefore, the general equation of this torus should be:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2\\]\n\nPlugging in \\(R = 3\\) and \\(r = 1\\):\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nBut I need to verify if this is indeed the correct equation and see which of the given options matches this.\n\nLet me expand this equation to see if it matches any of the options.\n\nFirst, expand \\((\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 3)^2\\):\n\n\\[(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9 + z^2 = 1\\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + 9 + z^2 - 1 = 0\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 - 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + z^2 + 8 = 0\\]\n\nHmm, this doesn't directly match any of the given options. Maybe I need to manipulate it further.\n\nLet me isolate the square root term:\n\n\\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8 = 6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\]\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n\\[(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = (6\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2\\]\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n\\[(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\\]\n\nLooking at the options, this matches option C.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can use cylindrical coordinates, since we're dealing with revolution around the z-axis. In cylindrical coordinates, \\(x = \\rho \\cos\\theta\\), \\(y = \\rho \\sin\\theta\\), and \\(z = z\\). The equation of the circle in the yz-plane is \\((y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\\).\n\nWhen we revolve this around the z-axis, each point on the circle traces out a circle in the xy-plane with radius equal to its y-coordinate.\n\nAlternatively, I can parameterize the torus. The circle in the yz-plane can be parameterized as:\n\n\\[y = 3 + \\cos\\phi\\]\\[z = \\sin\\phi\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\phi\\) is the parameter for the circle.\n\nThen, revolving this around the z-axis introduces another angle \\(\\theta\\), and the parametric equations for the torus are:\n\n\\[x = (3 + \\cos\\phi) \\cos\\theta\\]\\[y = (3 + \\cos\\phi) \\sin\\theta\\]\\[z = \\sin\\phi\\]\n\nBut I need to eliminate the parameters to get the Cartesian equation.\n\nThis seems more complicated than the earlier approach, so perhaps sticking with the expanded equation is better.\n\nGiven that, the equation \\((x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 8)^2 = 36(x^2 + y^2)\\) matches option C, so I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ (x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} + 8)^{2} = 36(x^{2} + y^{2}) } \\]"
