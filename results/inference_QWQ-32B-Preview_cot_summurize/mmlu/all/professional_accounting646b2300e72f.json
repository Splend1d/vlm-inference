                    "text": "To determine Gulde's basis in the land received from Chyme Partnership, we need to follow the steps for calculating the basis of property received in a liquidating distribution from a partnership.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when a partner receives a liquidating distribution, the partner's basis in the partnership is allocated between the cash and the property received. The basis of the property received is generally its adjusted basis to the partnership, but there are specific rules to follow.\n\nGiven:\n- Gulde's tax basis in Chyme Partnership: $26,000\n- Liquidating distribution:\n  - Cash: $12,000\n  - Land: Adjusted basis to Chyme: $10,000, Fair market value: $30,000\n\nStep 1: Determine the total distribution received by Gulde.\nTotal distribution = Cash + Adjusted basis of land\nTotal distribution = $12,000 + $10,000 = $22,000\n\nStep 2: Compare the total distribution to Gulde's basis in the partnership.\nGulde's basis: $26,000\nTotal distribution: $22,000\n\nSince the total distribution ($22,000) is less than Gulde's basis ($26,000), Gulde has a loss on the liquidation.\nLoss = Basis - Total distribution\nLoss = $26,000 - $22,000 = $4,000\n\nStep 3: Allocate Gulde's basis to the cash and the land received.\nThe basis is allocated in proportion to the fair market value of the cash and the property received.\n\nFair market value of cash: $12,000\nFair market value of land: $30,000\nTotal fair market value: $12,000 + $30,000 = $42,000\n\nAllocation to cash:\n(Basis * Fair market value of cash) / Total fair market value\n= ($26,000 * $12,000) / $42,000\n= ($312,000) / $42,000\n= $7,428.57 (approximately)\n\nAllocation to land:\n(Basis * Fair market value of land) / Total fair market value\n= ($26,000 * $30,000) / $42,000\n= ($780,000) / $42,000\n= $18,571.43 (approximately)\n\nStep 4: Determine Gulde's basis in the land.\nGulde's basis in the land is the allocated basis from the partnership, which is $18,571.43.\n\nHowever, there is a limitation based on the adjusted basis of the land to the partnership. The basis of property received in liquidation cannot exceed the partnership's adjusted basis in that property.\n\nPartnership's adjusted basis in land: $10,000\nAllocated basis to land: $18,571.43\n\nTherefore, Gulde's basis in the land is limited to the partnership's adjusted basis of $10,000.\n\nBut wait, there's more to consider. According to IRS rules, when a partner receives property in liquidation, the basis of the property is generally its adjusted basis to the partnership, but if the partner's basis in the partnership is less than the sum of the basis of the property and the cash received, then the basis of the property is reduced.\n\nIn this case, Gulde's basis is $26,000, and the total distribution is $22,000, which is less than the basis. So, there is a loss of $4,000, but the basis in the land is still limited to the partnership's adjusted basis of $10,000.\n\nHowever, there is another consideration: the concept of \"inside basis\" and \"outside basis.\" The outside basis is the partner's basis in the partnership, which is $26,000. The inside basis is the partnership's basis in its assets.\n\nGiven that Chyme did not have unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or properties contributed by its partners, we can assume that the inside basis is straightforward.\n\nThe land's adjusted basis to Chyme is $10,000, and its fair market value is $30,000. When Gulde receives the land, his basis in the land is generally the partnership's adjusted basis of $10,000.\n\nBut, because the total distribution is less than his basis, he has a loss, and his basis in the land cannot exceed the partnership's adjusted basis in the land.\n\nTherefore, Gulde's basis in the land is $10,000.\n\nWait, but according to the allocation based on fair market value, the allocated basis to the land was $18,571.43, but it is limited to the partnership's adjusted basis of $10,000.\n\nSo, the correct basis is $10,000.\n\nBut let's check the regulations to be sure.\n\nAccording to IRS Publication 541, for liquidating distributions, the basis of property received is generally its adjusted basis to the partnership, but the partner's basis in the property cannot exceed the partner's basis in the partnership reduced by the cash received.\n\nIn this case:\nPartner's basis - Cash received = $26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000\n\nSo, Gulde's basis in the land cannot exceed $14,000.\n\nHowever, the partnership's adjusted basis in the land is $10,000, which is less than $14,000.\n\nTherefore, Gulde's basis in the land is $10,000.\n\nWait, but there is a loss of $4,000, which might affect the basis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is $14,000.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nUnder IRC Section 732, for a liquidating distribution, the partner's basis in the property received is the lesser of:\n\na) The partnership's adjusted basis in the property, or\n\nb) The partner's basis in the partnership immediately before the distribution, reduced by the amount of cash received.\n\nIn this case:\n\na) Partnership's adjusted basis in land: $10,000\n\nb) Partner's basis before distribution: $26,000\n\nLess: Cash received: $12,000\n\n= $14,000\n\nTherefore, the basis in the land is the lesser of $10,000 or $14,000, which is $10,000.\n\nSo, Gulde's basis in the land is $10,000.\n\nBut, considering the loss, perhaps there is an adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is increased by the loss.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the basis is $14,000, but limited to the partnership's basis of $10,000, so $10,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different rule.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nAccording to IRC Section 732(a), the basis of property received in liquidation is the lesser of:\n\n1. The partnership's adjusted basis in the property, or\n\n2. The partner's basis in the partnership reduced by the amount of money received.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nPartnership's adjusted basis in land: $10,000\n\nPartner's basis reduced by cash received: $26,000 - $12,000 = $14,000\n\nTherefore, the basis in the land is $10,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be $10,000.\n\nBut let's consider if there is any other factor that could affect this.\n\nGiven that Chyme did not have unrealized receivables, appreciated inventory, or properties contributed by its partners, we can assume that there are no other adjustments to the basis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $10,000.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. $0\n\nB. $10,000\n\nC. $14,000\n\nD. $30,000\n\nOption B is $10,000, which matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since the partner's allocated basis to the land was $18,571.43, but it is limited to the partnership's adjusted basis of $10,000, the answer should be $10,000.\n\nAlternatively, some might think that the basis should be $14,000, but according to the code, it's the lesser of the two amounts, which is $10,000.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
