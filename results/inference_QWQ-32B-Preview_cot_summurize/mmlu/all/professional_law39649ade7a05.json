The mortgage instrument, which was recorded in 1956, recited that it was subordinate to a mortgage on the same land given by the son to an investor in 1936 and recorded in 1936.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to sort through this real estate transaction mess. There are a lot of players and transactions here, so I need to keep track of who did what and when.\n\nFirst, in 1888, there's a landowner who owns a dairy farm. In 1938, he conveys the property to his son. Then, in 1953, the son conveys the dairy farm to his friend, but the deed isn't recorded until after the son dies in 1957. In 1956, the son mortgages the farm to a bank, and this mortgage is recorded in 1956. Importantly, this mortgage says it's subordinate to a earlier mortgage from 1936 to an investor, which was recorded in 1936. So, there's an older mortgage from 1936 that apparently still exists.\n\nFast forward to 1979, the friend conveys the dairy farm to a farmer, and this deed is recorded, but it doesn't mention any mortgages. Then, in 2008, the farmer agrees to sell the farm to a buyer for $75,000, with closing on January 15, 2009. The buyer gets a general warranty deed with specific covenants: seisin, right to convey, and against encumbrances.\n\nAfter taking possession, the buyer learns about the 1936 mortgage to the investor, which hasn't been satisfied, and wants to sue the farmer for breach of the covenant against encumbrances.\n\nOkay, so the question is, should judgment be for the buyer or the farmer, and under what conditions?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a covenant against encumbrances is. It's a promise by the seller that the property is free from any liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances that aren't disclosed. In this case, there's an old mortgage from 1936 that's still out there, and it wasn't mentioned in the deed from the friend to the farmer in 1979, and presumably not disclosed to the buyer in 2009.\n\nNow, this jurisdiction has a notice-type recording statute and follows a title theory for mortgages. In a notice recording statute state, for a subsequent purchaser to be protected against prior interests, they need to have no notice of those prior interests at the time of purchase. Title theory means that the mortgagor still holds legal title to the property, and the mortgagee has a lien on the title.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\n- The son mortgaged the property to the investor in 1936, recorded in 1936.\n\n- The son conveyed to his friend in 1953, deed not recorded until after the son's death in 1957.\n\n- The son mortgaged to the bank in 1956, recorded in 1956, subordinating to the 1936 mortgage.\n\n- Friend conveys to farmer in 1979, deed recorded but doesn't mention the mortgage.\n\n- Farmer conveys to buyer in 2009, general warranty deed with covenants including against encumbrances.\n\nThe buyer is claiming breach of the covenant against encumbrances due to the existing 1936 mortgage.\n\nNow, in a notice recording statute state, if the buyer had notice of the prior mortgage, they can't claim breach. But if they had no notice, they might be able to.\n\nHowever, in this case, the buyer learned about the 1936 mortgage after taking possession, which suggests that at the time of purchase, they may not have had actual notice. But in a notice statute state, constructive notice from recording also applies.\n\nWait, but the 1936 mortgage was recorded in 1936, so anyone searching the title would have found it. Therefore, the buyer had constructive notice of the 1936 mortgage, even if they didn't actually know about it at the time of purchase.\n\nGiven that, the buyer likely can't claim breach of the covenant against encumbrances, because they had constructive notice of the mortgage due to its recording.\n\nBut let's look at the options:\n\nA. The buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances is a guarantee to the grantee that the property is not subject to outstanding rights or interests.\n\nB. The buyer, because the covenant against encumbrances would be breached at the time the deed was delivered, thereby entitling the covenantee to recover damages.\n\nC. The farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.\n\nD. The farmer, unless the covenantee is disturbed in his actual enjoyment of the land thereby conveyed.\n\nHmm.\n\nOption A seems to correctly state what the covenant against encumbrances is, but doesn't address the notice issue.\n\nOption B says the covenant is breached at the time of deed delivery, entitling the buyer to damages. But in notice recording states, the buyer's knowledge (actual or constructive) affects their rights.\n\nOption C suggests that the farmer wins because any breach would only occur at the time of conveyance, implying that since the encumbrance existed then, the buyer can't claim breach now. But that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D seems to suggest that the buyer only has a claim if they're actually disturbed in their enjoyment of the land, which might not be the case here since the mortgage exists but isn't necessarily affecting possession.\n\nI think the key here is the notice aspect. Since the 1936 mortgage was recorded, the buyer had constructive notice of it, which may bar them from claiming breach of the covenant against encumbrances.\n\nTherefore, judgment should be for the farmer, because the buyer had constructive notice of the encumbrance due to its recording, and thus can't claim breach.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The farmer, because the covenant against encumbrances may only be breached, if at all, at the time of conveyance.\n\nWait, but that doesn't fully capture the notice aspect. Maybe D is better, but I think C is the closest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's D, because the buyer isn't necessarily being disturbed in their enjoyment of the land by the mortgage, but I'm not sure.\n\nUpon further thought, I think C is the better answer because it recognizes that any breach would have occurred at the time of conveyance, and the buyer, having constructive notice, cannot now claim breach.\n\nSo, I'll go with C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
