It provided that the price for the system, which would be delivered on June 1, would be $110,000. The written agreement, a lengthy form contract, did not contain a merger clause. The seller delivered the system on June 1, but the buyer refused to pay more than $100,000, citing the earlier oral agreement as to price.

No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\nB. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\nC.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this contract law scenario. So, we've got a buyer and a seller negotiating an industrial air-conditioning system purchase. They start with an oral agreement on a $100,000 price, but keep negotiating and eventually sign a written agreement setting the price at $110,000 for delivery on June 1. The written agreement is detailed and doesn't have a merger clause. The seller delivers on time, but the buyer refuses to pay more than $100,000, sticking to the oral agreement, and the seller sues for the extra $10,000.\n\nThe question is whether the court is likely to admit evidence of the oral agreement pricing at $100,000. We've got four options:\n\nA. No, because the buyer assumed the risk of any mistake as to price.\n\nB. No, because the oral price term would contradict an express term in the written agreement.\n\nC. Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\n\nD. Yes, because the written agreement did not contain a merger clause.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a merger clause is. A merger clause, also known as an integration clause, states that the written contract is the final and complete agreement between the parties, and it supersedes any prior oral or written agreements. Since the written agreement here doesn't have a merger clause, that might suggest that prior agreements could still have some relevance.\n\nOption A talks about the buyer assuming the risk of any mistake as to price. This seems vague and doesn't directly relate to the admissibility of prior agreements in contract interpretation.\n\nOption B says no evidence of the oral agreement should be admitted because it contradicts the written agreement. This touches on the parol evidence rule, which generally prevents the introduction of oral or written statements made prior to or contemporaneous with a written contract to contradict its terms, especially when the contract is intended as a final expression of the agreement.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the parol evidence rule, one of which is when there's a claim for reformation of the contract. Reformation is an equitable remedy that allows a court to rewrite a contract to reflect the true intent of the parties, often due to a mutual mistake or misrepresentation.\n\nOption C suggests that the oral agreement should be admitted because it's relevant to whether the writing should be reformed. This aligns with the exception to the parol evidence rule I just mentioned. If there's evidence that the written agreement doesn't accurately reflect the actual agreement between the parties due to a mistake, then the court might consider prior agreements to reform the contract.\n\nOption D says yes, because there's no merger clause. While the absence of a merger clause might suggest that prior agreements could have some bearing, it doesn't necessarily mean that evidence of prior agreements is admissible to contradict the written terms. The parol evidence rule still generally applies in the absence of a merger clause, but again, there are exceptions, such as for reformation.\n\nGiven these points, it seems that options C and D are more plausible than A and B. Option B is too absolute; it doesn't account for the possibility of reformation. Option A isn't directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is stronger because it specifically addresses the legal doctrine that allows for the admission of prior agreements\u2014reformation. The fact that there's no merger clause might make option D attractive, but without a merger clause, the parol evidence rule still generally prevents contradiction of the written terms unless there's a valid reason, like a claim for reformation.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: Yes, because the oral price term is relevant to whether the writing should be reformed.\n\nThis makes sense because if the parties can show that the $110,000 price in the written agreement was a mistake and that they actually agreed on $100,000 orally before signing, they might argue for reformation to correct that mistake. Hence, evidence of the oral agreement is relevant to that claim.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
