So, the correct answer is A. four inches.\n\nTo provide more context, the height of a horse is typically measured from the ground to the highest point of the withers (the ridge between the horse's shoulder blades). This measurement is taken in hands, with fractions of a hand being expressed in inches. For example, a horse that is 15.2 hands tall is 15 hands and 2 inches tall, which would be calculated as (15 x 4) + 2 = 62 inches.\n\nThe use of hands as a unit of measurement for horses dates back to ancient times when people used the width of a human hand as a standardized unit. Over time, this measurement was standardized to four inches in the equine industry.\n\nSo, to summarize, a hand is four inches, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
