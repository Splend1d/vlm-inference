Raking leaves is a normal chore, especially in areas with trees that shed their leaves seasonally. Following instructions, in this case, seems like a responsible and considerate thing to do. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with raking leaves as instructed.\n\nIn Scenario 2: \"My dog sheds a lot so I brush him as a solution.\"\n\nThis scenario involves owning a dog that sheds a lot, and the owner brushes the dog to manage the shedding. Brushing a dog is a common practice for maintaining its hygiene and managing fur around the house. It's a responsible action for a pet owner. Again, there doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with brushing your dog to handle shedding.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither seems to involve any morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
