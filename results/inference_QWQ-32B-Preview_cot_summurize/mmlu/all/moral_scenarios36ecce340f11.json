This seems like a normal and responsible action for a pet owner. Leashing a dog is typically required by law in many places for safety and to prevent damage to property or harm to other animals or people. It also shows that the owner is taking care of their pet by providing exercise and supervision. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's brother was too tired and falling asleep in the car, so the main character carried him inside. This appears to be an act of kindness and responsibility. Helping a family member who is unable to walk due to fatigue is generally considered a positive and morally acceptable action. It demonstrates concern and support for a loved one. Therefore, this action is also not wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct choice would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, it's always important to consider context. For example, if carrying the brother inside involved putting oneself or others in danger, or if there were other circumstances that made the action unethical, then it might be different. But based on the information provided, both actions seem morally acceptable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
