For example, the integers modulo \\( n \\), denoted \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), form a cyclic group under addition. Similarly, the multiplicative group of integers modulo \\( p \\), where \\( p \\) is prime, is cyclic.\n\nSo, for any positive integer \\( n \\), can we always find a cyclic group of that order? Well, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) is always a cyclic group of order \\( n \\), right? Because it's generated by the element 1. So, no matter what \\( n \\) is, as long as it's a positive integer, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\) exists and is cyclic.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** \"Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit trickier. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have a finite cyclic group \\( G \\) of order \\( m \\). We know that \\( G \\) is generated by some element \\( g \\), meaning \\( G = \\langle g \\rangle \\), and the order of \\( g \\) is \\( m \\).\n\nNow, for any divisor \\( d \\) of \\( m \\), does \\( G \\) contain an element of order \\( d \\)?\n\nWell, in a cyclic group, for each divisor \\( d \\) of \\( m \\), there is exactly one subgroup of order \\( d \\), and that subgroup is also cyclic. So, there is a subgroup of order \\( d \\), which means there is an element in \\( G \\) whose order is \\( d \\).\n\nFor example, take \\( \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\), which is cyclic of order 6. Its subgroups are:\n\n- Order 1: {0}\n\n- Order 2: {0, 3}\n\n- Order 3: {0, 2, 4}\n\n- Order 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSo, for divisors 1, 2, 3, and 6, there are elements of those orders.\n\nSimilarly, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\), which is cyclic of order 4, we have:\n\n- Order 1: {0}\n\n- Order 2: {0, 2}\n\n- Order 4: {0, 1, 2, 3}\n\nSo, elements of orders 1, 2, and 4.\n\nThis seems to hold in general for finite cyclic groups.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
