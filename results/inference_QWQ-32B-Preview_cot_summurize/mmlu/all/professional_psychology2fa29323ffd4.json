                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. Dr. A. Praise is a forensic psychologist hired to do a court-ordered evaluation of a defendant in a criminal case. She explains the purpose of the evaluation to the defendant, and he says he doesn't want to cooperate. Now, according to the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology, what should Dr. Praise do?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology say about court-ordered evaluations and cooperation from the defendant.\n\nI remember that in forensic settings, evaluations can be court-ordered, which means that the evaluation is mandated by the court, and the defendant is required to participate. However, defendants have certain rights, and psychologists must balance legal requirements with ethical considerations.\n\nOption A suggests that Dr. Praise should remind the defendant that he has no choice since the evaluation is court-ordered. This seems straightforward, but I need to consider if there are any ethical caveats.\n\nOption B says she should refuse to conduct the evaluation unless she obtains a signed consent from the defendant. But wait, if it's a court-order, doesn't that override the need for standard informed consent?\n\nOption C proposes that she should refuse to conduct the evaluation unless she obtains a signed consent from the defendant's attorney. That introduces another party into the consent process.\n\nOption D suggests postponing the evaluation and advising the defendant to contact his attorney.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, in forensic evaluations, especially when they are court-ordered, the typical informed consent process is modified. The defendant is informed about the purpose and nature of the evaluation, but their cooperation may be mandated by the court.\n\nHowever, even in court-ordered evaluations, it's important to establish a therapeutic relationship and to ensure that the defendant understands the process and their rights.\n\nThe Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychology emphasize the importance of informing the individual about the limits of confidentiality, the purpose of the evaluation, and their rights.\n\nGiven that the evaluation is court-ordered, the defendant is required to participate, but it's still important to handle the situation sensitively.\n\nIf the defendant refuses to cooperate, Dr. Praise needs to consider the implications for the evaluation's validity and the ethical considerations.\n\nOption A seems direct, reminding the defendant that he has no choice. But this might not be the best approach because it could escalate the situation and potentially compromise the evaluation.\n\nOption B suggests refusing to conduct the evaluation unless there's signed consent from the defendant. However, since it's court-ordered, standard consent requirements are different. So, this might not be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nOption C introduces the defendant's attorney into the consent process. While involving the attorney could be helpful, it's not clear that signed consent from the attorney is necessary for the evaluation to proceed.\n\nOption D proposes postponing the evaluation and advising the defendant to contact his attorney. This seems like a reasonable approach because it allows the defendant to seek legal advice regarding the evaluation and his participation.\n\nBy postponing the evaluation, Dr. Praise gives the defendant an opportunity to consult with his attorney and perhaps reconsider his cooperation.\n\nThis approach also demonstrates respect for the defendant's rights and the legal process.\n\nMoreover, it aligns with the Specialty Guidelines, which encourage psychologists to consider the legal rights of the individuals they evaluate and to handle situations where cooperation is refused in a manner that respects those rights.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D: postpone the evaluation and advise the defendant to contact his attorney.\n\nThis allows for the legal process to proceed appropriately while also ensuring that the defendant's rights are protected and that he has the opportunity to seek legal advice regarding his participation in the evaluation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
