                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about proteins absorbing electromagnetic radiation at around 190 nanometers, and it's related to a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excitation. I need to figure out which region of the electromagnetic spectrum this wavelength falls into. The options are X-ray, Ultraviolet, Visible, and Infrared.\n\nFirst, I should recall the different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and their approximate wavelength ranges. Starting from the shortest wavelengths:\n\n1. **Gamma rays**: These have wavelengths less than about 0.01 nanometers.\n\n2. **X-rays**: Wavelengths from about 0.01 nanometers up to about 10 nanometers.\n\n3. **Ultraviolet (UV)**: Wavelengths from about 10 nanometers to about 400 nanometers.\n\n4. **Visible light**: A subset of UV, from about 400 nanometers (violet) to about 700 nanometers (red).\n\n5. **Infrared (IR)**: Wavelengths from about 700 nanometers to about 1 millimeter.\n\n6. **Microwaves**: Wavelengths from about 1 millimeter to about 1 meter.\n\n7. **Radio waves**: Wavelengths longer than about 1 meter.\n\nOkay, so 190 nanometers is within the ultraviolet region, which is between 10 and 400 nanometers. To confirm, let me check if 190 nm is indeed in the UV region.\n\nLooking back at the ranges:\n\n- X-rays: up to about 10 nanometers\n\n- Ultraviolet: 10-400 nanometers\n\n- Visible: 400-700 nanometers\n\n- Infrared: 700 nanometers to 1 millimeter\n\nSo, 190 nanometers is well within the ultraviolet range. But just to be thorough, I should make sure it's not in the visible range. The visible range starts at about 400 nanometers, which is violet light, and goes up to about 700 nanometers, which is red light. Since 190 nm is less than 400 nm, it's not in the visible range.\n\nMoreover, the question mentions that this absorption corresponds to a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excitation in the protein molecule. I recall that such electronic transitions typically occur in the ultraviolet region because they involve higher energy photons, which correspond to shorter wavelengths.\n\nTo further confirm, I can think about other molecules that undergo \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transitions. For example, conjugated organic molecules often absorb in the UV region due to these types of transitions. Proteins contain amino acids with conjugated double bonds, such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, which can undergo similar electronic transitions.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that proteins absorb at around 190 nanometers due to \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excitations, and this wavelength falls within the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. Ultraviolet\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
