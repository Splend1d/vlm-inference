                    "text": "Let's see. The Galilean moons are the four largest moons of Jupiter, and they were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. So, I need to recall which moons those are.\n\nI remember that Ganymede is one of them; it's the largest moon in the solar system. Callisto is also a Galilean moon; it's the second-largest after Ganymede. Europa is another one; it's known for its icy surface and potential subsurface ocean. And then there's Io, which is known for its volcanic activity.\n\nSo, looking at the options:\n\nA. Ganymede - Yep, that's a Galilean moon.\n\nB. Callisto - Definitely one of them.\n\nC. Europa - Absolutely.\n\nD. Dione - Hmm, I don't recall Dione being a moon of Jupiter. In fact, Dione is a moon of Saturn, right?\n\nYes, that makes sense because Saturn has many moons, including Dione, Enceladus, Titan, and so on.\n\nSo, if Dione is a moon of Saturn, then it cannot be one of the Galilean moons, which are moons of Jupiter.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Dione.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me make sure that none of the other options are moons of Saturn or any other planet.\n\nGanymede, Callisto, and Europa are all moons of Jupiter, and they are indeed the Galilean moons.\n\nSo, yes, Dione is not a Galilean moon; it belongs to Saturn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
