I have this question: \"If you are truly afraid of the dark, what do you suffer from?\" and there are four options: A. hypnophobia, B. cryptophobia, C. hadephobia, D. nyctophobia. I need to figure out which one of these phobias is the fear of the dark.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these phobias means. Phobias are intense fears of specific objects or situations, and they often have Greek or Latin roots, which can give clues to their meanings.\n\nStarting with A. hypnophobia: Hypnos is the Greek god of sleep, so hypnophobia must be the fear of sleep. That doesn't sound like the fear of dark.\n\nNext, B. cryptophobia: Cryptus is Latin for hidden or secret. So, cryptophobia might be the fear of hidden things or secrecy. Maybe fear of the unknown? But that's not directly the fear of dark.\n\nC. hadephobia: Hades is the Greek god of the underworld, so hadephobia could be the fear of the underworld or hell. That seems more like a fear of death or the afterlife rather than dark.\n\nFinally, D. nyctophobia: Nyx is the Greek goddess of the night, so nyctophobia likely means the fear of night or darkness. That sounds pretty close to the fear of dark.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should double-check each term quickly.\n\nHypnophobia: Fear of sleep.\n\nCryptophobia: Fear of hidden things or secrecy.\n\nHadephobia: Fear of the underworld or hell.\n\nNyctophobia: Fear of night or darkness.\n\nYes, clearly, nyctophobia is the fear of darkness. So, if someone is truly afraid of the dark, they suffer from nyctophobia.\n\nI think the answer is D. nyctophobia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
