Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"It means that only States are considered subjects of international law.\" Hmm, I know that traditionally, states have been the primary subjects of international law, but I think there are other entities that can also have international legal personality nowadays, like international organizations or even certain non-state actors in some contexts. So, maybe A isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption B: \"It means having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\" This sounds promising. Legal personality, in general, is about having the capacity to possess rights and obligations and to enforce them. So, in the international context, it would make sense that having international legal personality means being able to have and enforce rights and duties under international law.\n\nOption C: \"It means that an entity may challenge the authority of States.\" I'm not sure about this one. While having international legal personality might allow an entity to interact with states in certain ways, I don't think it specifically grants the power to challenge their authority. That seems a bit too broad and not directly related to the concept of legal personality.\n\nOption D: \"It is a term that is meant to denote legal, as opposed to physical persons under international law.\" This seems a bit vague. It mentions distinguishing between legal and physical persons, which is important, but it doesn't really explain what international legal personality entails. It's more of a definition in terms of categories rather than functionality.\n\nComparing all these options, B seems to be the most comprehensive and accurate. It directly ties international legal personality to the capacity to have and enforce rights and duties under international law, which aligns with my understanding of legal personality in general.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider each option again.\n\nA is too restrictive because it only includes states, ignoring other potential subjects of international law.\n\nC is appealing because it sounds powerful, but I don't think it's the core meaning of international legal personality. Maybe it's a consequence in some cases, but it's not the definition.\n\nD is somewhat accurate in distinguishing legal from physical persons, but it doesn't really capture the essence of what legal personality means in terms of rights and obligations.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: having rights and duties under international law and a capacity to enforce these by or against the relevant actor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
