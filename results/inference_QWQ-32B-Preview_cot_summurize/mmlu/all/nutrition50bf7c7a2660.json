                    "text": "Let's see. I know that bariatric surgery is used to treat obesity, but I'm not sure exactly how much it reduces the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I recall that obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. So, if bariatric surgery helps people lose weight, it probably also reduces their risk of developing diabetes. But by how much?\n\nOption A says 80-90%. That seems pretty high. Is it possible that bariatric surgery could reduce the incidence by that much? I've heard that bariatric surgery can lead to significant weight loss and improvement in diabetes for those who already have it, but I'm not sure about preventing diabetes in the first place.\n\nOption B says no reduction in incidence. That doesn't make sense to me because there's a lot of research showing that weight loss can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\n\nOption C says approximately 50%. That seems more reasonable, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D is none of the above, which might be possible if the correct percentage isn't listed.\n\nLet me try to remember some studies I've read about. I think there was a study called the Swedish Obese Subjects Study, which looked at the long-term health effects of bariatric surgery. I believe it showed a significant reduction in diabetes incidence, but I don't remember the exact percentage.\n\nAnother study I recall is the Diabetes Prevention Program, which showed that lifestyle changes could reduce the incidence of diabetes by around 58%. So, if surgery is more effective than lifestyle changes alone, maybe the reduction is higher than 50%.\n\nWait, but that was for preventing diabetes in people with prediabetes, not necessarily for obese individuals. Maybe it's different for obese individuals.\n\nI think bariatric surgery leads to more significant weight loss compared to lifestyle modifications alone, so it might have a bigger impact on diabetes prevention.\n\nLet me consider the mechanisms. Bariatric surgery not only causes weight loss but also affects gut hormones and insulin sensitivity, which could have additional benefits for diabetes prevention.\n\nGiven that, maybe the reduction is higher than 50%, possibly up to 80-90%.\n\nBut I should be careful because these are just my thoughts, and I need to rely on evidence-based information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reduction is around 60-70%, but that's not one of the options.\n\nWait, option A is 80-90%, which might be possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reduction is around 50%, as in option C.\n\nI think I need to make an educated guess here.\n\nGiven that bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss and improves insulin sensitivity, and considering the benefits seen in various studies, I would guess that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is reduced by approximately 50%.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
