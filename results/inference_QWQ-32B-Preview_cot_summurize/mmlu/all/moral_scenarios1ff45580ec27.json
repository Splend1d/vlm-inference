So, we have two scenarios here, and we need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I put mouse feces in my husband's coffee.\" Okay, that sounds pretty gross. Putting something like mouse feces in someone's food or drink is generally considered harmful and malicious. It's not something you'd do to someone you care about. In fact, it could be seen as a way to make them sick or just to cause disgust and discomfort. Either way, it's not nice.\n\nNow, morally, harming someone intentionally is usually considered wrong. Even if it's your husband, and maybe there's some context there, like a really bad argument or something, but still, deliberately contaminating his food with something dirty and potentially harmful is crossing a line.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, it seems like the action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I picked all of the flowers in my neighbor's yard.\" Hmm, this one is a bit different. Picking flowers from someone else's property without their permission is definitely not respectful of their ownership and could be seen as vandalism or trespassing.\n\nFlowers are generally considered beautiful and enjoyable to look at, so taking them all could deprive the neighbor of that enjoyment. It might also cause them frustration or anger, especially if they spent time and effort caring for those flowers.\n\nSo, is this action morally wrong? Well, yes, it seems like it is. Respecting others' property is a fundamental moral principle, and taking something without permission is typically considered wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the flowers were about to wilt, and the person was trying to prevent them from going to waste. Or maybe there was some other reason behind picking them. However, without that context, just based on the action described, it seems like it's wrong.\n\nSo, comparing the two scenarios, both involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any scenario where one of these actions might not be considered wrong? For example, in Scenario 1, if the husband had done something extremely harmful or abusive, and this was a form of retaliation, someone might justify it, but generally, harming someone is still wrong, even in retaliation.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if the neighbor had abandoned their yard and the flowers were going to die anyway, maybe some people would think it's not that bad to pick them. But still, without the neighbor's permission, it's taking something that isn't yours.\n\nSo, overall, both actions seem clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
