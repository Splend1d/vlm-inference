                    "text": "So I've got this question here about flower adaptations and how they influence which pollinators they attract. Specifically, it's asking which adaptation would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination. The options are:\n\nA. Patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals\n\nB. Modified petals to provide a landing space\n\nC. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers\n\nD. Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the differences between bee-pollinated flowers and hummingbird-pollinated flowers. Bees are known for their ability to see ultraviolet colors, which many flowers use to attract them. They also tend to prefer flowers that have a landing platform because bees land on the flower to feed on nectar. On the other hand, hummingbirds have poor smell but excellent vision, especially for the color red. They can hover in mid-air, so they don't need a landing platform, and they prefer flowers with high sugar concentration nectar because they have high energy needs.\n\nSo, looking at option A: Patterns of ultraviolet color on the petals. Bees can see ultraviolet colors, which often guide them to the nectar in flowers. Hummingbirds, however, don't see ultraviolet as well as bees do. So, if a flower has ultraviolet patterns, it's likely to attract bees more than hummingbirds. Therefore, having ultraviolet patterns on petals would actually promote bee pollination, not limit it.\n\nOption B: Modified petals to provide a landing space. Bees need a place to land on the flower to feed, whereas hummingbirds hover in front of the flower. So, if a flower has modified petals that provide a landing space, it's catering to bees and possibly other insects that need to land. This would likely limit hummingbird pollination because hummingbirds might not need or use a landing platform. Therefore, this adaptation would promote bee pollination and possibly limit hummingbird pollination.\n\nOption C: Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers. Hummingbirds are attracted to red colors, and pendant flowers are those that hang downward, which is a characteristic of many hummingbird-pollinated flowers. Hummingbirds can hover and reach into these pendant flowers with their long bills and tongues. Bees, however, might find it difficult to access nectar from pendant flowers because they prefer flowers that are upright and offer a stable landing platform. So, this adaptation would likely limit bee pollination and promote hummingbird pollination.\n\nOption D: Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts. Hummingbirds have high energy requirements and prefer nectar with high sugar concentrations. Bees can utilize a range of sugar concentrations but might prefer moderate sugar concentrations. If the nectar is produced in limited amounts, it might discourage bees, which often visit multiple flowers to collect nectar, whereas hummingbirds might be more persistent in feeding from flowers with less nectar. So, this adaptation could limit bee pollination and promote hummingbird pollination.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the adaptation that would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination. Both options C and D seem to fit this description. However, I need to choose the one that best answers the question.\n\nPendant red-colored flowers (option C) directly target hummingbird pollination by providing the type of flower structure and color that hummingbirds are attracted to, while making it less accessible for bees. High sugar concentration nectar in limited amounts (option D) also targets hummingbirds but might still be accessed by bees to some extent, especially if nectar is scarce.\n\nConsidering this, pendant red-colored flowers (option C) might be more effective in limiting bee pollination and promoting hummingbird pollination because it affects both the physical structure and the color attractiveness specifically for hummingbirds.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C. Pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
