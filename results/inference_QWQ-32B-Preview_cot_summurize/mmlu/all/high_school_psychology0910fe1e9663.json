                    "text": "C. be able to take another person's perspective.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development proposes that individuals progress through three levels of moral reasoning: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. The postconventional level is the highest stage, where individuals make moral judgments based on abstract principles and personal ethics, rather than societal norms or rules.\n\nTo reason at the postconventional level, according to Kohlberg, people must be able to take another person's perspective. This ability allows individuals to understand and consider the feelings, thoughts, and needs of others, which is essential for developing a more nuanced and empathetic moral framework.\n\nOption A, \"be generous,\" is not a specific requirement for postconventional reasoning in Kohlberg's theory. While generosity may be a virtue that develops alongside moral maturity, it is not a prerequisite for achieving postconventional reasoning.\n\nOption B, \"believe in God,\" is also not a requirement in Kohlberg's theory. His theory is secular and focuses on cognitive development in moral reasoning, independent of religious beliefs.\n\nOption D, \"have had a successful resolution of the integrity versus despair stage,\" refers to Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, not Kohlberg's stages of moral development. Erikson's theory is distinct from Kohlberg's and focuses on different aspects of psychological development.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: be able to take another person's perspective.\n\nReference:\n\nKohlberg, L.
