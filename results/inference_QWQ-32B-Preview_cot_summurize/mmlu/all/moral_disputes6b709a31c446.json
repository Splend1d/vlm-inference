Voluntary euthanasia occurs when a competent patient explicitly requests and consents to the termination of their life, usually due to unbearable suffering from a terminal illness. In this scenario, the healthcare provider actively administers lethal substances to end the patient's life, respecting the patient's autonomy and wishes.\n\nIn contrast, involuntary euthanasia involves ending a patient's life without their consent, which is generally considered unethical and illegal. Nonvoluntary euthanasia refers to situations where the patient is unable to give consent, such as being in a persistent vegetative state, and the decision is made by others, like family members or legal guardians. Passive euthanasia involves withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments, allowing the patient to die naturally from their underlying condition.\n\nTherefore, when a patient has consented to the active bringing of their death, it falls under voluntary euthanasia."
