                    "text": "In British currency, a pound is made up of 100 pence. So, the correct answer is B. 100.\n\nTo provide more context, the British pound sterling (symbol: \u00a3; ISO code: GBP) is the official currency of the United Kingdom. It is divided into 100 smaller units called pence (singular: penny). Coins currently in circulation include 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, \u00a31, and \u00a32. Banknotes are available in \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, and \u00a350 denominations.\n\nThe term \"pence\" is used for the plural of \"penny,\" and it's important to note that while \"pence\" is the plural form, in everyday speech, people often say \"pennies\" as well, though \"pence\" is more formal. For example, you might hear someone say, \"I have 50 pence\" or \"I have 50 pennies,\" but \"pence\" is the correct term when referring to the currency subdivision.\n\nAdditionally, the abbreviation for penny is \"p,\" so 50 pence can be written as 50p. This is commonly seen on coinage and in pricing.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that in some regions, such as Scotland, there are plans to introduce higher-value banknotes, but currently, the standard banknotes are as mentioned above.\n\nSo, to summarize, the British pound is divided into 100 pence, making option B the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
