                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about the dichromate ion and its reaction to form Cr3+. I need to find out the oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion and determine whether reduction or oxidation occurs when it forms Cr3+.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the dichromate ion is. Dichromate is Cr2O7^2-. So, it's a polyatomic ion with two chromium atoms and seven oxygen atoms, and it has a total charge of -2.\n\nTo find the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate, I should assign oxidation numbers to all the atoms in the ion and make sure they add up to the overall charge.\n\nOxygen usually has an oxidation state of -2, except in peroxides and certain other compounds, but in dichromate, it should be -2.\n\nSo, there are seven oxygen atoms, each with -2, that\u2019s 7 * (-2) = -14.\n\nThe overall charge of the dichromate ion is -2.\n\nLet\u2019s let x be the oxidation state of chromium. There are two chromium atoms, so together they have 2x.\n\nThe sum of the oxidation states should equal the overall charge:\n\n2x + (-14) = -2\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\n2x - 14 = -2\n\n2x = -2 + 14\n\n2x = 12\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate is +6.\n\nNow, the question says that when dichromate is reacted, one of its most common products is Cr3+. So, chromium is changing from +6 in dichromate to +3 in Cr3+.\n\nTo determine whether this is reduction or oxidation, I can use the mnemonic \"OIL RIG\" \u2013 Oxidation Is Loss of electrons, Reduction Is Gain of electrons.\n\nIf chromium is changing from +6 to +3, it's gaining electrons because its oxidation state is decreasing.\n\nGaining electrons is reduction.\n\nSo, reduction occurs when dichromate forms Cr3+.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3+, reduction\n\nB. 12+, reduction\n\nC. 6+, reduction\n\nD. 6+, oxidation\n\nIt seems that option C matches: 6+, reduction.\n\nWait a minute, but in the dichromate ion, chromium is +6, and it's being reduced to Cr3+, which is +3. So, the oxidation state changes from +6 to +3.\n\nBut the question is asking for the oxidation state of chromium in the dichromate ion, which is +6, and whether reduction or oxidation occurs when it forms Cr3+, which is reduction.\n\nSo, option C seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate.\n\nCr2O7^2-\n\nEach oxygen is -2, seven oxygens are -14.\n\nTotal charge is -2.\n\nSo, 2x + (-14) = -2\n\n2x - 14 = -2\n\n2x = 12\n\nx = 6\n\nYes, +6 is correct.\n\nAnd changing to Cr3+ is a decrease in oxidation state, which is reduction.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 6+, reduction.\n\nBut the question says \"one of its most common products is Cr3+\". So, it's\u660e\u786ethat dichromate is being reduced to Cr3+.\n\nNo, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's something about the dichromate ion that I'm missing.\n\nWait, perhaps dichromate can be reduced to Cr3+, but is there a possibility of another product?\n\nOr maybe the question is testing something else.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems straightforward.\n\nChromium in dichromate is +6, and it's reduced to +3 in Cr3+, which is reduction.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 6+, reduction.\n\nI think that's the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
