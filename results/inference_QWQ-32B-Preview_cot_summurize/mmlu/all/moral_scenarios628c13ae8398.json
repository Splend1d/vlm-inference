Sandboxes in parks are usually for kids to play in. They're not meant for animals to use as litterboxes. It's unsanitary and could pose health risks to children who play there, since cat feces can carry diseases like toxoplasmosis.\n\nAlso, it's probably against public health regulations and possibly local ordinances. So, from a moral standpoint, it seems like this is something that's clearly wrong.\n\nNext, Scenario 2: \"I followed my brother home from school.\"\n\nFollowing a family member, especially a sibling, home from school\u2014well, that seems pretty normal. Maybe you wanted to spend time together, help with homework, or just because that's what you do. Unless there's some ulterior motive or if the brother didn't want to be followed, which isn't indicated here, it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
