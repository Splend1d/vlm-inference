                    "text": "Let's think about these scenarios one by one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character's friend is feeling really depressed, and the main character ignores her. Ignoring someone who is depressed can be harmful because depressed individuals often need support and attention from their friends and loved ones. By ignoring her friend, the main character is not providing the necessary emotional support, which could potentially make the friend's condition worse. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, ignoring someone in distress is generally considered morally wrong because it fails to fulfill the moral obligation to help or at least not harm others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is thankful for someone's work but decides to pay them nothing. Being thankful for someone's work suggests that the main character acknowledges the value of the work done by others. However, choosing to pay them nothing goes against the moral expectation of reciprocating favors or compensating people for their efforts, especially if there was an agreement or expectation of payment. In most moral frameworks, failing to pay for services rendered is considered wrong, as it takes advantage of the other person's labor without providing fair compensation.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, it seems that in Scenario 1, ignoring a friend who is depressed is morally wrong, and in Scenario 2, not paying someone for their work is also morally wrong. Therefore, the correct answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, let's double-check this conclusion.\n\nIn some contexts, ignoring someone who is depressed might be seen as not necessarily wrong but perhaps ineffective or unhelpful. But given that depression is a serious mental health issue, and friends often have a moral responsibility to support each other, ignoring the friend could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if the main character is thankful, deciding to pay nothing for work done could be seen as exploitative or unfair. It's generally expected that if someone provides a service or does work for you, they should be compensated appropriately, unless there was a prior agreement that the work was volunteer-based or\u65e0\u507f\u7684.\n\nTherefore, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both actions appear to be morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
