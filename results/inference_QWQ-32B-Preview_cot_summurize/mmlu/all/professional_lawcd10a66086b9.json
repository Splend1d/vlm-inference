                    "text": "This question is about contract law, specifically focusing on the formation of a contract and the concept of acceptance through actions. Let's break down the scenario and analyze it step by step.\n\nFirst, on Monday, the man makes an offer to the gardener: \"I am having a party on Sunday and I want my house to look good. If you will promise to mow my lawn by Saturday, I will pay you $50.\" This is a clear offer with specific terms\u2014mowing the lawn by Saturday in exchange for $50.\n\nNow, on Friday, the gardener arrives at the man's home while the man is leaving for work and begins to mow the lawn. The man says nothing and drives off, observing the gardener unloading his lawn mower.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. Did the gardener accept the offer? Acceptance in contract law typically requires communication of agreement to the terms offered. However, acceptance can also be implied by conduct, especially when the offeree starts performing the requested act.\n\nIn this case, the gardener began mowing the lawn on Friday, which can be seen as starting performance of the agreed task. This action could imply acceptance of the offer.\n\nWhen the man returned home that evening, he saw that only half of the lawn had been mowed. The gardener left a note explaining that he ran out of gas and didn't have time to buy more, planning to take the weekend off but promising to return on Monday morning to finish the job.\n\nNow, if the man sues the gardener for breach of contract, who is likely to prevail?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The gardener, because he never accepted the offer made by the man.\n\nIs this correct? Well, the gardener started mowing the lawn, which could be considered partial performance and thus acceptance of the offer. So, this might not hold up.\n\nB. The gardener, because he offered to cure the defective performance by finishing the job on Monday morning.\n\nThe gardener did offer to finish the job on Monday, but the man wanted the lawn mowed by Saturday for his Sunday party. So, the proposed cure might not address the timing issue, which was crucial.\n\nC. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.\n\nThis seems plausible. By starting to mow the lawn, the gardener accepted the offer and impliedly promised to complete the job as per the agreement.\n\nD. The man, because under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the gardener's part performance was evidence of his intent to honor the entire contract.\n\nEquitable estoppel prevents a party from going back on their word when the other party has relied on that representation to their detriment. Here, the man might argue that he relied on the gardener's start of work to have the lawn ready by Saturday.\n\nConsidering these points, options C and D both suggest that the man is likely to prevail. However, option C directly addresses the acceptance through partial performance and the implied promise to complete the task, which aligns well with contract law principles.\n\nOption D introduces equitable estoppel, which might also apply but seems slightly more nuanced. Equitable estoppel would require that the man relied on the gardener's actions to his detriment, perhaps by not hiring someone else.\n\nBut in terms of straightforward contract law, option C seems more directly applicable. The gardener's partial performance implies acceptance and a promise to complete the agreed task. By not completing the job by the agreed deadline, the gardener breached the contract, and the man could seek remedies for that breach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely C. The man, because the gardener's part performance necessarily implied an acceptance and a promise that he would render complete performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
