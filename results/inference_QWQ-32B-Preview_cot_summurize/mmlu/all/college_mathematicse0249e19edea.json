                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: \"A total of x feet of fencing is to form three sides of a level rectangular yard. What is the maximum possible area of the yard, in terms of x?\" And there are some options: A. x\u00b2/9, B. x\u00b2/8, C. x\u00b2/4, D. x\u00b2. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. There's a rectangular yard, and only three sides are being fenced with a total of x feet of fencing. So, in a rectangle, there are four sides: two lengths and two widths. But here, only three sides are being fenced. That means one side is unfenced. I need to figure out which side is unfenced and how that affects the area.\n\nMaybe it's better to assume that the unfenced side is one of the lengths or one of the widths. Let's say the unfenced side is the length. So, then, the fenced sides would be two widths and one length. So, the total fencing used would be: 2w + l = x, where w is the width and l is the length.\n\nI need to maximize the area, which for a rectangle is a = l * w.\n\nSo, I have a = l * w, and I have 2w + l = x.\n\nI can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for l in terms of w from the fencing equation:\n\nl = x - 2w.\n\nNow, substitute this into the area equation:\n\na = (x - 2w) * w = xw - 2w\u00b2.\n\nSo, a = xw - 2w\u00b2.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of w, and it's a downward-opening parabola because of the -2w\u00b2 term. The maximum area will occur at the vertex of this parabola.\n\nThe vertex form for a quadratic equation y = ax\u00b2 + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). So, in this case, a = -2, and b = x.\n\nTherefore, the width w that maximizes the area is w = -x/(2*(-2)) = x/4.\n\nNow, plug this back into the equation for l:\n\nl = x - 2*(x/4) = x - x/2 = x/2.\n\nSo, the length is x/2, and the width is x/4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum area is a = (x/2) * (x/4) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. x\u00b2/8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe the unfenced side is the width instead of the length. Let's assume that the unfenced side is the width, so the fenced sides are two lengths and one width.\n\nThen, the fencing equation would be: 2l + w = x.\n\nAnd the area is a = l * w.\n\nSolve for w in terms of l: w = x - 2l.\n\nPlug into area: a = l * (x - 2l) = x l - 2 l\u00b2.\n\nAgain, this is a quadratic: a = -2 l\u00b2 + x l.\n\nThe vertex is at l = -x/(2*(-2)) = x/4.\n\nThen, w = x - 2*(x/4) = x/2.\n\nSo, again, a = (x/4) * (x/2) = x\u00b2/8.\n\nSame answer. So, it seems that regardless of which side is unfenced, the maximum area is x\u00b2/8.\n\nBut wait, is that true? Let's think about it. If I fence three sides, it might depend on the layout. Maybe if it's against a wall, the wall is one side, and I fence the other three.\n\nBut in either case, whether the wall is the length or the width, the calculation leads to the same maximum area of x\u00b2/8.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B. x\u00b2/8.\n\nLet me check the other options to see why they might be incorrect.\n\nOption A is x\u00b2/9. That's less than x\u00b2/8, so it's smaller. In our calculation, we got x\u00b2/8, which is larger, so probably not A.\n\nOption C is x\u00b2/4. That's larger than x\u00b2/8, but in our calculation, x\u00b2/8 is the maximum area. So, maybe C is not correct.\n\nOption D is x\u00b2, which is much larger than x\u00b2/8. That seems too big, so likely not D.\n\nTherefore, B. x\u00b2/8 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{x^2}{8}} \\]"
