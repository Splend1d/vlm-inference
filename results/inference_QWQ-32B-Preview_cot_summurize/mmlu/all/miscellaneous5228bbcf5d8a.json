                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract question. It says, \"If one party to a contract is forced to sign, the contract is defined as...\" and then it gives options: A. enforceable, B. executory, C. unilateral, D. voidable.\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what it means for someone to be \"forced\" to sign a contract. I think being forced could mean that they were coerced, threatened, or maybe even physically forced into signing. So, it's not really a voluntary agreement on their part.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is \"enforceable.\" An enforceable contract is one that can be enforced by law. So, if both parties agree voluntarily and meet all the legal requirements, the contract is enforceable. But in this case, one party was forced to sign, which suggests that there was no voluntary agreement. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B is \"executory.\" An executory contract is one where some obligations are yet to be performed by one or both parties. So, it's a contract that's not fully completed yet. Being forced to sign doesn't directly relate to whether obligations have been performed or not. So, perhaps this isn't the correct choice.\n\nOption C is \"unilateral.\" A unilateral contract is one where only one party makes a promise. For example, if I promise to pay you $100 if you mow my lawn, and you go ahead and mow the lawn, that's a unilateral contract because only I made a promise. Being forced to sign doesn't necessarily make a contract unilateral; it's about the nature of the promises made, not the manner in which it was signed.\n\nOption D is \"voidable.\" A voidable contract is one that can be canceled by one of the parties because of certain circumstances, like misrepresentation, fraud, or duress. Duress is when someone is forced or threatened into agreeing to something. So, if one party was forced to sign, that sounds a lot like duress, which makes the contract voidable at the option of the party who was forced.\n\nLet me double-check. Duress is a legal concept that invalidates consent, meaning that the party under duress didn't really agree voluntarily. Therefore, the contract can be voided by that party.\n\nComparing this with the other options, \"enforceable\" doesn't fit because the lack of voluntary agreement might make it unenforceable. \"Executory\" is about the performance of obligations, not about how the contract was agreed upon. \"Unilateral\" is about the nature of the promises, not the circumstances of signing. So, \"voidable\" seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other factors that could make the contract enforceable despite the duress. But generally, duress is a valid reason to void a contract, so I don't think that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, is there such a thing as a \"void\" contract in this situation? Well, void contracts are those that are invalid from the start and have no legal effect. Voidable contracts, on the other hand, are valid until they're voided by the affected party. In this case, since one party was forced to sign, the contract is potentially voidable, but not necessarily void ab initio.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. voidable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
