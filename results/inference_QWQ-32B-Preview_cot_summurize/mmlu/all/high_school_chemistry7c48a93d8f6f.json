                    "text": "So I have this question here: \"The molecule with a tetrahedral shape is\" and there are four options: A. PCl4F, B. BF3, C. CO2, and D. CBr4. I need to figure out which one has a tetrahedral shape. I remember that molecular shape is determined by the VSEPR theory, which stands for Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory. This theory helps predict the geometry of molecules based on the repulsion between electron pairs around the central atom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a tetrahedral shape is. In a tetrahedral molecule, the central atom has four bonding pairs of electrons, and no lone pairs. This arrangement minimizes the repulsion between the electron pairs, resulting in bond angles of approximately 109.5 degrees.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: PCl4F. This is phosphorus pentachloride with one chlorine replaced by fluorine, I think. Wait, phosphorus pentachloride is PCl5, so PCl4F should have the same structure as PCl5, which is trigonal bipyramidal. So, PCl4F should also have a trigonal bipyramidal shape, not tetrahedral.\n\nOption B: BF3. Boron trifluoride has boron as the central atom bonded to three fluorine atoms. Boron has three bonding pairs and no lone pairs, which according to VSEPR theory, should result in a trigonal planar shape, not tetrahedral.\n\nOption C: CO2. Carbon dioxide has carbon double-bonded to two oxygen atoms. Carbon has two double bonds and no lone pairs, which means it has two regions of electron density, leading to a linear shape, not tetrahedral.\n\nOption D: CBr4. This is carbon tetrabromide, with carbon as the central atom bonded to four bromine atoms. Carbon has four bonding pairs and no lone pairs, which according to VSEPR theory, should result in a tetrahedral shape.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, CBr4 should have a tetrahedral shape.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nLet's consider PCl4F again. Phosphorus has five valence electrons. In PCl4F, it forms four single bonds (to four chlorines and one fluorine). Wait, but PCl5 is trigonal bipyramidal, with five chlorines. So, replacing one chlorine with fluorine shouldn't change the basic shape, which is trigonal bipyramidal. So, PCl4F should still be trigonal bipyramidal.\n\nBF3: Boron has three valence electrons, forming three bonds with fluorine, no lone pairs, which results in a trigonal planar shape.\n\nCO2: Carbon has four valence electrons, forming two double bonds with oxygen, no lone pairs, leading to a linear shape.\n\nCBr4: Carbon has four valence electrons, forming four single bonds with bromine, no lone pairs, which should be tetrahedral.\n\nSo, it seems clear that CBr4 is the molecule with a tetrahedral shape.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should consider if any of these molecules have lone pairs that might affect the shape.\n\nIn PCl4F, phosphorus has no lone pairs if it's forming five bonds, so it's trigonal bipyramidal.\n\nBF3: Boron has no lone pairs, so trigonal planar.\n\nCO2: Carbon has no lone pairs, linear.\n\nCBr4: Carbon has no lone pairs, tetrahedral.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. CBr4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
