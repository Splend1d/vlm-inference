She is the consort of Vishnu and is often depicted alongside him in many of his incarnations. For example, in the Ramayana, she appears as Sita, the wife of Rama, who is an avatar of Vishnu. In the Mahabharata, she appears as Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, who are descendants of Vishnu. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sri (Lakshmi)."
