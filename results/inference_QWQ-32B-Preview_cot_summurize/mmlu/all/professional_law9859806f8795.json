He got approval from his employer to do so and was heading to a restaurant for a 30-minute lunch break. While entering the parking lot, he was careless and ran over a pedestrian, causing serious injuries. Now, the injured person is suing both the driver and the employer for negligence.\n\nThe question is whether the employer is liable in this situation. There are four options provided:\n\nA. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nB. Yes, because the employer owned the truck.\n\nC. No, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment.\n\nD. No, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what vicarious liability means. From what I recall, vicarious liability is a legal concept where one person is held liable for the actions of another person, usually an employee, even if the first person did not directly cause the harm. This is based on the relationship between the two parties, typically an employer-employee relationship.\n\nSo, option A suggests that yes, the employer is liable because of this doctrine. That seems plausible, but I need to consider the specifics of the situation.\n\nOption B says yes, because the employer owned the truck. This might be related to the concept of respondeat superior, which is similar to vicarious liability, where the employer is responsible for the acts of the employee committed within the scope of employment, especially if using the employer's equipment, like the truck.\n\nOption C says no, because the employee was not within the scope of his employment. This makes me think that maybe going for lunch is not considered part of the job duties, so the employer shouldn't be held liable for what happens during that time.\n\nOption D says no, because liability cannot be imputed from one person to another. This seems to be against the idea of vicarious liability altogether, suggesting that one person cannot be held responsible for another's actions.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these is correct based on the facts provided.\n\nFirst, the driver was making deliveries for his employer, which is clearly within the scope of his employment. Then, he decided to go for lunch and got approval from his employer. So, the lunch break is authorized and probably a necessary part of his work day, even if it's a break from active delivery duties.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, employees are considered to be within the scope of employment during authorized breaks, as long as they are not engaged in personal errands unrelated to work. In this case, going for lunch seems to be a routine break, not a personal errand.\n\nMoreover, he was driving the employer's truck to the restaurant, which strengthens the argument that he was still acting in the capacity of an employee, even if the primary purpose was to have lunch.\n\nGiven that, it seems that the doctrine of vicarious liability would apply, making the employer liable for the driver's negligence while he was using the employer's vehicle and during an authorized break.\n\nOption C suggests that the employee was not within the scope of his employment, but based on the facts, it appears that he was, since the lunch break was authorized and he was using the employer's truck.\n\nOption D seems too broad, as vicarious liability is a well-established legal principle that allows liability to be imputed from one person to another based on their relationship.\n\nOption B focuses on the ownership of the truck, which is a relevant factor, but I think the broader principle is the scope of employment.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A: Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any exceptions or nuances that might apply here.\n\nFor example, if the driver was engaged in a personal errand unrelated to his employment, then the scope of employment might not apply, and the employer wouldn't be liable. But in this case, it seems that going for lunch is a routine break, not a personal errand.\n\nAlso, some jurisdictions have rules about the use of company vehicles, and if an employee uses the vehicle for personal purposes outside the scope of employment, the employer might not be liable.\n\nBut here, the driver was using the truck to go to lunch, which is an authorized break, so it's likely still within the scope of employment.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the employer had control over the driver's actions. Since the driver was on an authorized break and had permission to take the truck to lunch, the employer might still be considered in control, making vicarious liability applicable.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the employer approved the lunch break suggests that it was a permitted activity, further supporting the argument that the driver was acting within the scope of his employment.\n\nTherefore, based on the doctrine of vicarious liability and the principles of agency law, I believe the employer would be liable for the driver's negligence in this scenario.\n\nSo, the answer is A. Yes, because of the doctrine of vicarious liability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
