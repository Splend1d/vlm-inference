                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at each one separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I wanted my boyfriend to appreciate me, so I waxed his car.\"\n\nFirst, the intention here seems positive\u2014wanting your boyfriend to appreciate you. Waxing his car could be seen as a thoughtful gesture to make his vehicle look nice, which might indeed make him appreciate you. In general, doing something nice for someone you care about is considered morally positive.\n\nHowever, there might be a couple of considerations here. One is whether the boyfriend wanted or needed his car waxed. If he didn't care about it or if it was unnecessary, then putting in effort might not be appreciated. But that's more about effectiveness rather than morality.\n\nAnother consideration is whether waxing the car was within your rights. If it's his personal property, touching his car without his explicit permission could be seen as intrusive, especially if he values his privacy or autonomy over his possessions. But in the context of a romantic relationship, where shared responsibilities and gestures of affection are common, this might be acceptable.\n\nOverall, in ordinary moral standards, this seems more like a positive action rather than something morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I knew there was not enough food to go around, so I insisted on being the first in line.\"\n\nThis scenario is a bit different. Here, the main character knows that there isn't enough food for everyone, and instead of considering the needs of others or perhaps finding a fair way to distribute the food, they insist on being first in line to secure their own share.\n\nThis could be seen as selfish and disregarding the needs of others who might be equally or more in need of the food. In situations where resources are scarce, moral standards often emphasize fairness, consideration for others, and perhaps helping those who are most vulnerable.\n\nInsisting on being first in line could be interpreted as cutting in line or pushing ahead of others, which is generally considered impolite and unfair. In some contexts, it might even be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the struggles of others.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action seems more likely to be considered morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer would be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nThe first scenario doesn't appear to involve a moral wrong, while the second does.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
