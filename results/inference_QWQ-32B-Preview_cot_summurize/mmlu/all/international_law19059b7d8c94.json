Emmanuel Kant, C. John Locke, and D. Jeremy Bentham.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who among these philosophers made that statement about natural rights. I think I remember something about Jeremy Bentham critiquing the concept of natural rights. Let me think about that.\n\nJeremy Bentham was a utilitarian philosopher, right? He was known for his utilitarianism, which focuses on the greatest happiness for the greatest number. I think he was critical of abstract concepts like natural rights,\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\n\nI recall that Bentham had a famous quote about natural rights, describing them as \"nonsense on stilts.\" I think that's the phrase. So, if that's correct, then the answer should be D. Jeremy Bentham.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A: Alan Gerwith. I'm not familiar with this name. Maybe it's a typo? Perhaps it's supposed to be Alan Gewirth, who was a contemporary philosopher known for his work on the principle of generic consistency. But I don't recall him making that particular statement about natural rights.\n\nOption B: Emmanuel Kant. Now, Kant was a German philosopher who talked a lot about rights and duties. He is known for his categorical imperative and the idea of treating people as ends in themselves, not merely as means. But I don't recall him referring to natural rights as \"nonsense on stilts.\" In fact, Kant did discuss natural rights in the context of moral philosophy.\n\nOption C: John Locke. Locke is one of the key figures in the development of the concept of natural rights. He is famous for his theories on life, liberty, and property. So, it's unlikely that he would call natural rights \"nonsense on stilts\" because he was a proponent of them.\n\nOption D: Jeremy Bentham. As I thought earlier, Bentham was critical of natural rights, considering them to be abstract and without practical basis. He preferred to focus on laws and policies that could be justified based on their utility and ability to promote happiness.\n\nSo, considering all this, I believe the correct answer is D. Jeremy Bentham.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
