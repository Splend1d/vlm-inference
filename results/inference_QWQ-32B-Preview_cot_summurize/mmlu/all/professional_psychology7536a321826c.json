                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here. I'm a psychologist, and I've just had a phone call from this guy, Hermann H., who's 28 years old. He says he's \"totally miserable\" because his girlfriend broke up with him, and he wants to start therapy with me. Okay, that seems pretty standard. But then, in the first session, I find out that his political views are completely repugnant to me, and I realize that I wouldn't enjoy working with him. Hmm, that's tricky.\n\nNow, as an ethical psychologist, I need to decide what to do. There are four options here:\n\nA. Consult with another psychologist during the course of treatment to make sure my feelings don't interfere with my objectivity.\n\nB. Discuss the difference in political views with Hermann only if they become relevant to the psychotherapy process.\n\nC. See Hermann in therapy until his current crisis is over and then make a referral if necessary.\n\nD. Provide Hermann with appropriate referrals.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, ethics in psychology are really important. The American Psychological Association (APA) has a code of ethics that guides our practice. One of the key principles is competence, which includes recognizing our own limitations and biases.\n\nIn this case, Hermann's political views are repugnant to me, and I don't enjoy the idea of working with him. That suggests that I might have some bias or prejudice that could affect my ability to provide effective therapy.\n\nOption A suggests consulting with another psychologist during treatment to ensure my feelings don't interfere with objectivity. That could be helpful, but it might not be enough. Bias can be subtle and unconscious, and even with consultation, I might still be projecting my own views or reacting negatively in ways that Hermann picks up on. This could damage the therapeutic relationship and hinder his progress.\n\nOption B is to discuss the political differences only if they become relevant to the therapy process. But here's the thing: if my discomfort with his political views is significant enough that I don't enjoy working with him, that might color all aspects of our interactions, not just the political ones. It's possible that my bias could spill over into other areas of therapy, affecting my objectivity and effectiveness as a therapist.\n\nOption C is to see Hermann through his current crisis and then make a referral if necessary. But what if his issues go beyond the immediate breakup? What if addressing deeper issues requires more time, and my bias could become more pronounced over time? It might not be fair to Hermann to have a therapist who isn't fully invested in his well-being because of personal biases.\n\nOption D is to provide him with appropriate referrals right from the start. This seems like the most ethical choice. If I know that my biases might interfere with my ability to provide effective therapy, it's better to refer him to someone else who can approach his case without those prejudices.\n\nMoreover, the APA ethics code emphasizes the importance of therapist self-awareness and the need to manage personal issues that could interfere with professional judgment and performance. If I feel that I cannot set aside my personal feelings about Hermann's political views, it would be unethical for me to continue treating him, as it could harm him.\n\nIt's also worth considering that therapy is about helping the client, not about agreeing with or endorsing their beliefs. As a therapist, I should be able to work with people from all walks of life, including those with differing political views. However, if I feel that my bias is too strong, it's better to refer the client to someone who can provide the necessary objectivity and support.\n\nIn conclusion, the most ethical choice would be Option D: provide Hermann with appropriate referrals. This ensures that he receives the best possible care without my biases getting in the way.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
