                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Jaina traditions, specifically about who the caityavasis were. The options are:\n\nA. Householders who supported renouncers\n\nB. Orthodox interpreters of the scriptures\n\nC. Women ascetics who lived in communities\n\nD. Temple-dwelling renouncers\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Jainism. Jainism is an ancient Indian religion that emphasizes non-violence and the path to liberation through the purification of the soul. It has two main sects: Digambara and \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara.\n\nIn Jainism, there are monks and nuns who renounce worldly life to pursue spiritual liberation, and there are laypeople who follow the religion but continue to live in society. So, the term \"caityavasis\" seems to relate to some group within this structure.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Householders who supported renouncers\n\nHouseholders in Jainism are called \u015br\u0101vakas and \u015br\u0101vik\u0101s. They do support the renouncers by providing them with food, shelter, and other necessities. But I think \"caityavasis\" might refer more specifically to a group of renouncers rather than laypeople.\n\nB. Orthodox interpreters of the scriptures\n\nJainism has its own set of scriptures, and there are certainly scholars and monks who interpret these texts. However, I don't recall the term \"caityavasis\" being associated specifically with scriptural interpretation.\n\nC. Women ascetics who lived in communities\n\nJainism has traditions of female renouncers, but again, I don't think \"caityavasis\" specifically refers to women ascetics. Maybe it's possible, but I need to check more carefully.\n\nD. Temple-dwelling renouncers\n\nThis seems plausible. The term \"caitya\" in Sanskrit refers to a shrine or a temple, and \"v\u0101s\u012b\" means one who dwells or resides. So, \"caityav\u0101s\u012b\" would literally mean someone who lives in a temple.\n\nIn Jainism, temples are important places of worship, and there are monks and nuns who reside in or near temples to perform their religious duties, such as meditation, teaching, and conducting rituals.\n\nI recall that in some Jain traditions, there were groups of monks who were associated with specific temples and lived there, while other monks were more nomadic or lived in caves and forests.\n\nGiven this, option D seems the most accurate. Caityavasis were likely temple-dwelling renouncers in Jainism.\n\nTo confirm, I can think about the contrast between different types of Jain monks. For example, in the Digambara sect, there are Acharyas who lead the monastic order and might be associated with temples, while other monks lead more ascetic lives. Similarly, in \u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara, there are different orders like Murtipujaka, Sthanakavasi, and Terapanthi, each with their own approaches to temple worship and monastic life.\n\nCaityavasis might be a term for those who are closely associated with temple life, perhaps involved in the maintenance of the temple, conducting pujas, and providing guidance to laypeople.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"caityavasis\" refers to a specific sect or subgroup within Jainism. I know that Jainism has had various subtraditions and sects over its history, some of which may have been known by such names.\n\nBut based on the literal meaning and the context provided in the question, I think D. Temple-dwelling renouncers is the correct answer.\n\nJust to double-check, I'll consider if any of the other options make sense.\n\nOption A mentions householders who supported renouncers. While it's true that laypeople support renouncers in Jainism, calling them \"caityavasis\" doesn't seem right because they are not renouncers themselves.\n\nOption B, orthodox interpreters of the scriptures, could be monks or scholars, but again, I don't think \"caityavasis\" specifically denotes scriptural interpreters.\n\nOption C, women ascetics who lived in communities, might be referring to Jain nuns who live in sanghas, but I don't recall any specific group called caityavasis within Jain nuns.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that D. Temple-dwelling renouncers is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
