                    "text": "When capacitors are connected in parallel, their equivalent capacitance is simply the sum of their individual capacitances. So, if you have four capacitors each of 40 \u00b5F connected in parallel, the equivalent capacitance \\( C_{\\text{eq}} \\) would be:\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{eq}} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4 \\]\n\nSince all capacitors are identical and each has a capacitance of 40 \u00b5F:\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{eq}} = 40 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F = 160 \\, \\mu F \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 160 \u00b5F.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn a parallel circuit, the voltage across each capacitor is the same, but the charge can be different. The total charge stored in the system is the sum of the charges on each capacitor. Since capacitance is defined as the ratio of charge to voltage (\\( C = \\frac{Q}{V} \\)), when voltages are equal, the equivalent capacitance is the sum of individual capacitances.\n\nThis is in contrast to capacitors connected in series, where the equivalent capacitance is given by the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{C_1} + \\frac{1}{C_2} + \\frac{1}{C_3} + \\frac{1}{C_4} \\]\n\nBut in this case, since the capacitors are in parallel, we use the addition rule directly.\n\n**Additional Insight:**\n\nIt's worth noting that connecting capacitors in parallel increases the total energy storage capacity of the system because the total charge that can be stored increases. This is similar to having multiple buckets in parallel to hold more water; each bucket represents a capacitor storing a certain amount of charge.\n\nIn practical applications, if you need a larger capacitance than what a single capacitor can provide, you can connect multiple capacitors in parallel to achieve the desired total capacitance.\n\n**Common Misconceptions:**\n\nOne common mistake is to confuse the rules for series and parallel connections of capacitors. For capacitors in series, the equivalent capacitance is less than the smallest individual capacitance because the effect is similar to having a single capacitor with a larger distance between plates, which reduces capacitance.\n\nAnother misconception is that capacitance is always additive, regardless of the connection type. However, as shown, the method of combination (series or parallel) determines how capacitances are combined mathematically.\n\n**Practice Problem:**\n\nIf you have three capacitors of 20 \u00b5F, 40 \u00b5F, and 60 \u00b5F connected in parallel, what is the equivalent capacitance of the system?\n\n**Solution:**\n\n\\[ C_{\\text{eq}} = 20 \\, \\mu F + 40 \\, \\mu F + 60 \\, \\mu F = 120 \\, \\mu F \\]\n\nSo, the equivalent capacitance is 120 \u00b5F.\n\n**Real-World Application:**\n\nIn power supply circuits, large capacitors are often connected in parallel to smooth out voltage fluctuations and store electrical energy. By using multiple smaller capacitors in parallel, engineers can achieve the necessary total capacitance while considering factors like cost, size, and reliability.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Capacitors in parallel: \\( C_{\\text{eq}} = C_1 + C_2 + \\cdots + C_n \\)\n- Total charge is the sum of individual charges.\n- Voltage across each capacitor is the same.\n- Equivalent capacitance increases with more capacitors in parallel.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{160 \\, \\mu F} \\]"
