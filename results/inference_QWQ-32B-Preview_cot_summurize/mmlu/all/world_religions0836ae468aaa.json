In ascetic renunciation\n\nD. In the life of the householder\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Sikhism teaches about liberation. I know that in Sikhism, liberation is about achieving Moksha, which is freedom from the cycle of birth and death. It's about merging with God or achieving a state of union with the divine.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. In the community:\n\nSikhism places a strong emphasis on the community, or Sangat. Being part of the community is important for spiritual growth because you can learn from others, participate in prayers, and support one another. However, is the key to liberation specifically found in the community? While community is supportive, it might not be the primary key to liberation.\n\nB. In faith in God:\n\nThis seems promising. Sikhism is a monotheistic religion that emphasizes the importance of believing in one God. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, taught that salvation comes through devotion to God and living a righteous life. So, faith in God is certainly crucial.\n\nC. In ascetic renunciation:\n\nAsceticism involves renouncing worldly pleasures and leading a life of self-denial. In some religions, like certain branches of Hinduism and Buddhism, ascetic practices are seen as a path to liberation. However, in Sikhism, asceticism is not promoted as the way to achieve liberation. In fact, Sikh Gurus lived normal family lives and encouraged their followers to do the same.\n\nD. In the life of the householder:\n\nThis refers to living a normal family life, with responsibilities and duties. Sikhism places a lot of value on leading a household life and fulfilling one's duties in society. The concept of Kirat Karo, which means to earn an honest living, is central to Sikh teachings. So, living as a householder and fulfilling one's responsibilities seems to be an important part of Sikhism.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the key to liberation in Sikhism is found in faith in God, which is option B. However, I should also consider that in Sikhism, living a righteous life as a householder, while having faith in God, is the path to liberation. So, perhaps there's a combination here, but since I have to choose one option, I'll go with B. In faith in God.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check. I recall that Sikhism emphasizes three main principles: Naam Japo, Kirat Karo, and Vand Chhako. Naam Japo means meditating on God's name, Kirat Karo means earning an honest living, and Vand Chhako means sharing with others. So, it seems like a balanced approach that includes both spiritual practices and worldly responsibilities.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option D, In the life of the householder, is also a strong candidate because it aligns with leading a normal life while practicing Sikh principles.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If I consider that faith in God is essential but needs to be accompanied by actions in the world, then maybe the life of the householder, where one can practice both faith and worldly responsibilities, is the key to liberation in Sikhism.\n\nMoreover, Sikh Gurus themselves lived as householders and taught that renunciation is not necessary for achieving spiritual goals. So, perhaps the life of the householder is the preferred path in Sikhism.\n\nOn the other hand, faith in God is fundamental in any religion, including Sikhism, so it's hard to dismiss option B.\n\nMaybe I need to look at it more deeply. In Sikhism, the concept of Sangat and Pangat, which are community gatherings and communal meals, are important for spiritual growth. But again, while community is supportive, is it the key to liberation?\n\nI think the key to liberation in Sikhism is a combination of faith in God and living a righteous life as a householder. However, since I have to choose one option, I need to decide which one is more central.\n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards D. In the life of the householder, because it seems to encapsulate both the spiritual and worldly aspects that Sikhism emphasizes.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider option C, In ascetic renunciation. As I recall, Sikhism rejects asceticism and emphasizes leading a productive life in the world rather than renouncing it. So, option C is probably not the correct answer.\n\nOption A, In the community, while important for support and practice, may not be the sole key to liberation. It's more of a means to achieve liberation rather than the key itself.\n\nTherefore, between options B and D, I think D is a better choice because it encompasses both faith and action in the world, which seems to be the Sikh approach.\n\nSo, my answer is D. In the life of the householder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
