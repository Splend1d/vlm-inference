                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about neurons. I need to identify which statement is NOT true regarding the function of neurons. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire.\" I recall that after an action potential, there's a period where the neuron becomes less sensitive to stimuli, which is due to hyperpolarization. This refractory period helps prevent the neuron from firing too rapidly. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B states: \"The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential.\" Yeah, that's right. When voltage-gated sodium channels open, sodium ions rush into the neuron, making the inside more positive. That's the depolarization phase of the action potential.\n\nOption C says: \"The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\" Hmm, I think this might be the one. I believe neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminals, not from the dendrites. Dendrites are more for receiving signals, whereas axon terminals are for sending signals. So, this might be the incorrect statement.\n\nOption D: \"An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential.\" That sounds accurate. The axon hillock is a key area where the decision to fire an action potential is made, based on the sum of all incoming signals reaching the threshold.\n\nSo, between these options, option C seems to be the one that's not true, because neurotransmitters are released from axon terminals, not dendrites.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
