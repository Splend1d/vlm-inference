                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what a prima facie duty is. The question presents four options, and I need to choose the one that best describes a prima facie duty. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"seems to be right, although this might be illusory.\" This suggests that a prima facie duty appears to be the right thing to do, but that appearance could be misleading. So, it might not actually be right, even though it seems that way.\n\nOption B says: \"tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.\" This option suggests that a prima facie duty is generally right, but there could be other factors that make it not the best choice in a particular situation.\n\nOption C says: \"is right.\" This is straightforward: a prima facie duty is simply right.\n\nOption D says: \"is the first thing that an agent ought to do, above all else.\" This suggests that a prima facie duty has priority over other duties or considerations.\n\nI recall that \"prima facie\" is a Latin term that means \"at first glance\" or \"on the face of it.\" In ethics, prima facie duties are duties that appear to be obligatory at first glance, but they may not be absolutely binding when they conflict with more important duties.\n\nLet me think about this. If I have a prima facie duty to do something, it seems like I ought to do it, but perhaps there are exceptions or conflicting duties that might override it in certain situations.\n\nOption A says it seems right, but that might be illusory. That could be possible; sometimes our initial judgments about what's right can be mistaken.\n\nOption B says it tends to be right, but other considerations might outweigh it. This sounds similar to what I just thought about prima facie duties: they are generally right, but not always absolutely.\n\nOption C says it is right. But if it's a prima facie duty, doesn't that mean it's right only at first glance, and maybe not ultimately right?\n\nOption D says it's the first thing an agent ought to do, above all else. But doesn't that sound more like an absolute duty rather than something that's only prima facie?\n\nI think option B is the best choice here. Prima facie duties tend to be right, but they can be outweighed by other considerations, especially when they conflict with more stringent duties.\n\nTo confirm, let me think of an example. Suppose I have a prima facie duty to keep a promise to a friend. Generally, keeping promises is the right thing to do. However, if keeping that promise would harm someone else, say, if I promised to help my friend commit a crime, then that duty might be outweighed by the duty to avoid harming others.\n\nIn this case, the prima facie duty to keep the promise tends to be right, but it can be outweighed by other moral considerations, such as not participating in harmful actions.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to capture the essence of prima facie duties: they tend to be right, but other factors can make them not the best course of action in particular situations.\n\nOption A is close, but it suggests that the appearance of rightness might be illusory, which could imply that prima facie duties are often wrong. However, in ethics, prima facie duties are typically considered to be genuinely obligatory; it's just that they can be overridden by stronger duties in conflicting situations.\n\nOption C is too absolute; prima facie duties are not always absolutely right, as they can be superseded by more important duties.\n\nOption D suggests that prima facie duties have priority over all other considerations, which isn't accurate because that's what makes them only prima facie\u2014subject to being overridden by stronger duties.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I believe the correct answer is option B: \"tends to be right, although this might be outweighed by other considerations.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
