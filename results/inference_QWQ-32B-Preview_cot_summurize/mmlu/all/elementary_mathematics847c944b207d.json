                    "text": "Let's solve this addition problem step by step. I have to add 145, 281, and 62 together. I'll try to be careful with each step to make sure I get the right answer.\n\nFirst, I'll add 145 and 281.\n\n145\n\n+281\n\n------\n\nLet's add the units place: 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nNext, the tens place: 4 + 8 = 12. So, I'll write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 1 + 2 = 3, plus the carried over 1 makes it 4.\n\nSo, 145 + 281 = 426.\n\nNow, I need to add 62 to this sum.\n\n426\n\n+ 62\n\n------\n\nAgain, starting with the units place: 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nThen, the tens place: 2 + 6 = 8.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, 426 + 62 = 488.\n\nTherefore, the total is 488.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 426\n\nB. 488\n\nC. 946\n\nD. 1,046\n\nIt seems that 488 is option B.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst addition: 145 + 281.\n\n145\n\n+281\n\n------\n\nUnits: 5 + 1 = 6\n\nTens: 4 + 8 = 12 \u2192 write 2, carry 1\n\nHundreds: 1 + 2 + 1 (carried) = 4\n\nSo, 426 is correct.\n\nSecond addition: 426 + 62.\n\n426\n\n+ 62\n\n------\n\nUnits: 6 + 2 = 8\n\nTens: 2 + 6 = 8\n\nHundreds: 4 + 0 = 4\n\nSo, 488 is correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that when adding multiple numbers, it's sometimes helpful to group them differently or look for rounding possibilities to check the reasonableness of the answer.\n\nLet me try adding them in a different order.\n\nFirst, add 281 and 62.\n\n281\n\n+ 62\n\n------\n\nUnits: 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTens: 8 + 6 = 14 \u2192 write 4, carry 1\n\nHundreds: 2 + 0 + 1 (carried) = 3\n\nSo, 281 + 62 = 343.\n\nNow, add this to 145.\n\n145\n\n+343\n\n------\n\nUnits: 5 + 3 = 8\n\nTens: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nHundreds: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nAgain, 488.\n\nSo, consistent result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can add the numbers by breaking them into hundreds, tens, and units.\n\n145 = 100 + 40 + 5\n\n281 = 200 + 80 + 1\n\n62 = 60 + 2\n\nNow, add the hundreds: 100 + 200 = 300\n\nAdd the tens: 40 + 80 + 60 = 180\n\nAdd the units: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8\n\nNow, sum these up: 300 + 180 = 480 + 8 = 488.\n\nAgain, 488.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use mental math.\n\nStarting with 145, add 281.\n\n145 + 281:\n\nI can think of it as 145 + 200 = 345, then 345 + 80 = 425, then 425 + 1 = 426.\n\nThen, add 62 to 426.\n\n426 + 62:\n\n426 + 60 = 486, then 486 + 2 = 488.\n\nSame answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use subtraction to check.\n\nIf I have the total and subtract the numbers, I should get zero.\n\nLet's see:\n\n488 - 145 = 343\n\n343 - 281 = 62\n\n62 - 62 = 0\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use estimation to see if 488 makes sense.\n\n145 is about 150, 281 is about 280, and 62 is about 60.\n\n150 + 280 = 430\n\n430 + 60 = 490\n\nSo, 488 is close to 490, which matches my estimation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that 488 is the correct answer.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 488.\n\nBut the user says the answer is 488, which is option B.\n\nHowever, the user also mentions that the correct option is C, which is 946, but according to my calculations, that's incorrect.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nLet me double-check the addition once more.\n\n145 + 281 + 62.\n\n145 + 281 = 426\n\n426 + 62 = 488\n\nYes, definitively 488.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to be done in a different way, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are negative numbers or some other trick, but given the numbers are all positive and straightforward, I don't see any trick here.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the correct answer is indeed 488, which is option B.\n\nIt's possible that there is an error in the provided options or the answer key.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misprint in the question, and one of the numbers is different, but as given, 145 + 281 + 62 = 488.\n\nIn any case, based on the provided numbers and standard addition, the answer is 488.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
