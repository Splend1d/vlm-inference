                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about statutes and what they're often called. The options are quasi, qualified, collaborated, and codified law. I think I need to recall what statutes are and how they relate to the legal system.\n\nSo, statutes are laws that are enacted by legislative bodies, like Congress or Parliament. They're written laws that are passed through a formal process and then become part of the legal system. I remember that these laws are often collected and organized into codes or collections, especially at the state or provincial level in the U.S. or other countries.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Quasi - I think \"quasi\" means something that is similar to something else but not exactly the same. Like quasi-judicial, which means something that has some characteristics of a judicial process but isn't exactly that. So, quasi law might mean something that's like law but not entirely law. But I don't think that fits with statutes.\n\nB. Qualified - This seems like it would mean that the law is limited or has certain conditions attached to it. While it's true that laws often have qualifications or exceptions, I don't think \"qualified law\" is a term used to describe statutes.\n\nC. Collaborated - This word usually refers to working together or collaborating with others. I don't see how that would apply to statutes. Maybe if laws are created through collaboration between different branches of government, but that doesn't seem directly relevant here.\n\nD. Codified - This term comes to mind when thinking about statutes because codification is the process of collecting and arranging laws into a systematic code. Statutes are often codified into legal codes, like the United States Code or state codes. So, it makes sense that statutes would be referred to as codified law.\n\nLet me double-check. If statutes are laws that are written and enacted by legislatures, and they're organized into codes, then calling them codified law seems accurate. On the other hand, quasi law might refer to something like case law or judicial decisions that have the force of law but aren't statutes. Qualified law doesn't seem like a standard legal term in this context, and collaborated law doesn't make much sense.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. codified.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
