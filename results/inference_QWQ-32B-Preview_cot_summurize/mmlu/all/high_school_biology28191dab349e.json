                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these options represents the smallest unit that natural selection can change. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. a species' gene frequency\n\nB. a population's gene frequency\n\nC. an individual's genome\n\nD. an individual's genotype\n\nFirst, I need to understand what natural selection is. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time because they affect the survival and reproduction of organisms. So, it's about how traits spread or disappear in a group of organisms.\n\nNow, let's consider what each option is referring to:\n\nA. A species' gene frequency: This is about the distribution of genes across an entire species. A species can consist of multiple populations, so this is a broad level.\n\nB. A population's gene frequency: This is about the distribution of genes within a specific population. A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area and interbreed.\n\nC. An individual's genome: This is the complete set of genes in one organism.\n\nD. An individual's genotype: This refers to the specific combinations of genes that an individual has, particularly at specific locations in the genome.\n\nSo, natural selection acts on variations within a population. Individuals with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits to the next generation. Over time, this can lead to changes in the frequency of those traits in the population.\n\nBut, can natural selection act on an individual's genome or genotype directly?\n\nWell, natural selection doesn't directly change an individual's genome or genotype. An individual's genome is set at conception, and while some mutations can occur during an individual's lifetime, natural selection doesn't cause those mutations. Instead, natural selection acts on the variations that already exist in a population.\n\nSo, perhaps the smallest unit that natural selection can change is an individual's genotype, in the sense that individuals with certain genotypes are more likely to survive and reproduce, thus passing those genotypes to the next generation.\n\nBut wait, if we're talking about changing frequencies, then it's really about the population over time. Individual genotypes don't change; they are passed on as is to offspring.\n\nSo, maybe it's the population's gene frequency that natural selection changes, as the proportions of different genotypes change over generations.\n\nOption B seems plausible.\n\nOption A, a species' gene frequency, is broader because a species can have multiple populations. Maybe natural selection acts at the population level and then, over time, affects the species as a whole.\n\nOption C, an individual's genome, doesn't make sense because natural selection doesn't change an individual's genome during their lifetime.\n\nOption D, an individual's genotype, is similar to C. Again, natural selection doesn't change an individual's genotype; it affects which genotypes are more likely to be passed on.\n\nSo, perhaps the smallest unit is a population's gene frequency, since natural selection acts on the variation within a population and can change the frequencies of different genes over generations.\n\nBut let's think about this again. Is there a smaller unit than a population's gene frequency?\n\nWell, a population consists of individuals, each with their own genotypes. So, in a way, the individual genotypes are the building blocks of the population's gene frequency.\n\nBut natural selection doesn't act on individual genotypes independently; it acts on the population level by affecting the reproductive success of individuals with certain genotypes.\n\nSo, while the individual's genotype is important because it determines the organism's traits, natural selection doesn't change that genotype; it just influences how common that genotype becomes in the population over time.\n\nTherefore, the unit that natural selection changes is the population's gene frequency, as the proportions of different genotypes change based on their fitness.\n\nOption B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption A, a species' gene frequency, is larger than a population's gene frequency, so it's not the smallest unit.\n\nOption C and D, an individual's genome and genotype, are smaller in a sense, but natural selection doesn't change these directly; it changes their frequencies in the population.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B: a population's gene frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
