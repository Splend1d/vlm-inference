The question is: \"Therapists considering working with elderly persons should especially keep in mind that, on most variables, the elderly...\" and then it lists four options:\n\nA. seldom make good candidates for psychotherapy\n\nB. have very few issues that can be addressed meaningfully in psychotherapy\n\nC. usually have great difficulty learning and remembering things\n\nD. show greater within-age-group differences than younger persons\n\nI need to choose the most accurate statement among these options. Let's think about each one.\n\nOption A says that elderly people seldom make good candidates for psychotherapy. But I know that many elderly people can benefit from therapy, especially for issues like grief, adjustment to retirement, or coping with chronic illness. So, this seems too generalized and negative.\n\nOption B suggests that they have very few issues that can be addressed meaningfully in psychotherapy. Again, this doesn't seem right because elderly people face unique challenges that can certainly be addressed in therapy.\n\nOption C states that they usually have great difficulty learning and remembering things. While it's true that some elderly people may experience cognitive decline, it's not accurate to generalize that all of them have this difficulty. Many remain sharp well into old age.\n\nOption D says that they show greater within-age-group differences than younger persons. This seems plausible because aging affects people differently. Some may remain very active and cognitively intact, while others may experience more difficulties. So, there's likely to be a wider range of abilities and needs within an older age group compared to a younger one.\n\nConsidering all these, option D seems to be the most accurate statement. Therapists need to be aware that elderly clients are a diverse group, and their needs can vary greatly. It's important to assess each individual's capabilities and tailor the therapy accordingly.\n\nI think the key point here is the diversity within the elderly population. Therapists should avoid making assumptions based on age and instead focus on the unique qualities and needs of each client.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
