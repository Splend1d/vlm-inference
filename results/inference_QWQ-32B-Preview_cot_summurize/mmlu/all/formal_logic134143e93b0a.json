The sentence is: \"Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad.\" We need to translate this into predicate logic and choose the best option among the given choices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"if and only if\" means in logic. It's a biconditional statement, which means both conditions are equivalent. So, \"A if and only if B\" means that A is true exactly when B is true, and vice versa.\n\nIn this case, \"Caroline is sweet if, and only if, Janet is engaged to Brad\" means that Caroline being sweet is equivalent to Janet being engaged to Brad.\n\nNow, let's look at the predicates. We need to define what each predicate represents.\n\nAssuming:\n\n- C: Caroline\n\n- s: sweet\n\n- J: Janet\n\n- B: Brad\n\n- e: engaged to\n\nSo, \"Caroline is sweet\" can be represented as s(C) or Cs, depending on the notation.\n\nSimilarly, \"Janet is engaged to Brad\" can be represented as e(J,B) or EjB, again depending on the notation.\n\nGiven that, the biconditional statement would be something like s(C) \u2261 e(J,B).\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Cs \u2283 Ej\n\nThis is a conditional statement, not a biconditional. The symbol \"\u2283\" typically represents implication, meaning \"if Cs, then Ej.\" But our original statement requires a biconditional, so this isn't correct.\n\nB. Sc \u2261 Ej\n\nHere, \"Sc\" might be interpreted as \"sweet Caroline\" or \"C is sweet,\" and \"Ej\" as \"engaged Janet\" or \"J is engaged.\" The symbol \"\u2261\" represents equivalence, which is what we need for \"if and only if.\" So this seems promising.\n\nC. sC \u2261 eJ\n\nThis looks similar to option B, but with lowercase letters. However, in predicate logic, capital letters typically represent predicates, and lowercase letters represent constants or variables. So this might not be standard notation.\n\nD. Sx \u2261 Jy\n\nThis introduces variables x and y, which aren't present in the original statement. The original statement is about specific individuals: Caroline and Janet, with Janet being engaged to Brad. So introducing variables doesn't seem appropriate here.\n\nBetween options B and C, option B uses capital letters for predicates and constants, which is more standard in predicate logic. Option C uses lowercase for predicates, which is not conventional.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option B: Sc \u2261 Ej.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
