                    "text": "Let's start by trying to understand the given equation of the circle: \\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\). Hmm, this doesn't look like the standard form of a circle equation, which is usually \\((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius.\n\nFirst, I need to rearrange and simplify this equation to get it into the standard form. Let's move all terms to one side:\n\n\\(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\\)\n\nI can divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\n\\(x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10 = 0\\)\n\nNow, I need to complete the square for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nStarting with \\(x\\):\n\n\\(x^2 - 6x\\)\n\nTo complete the square, I take half of the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is -6, half of that is -3, and then square it to get 9. So, I add and subtract 9:\n\n\\(x^2 - 6x + 9 - 9\\)\n\nThis becomes \\((x - 3)^2 - 9\\)\n\nNow for \\(y\\):\n\n\\(y^2 + 2y\\)\n\nHalf of 2 is 1, squared is 1. Add and subtract 1:\n\n\\(y^2 + 2y + 1 - 1\\)\n\nThis becomes \\((y + 1)^2 - 1\\)\n\nNow, substitute these back into the equation:\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 - 10 = 0\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 20 = 0\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\\)\n\nAh, now it's in the standard form! The center of the circle is at \\((3, -1)\\) and the radius is \\(\\sqrt{20}\\).\n\nNow, the problem states that this circle is inscribed inside a square that has a pair of sides parallel to the x-axis. That means the square is aligned with the axes, and the circle touches all four sides of the square.\n\nIn such a case, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.\n\nThe diameter of the circle is \\(2r = 2\\sqrt{20}\\)\n\nTherefore, the side length of the square is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\)\n\nTo find the area of the square, we square the side length:\n\n\\((2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \\times 20 = 80\\)\n\nSo, the area of the square is 80.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 80\n\nB. \\sqrt{20}\n\nC. 2\\sqrt{20}\n\nD. 20\n\nIt seems that option A is correct.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n\\(2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20\\)\n\nRearranged to:\n\n\\(2x^2 + 2y^2 - 12x + 4y - 20 = 0\\)\n\nDivided by 2:\n\n\\(x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 2y - 10 = 0\\)\n\nCompleting the square:\n\nFor \\(x\\): \\(x^2 - 6x\\) \u2192 \\((x - 3)^2 - 9\\)\n\nFor \\(y\\): \\(y^2 + 2y\\) \u2192 \\((y + 1)^2 - 1\\)\n\nSubstituted back:\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 - 9 + (y + 1)^2 - 1 - 10 = 0\\)\n\nSimplified:\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - 20 = 0\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\((x - 3)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 20\\)\n\nRadius is \\(\\sqrt{20}\\), diameter is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\), side of square is \\(2\\sqrt{20}\\), area is \\( (2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the geometry. Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the square's sides are tangent to the circle. Given that the circle touches all four sides, the distance from the center of the circle to any side of the square is equal to the radius.\n\nGiven that the square has sides parallel to the x-axis, the side lengths should be twice the radius, as the radius extends from the center to the side.\n\nTherefore, side length = \\(2r = 2\\sqrt{20}\\), and area = \\( (2\\sqrt{20})^2 = 80 \\)\n\nThis confirms the answer.\n\nI think option A, 80, is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{80} \\]"
