                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Both statements are about groups of order 42 and their normal subgroups, specifically of orders 7 and 8. I need to determine the truth value of each statement and then choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, some background: A group of order \\( n \\) is a set with \\( n \\) elements that follows specific algebraic rules under a defined operation. A subgroup is a subset of the group that is itself a group under the same operation. A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by members of the group; this is important because normal subgroups are used to construct quotient groups.\n\nStatement 1: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nTo analyze this, I'll use Sylow's Theorems, which are powerful tools for determining the number and properties of subgroups of certain orders in a finite group.\n\nThe order of the group is 42. Let's factorize 42:\n\n\\[ 42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7 \\]\n\nSo, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 7.\n\nSylow's Theorems tell us about the number of Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups for each prime \\( p \\) dividing the order of the group. A Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup is a subgroup of order \\( p^k \\), where \\( p^k \\) is the highest power of \\( p \\) dividing the order of the group.\n\nFor \\( p = 7 \\), the highest power is \\( 7^1 = 7 \\), since \\( 7 \\) divides \\( 42 \\) but \\( 49 = 7^2 \\) does not.\n\nLet \\( n_7 \\) be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups. By Sylow's Theorems:\n\n1. \\( n_7 \\) divides the index of the Sylow 7-subgroup in the group, which is \\( [G : P] = \\frac{|G|}{|P|} = \\frac{42}{7} = 6 \\). So, \\( n_7 \\) divides 6.\n\n2. \\( n_7 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7} \\).\n\nThe possible divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nAmong these, the only one congruent to 1 modulo 7 is \\( n_7 = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, which must be normal (since it is unique; all conjugates of a Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroup are also Sylow \\( p \\)-subgroups, and if there's only one, it's invariant under conjugation).\n\nSo, every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is True.\n\nNow, Statement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nWait a minute, the order of the group is 42, and 8 does not divide 42. Since 8 = 2^3 and 42 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, the highest power of 2 dividing 42 is 2^1 = 2. Therefore, there cannot be a subgroup of order 8 in a group of order 42, because 8 does not divide 42.\n\nThis violates Lagrange's Theorem, which states that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is False.\n\nSo, combining both statements:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice is C. True, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
