She has to be the seventh caller to win concert tickets, so she repeats the number to herself several times while pulling over to make the call. The question is asking about the memory technique she's using to remember the phone number.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of the options means.\n\nA. Iconic memory: I think this has something to do with visual memory, like when you see something and can hold that image in your mind for a short time. But in this case, Elise is remembering a phone number, which is auditory information, not visual. So maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. Elaborative rehearsal: This sounds like a method where you try to understand and relate new information to what you already know to make it more meaningful. For example, if you were trying to remember a number by associating it with dates or other significant numbers. But the question says she's just repeating the number several times, not really connecting it to other information.\n\nC. Chunking: This is a technique where you break down information into smaller chunks to make it easier to remember. For example, remembering a phone number as three separate parts: the area code, the first three digits, and the last four digits. But the question doesn't mention her breaking the number down into parts; it just says she's repeating it several times.\n\nD. Maintenance rehearsal: This seems like the basic repetition of information to keep it active in short-term memory. Like when you repeat a phone number over and over to remember it long enough to dial it. That sounds a lot like what Elise is doing.\n\nSo, considering that, it seems like maintenance rehearsal is the most appropriate answer here. She's repeating the number to keep it in her short-term memory until she can call in.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another aspect to it.\n\nIconic memory doesn't fit because it's visual, and the number is auditory.\n\nElaborative rehearsal involves deeper processing and making connections, which isn't mentioned here. She's just repeating the number.\n\nChunking is about organizing information into manageable units, but again, the question doesn't indicate that she's breaking the number down into chunks.\n\nTherefore, maintenance rehearsal makes the most sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
