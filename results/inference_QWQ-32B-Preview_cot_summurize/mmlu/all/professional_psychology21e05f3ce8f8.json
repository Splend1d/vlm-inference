A biographical inventory\n\nPredictive validity refers to how well a selection tool can forecast an individual's future job performance. Among the options provided:\n\n- A projective technique (Option A) involves interpreting an individual's responses to ambiguous stimuli, which can be subjective and less reliable for predicting job performance.\n\n- An objective personality inventory (Option B) measures personality traits but may not directly correlate with job-specific skills or performance.\n\n- An interview by the personnel manager (Option C) can be influenced by interviewer bias and may not always accurately predict job performance.\n\n- A biographical inventory (Option D) is a structured questionnaire that gathers detailed information about an individual's background, experiences, and achievements. It can provide valuable insights into an individual's potential for success in a particular role, making it a more reliable predictor of job performance.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the most effective selection methods often involve a combination of tools to get a comprehensive understanding of a candidate's suitability for a role."
