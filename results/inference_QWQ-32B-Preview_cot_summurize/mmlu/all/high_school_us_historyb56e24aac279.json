It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But that is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness. It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods. But most of all, the Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor.\"\nLyndon Johnson, Remarks at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1964\nAll of the following were part of Johnson's Great Society program EXCEPT\n\nA. the Civil Rights Act of 1964\nB.

                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which one of these options wasn't part of Johnson's Great Society program. So, first, I should probably recall what the Great Society program was all about.\n\nI remember that President Lyndon B. Johnson introduced the Great Society in the 1960s. It was a set of domestic programs designed to reduce poverty, racial injustice, and improve education, healthcare, and the environment. It was a major initiative that aimed to improve the quality of life for all Americans.\n\nOption A is the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I think that was a key part of the Great Society. Johnson was instrumental in pushing this through Congress to address racial inequality and discrimination. So, that seems like it would be included.\n\nOption B mentions Medicare and Medicaid. I know that Medicare provides health insurance for seniors, and Medicaid for low-income individuals. These were both established under the Great Society to expand access to healthcare. So, that probably counts.\n\nOption C is the establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). I believe HUD was created to address housing issues and urban development, which aligns with the Great Society's goals of improving living conditions and reducing poverty. So, that seems relevant too.\n\nOption D is the balanced budget mandate. Now, I'm not sure about this one. I don't recall balanced budget being a central part of the Great Society program. In fact, the Great Society involved increased government spending on social programs, which might have led to deficits rather than a balanced budget.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The Great Society was about expanding government programs to address social issues, which typically requires more spending. A balanced budget mandate would require that government spending doesn't exceed its revenues, which might conflict with the expansionary nature of the Great Society programs.\n\nMoreover, looking back at the historical context, the 1960s were a time of increased government intervention in the economy and society, with the belief that government could solve many problems. A balanced budget might not have been a priority compared to addressing poverty and inequality.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that during Johnson's presidency, the country was also involved in the Vietnam War, which was costly. So, there were both social spending increases and military spending, which might have made balancing the budget difficult.\n\nGiven all that, I think the balanced budget mandate was not a part of the Great Society program. Instead, it was more about using government spending to achieve social goals, even if it meant running deficits.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. the balanced budget mandate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
