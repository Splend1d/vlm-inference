Because when the product goes straight from the producer to the final customer without any intermediaries, that's called a direct channel. For example, when you buy something directly from the manufacturer's website, that's a direct channel. Indirect would involve some middlemen like retailers or distributors, and hybrid might be a combination of both direct and indirect channels. So, in this case, since it's directly from the producer to the customer, it should be direct."
