                    "text": "So I have this problem: write 4 and 4 over 5 as an improper fraction. The options are A) 28 over 5, B) 4 over 5, C) 24 over 5, and D) 20 over 5. Okay, first I need to understand what \"4 and 4 over 5\" means. It's a mixed number, right? So, it's 4 whole units and an additional 4/5.\n\nI remember that to convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, I need to multiply the whole number by the denominator of the fractional part, and then add the numerator. That sum becomes the new numerator, and the denominator stays the same.\n\nSo, in this case, the whole number is 4, and the fractional part is 4/5. The denominator is 5.\n\nFirst, multiply 4 (the whole number) by 5 (the denominator): 4 times 5 is 20.\n\nThen, add the numerator of the fractional part: 20 plus 4 is 24.\n\nSo, the improper fraction should be 24 over 5.\n\nLooking at the options, C) 24 over 5 matches what I got.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as converting the whole number to fifths. Since 4 is the same as 20/5, and adding 4/5 to that would be 20/5 plus 4/5 equals 24/5. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the mixed number as 4 + 4/5, to add these, I need a common denominator. 4 is 20/5, so 20/5 + 4/5 is 24/5.\n\nSo, all these methods lead me to 24/5.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) 28/5\n\nB) 4/5\n\nC) 24/5\n\nD) 20/5\n\nOption C seems correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret \"4 and 4 over 5\". Maybe it's not a mixed number, but somehow 4 plus 4/5.\n\nWait, but that's exactly what a mixed number is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 4 multiplied by 4/5, but that would be 16/5, which isn't among the options.\n\nNo, the problem says \"write 4 and 4 over 5 as an improper fraction,\" which clearly indicates a mixed number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the wording.\n\nWait, let's consider if it's written as 4 4/5, that's 4 + 4/5, which is 24/5.\n\nAlternatively, if it's written as 4 and 4/5, same thing, 4 + 4/5.\n\nSo, I think 24/5 is correct.\n\nBut let's cross-verify with another method.\n\nLet me consider the definition of an improper fraction. It's a fraction where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.\n\n24/5 meets that criterion, as 24 is greater than 5.\n\nAlternatively, 28/5 is also greater than 5, but according to my calculation, it's 24.\n\nSimilarly, 20/5 is 4, which is the whole number part, but it doesn't account for the additional 4/5.\n\nAnd 4/5 is just the fractional part, not the whole mixed number.\n\nSo, again, 24/5 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should perform the division to check.\n\n24 divided by 5 is 4 with a remainder of 4, which is exactly the original mixed number, 4 and 4/5.\n\nSo, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to interpret \"and\" in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe it's 4 + 4/5, which is again 24/5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 4 multiplied by 4/5, but that would be 16/5, which isn't an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 4 divided by 4/5, but that's 4 * 5/4 = 5, which is 5/1, not among the options.\n\nSo, I think 24/5 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written differently, and I need to consider order of operations.\n\nBut given that it's a straightforward conversion of a mixed number to an improper fraction, I think 24/5 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options.\n\nOption D is 20/5, which is just 4, but again, that doesn't include the 4/5 part.\n\nSo, no, 24/5 is definitely the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as 4 * 5 + 4 = 24, and the denominator remains 5, so 24/5.\n\nYes, that's the standard method.\n\nSo, I'm confident with C) 24/5 as the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{24}{5}} \\]"
