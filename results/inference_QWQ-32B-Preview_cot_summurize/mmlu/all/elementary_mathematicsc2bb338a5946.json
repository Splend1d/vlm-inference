                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a tank shaped like a triangular prism. The base of the triangle has an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall. I need to find out how much water the tank can hold when it's full. The options are 1725, 1740, 3480, and 6960 cubic feet.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a prism. I think it's the area of the base times the height. Since it's a triangular prism, the base is a triangle, and I'm given its area, which is 116 square feet. The height of the prism is 30 feet.\n\nSo, volume should be base area times height, right? That would be 116 times 30. Let me calculate that.\n\n116 multiplied by 30. Well, 100 times 30 is 3000, and 16 times 30 is 480. So, 3000 plus 480 is 3480 cubic feet.\n\nLooking at the options, 3480 is one of them. But wait, maybe I need to consider something else. Is there any other factor that affects the volume here?\n\nThe problem says the base has an area of 116 square feet, and the tank is 30 feet tall. It seems straightforward. Volume of a prism is indeed base area times height.\n\nLet me double-check my multiplication. 116 times 30. Yes, that's 3480.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the units. It's in cubic feet, and the options are in ft^3, which matches.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"height\" of the prism is not 30 feet, or maybe I need to use a different formula. But no, for a prism, it's base area times height.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about the shape of the base. The base is a triangle with an area of 116 square feet. But since I have the area, I don't need to know the specific dimensions of the triangle, just its area.\n\nSo, volume = base area \u00d7 height = 116 \u00d7 30 = 3480 ft^3.\n\nBut 3480 is one of the options. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tank has some other features, like it's not a right prism or something, but the problem just says it's a triangular prism, and gives the base area and height.\n\nI think 3480 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let's consider if there's any other interpretation. Maybe the \"height\" of 30 feet is not the same as the length of the prism. In prisms, height is usually the distance between the two bases, which in this case would be the length of the prism.\n\nBut in any case, the volume formula remains the same: base area times height.\n\nSo, unless there's some trick here that I'm missing, I think 3480 ft^3 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me check again. 116 times 30 is 3480. Yes.\n\nSo, the tank would contain 3480 cubic feet of water when it's full.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3480 \\text{ ft}^3} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\nc"
