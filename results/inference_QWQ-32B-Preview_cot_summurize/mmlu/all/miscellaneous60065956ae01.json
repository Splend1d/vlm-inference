Asia.\n\nTo provide more context, tigers are one of the largest living cat species and are apex predators in their ecosystems. They are primarily found in various parts of Asia, including countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Russia (in the far eastern parts). Each of these regions may have subspecies of tigers adapted to local environments.\n\nIt's important to note that while tigers are Asian animals, there are also populations in zoos and wildlife reserves around the world, including in Africa, Europe, and the Americas. However, in the wild, they are exclusively Asian.\n\nSo, if the question is about where tigers can be found in the wild, the answer is Asia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
