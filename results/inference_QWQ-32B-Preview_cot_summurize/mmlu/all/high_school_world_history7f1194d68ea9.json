                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Ban Zhao, who wrote \"Lessons for a Woman\" around 80 C.E. It's giving advice on how women should behave and what their roles should be. It talks about being industrious, doing household chores diligently, serving their husbands properly, maintaining purity and order, and taking care of ancestral rituals. It emphasizes that if women follow these rules, they won't have a bad reputation or fall into disgrace.\n\nNow, the question is about how women's lives in the period from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. were more restricted compared to before the advent of sedentary societies. So, before sedentary societies, people were likely hunter-gatherers, living in more egalitarian societies where roles might have been more fluid between men and women.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family.\n\nB. Women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children.\n\nC. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n\nD. Women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere.\n\nFirst, option A seems contrary to what happened in sedentary societies. In hunter-gatherer societies, both men and women contributed to finding food, but in agricultural societies, men often took on more public roles, and women's work was often confined to the household and domestic duties. So, women might have been primary earners in hunter-gatherer societies but less so in sedentary societies.\n\nOption B says women were increasingly responsible for the care of their children. Well, caring for children has likely always been a female responsibility across different societies. So, it might not be the best answer for showing increased restriction.\n\nOption C suggests that women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere. The private sphere typically refers to the home and domestic duties, which aligns with the advice given in Ban Zhao's text. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D says women's power increasingly fell within the public sphere. But in the passage, it's all about women's roles within the household and serving their husbands, which is more aligned with the private sphere.\n\nGiven that, option C seems to fit best. It suggests that women's influence and power became more confined to the domestic realm, which aligns with the expectations outlined in Ban Zhao's text.\n\nMoreover, considering the historical context from 600 B.C.E. to 600 C.E., many societies were becoming more patriarchal and hierarchical, with clearer distinctions between male and female roles. Women's positions in public life might have diminished, pushing their activities and influence more into the private domain.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Women's power increasingly fell within the private sphere.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
