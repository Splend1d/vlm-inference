                    "text": "I'm trying to recall the principle established by the Supreme Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison. Let me think about this. I remember that Marbury v. Madison is a really important case in U.S. history, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.\n\nOption A says \"One man, one vote.\" I think that principle is related to ensuring equal representation or something like that. Maybe it's from a different case. Hmm.\n\nOption B is \"Separate but equal.\" I believe that's from Plessy v. Ferguson, where the Supreme Court allowed segregation as long as the facilities were equal. So, that probably isn't the right answer here.\n\nOption C is \"Judicial review.\" Now, that sounds familiar. I think Marbury v. Madison had something to do with the Court's power to review laws and determine their constitutionality. Let me see if I can remember more about that case.\n\nIn Marbury v. Madison, there was something about William Marbury suing James Madison, who was the Secretary of State, I think, to get a commission that he was supposed to receive. The Court, under Chief Justice John Marshall, decided that part of the law Marbury was relying on was unconstitutional, and therefore, the Court couldn't order Madison to give him the commission.\n\nWait, so the Court said that it couldn't issue the order because the law was unconstitutional. That means the Court has the power to decide what's constitutional and what's not. That sounds like judicial review.\n\nOption D is \"Right to privacy.\" I think that's more related to cases like Griswold v. Connecticut or Roe v. Wade, where the Court found a right to privacy in the Constitution, even though it's not explicitly mentioned.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like Option C, \"Judicial review,\" is the principle established by Marbury v. Madison. The Court established its authority to review acts of Congress and declare them unconstitutional if they conflict with the Constitution.\n\nI should probably look this up to make sure I have it right, but based on what I remember, I'm going to go with C. Judicial review.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
