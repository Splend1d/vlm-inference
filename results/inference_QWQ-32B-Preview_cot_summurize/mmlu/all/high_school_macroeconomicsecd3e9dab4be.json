                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to understand how automatic stabilizers work during economic expansions. So, first things first, what are automatic stabilizers? They are built-in mechanisms in the economy that help to stabilize economic fluctuations without the need for new government policies. They work automatically to smooth out business cycles.\n\nDuring an economic expansion, the economy is growing, unemployment is low, and overall economic activity is high. So, how do automatic stabilizers respond to this situation?\n\nLet me think about government expenditures. In an expansion, the economy is doing well, so perhaps government expenditures would decrease because less support is needed. For example, fewer people are unemployed, so less spending on unemployment benefits. Is that right?\n\nSimilarly, taxes. When the economy is expanding, people and businesses earn more income, so they pay more taxes automatically, assuming the tax rates remain the same. So, taxes would rise.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. If government expenditures fall during an expansion because less support is needed, and taxes rise because people are earning more, then that would mean the government is taking in more revenue and spending less. That should lead to a surplus, right? But I thought automatic stabilizers are supposed to counteract economic expansions to prevent overheating.\n\nLet me check what I've read about this. In economic expansions, automatic stabilizers should help to prevent the economy from growing too fast, which could lead to inflation. So, by taking more money out of the economy through higher taxes and spending less, it should help to cool down the economy.\n\nSo, based on that, it seems like government expenditures fall and taxes rise during economic expansions due to automatic stabilizers.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. and taxes fall.\n\nB. and taxes rise.\n\nC. rise and taxes fall.\n\nD. fall and taxes rise.\n\nIt seems like option D is the correct one: government expenditures fall and taxes rise during economic expansions.\n\nBut let me make sure. Is there any scenario where government expenditures rise during an expansion?\n\nWell, perhaps if the government is investing more in certain areas because the economy can handle it, but I think in the context of automatic stabilizers, government expenditures are supposed to decrease because less social spending is needed.\n\nAlso, regarding taxes, yes, as the economy expands, incomes rise, and with-progressive tax systems, higher incomes are taxed at higher rates, so total tax revenue increases.\n\nWait, but I should consider whether the tax system is progressive, proportional, or regressive. In many countries, including the United States, the tax system is progressive, meaning that higher incomes are taxed at higher rates. So, during an expansion, with higher incomes, more tax is collected automatically.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that during economic expansions, government expenditures fall (due to less need for social support) and taxes rise (due to higher incomes).\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider what happens during a recession. Automatic stabilizers should work in the opposite way: government expenditures rise (due to increased need for social support like unemployment benefits) and taxes fall (due to lower incomes). That would help to stimulate the economy and counteract the downturn.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, during expansions, expenditures fall and taxes rise, and during recessions, expenditures rise and taxes fall.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. fall and taxes rise.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
