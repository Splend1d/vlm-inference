                    "text": "All right, so I've got this problem here. There's a sphere, a cube, and a cylinder, and they all have the same mass. They're placed at the top of a really smooth incline, so smooth that there's negligible friction. They're released from rest, meaning they start at zero velocity. The question is, which one reaches the base of the incline first?\n\nOkay, first things first, let's understand the setup. The incline is short, and the surface is extremely slick, meaning friction is negligible. So, when these objects are released, they're going to slide down the incline without rotating, because there's not enough friction to cause rotation.\n\nWait a minute, but in real life, a sphere would roll down an incline if there's enough friction, right? Because the friction provides the torque needed to make it roll. But here, since friction is negligible, none of them are going to rotate. So, they're all just going to slide down the incline.\n\nNow, the question is, which one gets to the bottom first. Since they all have the same mass and they're on the same incline with negligible friction, I think they should all reach the bottom at the same time. Because the only force acting on them parallel to the incline is the component of gravity, which is m*g*sin(theta), where theta is the angle of the incline.\n\nSince mass m is the same for all of them, and gravity g is constant, and the angle theta is the same for all, the acceleration down the incline should be the same for all three objects. Therefore, their velocities as they slide down should be the same at any given time, and they should all reach the bottom together.\n\nBut wait, is there something I'm missing here? Maybe something to do with their shapes affecting their motion. Like, perhaps the sphere has a different moment of inertia or something, but since they're not rotating, that shouldn't matter, right?\n\nLet me think about potential energy. At the top of the incline, they all have the same potential energy, m*g*h, where h is the height of the incline. As they slide down, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is (1/2)*m*v^2, where v is their velocity.\n\nSince mass m is the same and it's present in both equations, it cancels out. So, the velocity should be the same for all of them at any point down the incline, including at the bottom.\n\nHmm, but the question is about which one reaches the base first. If they all have the same acceleration and start from rest, and the incline is the same length for all of them, then they should all take the same time to reach the bottom.\n\nI think the key here is that the friction is negligible, so none of them rotate; they all just slide down with the same acceleration due to gravity's component parallel to the incline.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. All reach the base at the same time.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's something about the shape affecting the way they slide. For example, does the sphere have less contact area, so maybe less friction, but since friction is already negligible, it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps air resistance could play a role, but the problem doesn't mention anything about air resistance, so I think we can ignore that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distribution of mass affects the motion, but since they all have the same mass and they're all sliding without rotating, I don't see how that would make a difference.\n\nSo, I stick with D. All reach the base at the same time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
