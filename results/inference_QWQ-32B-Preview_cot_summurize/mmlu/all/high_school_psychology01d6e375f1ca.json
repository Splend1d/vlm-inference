The question is asking which controversy this psychologist is most interested in. The options are:\n\nA. nature versus nurture\n\nB. continuity versus discontinuity\n\nC. stability versus change\n\nD. subjectivity versus objectivity\n\nOkay, so first, I need to understand what each of these controversies is about.\n\nStarting with A, nature versus nurture. This is a classic debate in psychology about whether our behaviors and traits are more influenced by our genetic inheritance (nature) or by our environment and experiences (nurture). So, it's about innate qualities versus learned behaviors.\n\nOption B is continuity versus discontinuity. This controversy is about how psychological development occurs over time. Does it happen smoothly and gradually (continuity), or does it happen in distinct stages with abrupt changes (discontinuity)?\n\nOption C, stability versus change, is about whether our personality and behavior remain stable throughout our lives or if they change significantly over time.\n\nLastly, option D, subjectivity versus objectivity, deals with whether psychological phenomena should be studied from an internal, personal perspective (subjectivity) or from an external, measurable perspective (objectivity).\n\nNow, the question is about a psychologist interested in whether development occurs in stages. Stages suggest distinct periods with different characteristics, which implies discontinuity in development.\n\nSo, if development occurs in stages, that would align more with discontinuity, because each stage is a distinct period with its own features, and transitions between stages can be abrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, continuity suggests a smooth and gradual change over time, without clear stages.\n\nTherefore, the psychologist interested in whether development occurs in stages is most interested in the continuity versus discontinuity controversy.\n\nLet me double-check this. If development happens in stages, that means there are specific points where significant changes occur, which is a discontinuous process. Conversely, continuity would suggest that development is a gradual, uninterrupted process.\n\nSo, yes, stages imply discontinuity.\n\nOption A, nature versus nurture, doesn't directly relate to whether development occurs in stages. It's more about what influences development, not the manner in which it occurs.\n\nOption C, stability versus change, is about whether traits remain the same or change over time, but again, not specifically about the process of development being staged or continuous.\n\nOption D, subjectivity versus objectivity, is about the approach to studying psychological phenomena, not about the nature of development.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant controversy is B, continuity versus discontinuity.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
