                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a spherical charge distribution where the volume charge density \u03c1 varies with the radius r according to the equation \u03c1 = a r, where a is a positive constant, and this distribution extends out to a radius R. We need to find out how the electric field strength E behaves at a distance r from the center for different regions: r > R and r < R.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Gauss's law, which relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the total charge enclosed by that surface. Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\Phi_E = \\oint \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nFor a spherical symmetry, the electric field E is radial and depends only on the distance r from the center. So, the flux simplifies to:\n\n\\[ E(r) \\times 4\\pi r^2 = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}(r)}{\\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nTherefore, the electric field is:\n\n\\[ E(r) = \\frac{Q_{\\text{enc}}(r)}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^2} \\]\n\nSo, to find E(r), I need to find the enclosed charge Q_enc(r) for a given r.\n\nLet's consider two cases: r > R and r < R.\n\n**Case 1: r > R**\n\nFor r > R, the entire charge distribution is enclosed within the Gaussian surface of radius r. Therefore, Q_enc(r) is the total charge Q_total.\n\nFirst, I need to find Q_total. The total charge is the integral of the charge density over the volume:\n\n\\[ Q_{\\text{total}} = \\int_{\\text{volume}} \\rho \\, dV \\]\n\nGiven that \u03c1 = a r and the volume element in spherical coordinates is dV = 4\u03c0 r^2 dr, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ Q_{\\text{total}} = \\int_{0}^{R} a r \\times 4\\pi r^2 \\, dr = 4\\pi a \\int_{0}^{R} r^3 \\, dr = 4\\pi a \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R} = 4\\pi a \\times \\frac{R^4}{4} = \\pi a R^4 \\]\n\nSo, for r > R, Q_enc(r) = \u03c0 a R^4.\n\nPlugging this into the electric field formula:\n\n\\[ E(r) = \\frac{\\pi a R^4}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^2} = \\frac{a R^4}{4 \\epsilon_0 r^2} \\]\n\nNow, let's see how E(r) behaves for r > R.\n\n- As r increases, E(r) decreases as 1/r^2.\n\n- As r approaches infinity, E(r) approaches zero.\n\nSo, option A (\"It increases as r approaches infinity.\") is not correct for r > R.\n\n**Case 2: r < R**\n\nFor r < R, the enclosed charge Q_enc(r) is the charge within a sphere of radius r.\n\nUsing the same integral as before, but with the upper limit r instead of R:\n\n\\[ Q_{\\text{enc}}(r) = \\int_{0}^{r} a r' \\times 4\\pi (r')^2 \\, dr' = 4\\pi a \\int_{0}^{r} (r')^3 \\, dr' = 4\\pi a \\left[ \\frac{(r')^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{r} = 4\\pi a \\times \\frac{r^4}{4} = \\pi a r^4 \\]\n\nSo, for r < R, Q_enc(r) = \u03c0 a r^4.\n\nPlugging this into the electric field formula:\n\n\\[ E(r) = \\frac{\\pi a r^4}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^2} = \\frac{a r^4}{4 \\epsilon_0 r^2} = \\frac{a r^2}{4 \\epsilon_0} \\]\n\nNow, let's see how E(r) behaves for r < R.\n\n- E(r) increases with r^2.\n\n- So, it increases non-linearly with r.\n\nTherefore, for r < R, the electric field increases non-linearly with r.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. It increases as r approaches infinity. (Not true for r > R, and not specific enough.)\n\nB. It decreases linearly for r > R. (Actually, it decreases as 1/r^2 for r > R.)\n\nC. It increases linearly for r > R. (Not true; it decreases as 1/r^2 for r > R.)\n\nD. It increases non-linearly for r < R. (This matches our finding for r < R.)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nHowever, let's double-check if there's any other option that could be true.\n\nOption A is incorrect because for r approaching infinity, E(r) approaches zero.\n\nOption B is incorrect because for r > R, E(r) decreases as 1/r^2, which is not linear.\n\nOption C is incorrect for the same reason as B; it decreases, not increases, and not linearly.\n\nOption D is correct based on our calculation for r < R.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
