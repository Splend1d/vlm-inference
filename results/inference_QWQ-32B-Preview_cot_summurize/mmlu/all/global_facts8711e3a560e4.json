                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about median international income as of 2020. The options are A. $300, B. $1,000, C. $10,000, and D. $30,000. I'm not exactly sure what \"median international income\" means, but I think it refers to the middle income when all the incomes of people around the world are ordered from lowest to highest.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what median means. Median is the middle value in a list of numbers arranged in order. So, in this case, it would be the income level where half of the world's population earns less and half earns more.\n\nNow, I need to find data on global income distribution for the year 2020. I recall that organizations like the World Bank, IMF, and OECD publish reports on income and poverty levels worldwide. Maybe I can look for a report from one of these institutions that provides information on median income.\n\nLet me consider the possible answers:\n\nA. $300 - That seems really low. I know that the international poverty line is around $2 or $3 a day, which annualizes to a few hundred dollars, but median income should be higher than that.\n\nB. $1,000 - This is still quite low. In many developing countries, the average income is higher than this.\n\nC. $10,000 - This seems more plausible. In many middle-income countries, the average income is around this level.\n\nD. $30,000 - This is the income level of high-income countries like the United States and Western Europe.\n\nI need to think about where the middle income lies globally. Given that a large portion of the world's population lives in countries like India and Africa, where incomes are lower, the median might be closer to the lower end.\n\nBut, on the other hand, China has a large middle class now, and their incomes have been increasing. So, maybe the median has shifted upwards in recent years.\n\nWait, the question is about 2020. I should look for data specifically from that year.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've seen any statistics on global income distribution recently.\n\nI remember that in 2018, the World Bank reported that the global median income was around $4,200 per year. But that was a few years ago, and incomes have likely changed since then.\n\nHowever, considering that, option B at $1,000 seems too low, and option D at $30,000 seems too high.\n\nOption C at $10,000 might be possible if there has been significant income growth, especially in countries like China and India.\n\nBut, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to estimate it.\n\nLet's think about the distribution of the world's population across different income groups.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, countries are classified as low-income (LICs), lower-middle-income (LMICs), upper-middle-income (UMICs), and high-income countries (HICs).\n\nAs of 2020, the income thresholds were:\n\n- Low-income: $1,085 or less\n\n- Lower-middle-income: $1,086 - $4,255\n\n- Upper-middle-income: $4,256 - $13,155\n\n- High-income: $13,156 or more\n\nNow, if I can find the proportion of the world's population in each of these categories, I can determine where the median lies.\n\nSuppose that the majority of the world's population is in lower-middle and upper-middle-income countries, then the median might be around the lower end of upper-middle, say around $4,256 to $10,000.\n\nAlternatively, if a large portion is still in low-income countries, the median might be closer to the higher end of low-income or lower-middle-income.\n\nI need actual data to make an informed guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are reports that directly state the global median income for 2020.\n\nI recall that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global incomes in 2020, with many people losing jobs and facing income reductions.\n\nHowever, I don't know exactly how that would affect the median income globally.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the pandemic might have pulled the median income down, but I'm not sure by how much.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B at $1,000 is too low, even considering the pandemic's impact.\n\nOption C at $10,000 seems more reasonable, assuming that many people in emerging economies like China and India have incomes around that level.\n\nOption D at $30,000 would be the income level of high-income countries, which are a minority of the world's population.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the global median is that high.\n\nOption A at $300 is way too low; that's below the international poverty line.\n\nSo, between options B and C, I'm leaning towards C. $10,000.\n\nBut to be sure, I should look for actual data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to estimate it based on population and income distributions.\n\nLet's assume that the world population in 2020 was about 7.8 billion.\n\nNow, if I could find out how many people earn below $1,000, below $10,000, and below $30,000, I could see where the median lies.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2018, about 8.6% of the world's population lived below $1.90 a day, which is around $700 annually.\n\nAssuming that has decreased slightly by 2020, but still, that's only a small portion of the population.\n\nHowever, many more people earn between $1.90 and $10 a day, which would annualize to between $700 and $3,650.\n\nSo, the lower end of the income spectrum is significant.\n\nBut again, with the rise of countries like China and India, a large middle class has emerged.\n\nAccording to some estimates, the global middle class, defined as people earning between $11 and $110 a day, which is approximately $4,000 to $40,000 annually, comprises a significant portion of the world's population.\n\nIf that's the case, then the median might be within this range.\n\nGiven that, option C at $10,000 seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if the median is below $10,000, then option B at $1,000 seems too low.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider purchasing power parity (PPP) when comparing incomes across countries.\n\nNominal income figures can be misleading due to differences in cost of living.\n\nMaybe the question refers to income in PPP terms.\n\nIf that's the case, then the median income would be higher when accounted for lower costs in developing countries.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the question specifies PPP or nominal terms.\n\nAssuming it's in nominal terms, then $10,000 seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, if it's in PPP terms, maybe the median is higher.\n\nBut without that specification, I'll assume nominal terms.\n\nAnother consideration is that the pandemic might have disproportionately affected lower-income earners, potentially lowering the global median income.\n\nHowever, without specific data, it's hard to quantify that impact.\n\nGiven all that, I'm going to guess that the median international income in 2020 was $10,000.\n\nSo, option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
