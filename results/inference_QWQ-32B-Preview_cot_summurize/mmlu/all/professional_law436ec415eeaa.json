                    "text": "After months of negotiations, the United States and Canada entered into a tax treaty that provided that neither country would impose income taxes on citizens of the other nation. The treaty, which was ratified by the Senate, was supported by professional baseball and hockey players. Many Canadian hockey players, who were employed by American teams and lived in the United States during the hockey season, lobbied for passage of the treaty, since they were subject to the payment of both U. S. and Canadian income taxes. In like manner, many American baseball players, who lived in Canada during the baseball season, objected to the same dual taxation. In violation of the treaty, a Canadian court convicted a U. S. citizen who resided in Canada, of illegally evading the payment of Canadian income taxes. The U. S. citizen, who was a member of a Canadian baseball team, resided in Canada during the baseball season. Following his conviction, the President announced that the previously effective tax treaty would no longer be abided by the United States. The President proclaimed that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty rendered it invalid. As a result, the President ordered the Internal Revenue Service to begin collecting income taxes from Canadian citizens residing in the United States in the same manner that it collects taxes from other residents of this country. A Canadian citizen and resident of the United States, sues in an appropriate federal court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the treaty with Canada remains valid and effective. Therefore, he contends that the Internal Revenue Service may not collect U. S. income taxes from him. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional basis that may be urged in support of this claim?\n\nA. The President's unilateral termination of a treaty benefiting residents of the United States cannot be effective until a hearing is afforded to persons who would be affected by such action.\nB. The courts have exclusive authority to determine whether a particular treaty has, in fact, been breached by another nation.\nC. A ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and, therefore, remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute.\nD. The treaty created a property right in Canadian citizens residing in the United States that cannot be taken away without just compensation.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here involving a tax treaty between the U.S. and Canada, and there's a bit of a mess with the President deciding to no longer abide by it. Then there's a Canadian citizen living in the U.S. who\u2019s suing to keep the treaty alive and prevent the IRS from taxing him. I need to find the strongest constitutional basis for his claim from the options given.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the treaty power is in the U.S. constitution. Article VI says that treaties are the supreme law of the land, right alongside the Constitution and federal statutes. So, any treaty ratified by the Senate has a lot of weight.\n\nOption A says that the President can't unilaterally terminate a treaty that benefits U.S. residents without giving affected persons a hearing. Hmm, I don't recall any specific constitutional provision that requires a hearing in such cases. It seems more like a procedural due process issue, but treaties are part of the law of the land, and their termination might not necessarily require a hearing. So, this one seems a bit weak.\n\nOption B claims that only the courts can determine if a treaty has been breached by another nation. Well, courts interpret the law, including treaties, but the executive branch, particularly the President, has a role in foreign affairs and enforcing treaties. It's possible that the President can make a determination about whether another country is upholding its treaty obligations, and the courts would review that decision under certain standards of deference. So, this doesn't seem like the strongest basis.\n\nOption C states that a ratified treaty is the supreme law of the land and remains effective until superseded by another treaty or statute. This seems solid. According to the Constitution, treaties are indeed the supreme law of the land, and they stay in effect unless changed by another treaty or a domestic law. The President can't just decide to stop abiding by a treaty; that would undermine the constitutional structure.\n\nOption D says that the treaty created a property right for Canadian citizens in the U.S., and that can't be taken away without just compensation. This is interesting. Perhaps the treaty could be seen as conferring a benefit\u2014a exemption from certain taxes\u2014that could be considered a property right. But I'm not sure if tax exemptions are generally considered property rights subject to the Takings Clause. It might be a stretch.\n\nComparing these options, C seems the strongest. The Constitution clearly makes treaties the supreme law of the land, and any attempt to invalidate or terminate a treaty unilaterally by the President might be unconstitutional, especially if the treaty has not been formally superseded by another treaty or a federal statute.\n\nMoreover, in the case of Medell\u00edn v. Texas (2008), the Supreme Court addressed the President's power to enforce treaties. The Court held that a non-self-executing treaty doesn't create directly enforceable federal law without implementing legislation. However, in this scenario, the treaty has already been ratified and is in effect, so it should be considered part of the supreme law of the land.\n\nAdditionally, the Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate, but it doesn't explicitly grant the President the power to unilaterally terminate treaties. Some might argue that the power to make treaties includes the power to terminate them, but that's not explicitly stated.\n\nThere is also the idea of international law, where treaties are supposed to be binding on the signatory countries unless terminated through agreed-upon procedures. If one party breaches the treaty, the other party might have remedies under international law, but unilaterally terminating a treaty without following proper procedures might not be acceptable.\n\nIn the scenario, the President is claiming that Canada's refusal to honor the treaty makes it invalid, so the U.S. won't abide by it either. However, whether this is a valid reason to terminate the treaty is debatable. It might be that only through formal procedures, perhaps involving both countries, can a treaty be terminated.\n\nTherefore, the Canadian citizen living in the U.S. would likely argue that the treaty remains the supreme law of the land and is still in effect, regardless of the President's proclamation, unless it has been properly terminated through diplomatic channels or superseded by new law.\n\nSo, among the options provided, C seems to be the strongest constitutional basis for the claim that the treaty remains valid and effective.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
