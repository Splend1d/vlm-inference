                    "text": "So I've got this question about ultraviolet light. It says that ultraviolet light has a wavelength of about 6 times 10 to the power of negative 8 meters, and I need to find out its frequency. The options are A) 5 times 10 to the 15 hertz, B) 0.5 hertz, C) 2 hertz, and D) 20 hertz. Hmm, I'm not completely sure about this, but I think there's a relationship between wavelength and frequency in light.\n\nI remember that speed, wavelength, and frequency are related by the equation: speed equals wavelength times frequency. In the case of light, the speed should be the speed of light, right? Which is approximately 3 times 10 to the 8 meters per second. So, if I have the wavelength, I can rearrange the equation to solve for frequency. That would be frequency equals speed divided by wavelength.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nFrequency = speed of light / wavelength\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nFrequency = (3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s) / (6 \u00d7 10^-8 m)\n\nNow, I need to divide these two numbers. First, I can simplify the constants: 3 divided by 6 is 0.5, and then for the exponents of 10, subtract the denominator's exponent from the numerator's: 10^8 divided by 10^-8 is 10^(8 - (-8)) = 10^(16).\n\nSo, frequency = 0.5 \u00d7 10^16 Hz\n\nBut 0.5 times 10 to the 16 is the same as 5 times 10 to the 15, because moving the decimal one place to the right increases the exponent by one.\n\nSo, frequency = 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option A. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\nSpeed of light: 3 \u00d7 10^8 m/s\n\nWavelength: 6 \u00d7 10^-8 m\n\nFrequency = (3 \u00d7 10^8) / (6 \u00d7 10^-8)\n\nDivide the coefficients: 3 / 6 = 0.5\n\nDivide the powers of 10: 10^8 / 10^-8 = 10^(8 - (-8)) = 10^16\n\nSo, 0.5 \u00d7 10^16 Hz, which is indeed 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz.\n\nAlright, that matches option A. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. Is there something specific about ultraviolet light that would affect this calculation? I don't think so, because this seems to be a general wave equation applicable to all electromagnetic waves, of which ultraviolet is a part.\n\nMoreover, I know that higher frequency corresponds to higher energy, and ultraviolet light is known to have higher frequency and energy compared to visible light, which makes sense with the calculated frequency being in the 10^15 hertz range.\n\nAlso, comparing with other options: 0.5 hertz, 2 hertz, and 20 hertz are all much lower frequencies, corresponding to much longer wavelengths, which wouldn't be in the ultraviolet range. So, option A seems to be the correct choice.\n\nJust to recall, the electromagnetic spectrum ranges from radio waves at low frequencies to gamma rays at high frequencies, with ultraviolet light falling between visible light and X-rays. Given that visible light has frequencies around 4 to 8 \u00d7 10^14 hertz, ultraviolet should have higher frequencies, which aligns with 5 \u00d7 10^15 hertz.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A) 5 \u00d7 10^15 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
