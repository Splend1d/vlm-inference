Life expectancy is a measure of the average number of years a person is expected to live based on the year of their birth, assuming that the current mortality rates continue to apply.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. U.S.A. - The United States is a developed country with a high standard of living and access to advanced medical care. However, life expectancy in the U.S. has been a topic of discussion due to various factors such as healthcare accessibility, lifestyle, and socioeconomic disparities.\n\nB. Sweden - Sweden is known for its strong social welfare systems and high standards of living. It is a country that invests heavily in public health and has a universal healthcare system.\n\nC. Japan - Japan is often noted for having some of the highest life expectancies in the world. The country is known for its healthy diet, active lifestyle, and excellent healthcare system.\n\nD. Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia is a Middle Eastern country with a high-income economy and access to modern medical facilities. However, life expectancy in Saudi Arabia may be influenced by factors such as climate, lifestyle, and healthcare infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the World Bank data from 2021, here are the life expectancies for these countries:\n\n- Japan: 84.6 years\n\n- Sweden: 83.2 years\n\n- United States: 78.5 years\n\n- Saudi Arabia: 75.6 years\n\nBased on this data, Japan has the highest life expectancy among the options provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Japan.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
