So, we have two scenarios, and we need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst up, Scenario 1: \"I consider friendly fire to be a serious hobby.\" Now, friendly fire is a term usually used in military contexts to describe incidents where troops accidentally shoot at or injure their own comrades. It's not something someone would typically consider a hobby, especially not a \"serious\" one. Considering something like friendly fire as a hobby seems twisted and inappropriate, to say the least. It suggests a morbid fascination with harm and injury, which goes against ordinary moral standards that value respect for human life and safety. So, this one probably counts as morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I gave the students an F for the semester for answering the questions correctly.\" This one sounds really bizarre. Typically, students are graded based on their performance, and answering questions correctly should lead to better grades, not worse. Giving students an F for correct answers seems completely backwards and unfair. As an educator, it's expected to evaluate students based on their knowledge and understanding, not to punish them for getting things right. This action would likely be seen as malicious or retaliatory, which is against the moral standards of fairness and justice in education. So, this also seems morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there might be any nuances or contexts that could make these actions not wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe someone is role-playing or simulating military scenarios in a controlled environment, and \"friendly fire\" is a concept they discuss or simulate. However, even in that context, considering it a \"serious hobby\" still seems problematic because it involves harm to others, even if it's just simulated. It's hard to see how glorifying or taking pleasure in such concepts isn't morally questionable.\n\nFor Scenario 2, there might be an extremely unusual situation where giving an F for correct answers makes sense, but it's hard to imagine a legitimate educational reason for doing so. It would probably be seen as abuse of power or some form of misconduct.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion remains that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, and the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
