This is done by dividing the total distance by the total time.\n\nSo, you have:\n\nDistance = 308 km\n\nTime = 4 hours\n\nUnit rate (speed) = Distance / Time = 308 km / 4 h\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n308 \u00f7 4 = 77\n\nTherefore, the unit rate is 77 km/h.\n\nSince the question asks to round to the nearest hundredth if necessary, and in this case, the result is a whole number, there's no need for rounding.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 77 km/h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
