It is better for them to be ruled thus.\"\nJuan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522\n\"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich of the following presidents was most involved in Latin American politics in the twentieth century?\n\nA.

Polk, James Monroe, Theodore Roosevelt, and Chester Arthur. Hmm, first I need to figure out which of these presidents served in the twentieth century.\n\nJames K. Polk was president from 1845 to 1849, that's the nineteenth century. James Monroe was president from 1817 to 1825, also nineteenth century. Chester Arthur was president from 1881 to 1885, still nineteenth century. That leaves Theodore Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, which is the twentieth century. So, he's the only one in the twentieth century, but I should check if any of the others had significant involvement in Latin American politics outside their presidency.\n\nWait, James Monroe is known for the Monroe Doctrine, which had a big impact on Latin American politics, but that was in 1823, which is the nineteenth century. So, even though it's influential, it's not in the twentieth century. James K. Polk is known for expanding the U.S. territory, including into areas that are now part of Latin America, but again, that's in the nineteenth century.\n\nChester Arthur, as far as I know, didn't have notable involvement in Latin American politics. So, that leaves Theodore Roosevelt. He was president at the beginning of the twentieth century, and I recall that he had some policies toward Latin America.\n\nOh, right, he's famous for the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. That was in 1904, I think. He essentially expanded the Monroe Doctrine to give the United States the right to intervene in Latin American countries to stabilize their economies and prevent European intervention. So, that seems like significant involvement in Latin American politics.\n\nAlso, he was involved in the construction of the Panama Canal, which required intervention in Panama's separation from Colombia in 1903. That was a direct involvement in Latin American politics.\n\nSo, compared to the other presidents listed, Theodore Roosevelt had the most involvement in Latin American politics in the twentieth century.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about other presidents in the twentieth century who might have been more involved. For example, Woodrow Wilson was president from 1913 to 1921. He intervened in Mexico during the Mexican Revolution and also in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. So, he had significant involvement in Latin American politics.\n\nHowever, Woodrow Wilson isn't one of the options. Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was president from 1933 to 1945, had the Good Neighbor Policy, which was aimed at improving relations with Latin American countries, but he's not on the list either.\n\nGiven that, among the options provided, Theodore Roosevelt is the only one who served in the twentieth century and had notable involvement in Latin American politics.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
