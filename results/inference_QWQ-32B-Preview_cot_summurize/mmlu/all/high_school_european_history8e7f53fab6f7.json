It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Erasmus and his impact compared to earlier humanists, based on Johan Huizinga's perspective. So, the question is: According to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant than that of earlier humanists because... and we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Erasmus was and what humanism entailed during his time. Erasmus was a Dutch Renaissance humanist, theologian, and philosopher who lived in the 15th and 16th centuries. Humanism during the Renaissance was a movement that emphasized the study of classical antiquity, particularly Greek and Roman literature, and the application of those insights to contemporary life and scholarship.\n\nNow, looking at the provided text, it seems that Huizinga is discussing Erasmus's work, specifically the \"Adagiorum Collectanea,\" which is a collection of proverbial sayings from Latin authors. This work was dedicated to Mountjoy and was meant to help those who wanted to write elegant Latin.\n\nHuizinga notes that Erasmus's approach was different from earlier humanists. While earlier humanists had somewhat monopolized classical culture, making it exclusive, Erasmus sought to bring this classical spirit to a wider audience. Although he wrote in Latin, which limited his direct influence to the educated classes, he still managed to spread the classical spirit more extensively and effectively than others.\n\nSo, according to Huizinga, Erasmus's legacy was more significant because he introduced the classical spirit to more people, making it less exclusive. Now, let's look at the options:\n\nA. He had more support from the Church.\n\nThe text doesn't really discuss Erasmus's support from the Church compared to earlier humanists. It focuses more on his educational impact and the dissemination of classical knowledge.\n\nB. He wrote in a language that was understandable to the masses, unlike his predecessors.\n\nThis is partially true, but with a caveat. Erasmus wrote in Latin, which was the language of the educated classes and not the common people. So, in that sense, he didn't write in a language understandable to the masses. However, his work still reached a broader audience within the educated sphere.\n\nC. He wrote exclusively about religious matters.\n\nActually, the text mentions that Erasmus's work, the \"Adagiorum Collectanea,\" is about classical sayings and their use in elegant Latin writing. It's not exclusively about religious matters, although Erasmus was a theologian and did write on religious subjects.\n\nD. He valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had.\n\nThis seems closest to Huizinga's assessment. Erasmus had a sincere love for humanity and its general culture, and he sought to introduce the classical spirit to a wider circle, not just limit it to a few humanists.\n\nGiven these considerations, option D appears to be the most accurate based on the provided text. Erasmus's legacy was more significant because he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had, even if the language he used still limited his direct impact to the educated classes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
