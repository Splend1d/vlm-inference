                    "text": "Let's see, I need to answer this question about Kohlberg's theory of morality. So, Kohlberg is known for his work on moral development, right? He proposed that people go through different stages as they mature morally. Let me think about each option:\n\nOption A says that morality develops independent of outside influence. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I remember that Kohlberg emphasized the role of social interaction and cognitive development in moral growth. So, morality isn't something that develops in isolation; it's influenced by how we interact with others and process moral dilemmas. Therefore, A doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption B states that morality cannot be rationalized in every instance. Kohlberg was big on the idea that moral reasoning is based on principles and that people at higher stages can rationalize their moral decisions. He believed that moral judgments can be explained and justified through reasoning. So, B contradicts his approach, which was to map out stages of moral reasoning.\n\nOption C says that morality is independent from emotion. Now, this is interesting. In Kohlberg's original theory, he focused more on rational reasoning and less on emotions. He thought that moral development was primarily cognitive, involving the advancement of logical thinking about moral issues. However, later theorists like Carol Gilligan criticized him for ignoring the emotional aspects of morality, such as care and empathy. So, while Kohlberg downplayed the role of emotion, it's not accurate to say that morality is entirely independent from emotion, but that might have been his view.\n\nOption D says that morality shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles. This sounds a lot like Kohlberg's stages. He proposed that moral development progresses through stages, starting from a more self-centered perspective (pre-conventional level) to a stage where moral decisions are based on social rules and conventions (conventional level), and finally to a stage where individuals base their morals on universal ethical principles (post-conventional level). This seems to align with the idea of a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles.\n\nLet me consider this again. If morality develops independently of outside influence, that doesn't fit with Kohlberg's theory, which emphasizes social interaction and cognitive development. If morality cannot be rationalized in every instance, that contradicts his focus on rational moral reasoning. If morality is independent from emotion, well, that might have been his view, but it's been critiqued for ignoring emotional aspects. If morality shows a logical progression from egocentric thought to broad moral principles, that seems to match his stages quite well.\n\nI think the best answer is D. It captures the essence of Kohlberg's stages of moral development, which progress from self-focused thinking to more abstract and universal moral principles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
