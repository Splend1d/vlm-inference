                    "text": "Let's tackle this economics problem step by step. So, we have DVD players which are considered a normal good, and they are traded in a competitive market. The question is asking what happens when household income increases, all else being equal. We need to figure out how this affects the equilibrium quantity and price of DVD players.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a normal good is. A normal good is one for which demand increases as income increases, and vice versa. So, if people's incomes go up, they'll probably want to buy more DVD players, assuming DVD players are a normal good.\n\nNow, since this is a competitive market, supply and demand forces will determine the equilibrium price and quantity. Let's think about what happens when demand changes.\n\nIf household income increases, and DVD players are a normal good, then the demand for DVD players should increase. This means the demand curve shifts to the right.\n\nNext, I need to consider how this shift in demand affects the equilibrium price and quantity. In a competitive market, when demand increases (shifts right) and supply remains constant, both the equilibrium price and quantity should increase.\n\nLet me sketch this out to visualize it.\n\n[Imagining a demand and supply graph]\n\nInitially, we have a certain demand curve and a supply curve intersecting at equilibrium point E1, with price P1 and quantity Q1.\n\nNow, with increased income, demand increases, so the demand curve shifts to the right to D2.\n\nThe new equilibrium, E2, will be at a higher price P2 and a higher quantity Q2.\n\nSo, according to this, both price and quantity should increase.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increase the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.\n\nB. decrease the equilibrium quantity and increase the price.\n\nC. increase the equilibrium price but the change in quantity is ambiguous.\n\nD. decrease the equilibrium quantity and decrease the price.\n\nBased on my analysis, option A seems to be correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIs it possible that supply could change as well? The question says \"all else equal,\" which means supply is held constant. So, no, supply shouldn't change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps DVD players are not normal goods after all. But the question explicitly states they are normal goods.\n\nAlso, in a competitive market, price adjustments happen quickly to balance supply and demand.\n\nSo, again, with increased demand and constant supply, price and quantity should both increase.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
