                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what John Rawls meant by an \"unjust society.\" There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best captures his view. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"some have more goods (e.g., happiness) than others.\" Hmm, Rawls is known for his theory of justice, particularly his book \"A Theory of Justice.\" I remember that he proposes the difference principle, which allows for inequalities in society as long as they benefit the least advantaged members. So, according to Rawls, it's not necessarily unjust if some people have more goods than others, as long as those inequalities are to the benefit of the least well-off. Therefore, Option A might not be the best characterization of an unjust society according to Rawls.\n\nOption B: \"political power is mostly given to the wealthy and upper class.\" Well, Rawls does discuss the distribution of political power in society. He argues for a democratic society where political liberties are equally protected for all citizens. So, if political power is disproportionately held by the wealthy and upper class, that could be seen as unjust because it violates the principle of equal basic liberties. But I need to check if this is the primary characterization of an unjust society in Rawls' view.\n\nOption C: \"there are inequalities that are not to the benefit of all.\" This sounds familiar. Rawls' difference principle states that social and economic inequalities are acceptable only if they work to the advantage of the least advantaged members of society. So, if there are inequalities that do not benefit the least advantaged, that would indeed be unjust according to Rawls. This seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nOption D: \"liberty is restricted to those who have not earned it.\" Rawls places a lot of emphasis on the equal basic liberties for all citizens. He believes that liberties should be equally distributed unless inequalities in liberties would make everyone better off, which is a very high bar. So, restricting liberty to those who haven't earned it might be seen as unjust, but again, I need to see how this compares to his overall theory.\n\nComparing these options, Option C directly relates to Rawls' difference principle, which is a central part of his theory of justice. Therefore, it seems that an unjust society, according to Rawls, can be roughly characterized as any society where there are inequalities that are not to the benefit of all.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
