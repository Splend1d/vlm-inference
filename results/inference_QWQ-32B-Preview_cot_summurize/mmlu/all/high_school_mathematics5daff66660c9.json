                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out what day of the week April will begin on, given that February 2011 has 28 days and March has 31 days. The options are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the days of the week and the dates. Each week has 7 days, so every 7 days, the day of the week repeats.\n\nIf I know what day of the week March 1st is, I can figure out what day April 1st will be. But I don't know what day March 1st is. Wait, maybe I don't need to know that. Maybe I can just calculate the total number of days from February 1st to April 1st and see how many weeks and extra days that is.\n\nBut actually, since February has 28 days in 2011, and March has 31 days, the total number of days from February 1st to March 31st is 28 + 31 = 59 days.\n\nNow, 59 days from a certain day, what day of the week will it be?\n\nWait, but I need to find out what day April 1st is, which is 59 days after February 1st.\n\nBut I don't know what day February 1st is. This seems like a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the number of days in February and March and see how that affects the day of the week.\n\nLet me think differently. If I know that February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks (since 28 / 7 = 4), then March has 31 days.\n\nNow, 31 days is 4 weeks and 3 days (because 31 / 7 = 4 weeks and 3 days).\n\nSo, starting from a certain day of the week on February 1st, after 28 days, it will be the same day of the week on March 1st.\n\nThen, from March 1st to April 1st is 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days.\n\nSo, if March 1st is a certain day, April 1st will be 3 days later in the week.\n\nFor example, if March 1st is a Monday, April 1st would be a Thursday.\n\nBut I don't know what day March 1st is.\n\nWait, maybe I can assume that February 1st is a certain day and see what April 1st is.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI recall that there is a way to calculate the day of the week for any date using Zeller's Congruence or something similar, but that might be too complicated for now.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look up what day April 1st, 2011 was, but that's not really solving the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that 2011 was not a leap year, so February had 28 days.\n\nAnd March has 31 days.\n\nSo, total days from February 1st to April 1st is 28 + 31 = 59 days.\n\nNow, 59 divided by 7 is 8 weeks and 3 days (since 7 * 8 = 56, and 59 - 56 = 3).\n\nSo, if February 1st is a certain day, April 1st is 3 days later in the week.\n\nBut again, without knowing February 1st, this doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the fact that February has 28 days, which is exactly 4 weeks, so the day of the week repeats every month.\n\nBut March has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days, so April 1st is 3 days after March 1st.\n\nBut I still don't know what day March 1st is.\n\nThis is getting circular.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the total number of days from a known date.\n\nWait, I know that 2011 was not a leap year, and I know that 2011 started on a Saturday.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nActually, I'm not sure what day January 1st, 2011 was. Maybe I should look that up, but the problem is to solve it without external information.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume that February 1st is a certain day and work from there.\n\nLet's say February 1st is a Monday.\n\nThen, February 28th is also a Monday, since 28 days is exactly 4 weeks.\n\nMarch 1st is the day after February 28th, so it would be a Tuesday.\n\nThen, March has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days, so April 1st would be 3 days after March 1st.\n\nSo, March 1st is Tuesday, April 1st is Friday.\n\nBut that assumes February 1st is Monday, which it probably wasn't, but according to this, April 1st would be Friday.\n\nBut maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but the options include Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.\n\nSo, if February 1st is Monday, April 1st is Friday.\n\nBut maybe February 1st wasn't Monday.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look at the number of days from a known reference.\n\nWait, I recall that in non-leap years, the day of the week for the same date in the next year advances by one day.\n\nBut that might not help here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in 2011, January 1st was a Saturday.\n\nI think January 1st, 2011 was a Saturday.\n\nIf that's the case, then February 1st, 2011 would be February 1st.\n\nNow, January has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days.\n\nSo, if January 1st is Saturday, January 31st is Monday.\n\nTherefore, February 1st is Tuesday.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nJanuary has 31 days.\n\nIf January 1st is Saturday, then January 2nd is Sunday, January 3rd is Monday, and so on, up to January 31st, which is Monday.\n\nTherefore, February 1st is Tuesday.\n\nNow, February has 28 days, so February 28th is also a Monday.\n\nMarch 1st is the day after, so it's Tuesday.\n\nMarch has 31 days, which is 4 weeks and 3 days, so April 1st is 3 days after March 1st.\n\nMarch 1st is Tuesday, so April 1st is Friday.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Friday.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nJanuary 1st: Saturday\n\nJanuary 2nd: Sunday\n\nJanuary 3rd: Monday\n\n...\n\nJanuary 31st: Monday\n\nFebruary 1st: Tuesday\n\nFebruary 28th: Monday\n\nMarch 1st: Tuesday\n\nMarch 31st: Thursday\n\nApril 1st: Friday\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer is Friday, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
