It's like stealing, right? Friends trust each other, and taking money without permission breaches that trust. So, this seems morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I submitted my timecard at work with precisely the correct hours I worked.\n\nThis seems straightforward. Submitting accurate timecards is important for getting paid correctly. Reporting precise hours worked is honest and fair. So, this should be considered not wrong.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Let's consider if there are any circumstances where submitting accurate hours could be wrong. For example, if the policy at work is to round up to the nearest hour, or if there are rules about reporting overtime. But the scenario says \"precisely the correct hours I worked,\" which sounds accurate and honest.\n\nIn contrast, taking $1 million from friends without their knowledge or agreement is clearly a breach of trust and ethical boundaries. It's akin to theft.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
