The options are:\n\nA. 599\n\nB. 500\n\nC. 499\n\nD. 401\n\nFirst, I need to perform the subtraction: 800 - 301.\n\nI know that subtracting 301 from 800 is the same as subtracting 300 and then subtracting 1 more.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\n1. Subtract 300 from 800:\n\n800 - 300 = 500\n\n2. Now, subtract the remaining 1:\n\n500 - 1 = 499\n\nTherefore, 800 - 301 = 499.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 499 matches our answer.\n\nTo double-check, I can add 301 to 499 and see if I get back to 800.\n\n499 + 301:\n\nAdding the hundreds: 400 + 300 = 700\n\nAdding the tens: 90 + 0 = 90\n\nAdding the ones: 9 + 1 = 10\n\nNow, combine them: 700 + 90 + 10 = 800\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the numbers in terms of place value.\n\n800 is eight hundreds, and 301 is three hundreds and one.\n\nSubtracting three hundreds from eight hundreds leaves five hundreds.\n\nThen, subtracting one from five hundreds requires borrowing.\n\nSo, 800 can be thought of as 7 hundreds and 10 tens.\n\nSubtracting 300 (three hundreds) leaves 4 hundreds and 10 tens.\n\nNow, subtracting 1 (one unit) from 10 tens (which is 100 units) requires borrowing again.\n\nBut actually, it's easier to think of 10 tens as 100, and then subtract 1, which is 99.\n\nSo, 4 hundreds and 99 units is 499.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 499.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
