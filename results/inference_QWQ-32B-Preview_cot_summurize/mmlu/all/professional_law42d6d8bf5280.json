The defense asks witness \"isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?\n\nA. Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.\nB. Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.\nC. No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.\nD. No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this legal scenario. We've got a teenage boy on trial for breaking into someone's property and stealing their car. The prosecution has a witness who can confirm that a car was indeed stolen, specify the make and model, and note the date it went missing. Now, the defense attorney is asking this witness if it's possible that the client didn't steal the car, suggesting someone else did it, and even questioning the police's integrity by implying they might be lying about the charges.\n\nThe prosecution objects to this line of questioning, and we need to figure out whether the court is likely to sustain that objection. We've got four options to choose from, each with a different perspective on what's permissible in this situation.\n\nOption A says yes, the court will sustain the objection because the question is based on pure speculation. Hmm, that seems plausible. The defense is essentially asking the witness to consider alternative scenarios without any concrete evidence to support them. It sounds like they're trying to plant doubt in the jury's mind without any factual basis, which could be seen as speculative.\n\nOption B also says yes, the court will sustain the objection, but for a different reason: it's not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence. This makes sense too. Police officers are generally trusted, and their credibility shouldn't be casually impeached without good reason. If the defense has specific evidence suggesting police misconduct or lying, that's different, but just suggesting it without basis might not be allowed.\n\nOption C says no, the court won't sustain the objection because questioning about other perpetrators or police misconduct is always permissible. This seems too broad. While it's important for the defense to explore other possibilities and challenge the prosecution's case, there must be some limits. Allowing unlimited speculation could lead to confusion and unfair tactics.\n\nOption D says no, the court won't sustain the objection because the witness might be withholding information, and cross-examination should have wide latitude. This touches on an important principle in law: the right to thorough cross-examination. However, even cross-examination has its bounds. Just because a witness might know something doesn't mean they can be asked anything, especially if the questions are speculative or irrelevant.\n\nConsidering these points, I think Option A is the strongest. The defense's question seems to be based on pure speculation. There's no evidence presented yet about another perpetrator or police lying. It's just a hypothetical scenario being thrown out there to perhaps sway the jury's opinion. In court, questions need to be grounded in some factual basis, and speculative questions that aren't tied to evidence can be objectionable.\n\nOption B also has merit, but it seems slightly narrower. Questioning the police's credibility is serious business and usually requires some foundation or specific allegations. Without that, it might be seen as an improper attack on the police.\n\nOption C is too broad, as it suggests that such questions are always permissible, which isn't the case. There need to be limits to prevent abuse.\n\nOption D acknowledges the importance of cross-examination but doesn't account for the need to keep questions relevant and based on evidence.\n\nTherefore, I believe the court is likely to sustain the prosecution's objection based on the question being purely speculative without any evidentiary support. So, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
