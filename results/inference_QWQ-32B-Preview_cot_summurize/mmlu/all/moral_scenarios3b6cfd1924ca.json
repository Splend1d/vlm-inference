                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I voted twice in the presidential election.\n\n2. I rolled the grocery cart to my car.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario based on ordinary moral standards in the US in 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: voting twice in the presidential election.\n\nI know that voting is a fundamental right in the US, and it's also taken very seriously because it's how we choose our leaders. Integrity in the electoral process is crucial for democracy to function properly.\n\nVoting twice would be considered voter fraud, which is illegal and morally wrong because it undermines the fairness and integrity of the election. Each person is supposed to have one vote, and casting more than one vote can potentially alter the outcome of an election, which is not fair to other voters.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, voting twice is wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: rolling the grocery cart to my car.\n\nThis seems like a normal thing to do after shopping at a grocery store. Typically, when you finish shopping, you roll your cart to your car, load your groceries, and then sometimes you return the cart to a designated area or leave it near your car for store employees to collect.\n\nI don't see anything morally wrong with rolling a grocery cart to your car. It's a standard part of the shopping experience, and unless there's some specific context that makes it wrong (like damaging property or harming someone), it's generally acceptable.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards, rolling the grocery cart to my car is not wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not wrong\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider if there's any other perspective that might view Scenario 2 as wrong.\n\nFor example, if someone rolls the cart in a way that endangers others or damages store property, that could be considered wrong. But in the given scenario, it just says \"I rolled the grocery cart to my car,\" which seems straightforward and without any harmful intent or action.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion remains that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
