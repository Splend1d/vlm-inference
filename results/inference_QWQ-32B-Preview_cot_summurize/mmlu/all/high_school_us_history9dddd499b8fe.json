                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Marcus Garvey in 1920, and it's saying that blacks should have their own place in Africa, right? And the question is asking how to best understand this passage. The options are about immigration restrictions, uniting working-class people, black nationalism, or promoting African American advancement in industry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who Marcus Garvey was. I remember he was a key figure in the early 20th century associated with the idea of black nationalism and the Back-to-Africa movement. So, that might lean towards option C, black nationalism.\n\nLet's look at the passage itself. He's saying that blacks have souls, passions, feelings, hopes, and desires just like any other race in the world. Then he mentions that everywhere people are saying their country should be for their own people\u2014Canada for Canadians, America for Americans, and so on. And he's essentially asking if it's unreasonable for blacks to want Africa for Africans.\n\nSo, he's drawing a parallel between how other nations are for their own people and suggesting that blacks should have their own space in Africa. This sounds like he's advocating for a separate homeland for blacks, which aligns with the idea of black nationalism.\n\nOption A talks about restrictions on immigration into the US. While Garvey was involved in politics, this passage doesn't seem to be directly about immigration restrictions. He's more focused on the idea of blacks having their own place in Africa.\n\nOption B mentions uniting working-class African American and white men and women. Again, this doesn't seem to be the main point of the passage. Garvey was more about black self-reliance and nationalism, not necessarily uniting with white working-class people.\n\nOption D is about promoting African American advancement in industry. While Garvey did encourage economic empowerment among blacks, this particular passage seems more about the idea of having their own nation rather than advancing in industry.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the best answer is C, an expression of black nationalism. He's asserting the rights of blacks to have their own space and governing themselves, similar to how other nations are for their own people.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should think about the context of 1920. That was a time of racial tension in the US, with events like the Red Summer of 1919, where there were racial conflicts across the country. Garvey's message of black pride and nationalism could have been a response to that environment, offering a vision of self-determination and autonomy for blacks.\n\nAlso, comparing it to other movements of the time, like the Harlem Renaissance, which was more about cultural expression and integration into American society, Garvey's message was different in that he promoted separation and return to Africa.\n\nSo, overall, I think the passage is best understood as an expression of black nationalism, making option C the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
