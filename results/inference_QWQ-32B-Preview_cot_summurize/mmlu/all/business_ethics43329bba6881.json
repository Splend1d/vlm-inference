                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about factors that impact ethical decision making. It says that these factors can be broadly broken down into two types: one related to the unique characteristics of a person, and the other related to features of the person's environment or the particular issue. Then it gives options A through D with different pairs of words.\n\nSo, I need to match these descriptions to the right terms. The first blank is for factors related to the unique characteristics of a person, and the second blank is for factors related to the person's environment or the particular issue.\n\nLooking at option A: Tailored, Individual. \"Tailored\" suggests something customized or fitted to a specific person, which sounds like it could relate to unique characteristics. \"Individual\" generally refers to a single person, which also aligns with unique characteristics. But the second part should be about the environment or the particular issue, not just the individual.\n\nOption B: Situational, Individual. \"Situational\" sounds like it relates to the environment or specific context, which matches the second part of the description. \"Individual\" again refers to the person's unique characteristics. This seems promising.\n\nOption C: Situational, Tailored. \"Situational\" is again about the environment or context, and \"tailored\" is about customizing to a specific person. So, this might be mixing the two concepts.\n\nOption D: Individual, Situational. This is similar to option B but reversed. \"Individual\" for the first blank, which is about unique characteristics, makes sense. \"Situational\" for the second blank, relating to the environment or issue, also makes sense.\n\nWait a minute, options B and D are essentially the same, just with the order switched. But according to the question, the first blank is for factors related to the unique characteristics of a person, and the second for features of the person's environment or the particular issue. So, the order matters here.\n\nLet me think about standard terminology in ethics. When we talk about ethical decision making, we often consider both individual traits, like personality, values, and morals, and situational factors, like the context, culture, and circumstances surrounding the decision.\n\nSo, individual factors are internal to the person, while situational factors are external.\n\nGiven that, the first blank should be \"individual\" because it's about the unique characteristics of the person, and the second blank should be \"situational\" because it's about the environment or the particular issue.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Tailored, Individual\n\nB. Situational, Individual\n\nC. Situational, Tailored\n\nD. Individual, Situational\n\nOption D seems to fit best: Individual factors (unique characteristics) and Situational factors (environment or particular issue).\n\nBut option B has Situational first and Individual second, which reverses the order specified in the question. So, D makes more sense.\n\nWait, but the question specifies that the first blank is for factors related to the unique characteristics of a person, which are individual factors, and the second blank is for factors related to the person's environment or the particular issue, which are situational factors.\n\nTherefore, D. Individual, Situational seems correct.\n\nBut let's double-check what \"tailored\" means. Tailored suggests something that is custom-made for a particular person, which could be seen as a type of individual factor. However, it's not a standard term used in discussions of ethical decision making, at least not that I recall.\n\n\"Situational\" is a common term used to describe context-dependent factors, and \"individual\" refers to personal characteristics.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
