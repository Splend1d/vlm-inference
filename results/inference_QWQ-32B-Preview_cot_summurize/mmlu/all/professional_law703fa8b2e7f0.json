                    "text": "Let's see. So, this homeowner had a contract with a famous landscape architect to landscape her five-acre estate, and she was expecting it to be done before her annual garden party on May 30. She was happy with the work the architect did for her neighbor, that's why she hired him. But then, while she was on vacation in March, the architect assigned the contract to a gardener because of previous commitments. When she came back, she saw that 60% of the work was done by this gardener, and she wasn't pleased with it. So, she fired the gardener and now wants to hold the architect responsible for breach of contract.\n\nOkay, so the question is, given that the architect assigned the contract to the gardener, does that relieve the architect from liability if the homeowner sues for breach of contract? The options are:\n\nA. Yes, because the contract was assignable.\n\nB. Yes, because the gardener's work caused the homeowner's dissatisfaction.\n\nC. No, because this is a personal service contract and can't be delegated.\n\nD. No, unless there was an express contractual provision against assignments.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand what kind of contract this is. It's a contract for landscaping services, and it seems like it's a personal service contract because it's with a famous landscape architect, presumably known for their unique skills and expertise. Personal service contracts are generally not assignable because the performance depends on the particular skills of the individual.\n\nIn option A, it says that the contract was assignable, but if it's a personal service contract, assignability might not be allowed unless specified in the contract. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B says that the architect is relieved of liability because the gardener's work caused the dissatisfaction. But, in contract law, if you assign a contract, you're still ultimately responsible for its performance unless otherwise agreed. So, maybe this isn't correct.\n\nOption C says that it's a personal service contract and therefore non-delegable. That sounds plausible because the homeowner hired the architect specifically for their skills and reputation, not just any gardener. So, delegating the work to someone else might be a breach of that personal service contract.\n\nOption D says that the architect isn't relieved of liability unless there was an express provision against assignments. This suggests that, generally, assignments are allowed unless the contract prohibits them. But again, in personal service contracts, assignments are typically not allowed.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate. The contract is for personal services, and such contracts are generally non-delegable. The architect can't just assign the work to someone else and wash their hands of it. The homeowner expected the architect's personal involvement, and by assigning the work, the architect breached that expectation.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Assignments in contract law can be tricky. Generally, assignments are allowed unless they materially alter the obligor's duty or increase the risk of non-performance. In this case, assigning the work to a gardener might alter the quality of work expected, which could be material since it's a personal service contract.\n\nAlso, the architect informed the homeowner about the assignment and said he's no longer obligated under the original contract. But legally, even if the homeowner was informed, the architect may still be liable if the assignment wasn't permitted under the contract terms.\n\nMoreover, the homeowner fired the gardener, which suggests that she wanted to terminate the contract and possibly hold the architect responsible for not performing as promised.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I believe that the architect cannot relieve himself of liability just by assigning the contract to the gardener, especially in a personal service contract where personal involvement is expected. Therefore, the correct answer is C: not relieve the architect of liability, because a personal service contract of this nature is non-delegable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
