The options are:\n\nA. cuneiform, in Mesopotamia\n\nB. hieroglyphics, in Egypt\n\nC. clay-tablets, at Knossos\n\nD. runes, at Stonehenge\n\nHmm, I need to think about this carefully. I remember from my history classes that writing systems developed in several ancient civilizations, but which one is the earliest?\n\nFirst, let's consider option A: cuneiform in Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is often called the cradle of civilization, located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, present-day Iraq. I think writing started there around 3200 BCE. Cuneiform was a system of writing used by the Sumerians, and it involved pressing a reed stylus into clay tablets to make wedge-shaped marks. So, that sounds pretty old.\n\nOption B is hieroglyphics in Egypt. I know that the Egyptian hieroglyphic system is also very ancient, but I think it developed a bit later than cuneiform. Maybe around 3100 BCE or so. So, while it's certainly one of the earliest writing systems, it might not be the very first.\n\nOption C mentions clay-tablets at Knossos. Knossos is associated with the Minoan civilization on Crete, which is fascinating, but I believe their writing system, known as Linear A and Linear B, developed much later, around 1800-1400 BCE. So, that's quite a bit after Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nLastly, option D: runes at Stonehenge. Now, Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in England, and runes are an ancient Germanic alphabet that was used much later, around 150-800 CE. So, that seems way too recent compared to the other options.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like cuneiform in Mesopotamia is the earliest form of writing among the options provided. But just to be thorough, I should double-check the timelines.\n\nLet me recall: Mesopotamian cuneiform around 3200 BCE, Egyptian hieroglyphics around 3100 BCE, Minoan Linear A around 1800 BCE, and runes around 150-800 CE. So, cuneiform predates hieroglyphics by about 100 years, which is still pretty significant.\n\nAlso, I should consider that some sources might place the origins of Egyptian hieroglyphics earlier, but based on my knowledge, cuneiform still seems to be slightly older.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. cuneiform, in Mesopotamia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
