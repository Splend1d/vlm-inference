                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the nitrate ion, NO3-. I need to figure out how many sigma and pi bonds are in each resonance form of this ion. So, first things first, I should recall what resonance forms are and how they apply to the nitrate ion.\n\nI know that the nitrate ion has three oxygen atoms bonded to a central nitrogen atom, and it has a negative charge. Resonance forms are different Lewis structures that represent the same molecule, differing only in the arrangement of electrons. For NO3-, there are three resonance forms where the double bond shifts between the nitrogen and each of the oxygen atoms.\n\nOkay, so in each resonance form, there's one double bond and two single bonds between nitrogen and oxygen. Now, I need to determine the number of sigma and pi bonds in these structures.\n\nI remember that single bonds consist of one sigma bond, and double bonds consist of one sigma bond and one pi bond. So, in each resonance form, there are:\n\n- Two single bonds: 2 sigma bonds\n\n- One double bond: 1 sigma bond and 1 pi bond\n\nAdding those up, total sigma bonds would be 2 (from single bonds) + 1 (from the double bond) = 3 sigma bonds.\n\nAnd the total pi bonds would be 1 (from the double bond).\n\nSo, in each resonance form, there are 3 sigma bonds and 1 pi bond.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1 sigma and 2 pi\n\nB. 2 sigma and 1 pi\n\nC. 1 sigma and 1 pi\n\nD. 3 sigma and 1 pi\n\nIt seems like option D matches what I've calculated.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something about the resonance forms or the bond types.\n\nIn the nitrate ion, the nitrogen atom is sp2 hybridized, which allows for one double bond and two single bonds in a trigonal planar geometry. Each resonance form represents one possible arrangement of the double bond, but in reality, the molecule has a hybrid structure with partial double bond character in all three N-O bonds.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically about each resonance form, not the overall hybrid structure. So, in each individual resonance form, there should be one double bond and two single bonds, as I initially thought.\n\nTherefore, with two single bonds (each having one sigma bond) and one double bond (one sigma and one pi bond), the total is indeed 3 sigma bonds and 1 pi bond.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
