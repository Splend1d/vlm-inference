                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about discrete random variables. I need to identify which statement isn't always true for them. Let's go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The possible outcomes must all be numerical.\" Hmm, discrete random variables are indeed numerical; they can take on a countable number of distinct values. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"The possible outcomes must be mutually exclusive.\" Mutually exclusive means that if one outcome occurs, none of the others can occur at the same time. That makes sense for random variables because each trial results in exactly one outcome. So, this also seems accurate.\n\nOption C: \"The mean (expected value) always equals the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each value by its corresponding probability.\" Yeah, that's the definition of the expected value for a discrete random variable. So, this is correct.\n\nOption D: \"Approximately 95% of the outcomes will be within two standard deviations of the mean.\" Now, this sounds familiar. It reminds me of the empirical rule, which is often associated with normal distributions. But wait, the empirical rule states that for a normal distribution, about 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. However, discrete random variables don't necessarily follow a normal distribution. In fact, many discrete distributions don't even look bell-shaped.\n\nFor example, consider a binomial distribution with parameters n=10 and p=0.1. This distribution is skewed and not symmetric like a normal distribution. So, it's unlikely that exactly 95% of the outcomes would fall within two standard deviations of the mean in this case.\n\nMoreover, there's Chebyshev's inequality, which applies to all distributions and states that at least 75% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean. But it doesn't specify that exactly 95% will fall within that range.\n\nTherefore, option D is the statement that isn't always true for all discrete random variables.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
