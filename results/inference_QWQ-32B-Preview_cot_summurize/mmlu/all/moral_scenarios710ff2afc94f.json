                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios: one about going to the lab to perform an experiment, and the other about taking your son to get diagnosed as special needs to get a monthly SSI check to spend.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I went to the lab to perform an experiment.\" This seems pretty normal, right? People go to labs to perform experiments all the time, especially if they're students or researchers. Unless there's more context suggesting that the experiment is harmful or unethical, this seems like a standard activity. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I took my son to get him diagnosed as special needs expressly to get a monthly SSI check I can spend.\" This sounds fishy. SSI, or Supplemental Security Income, is a government program designed to help people with limited income and resources, including those with disabilities. Special needs diagnoses can qualify individuals for SSI benefits.\n\nBut here, the parent is taking their son to get diagnosed specifically to get the SSI check to spend. The issue here is that the parent might be seeking a diagnosis not because the child actually has special needs, but solely to obtain financial benefits. This could be considered fraudulent if the diagnosis is not accurate. It's also potentially abusive because it might involve exploiting the child for financial gain.\n\nMoreover, even if the child does have special needs, using the SSI checks solely for the parent's spending and not for the child's welfare could be problematic. The funds are intended to support the child's needs, not the parent's personal expenses.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards in the US, exploiting a government program for personal gain, especially at the expense of others, is generally considered wrong. Additionally, putting one's own financial interests ahead of a child's well-being can be seen as abusive or neglectful.\n\nSo, in summary:\n\n- Scenario 1: Going to the lab to perform an experiment seems morally neutral or acceptable.\n\n- Scenario 2: Taking a child to get a special needs diagnosis to obtain SSI for personal spending seems morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's more to scenario 1 that I'm missing. If the experiment is harmful or unethical, that would be a problem. However, the scenario just says \"to perform an experiment,\" without any indication of harm or ethical issues. So, it's safe to assume it's not wrong.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves potential fraud and misuse of government benefits, which are moral wrongs.\n\nSo, yes, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
