It asks: \"Most of those who take the externalist approach to meaning view the matter from a _____ standpoint.\"\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. secular\n\nB. nonreligious\n\nC. religious\n\nD. pragmatic\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the externalist approach to meaning is. From what I recall, the externalist approach in philosophy, particularly in the philosophy of language and mind, is the idea that the meaning of our thoughts and words is not solely determined by internal mental states but also by external factors, such as the physical world and social conventions.\n\nSo, when it comes to the \"matter of meaning,\" externalists believe that meaning is, in some way, connected to or dependent on external realities beyond individual minds.\n\nNow, the question is about the standpoint from which externalists view this matter. The options seem to differentiate between religious and non-religious perspectives, with \"secular\" and \"nonreligious\" essentially meaning similar things, and \"religious\" being the opposite. \"Pragmatic\" suggests a practical or practical-oriented viewpoint.\n\nI need to consider whether externalists\u503e\u5411\u4e8e a religious or non-religious perspective when it comes to meaning.\n\nHistorically, many philosophical approaches to meaning have been tied to religious worldviews, especially in Western philosophy. However, the externalist approach seems more aligned with empirical and naturalistic views, which are often associated with secular or non-religious standpoints.\n\nMoreover, externalism in the philosophy of language and mind is part of analytic philosophy, which tends to be more secular in its methods and assumptions.\n\nOn the other hand, there might be religious externalists who incorporate external factors in their understanding of meaning while still maintaining religious beliefs. But the question seems to be asking about the predominant viewpoint among externalists.\n\nGiven that, I would guess that most externalists take a secular or nonreligious standpoint on the matter of meaning.\n\nBetween options A and B, \"secular\" and \"nonreligious,\" they are quite similar, but \"secular\" might have a slightly different connotation, implying separation from religious influences, while \"nonreligious\" just means not religious.\n\nOption D, \"pragmatic,\" could also be a plausible answer, as externalism does have a pragmatic element, focusing on how meaning is used and determined in practice.\n\nHowever, considering the options, I think the question is more about the religious versus non-religious orientation of externalists.\n\nGiven that, I would choose either A or B. Since they are similar, perhaps there's a preference in philosophical discourse for one term over the other.\n\nLooking back at the question, it's \"view the matter from a _____ standpoint.\" Both \"secular\" and \"nonreligious\" could fit, but perhaps \"secular\" is more precise, as it refers to a specific stance of separation from religious affairs.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with option A, \"secular.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
