To generate energy.\n\nMitochondria are often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell because they produce most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy. This process is known as cellular respiration, where nutrients are converted into energy that the cell can use.\n\nOption B, to process waste, is not the primary function of mitochondria. While cells do have mechanisms to process waste, this is not the main role of mitochondria.\n\nOption C, to kill viruses or other antigens, is a function typically associated with immune cells, not mitochondria. Mitochondria do play some role in immune responses, but their primary function is energy production.\n\nOption D, to repair damage, is more associated with other cellular components such as DNA repair mechanisms or the action of certain enzymes. While mitochondria can repair some of their own components, their main function is energy generation.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. To generate energy."
