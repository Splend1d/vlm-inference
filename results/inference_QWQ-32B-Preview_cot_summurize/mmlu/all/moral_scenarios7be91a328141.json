Mail is private communication, and reading someone else's mail without their permission is generally considered a violation of their privacy. In the US, there are even laws against opening someone else's mail. So, this seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, Hank offers to help with an essay, and the main character asks him to write the entire essay. This sounds like plagiarism or academic dishonesty. Depending on the context, it might be considered cheating, which is morally wrong in educational settings because it's unfair to others and undermines the purpose of learning.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
