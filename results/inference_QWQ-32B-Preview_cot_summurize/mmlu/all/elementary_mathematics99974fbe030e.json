I need to find out the total points she earned from both.\n\nFirst, she earned 389 points in the first level. Then, she earned an additional 116 points in the bonus round. To find the total, I should add these two amounts together, right?\n\nSo, 389 plus 116. Let me add them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: 9 plus 6 is 15. So, I write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNext, the tens place: 8 plus 1 is 9, plus the carried over 1 makes it 10. So, I write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 3 plus 1 is 4, plus the carried over 1 makes it 5.\n\nSo, 389 plus 116 equals 505.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 405\n\nB. 495\n\nC. 505\n\nD. 4,915\n\nThe correct answer is C. 505.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my addition to be sure.\n\n389\n\n+116\n\n------\n\n505\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can subtract 116 from 505 to see if I get back to 389.\n\n505 minus 116:\n\nStarting from the units place: 5 minus 6. Since 5 is less than 6, I need to borrow from the tens place. So, 15 minus 6 is 9.\n\nNow, the tens place: since I borrowed, it's 0 minus 1, but again, I need to borrow from the hundreds place. So, 10 minus 1 is 9.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 4 minus 1 is 3.\n\nSo, 505 minus 116 equals 389, which matches the points she earned in the first level. So, my addition was correct.\n\nTherefore, the total points Shodi earned in the first level and bonus round is 505, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
