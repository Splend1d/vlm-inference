The options are innate factors, operant conditioning, parental modeling, and cognitive development. I think I remember that Chomsky believed language is something we're born with, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what nativist theory means. Nativism in language acquisition suggests that humans have an innate ability or set of principles that allow them to learn language. This is different from learning through experience or reinforcement.\n\nOption A is \"innate factors.\" That sounds like it aligns with nativism, as innate factors would be those we're born with, part of our genetic makeup.\n\nOption B is \"operant conditioning.\" I know that's a behaviorist concept where behavior is shaped by reinforcement and punishment. Chomsky was critical of behaviorist approaches to language learning, so I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption C is \"parental modeling.\" While parents do model language for their children, Chomsky's theory emphasizes an innate language acquisition device rather than learning through imitation alone.\n\nOption D is \"cognitive development.\" This seems more related to Jean Piaget's theories, where language development is linked to general cognitive growth. Chomsky's view is more specific to language being a separate module in the mind.\n\nGiven this, I think the best answer is A, innate factors, because Chomsky's nativist theory posits that language abilities are inherent and not solely learned through experience or environmental influences.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up a quick summary of Chomsky's theory. According to Chomsky, humans have an innate faculty for language, often referred to as the \"language acquisition device\" (LAD). This suggests that certain principles of language are hardwired into the brain, allowing children to acquire language rapidly and efficiently, even in environments with limited linguistic input.\n\nSo, reinforcing my initial thought, innate factors seem to be the core of Chomsky's nativist theory.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOperant conditioning (option B) is more associated with B.F. Skinner, who proposed that children learn language through reinforcement and imitation. However, Chomsky critiqued Skinner's behaviorist approach, arguing that it couldn't account for the creativity and rapidity of language acquisition.\n\nParental modeling (option C) is important, but Chomsky's theory downplays the role of imitation, suggesting that children can produce grammatically correct sentences they've never heard before, indicating an innate understanding of grammar rules.\n\nCognitive development (option D) relates more to how general cognitive abilities support language learning, but Chomsky's theory suggests that language has its own independent module in the mind.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, innate factors (option A) best represent the essence of Chomsky's nativist theory of language.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
