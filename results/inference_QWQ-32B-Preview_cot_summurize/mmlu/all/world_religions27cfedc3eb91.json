Guru Tegh Bahadur\n\nC. Guru Gobind Singh\n\nD. Guru Har Rai\n\nI need to recall the history of the Sikh Gurus and their interactions with Mughal rulers, as some of them faced persecution for their faith.\n\nStarting with Guru Ram Das, he was the fourth Sikh Guru. I think he lived during a relatively peaceful time, and I don't recall any martyrdom associated with him. So, probably not A.\n\nGuru Tegh Bahadur was the ninth Sikh Guru. I remember that he was arrested and executed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for refusing to convert to Islam. This seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh was the tenth Sikh Guru. He faced a lot of persecution and fought against the Mughals, but I don't recall him being martyred for refusing to embrace Islam. He was killed in battle, I think.\n\nGuru Har Rai was the seventh Sikh Guru. He is known for his kindness and medical expertise. I don't think he faced any martyrdom related to conversion.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, Guru Tegh Bahadur was the one who was martyred for refusing to embrace Islam.\n\nBut let me double-check the sequence of Gurus to make sure I have the correct one.\n\nThe lineage of Sikh Gurus is as follows:\n\n1. Guru Nanak\n\n2. Guru Angad\n\n3. Guru Amar Das\n\n4. Guru Ram Das\n\n5. Guru Arjan\n\n6. Guru Har Gobind\n\n7. Guru Har Rai\n\n8. Guru Har Krishan\n\n9. Guru Tegh Bahadur\n\n10. Guru Gobind Singh\n\n11. The Guru Granth Sahib (the eternal Guru)\n\nYes, Guru Tegh Bahadur was the ninth Guru, and he was indeed executed by Aurangzeb for refusing to convert to Islam.\n\nThe story goes that Aurangzeb was trying to convert Hindus and Sikhs to Islam, and he offered Guru Tegh Bahadur a choice: accept Islam or face death. The Guru chose to stay true to his faith and was executed in public as a warning to others.\n\nThis act of martyrdom is a significant part of Sikh history and is remembered and revered by Sikhs worldwide.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. Guru Tegh Bahadur.\n\nI think that's the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
