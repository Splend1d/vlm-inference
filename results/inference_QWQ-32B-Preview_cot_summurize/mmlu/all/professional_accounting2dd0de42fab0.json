However, Corbet expects to sell the book for only five years. For amortization purposes, we should use the shorter of the legal life or the useful life expected by the company. In this case, the useful life is five years.\n\n3. **Calculate the annual amortization expense:** Since the copyright is expected to be used over five years, we will amortize the cost evenly over these five years.\n\nThe formula for annual amortization expense is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual Amortization Expense} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of the Copyright}}{\\text{Useful Life in Years}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Annual Amortization Expense} = \\frac{20,000}{5} = 4,000\n\\]\n\n4. **Determine the amortization expense for the current year:** Since the copyright was purchased near the beginning of the current year, the full annual amortization expense should be recognized for the current year.\n\nTherefore, the amortization expense related to the copyright at the end of the current year is $4,000.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. $0  \nB. $400  \nC. $500  \nD. $4,000\n\nThe correct answer is D. $4,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
