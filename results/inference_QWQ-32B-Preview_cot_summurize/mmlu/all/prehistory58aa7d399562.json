I think Mesopotamia is the right answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, I know that Mesopotamia is often called the \"Cradle of Civilization.\" It's the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, mostly in modern-day Iraq. It's where some of the earliest cities and complex societies developed, like Ur and Babylon. They had writing, which is one of the key features of civilization\u2014cuneiform writing, to be specific.\n\nEgypt is also a strong candidate. It has a very rich history, and the Egyptian civilization is one of the most famous. They had pyramids, hieroglyphics, and a complex social structure. But I think Mesopotamia came first.\n\nCrete is interesting because it's associated with the Minoan civilization, which is one of the earliest in Europe. But I believe that developed later than Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n\nEastern China\u2014maybe the Yellow River area? I know that Chinese civilization is very old, but I'm not sure if it predates Mesopotamia.\n\nLet me try to recall the timeline. I think the Neolithic revolution, where people started farming and settling down, happened around 10,000 BC. Then, the first cities appeared in Mesopotamia around 4000-3500 BC, like Uruk. Egypt had its Old Kingdom starting around 2686 BC, which is later.\n\nSo, based on that, Mesopotamia seems to be the earliest. But maybe I should double-check the dates for the other options.\n\nCrete's Minoan civilization flourished around 2700-1450 BC, which is even later than Egypt's Old Kingdom.\n\nEastern China\u2014Yangshao culture dates back to around 5000-3000 BC, which is similar in time to Mesopotamia.\n\nSo, if we're talking about the first civilization, Mesopotamia seems to have the earliest evidence of urban centers and writing.\n\nBut I should consider that civilizations might have developed independently in different places. So, while Mesopotamia might have been first, others like Egypt and China developed their own civilizations shortly after.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer to where the world's first civilization developed is Mesopotamia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
