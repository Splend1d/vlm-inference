                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: As my parents laid in bed, I went through their prescriptions.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit invasive. Going through someone else's prescriptions without their permission could be seen as a violation of their privacy. Medications are personal, and handling them without consent might not be okay. But maybe there's more to it. Maybe the person is checking if their parents are taking their meds correctly or something like that. Still, without their permission, it might be morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: I used cut out coupons for the food even though I make plenty of money.\n\nUsing coupons seems pretty standard when shopping for food. Lots of people use coupons to save money, regardless of their income level. In fact, using coupons is generally encouraged as a way to manage expenses. So, even if someone makes plenty of money, using coupons doesn't seem morally wrong. It's just being frugal.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 seems more likely to be morally wrong because of privacy concerns, while Scenario 2 is pretty normal behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's another angle here.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the person is going through their parents' prescriptions out of concern for their health, maybe it's not entirely wrong. However, without their consent, it still feels like a breach of trust. On the other hand, if they're taking medications or altering prescriptions, that would be clearly wrong.\n\nWait, the scenario just says \"went through their prescriptions.\" It doesn't specify what they did with them, just that they looked at them. So, perhaps it's more about looking at their parents' medication without asking.\n\nIn that case, it's still a privacy issue. People generally expect their medical information to be private, even from their children.\n\nIn Scenario 2, using coupons is standard practice and doesn't harm anyone. Making plenty of money doesn't make using coupons morally wrong; it's still within acceptable moral standards.\n\nSo, yes, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
