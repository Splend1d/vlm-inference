                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about how marital discord affects children's behavior, specifically looking at whether boys or girls are more likely to show behavior problems immediately after their parents have issues. The question mentions a meta-analysis, which is a study that combines results from multiple studies to find overall patterns.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what meta-analysis is. It's a statistical method that combines the results of several studies to get a more precise estimate of the effect size. So, in this case, it's looking at many studies on marital discord and child behavior problems to see if there's a general trend regarding gender differences in how children react.\n\nThe question presents four options:\n\nA. Neither child is more likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem than are children of stable marriages.\n\nB. The girl is more likely than the boy to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nC. The boy is more likely than the girl to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nD. Both children are equally likely to manifest an immediate behavior problem.\n\nI need to think about what research generally says about how boys and girls respond to parental conflict.\n\nFrom my general knowledge, I recall that girls might be more sensitive to emotional cues and interpersonal relationships, which could mean they might be more affected by marital discord. On the other hand, boys might exhibit behavior problems more overtly, like acting out or showing aggression.\n\nBut I need to consider what the meta-analysis would likely find. Meta-analyses tend to show overall trends, and in psychology, there's a body of research suggesting that girls might be more adversely affected by marital discord than boys, at least in terms of internalizing problems like anxiety and depression. However, boys might show more externalizing behaviors like aggression.\n\nBut the question is about immediate behavior problems, which might lean more towards externalizing behaviors that are observable right away.\n\nLet me consider some possible reasons:\n\n1. Societal expectations: Boys might be more likely to act out behaviorally, while girls might internalize problems.\n\n2. Parenting styles: Parents might react differently to boys and girls when stressed, which could influence how children behave.\n\n3. Children's coping mechanisms: Girls might be more likely to use avoidance or withdrawal, while boys might act out.\n\nGiven that it's about immediate behavior problems, I'm inclined to think that boys might be more likely to show externalizing behaviors right away, such as acting out or being aggressive.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that girls might show immediate behavior problems in different ways, like becoming clingy or showing anxiety right away.\n\nBut the question seems to be focusing on \"behavior problems,\" which might be more aligned with externalizing behaviors that are overt and disruptive.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B suggests that the girl is more likely than the boy to manifest an immediate behavior problem, option C says the opposite, and option D says both are equally likely.\n\nOption A says neither is more likely, meaning that children of discordant marriages are not more likely to have behavior problems than those from stable marriages.\n\nBut given that it's a meta-analysis on marital discord and child behavior problems, it's likely that children from discordant marriages do have higher rates of behavior problems overall.\n\nSo option A seems unlikely.\n\nBetween options B, C, and D, I need to decide whether girls, boys, or both equally are more likely to show immediate behavior problems.\n\nGiven that research often shows girls being more affected by marital discord in terms of internalizing problems, but boys showing more externalizing problems, I wonder if the meta-analysis would find that boys are more likely to manifest immediate behavior problems.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta-analysis found no significant gender difference, making option D the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe girls show immediate behavior problems in different ways that might not be captured by traditional behavior problem assessments.\n\nI think I need to recall specific studies or meta-analyses on this topic to answer this accurately.\n\nI recall that some studies suggest that girls might be more adversely affected by marital discord, but I'm not sure if that translates to immediate behavior problems.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that immediate behavior problems might be more aligned with externalizing behaviors, which are more commonly associated with boys.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the meta-analysis found that girls are more likely to show immediate behavior problems, perhaps in the form of anxiety or withdrawal, which could be considered behavior problems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no significant difference between boys and girls in terms of immediate behavior problems in response to marital discord.\n\nGiven that it's a meta-analysis, it would have synthesized data from multiple studies, controlling for various variables, and perhaps found no significant gender difference.\n\nTherefore, option D might be the most accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta-analysis found that boys are more likely to show immediate behavior problems, in line with the general finding that boys exhibit more externalizing behaviors.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider the context of the question. It's about immediate behavior problems, which might suggest short-term reactions to marital discord.\n\nPerhaps in the immediate term, boys are more likely to act out, while girls might show more long-term internalizing problems.\n\nIf that's the case, then option C might be the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the meta-analysis found that girls are more sensitive to marital discord and therefore show immediate behavior problems more than boys.\n\nBut I don't have enough specific knowledge to definitively choose one option over the others.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that meta-analyses often find small to moderate effects, and in the case of gender differences, the effects might be minimal or non-existent.\n\nTherefore, option D, both children are equally likely to manifest immediate behavior problems, might be the most accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the meta-analysis found that girls are more affected, making option B the correct answer.\n\nI need to make a decision based on the information I have.\n\nGiven that I'm unsure, I might default to the idea that both children are equally likely to manifest immediate behavior problems, as gender differences in reaction to marital discord might not be significant in the short term.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
