The options are Peck, Foos, Levenson, and Erikson. I need to think about which of these figures is known for a theory that has been studied using both types of research methods.\n\nFirst, I should recall what longitudinal and cross-sectional research entail. Longitudinal studies observe the same variables over long periods, often involving the same subjects multiple times. Cross-sectional studies, on the other hand, look at different subjects at a single point in time.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Peck: I'm not immediately familiar with a theory by someone named Peck that's widely recognized in psychology or a related field. It's possible that it's a lesser-known theorist or perhaps a typo.\n\nB. Foos: Similarly, Foos doesn't ring a bell. I might not be aware of a theory by this person, or again, it could be a typo.\n\nC. Levenson: Robert Levenson is a well-known psychologist, particularly for his work on emotion and aging. He's conducted extensive research on emotional regulation and has looked at how emotions change over the lifespan. His work often involves longitudinal designs to track changes over time. So, it's possible that his theory has been supported by both longitudinal and cross-sectional research.\n\nD. Erikson: Erik Erikson is famous for his theory of psychosocial development, which outlines eight stages of development from infancy to old age. His theory is widely studied, and research on it has likely included both longitudinal and cross-sectional methods to examine development across the lifespan.\n\nBetween Levenson and Erikson, Erikson's theory is more broadly about development across the lifespan, which would naturally lend itself to both longitudinal and cross-sectional research designs. Levenson's work, while important, is more focused on emotion and aging, which might also involve both types of research but may not have the same level of longitudinal and cross-sectional support as Erikson's comprehensive developmental theory.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the question specifies \"the theory put forth by...\" which might suggest a single, specific theory attributed to one of these individuals. Erikson is known for his stages of psychosocial development, which is a prominent theory in psychology. Levenson, while renowned, may not have a single theory that is as widely recognized or as extensively researched using both longitudinal and cross-sectional methods.\n\nAdditionally, Erikson's theory has been tested and supported through various research methods, including longitudinal studies that track individuals through different stages of their lives and cross-sectional studies that compare different age groups at a single point in time.\n\nGiven this information, I believe that the correct answer is D. Erikson, as his theory of psychosocial development has received substantial support from both longitudinal and cross-sectional research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
