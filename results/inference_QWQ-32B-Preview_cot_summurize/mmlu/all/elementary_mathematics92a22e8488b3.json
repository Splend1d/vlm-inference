I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. It's giving me an expression, 4x + 9, and telling me that x equals 4. So, I need to plug in x = 4 into the expression and calculate the result.\n\nLet me write it down step by step.\n\nThe expression is:\n\n4x + 9\n\nAnd x = 4.\n\nSo, substitute x with 4:\n\n4*(4) + 9\n\nNow, I need to perform the multiplication first, because according to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), multiplication comes before addition.\n\n4*4 is 16.\n\nSo now, it's:\n\n16 + 9\n\nAdding those together gives me 25.\n\nTherefore, the value of 4x + 9 when x = 4 is 25.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 13\n\nB. 17\n\nC. 25\n\nD. 52\n\nOption C is 25, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should double-check my steps.\n\nStarting again:\n\nExpression: 4x + 9\n\nGiven: x = 4\n\nSubstitute: 4*(4) + 9\n\nMultiply: 4*4 = 16\n\nThen add: 16 + 9 = 25\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider if there's any other way to interpret the expression. For example, maybe someone might\u8bef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f4 times (x + 9), but that would be 4*(x + 9), which is different from 4x + 9. In this case, it's clearly 4x plus 9.\n\nAlso, ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors. 4 times 4 is indeed 16, and 16 plus 9 is 25. No mistakes there.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is 25, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
