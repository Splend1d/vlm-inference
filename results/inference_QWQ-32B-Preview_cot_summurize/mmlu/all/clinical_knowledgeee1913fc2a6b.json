                    "text": "To figure out how much energy is expended based on the athlete's oxygen uptake, we need to understand the relationship between oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. \n\nFirst, let's recall that the body uses oxygen to produce energy through cellular respiration. The amount of energy produced can be estimated based on the amount of oxygen consumed. There's a standard value that relates oxygen consumption to energy expenditure, which is approximately 20 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed. This value is an average and can vary slightly depending on the type of activity and the individual's metabolic efficiency.\n\nGiven that, we can calculate the total energy expended by multiplying the oxygen consumption rate by the time of exercise and then by the energy equivalent per liter of oxygen.\n\nSo, the athlete's oxygen uptake is 3.0 liters per minute, and the exercise duration is 5 minutes.\n\nFirst, calculate the total oxygen consumed:\n\nTotal oxygen consumed = oxygen uptake rate \u00d7 time\n\nTotal oxygen consumed = 3.0 L/min \u00d7 5 min = 15 liters\n\nNext, calculate the total energy expended:\n\nEnergy expended = total oxygen consumed \u00d7 energy per liter of oxygen\n\nEnergy expended = 15 L \u00d7 20 kJ/L = 300 kJ\n\nTherefore, the approximate energy expended is 300 kJ.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 300 kJ.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
