                    "text": "So I have this question about concave mirrors and how the image changes as the object moves from far away towards the focal point. Let's see. Concave mirrors are the ones that curve inward, like a spoon's inner surface. They can form different types of images depending on where the object is placed relative to the mirror.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basic properties of image formation by concave mirrors. I remember that there's a focal point, which is a specific distance from the mirror where parallel rays converge after reflecting off the mirror. The location of this focal point determines how the image is formed.\n\nWhen an object is placed very far away from the concave mirror, the image is formed at the focal point, and it's real, inverted, and much smaller than the object. As the object moves closer to the mirror, the image should move somewhere, and its size should change too.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine the object is at infinity. The image is at the focal point, and it's tiny. Now, if I bring the object closer, say beyond the center of curvature, the image should still be real and inverted but maybe a bit larger. As the object comes closer to the center of curvature, the image moves farther away from the mirror and gets larger.\n\nWait, is that right? I think I need to refer to the mirror formula to get this straight. The mirror formula is:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.\n\nLet's rearrange this to solve for di:\n\ndi = (f do)/(do - f)\n\nAnd the magnification m is:\n\nm = -di / do\n\nSo, as do decreases from infinity towards the focal point, di should change accordingly.\n\nLet me consider some specific cases.\n\nCase 1: do approaches infinity.\n\nThen di approaches f, and m approaches -f/infinity, which is nearly zero. So the image is small, real, and inverted.\n\nCase 2: do = 2f (at the center of curvature).\n\nThen di = f, and m = -f/(2f) = -1/2. So the image is half the size, real, and inverted.\n\nWait, no. Let's check that.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\ndi = (f do)/(do - f) = (f * 2f)/(2f - f) = (2f\u00b2)/f = 2f\n\nSo di = 2f, not f.\n\nThen m = -di/do = -2f / 2f = -1.\n\nSo the image is same size, real, and inverted.\n\nHmm, I must have misremembered that.\n\nCase 3: do = f.\n\nThis would make di = (f * f)/(f - f) = f\u00b2/0, which is undefined. So the image is formed at infinity.\n\nBut actually, when do = f, the image is formed at infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate.\n\ndi = (f do)/(do - f) = (f * f)/(f - f) = f\u00b2/0, which is infinity.\n\nYes, so when do = f, di approaches infinity.\n\nSo, as the object comes from infinity towards the focal point, the image moves from f towards infinity.\n\nAnd the magnification m = -di/do.\n\nSo, as do decreases from infinity to f, di increases from f to infinity, and m increases from 0 to -infinity.\n\nWait, in terms of size, |m| increases from 0 to infinity.\n\nSo the image starts very small and gets larger and larger as the object approaches the focal point.\n\nAlso, since m is negative, the image is inverted.\n\nBut the question is about what happens as the object moves from far away towards the focal point.\n\nSo, the image moves away from the mirror (from f towards infinity) and gets taller (from small to large).\n\nBut wait, the options say:\n\nA. The image moves away from the mirror and gets shorter.\n\nB. The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nC. The image moves toward the mirror and gets shorter.\n\nD. The image moves toward the mirror and gets taller.\n\nHmm, according to my analysis, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nSo, option B seems to be correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAs do decreases from infinity to f, di increases from f to infinity, and |m| increases from 0 to infinity.\n\nSo, yes, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nWait, but I think I need to consider what happens when do is less than f.\n\nThe question says \"as the object is moved from far away to near the focal point.\"\n\nSo, does it mean do decreases from infinity down to f.\n\nOr does it include moving beyond f?\n\nThe focal point is at distance f from the mirror.\n\nIf the object is placed at do < f, then according to the mirror formula, di becomes negative.\n\nLet me check.\n\nSuppose do = f/2.\n\nThen di = (f * f/2)/(f/2 - f) = (f\u00b2/2)/(-f/2) = -f.\n\nSo di is negative, which means the image is virtual, on the same side as the object.\n\nAnd m = -di/do = -(-f)/(f/2) = f / (f/2) = 2.\n\nSo, the image is upright and magnified.\n\nBut the question specifies \"as the object is moved from far away to near the focal point.\"\n\nSo, if do decreases from infinity to f, di increases from f to infinity, and m increases from 0 to -infinity.\n\nThus, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nBut, if do decreases below f, the image becomes virtual, on the same side, and magnified.\n\nBut in the scenario given, it's moving towards the focal point, which is do approaching f from larger values, not going beyond f.\n\nSo, as long as do is greater than f, moving towards f, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct.\n\nWait, but I think I should confirm this with a ray diagram.\n\nIn a concave mirror, when the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point, real and inverted, small.\n\nAs the object comes closer to the mirror, still beyond C (center of curvature), the image moves beyond C, real and inverted, and larger.\n\nWhen the object is at C, the image is at C, same size, real and inverted.\n\nWhen the object is between C and F, the image is beyond C, real and inverted, larger than the object.\n\nWhen the object is at F, the image is at infinity.\n\nWhen the object is between F and the mirror, the image is virtual, upright, and magnified.\n\nBut the question is about moving from far away to near the focal point, meaning do decreases from infinity to f, staying do > f.\n\nSo, in that case, the image moves from f to infinity, and gets larger (more magnified, since |m| increases).\n\nTherefore, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nSo, option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, I think there's a confusion here.\n\nIf do decreases from infinity to f, di increases from f to infinity.\n\nSo, the image is moving away from the mirror.\n\nAnd since |m| increases, the image gets taller.\n\nHence, B is correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should check a specific example.\n\nLet\u2019s say f = 10 cm.\n\nCase 1: do = 100 cm.\n\nThen di = (10*100)/(100-10) = 1000/90 \u2248 11.11 cm.\n\nMagnification m = -11.11 / 100 = -0.111.\n\nSo, image is real, inverted, 0.111 times the size of the object.\n\nCase 2: do = 20 cm.\n\ndi = (10*20)/(20-10) = 200/10 = 20 cm.\n\nm = -20 / 20 = -1.\n\nImage is real, inverted, same size as object.\n\nCase 3: do = 15 cm.\n\ndi = (10*15)/(15-10) = 150/5 = 30 cm.\n\nm = -30 / 15 = -2.\n\nImage is real, inverted, twice the size of the object.\n\nCase 4: do = 10 cm (at focal point).\n\ndi approaches infinity.\n\nm approaches -infinity.\n\nSo, as do decreases from 100 cm to 10 cm, di increases from 11.11 cm to 30 cm to approaching infinity, and |m| increases from 0.111 to 1 to 2 to infinity.\n\nThus, the image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. The image moves away from the mirror and gets taller.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
