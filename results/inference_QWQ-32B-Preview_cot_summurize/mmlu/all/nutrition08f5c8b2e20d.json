                    "text": "So I've got this question about energy intake and stuff. Let's see what it's asking. It says that on average, a healthy woman takes in 9279 kJ of gross energy daily. Then, her faeces have 647 kJ and urine has 318 kJ of energy content. I need to find her average daily digestible energy intake and metabolisable energy intake from the options given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these terms mean. Gross energy intake is the total energy from food and drink. Digestible energy intake should be the energy that's actually digested, right? That means the gross energy minus what's lost in faeces, I think. Because faeces are undigested material.\n\nAnd metabolisable energy intake is probably the energy that's available for metabolism, which would be the digestible energy minus the energy in urine, maybe? Wait, but urine contains some energy from metabolic processes.\n\nLet me try to think this through step by step.\n\nOption A says 647 kJ and 318 kJ. That can't be right because those are the energy contents of faeces and urine, not the digestible and metabolisable energy intakes. So option A is probably wrong.\n\nOption B has 9279 - 318 kJ and 9279 - 647 kJ. So that's subtracting urine energy from gross energy and faeces energy from gross energy. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let's see.\n\nOption C adds the urine and faeces energy to the gross energy, which doesn't make sense to me because they're losses, not gains. So option C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D has 9279 - 647 kJ and 9279 - (647 + 318) kJ. So digestible energy is gross energy minus faeces energy, and metabolisable energy is gross energy minus both faeces and urine energy. This seems logical.\n\nLet me confirm the definitions.\n\nDigestible energy should be the gross energy minus the energy in faeces, because faeces contain the undigested energy.\n\nMetabolisable energy should be the digestible energy minus the energy lost in urine and gases, but the question only mentions faeces and urine.\n\nSo, metabolisable energy would be gross energy minus energy in faeces and urine.\n\nWait, but some energy is also lost in gases, but the question doesn't mention that, so maybe we can ignore that.\n\nSo, according to this, digestible energy is gross energy minus faeces energy, which is 9279 - 647 kJ.\n\nAnd metabolisable energy is digestible energy minus urine energy, which is (9279 - 647) - 318 kJ, or simply gross energy minus both faeces and urine energy: 9279 - (647 + 318) kJ.\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGross energy: 9279 kJ\n\nFaeces: 647 kJ (undigested)\n\nUrine: 318 kJ (losses)\n\nDigestible energy: gross - faeces = 9279 - 647 = 8632 kJ\n\nMetabolisable energy: digestible - urine = 8632 - 318 = 8314 kJ\n\nOr directly: gross - (faeces + urine) = 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 kJ\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nOption A is just the energy in faeces and urine, which isn't what's asked.\n\nOption B subtracts urine from gross for digestible, which doesn't make sense, and subtracts faeces from gross for metabolisable, which also doesn't align with the definitions.\n\nOption C adds the energy of faeces and urine to gross energy, which would be incorrect because they are losses, not gains.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: 9279 - 647 kJ and 9279 - (647 + 318) kJ.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
