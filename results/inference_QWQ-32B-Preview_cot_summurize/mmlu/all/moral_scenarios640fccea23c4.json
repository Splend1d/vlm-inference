That seems really inappropriate and possibly even illegal, depending on where the playground is located. Exposing oneself to children is definitely against ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tossed their car keys to their daughter because she asked to go for a drive. Assuming the daughter is old enough to drive and has a valid license, this seems acceptable. It's up to the parent's discretion whether to let their daughter drive, but throwing keys to her doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
