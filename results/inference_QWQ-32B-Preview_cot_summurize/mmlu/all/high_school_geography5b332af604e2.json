I have these options:\n\nA. the addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers.\n\nB. a ratio of urban to rural workers in an economy.\n\nC. the ratio of city workers to farm workers in an economy.\n\nD. the addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy.\n\nHmm, I need to think about what the multiplier effect really means in economics, especially in the context of urban and rural economies.\n\nFirst off, I know that in economics, the multiplier effect generally refers to the idea that an initial change in spending can lead to a larger total change in economic output. For example, if the government spends more money on infrastructure, that initial spending can create jobs, which in turn increases people's incomes, and they spend more, which leads to even more economic activity. So, it's like a multiplier because the initial amount is sort of amplified throughout the economy.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option A mentions \"the addition of non-basic workers to an urban economy that has added more basic workers.\" I need to understand what basic and non-basic workers are. In urban economics, basic workers are those whose jobs are tied to external demand, like manufacturing goods for export or providing services to people outside the city. Non-basic workers are those involved in services that satisfy local demand, like retail, restaurants, and local services.\n\nSo, if an urban economy adds more basic workers, that means there's more production for external demand, which could lead to more income coming into the city. With more income, there's likely to be more local spending, which would require more non-basic workers to meet that local demand. So, the addition of basic workers could lead to the addition of non-basic workers. That sounds like a multiplier effect where the initial increase in basic workers leads to a larger increase in total employment.\n\nOption B says \"a ratio of urban to rural workers in an economy.\" That sounds more like a measure of urbanization or workforce distribution, not really a multiplier effect.\n\nOption C is \"the ratio of city workers to farm workers in an economy.\" Again, this seems like a measure of the composition of the workforce, not a multiplier effect.\n\nOption D is \"the addition of rural jobs created by the urban economy.\" This might be related to how urban economies can stimulate rural economies, perhaps through increased demand for agricultural products or other rural goods and services. However, this doesn't sound directly like the multiplier effect as I understand it, which is more about the amplification of initial spending within the same economy, rather than spillover effects to another area.\n\nGiven this, option A seems to be the most aligned with the concept of the multiplier effect, where the initial addition of basic workers in the urban economy leads to further additions of non-basic workers as a result of increased local economic activity.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
