                    "text": "So I've got this question about Calvin and his fear of dogs. It says his fear was so bad that he couldn't even visit friends who had dogs or lived in neighborhoods with lots of dogs. Then, he sought help and started working on overcoming this fear. The method used involved watching his counselor play with a dog and, later, actually touching and petting a dog himself. The question is asking what this method is called, and there are four options: A) countertransference, B) peer-counselor alliance, C) rational-emotive therapy, and D) systematic desensitization.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means to see which one fits the description.\n\nA) Countertransference: I think this has to do with the counselor's emotional response to the client. Like, if the counselor starts developing feelings for the client or something like that. But in this case, it's about Calvin overcoming his fear, so maybe not directly related.\n\nB) Peer-counselor alliance: I'm not entirely sure what this means. Maybe it's about the relationship between the counselor and the client, like building trust and cooperation. But again, the focus here is on the method used to help Calvin with his fear.\n\nC) Rational-emotive therapy: I believe this is a type of therapy developed by Albert Ellis, where the therapist helps the client to identify and challenge irrational beliefs that lead to emotional distress. So, it's more about changing thought patterns and beliefs.\n\nD) Systematic desensitization: I think this is a method used in behavior therapy to help people overcome phobias or fears by gradually exposing them to the feared object or situation in a controlled way.\n\nLooking back at the scenario, Calvin started by watching his counselor play with a dog, and then later touched and petted a dog himself. This sounds like a step-by-step approach to getting more comfortable around dogs, starting from a distance and gradually getting closer.\n\nSystematic desensitization matches this description because it involves creating a hierarchy of fear-provoking situations and then exposing the person to these situations in a gradual and controlled manner, often combined with relaxation techniques.\n\nRational-emotive therapy, on the other hand, focuses more on changing the thoughts and beliefs that cause the fear, rather than gradually exposing the person to the feared object.\n\nCountertransference seems unrelated to the method used to help the client overcome their fear.\n\nPeer-counselor alliance might be important in the therapeutic relationship, but it doesn't describe the specific method used to address the fear.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D) systematic desensitization.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider each option again.\n\nA) Countertransference: This is more about the counselor's feelings toward the client, not the method used to treat the client.\n\nB) Peer-counselor alliance: This might refer to the collaboration between the counselor and the client, but it's not a specific therapeutic technique for overcoming phobias.\n\nC) Rational-emotive therapy: While this can be used to treat phobias by challenging irrational beliefs, the scenario described seems more behaviorally oriented, focusing on exposure rather than cognitive restructuring.\n\nD) Systematic desensitization: This directly involves gradual exposure to the feared stimulus, which aligns with Calvin watching the counselor play with a dog and then eventually petting the dog himself.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, systematic desensitization is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
