                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these situations isn't an example of price discrimination. Let's see what price discrimination even means. From what I remember, price discrimination is when a seller charges different prices to different buyers for the same product based on their ability or willingness to pay. It's like charging more to people who are willing to pay more and less to those who aren't.\n\nOkay, let's look at option A: Brent works nights, so he chooses to buy bread at 7 a.m. rather than at 7 p.m. Hmm, is this price discrimination? Well, maybe the store charges different prices at different times of the day. Like, maybe bread is cheaper early in the morning to encourage people to buy it then, or maybe it's more expensive in the evening because people are willing to pay more for convenience. If the store is setting different prices based on the time of day, that could be considered a form of price discrimination based on when people shop.\n\nMoving on to option B: Bob and Nancy each receive a \"$1 off\" coupon in the mail, but Bob redeems it while Nancy does not. This seems a bit different. Here, the seller is offering a discount to both Bob and Nancy, but only Bob chooses to use it. So, the price difference isn't being set by the seller based on who they think will pay more; it's up to the individual whether they want to take the discount or not. So, maybe this isn't price discrimination because the seller isn't actively choosing to charge different prices based on the buyers' characteristics; they're offering a discount to everyone and letting them decide.\n\nOption C: Katie buys 12 Cokes for $3, and Josh buys one Coke at a time for $1. So, Katie is getting a bulk discount, right? She's buying more and paying less per Coke than Josh is. This seems like a volume discount, which is a type of price discrimination where the seller offers lower prices for larger quantities. So, yes, this appears to be price discrimination.\n\nOption D: Velma likes to go to the movies at the lower afternoon matinee price, and Rosemary would rather pay more for the evening show. Movie theaters often charge different prices for different showtimes, with matinees being cheaper than evening or prime-time shows. This is because they're trying to fill seats during slower times and charge more during peak times when people are willing to pay more. So, this seems like price discrimination based on the time of the showing.\n\nAlright, so comparing all these options, A, C, and D seem to be examples of price discrimination, while B might not be, because the seller is offering the same discount to both Bob and Nancy, and it's up to them whether to use it or not. In price discrimination, the seller is actively setting different prices based on certain characteristics or behaviors of the buyers, whereas in option B, the seller is offering the same discount to both and not differentiating between them in terms of pricing.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
