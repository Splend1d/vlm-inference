                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about real GDP per capita. It says that in 1990, it was $10,000, and in 2000, it was $15,000. I need to find out the amount of economic growth between those years. The options are A) 0.5 percent, B) 5.0 percent, C) 50 percent, or D) 3.3 percent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what economic growth means in this context. Economic growth is typically measured by the increase in real GDP over a period of time. Since the question is about real GDP per capita, it's considering the average real GDP per person, which accounts for both GDP growth and population changes.\n\nSo, from 1990 to 2000, real GDP per capita grew from $10,000 to $15,000. I need to calculate the percentage increase from $10,000 to $15,000.\n\nI remember that to calculate the percentage increase, I can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{new value} - \\text{old value}}{\\text{old value}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{percentage increase} = \\left( \\frac{15,000 - 10,000}{10,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{5,000}{10,000} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.5 \\times 100\\% = 50\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the economic growth is 50 percent. That corresponds to option C.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to look at it. The question is about the amount of economic growth, which I interpreted as the total percentage increase over the period from 1990 to 2000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the average annual growth rate. In that case, I would need to use a different formula, perhaps the compound annual growth rate (CAGR).\n\nThe CAGR formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{end value}}{\\text{start value}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\text{number of years}}} - 1\n\\]\n\nFrom 1990 to 2000 is 10 years, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CAGR} = \\left( \\frac{15,000}{10,000} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{10}} - 1 = (1.5)^{0.1} - 1\n\\]\n\nI'm not sure about the exact value of \\(1.5^{0.1}\\), but I know that it's approximately 1.0414. So:\n\n\\[\n\\text{CAGR} \\approx 1.0414 - 1 = 0.0414 \\text{ or } 4.14\\%\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's not matching any of the options. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question seems straightforward: it's asking for the amount of economic growth, which I think is the total percentage increase from 1990 to 2000, not the annual growth rate.\n\nLooking back at my first calculation, it seems correct. $15,000 minus $10,000 is $5,000, which is a 50% increase from $10,000.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should account for, like inflation. But since it's real GDP, inflation is already accounted for, so I don't need to adjust for that.\n\nAlso, the question specifies real GDP per capita, which means it's adjusted for both inflation and population changes. So, the $10,000 and $15,000 figures are already in constant dollars and per person.\n\nTherefore, the straightforward percentage increase from $10,000 to $15,000 is indeed 50%.\n\nLooking back at the options, C) 50 percent seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut why are there other options like 0.5 percent and 5.0 percent? Maybe someone might misplace the decimal point. For example, if they divide 5,000 by 10,000 to get 0.5 and forget to multiply by 100, they might think it's 0.5 percent, which is option A. Similarly, option B) 5.0 percent could be a mistake if someone thinks that 5,000 out of 100,000 is 5%, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nOption D) 3.3 percent might be another miscalculation, perhaps if someone tries to calculate the annual growth rate and gets around 3.3% per year, but as I saw earlier, the CAGR is approximately 4.14%, which isn't listed anyway.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is C) 50 percent.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if the time period affects anything. From 1990 to 2000 is 10 years, but since the question is about the total growth over that period, not the annual growth, my initial calculation should still hold.\n\nAlternatively, if the question was about annual growth, then CAGR would be more appropriate, but again, the question seems to be about the total growth amount.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C) 50 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
