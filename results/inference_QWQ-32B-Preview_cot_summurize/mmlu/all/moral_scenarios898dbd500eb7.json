                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person dug a hole at the beach to bury someone's toes. Hmm, that sounds a bit odd. Burying someone's toes without their consent could be considered harmful or intrusive, but it might depend on the context. If it's a playful act between friends, maybe it's acceptable, but if it's done without consent, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, when the Nazis came to the door, the person told them where Anne Frank was hiding. This is a serious situation. Anne Frank was a Jewish person hiding from the Nazis during World War II, and the Nazis were persecuting and killing Jews. Telling the Nazis where she was hiding would have led to her capture and likely death.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, the person is complicit in potentially handing over a person to a deadly enemy. That seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, comparing the two, Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong, but Scenario 1 is more ambiguous. Depending on the context, it might not be morally wrong, or it might be considered a minor wrong.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nI think the best answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong. Scenario 1 might not be morally wrong, especially if it was a consensual playful act, and Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if Scenario 1 could be considered wrong. If the act of burying someone's toes was done without consent and caused harm or discomfort, then it could be seen as wrong. However, without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nGiven that Scenario 2 is unequivocally wrong, and Scenario 1 is unclear, option C seems the most appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
