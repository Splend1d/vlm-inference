Empirical methods are never useful in resolving ethical disagreements.\n\nB. Empirical methods are sometimes useful but not always sufficient.\n\nC. Empirical methods are always sufficient for resolving ethical disagreements.\n\nD. Empirical methods provide the only responsible way to engage in moral philosophy.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Stevenson's perspective is on empirical methods in ethics. I remember that Stevenson is associated with emotivism, which suggests that moral statements express emotions or attitudes rather than factual claims. So, from that, it seems like he might not think empirical methods are sufficient on their own for resolving ethical disagreements.\n\nLet me think about option A: saying empirical methods are never useful. That seems too strong. Even if moral statements are expressions of emotion, understanding the empirical context can still be helpful in ethical discussions. For example, knowing the facts about a situation can influence how people feel about it.\n\nOption B says empirical methods are sometimes useful but not always sufficient. This seems more plausible. Empirical data can inform our ethical decisions, but since ethics involves values and emotions, just having the facts might not be enough to resolve disagreements.\n\nOption C claims that empirical methods are always sufficient. That doesn't align with Stevenson's emotivism because, if moral statements are about emotions, then facts alone might not resolve disagreements. People could have different emotional responses even with the same facts.\n\nOption D says empirical methods are the only responsible way to engage in moral philosophy. Again, this seems at odds with emotivism, which emphasizes the role of emotions and attitudes in moral judgments.\n\nSo, based on Stevenson's emotivism, it seems that empirical methods, while sometimes useful, are not always sufficient for resolving ethical disagreements because the disagreements may stem from differing emotions or attitudes rather than just a lack of factual information.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is probably B: empirical methods are sometimes useful in resolving ethical disagreement, but are not always sufficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
