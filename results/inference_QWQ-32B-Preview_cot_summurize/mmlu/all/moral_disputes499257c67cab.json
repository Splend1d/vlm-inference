                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about Reiman's\u89c2\u70b9 on executing criminals, and I need to figure out what he suggests about refusing to execute them. The options are about teaching the wrongfulness of murder, comparing the death penalty to life imprisonment as deterrents, the risks criminals face, and whether criminals are deterred by the possibility of the death penalty.\n\nFirst, I need to recall Reiman's stance on the death penalty. I remember that he is critical of it and argues against its use. So, his suggestion about refusing to execute criminals would likely align with his overall opposition to the death penalty.\n\nOption A says that refusing to execute criminals teaches the wrongfulness of murder. That seems counterintuitive because if you're refusing to execute them, aren't you not carrying out the punishment that some might see as matching the severity of the crime? So, maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B says that the death penalty is a better deterrent than life imprisonment. But since Reiman is against the death penalty, he probably wouldn't support this view. He might argue that life imprisonment is just as effective or even more effective as a deterrent.\n\nOption C says that criminals already face the risk of death. Well, criminals do face various risks, including death, especially in violent crimes or in environments where there's a lot of crime and violence. But I'm not sure if this directly relates to the refusal to execute them.\n\nOption D says that criminals are usually undeterred by the chance of receiving the death penalty. This seems more in line with Reiman's likely perspective. If he's arguing against the death penalty, he might be suggesting that the threat of execution doesn't effectively deter criminals from committing murders.\n\nLet me think about this some more. If refusing to execute criminals teaches something, and Reiman is against execution, perhaps he would argue that refusing to execute them teaches that all lives have value, or that rehabilitation is possible, but those options aren't listed here.\n\nLooking back at the options, maybe Option A isn't so off-base. If you refuse to execute criminals, perhaps it teaches that even those who have committed heinous crimes deserve to be treated with a certain level of humanity, which could be seen as a way of valuing human life and thus reinforcing the wrongfulness of murder. But I'm not sure if that's what Reiman was getting at.\n\nOption B seems contrary to his views, as he likely wouldn't support the idea that the death penalty is a better deterrent.\n\nOption C is a bit vague. Criminals do face risks, but I don't see the direct connection to refusing execution.\n\nOption D seems plausible because if criminals aren't deterred by the possibility of the death penalty, then implementing it doesn't serve its intended purpose of prevention.\n\nMaybe I should consider what Reiman actually says. I recall that he argues that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent and that the threat of execution doesn't significantly influence potential murderers. If that's the case, then refusing to execute criminals might be seen as acknowledging that the death penalty doesn't serve its deterrent function.\n\nTherefore, Option D seems to align best with Reiman's views. He likely suggests that refusing to execute criminals teaches that criminals are usually undeterred by the chance of receiving the death penalty.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way to interpret this. Maybe refusing to execute criminals teaches that the justice system values rehabilitation over retribution, but that's not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it teaches that the justice system recognizes the possibility of error and doesn't want to risk executing an innocent person, but again, that's not listed.\n\nGiven the options provided, I think Option D is the most appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
