                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand this problem about the ticking bomb case and torture. According to Baron, there's an issue with treating it as just a single instance of torture. The options are:\n\nA. Justifying one instance of torture requires justifying the practice of torture.\n\nB. It's virtually impossible for torture to be limited to just one instance.\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nD. Neither A nor B\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct according to Baron's view.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the ticking bomb scenario is. It's a hypothetical situation where there's a bomb that's about to explode, causing massive harm, and the only way to prevent it is to torture someone who has information about how to stop it.\n\nNow, Baron is pointing out a problem with considering this as just one single act of torture. Let's look at option A: Justifying one instance requires justifying the practice. Hmm, that makes sense. If you say that torture is acceptable in this one specific case, does that mean you're accepting torture as a general practice? Or is it possible to make an exception without endorsing it overall?\n\nI think Baron might be arguing that once you allow torture in one instance, it sets a precedent that could lead to its broader acceptance. So, justifying one instance might require justifying it in similar situations, gradually accepting it as a practice.\n\nOption B says it's virtually impossible to limit torture to just one instance. This seems related to the slippery slope argument. If you start using torture in one case, it might become more commonplace, and it's hard to contain it to just that one situation.\n\nSo, both A and B seem plausible. Maybe the answer is C, both A and B.\n\nBut let's think deeper. Is there a difference between justifying the practice and the practical difficulty of limiting its use?\n\nOption A is about the logical or moral justification: if you justify one instance, do you have to justify it in principle, which would make it a practice?\n\nOption B is more about the practical implications: even if you justify it only for that one instance, in reality, it might lead to more instances.\n\nSo, perhaps both are problems that Baron is pointing out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Baron only focuses on one aspect. I need to remember the specifics of Baron's argument.\n\nWait, I think Baron emphasizes the idea that allowing torture in one extreme case can lead to abuses because it's hard to define clear limits. So, it's not just about justifying the practice in theory, but also about the practical risks of expanding its use beyond the intended single instance.\n\nGiven that, both A and B seem relevant. Justifying one instance might require accepting it as a practice, and even if you don't accept it as a practice, it's hard to ensure it stays just one instance.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be C, both A and B.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any reason to choose only one or neither.\n\nIf I choose only A, that would mean Baron is only concerned about the theoretical justification leading to accepting torture as a practice, but not about the practical difficulties of limiting its use.\n\nSimilarly, choosing only B would mean Baron is only concerned about the practical impossibility of limiting torture to one instance, but not about the theoretical implications.\n\nChoosing D, neither A nor B, would mean that Baron's problem is something else entirely, not related to justifying the practice or limiting the instances.\n\nBut based on my understanding, Baron is likely concerned with both the theoretical and practical aspects.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is C, both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
