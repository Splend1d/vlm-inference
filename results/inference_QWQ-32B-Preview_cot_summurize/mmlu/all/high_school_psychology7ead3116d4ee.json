                    "text": "I think the answer is D. group polarization. I've heard that term before, and it seems to fit the description of like-minded groups taking more extreme positions. But let me make sure I understand all the options.\n\nA. Social facilitation is when people perform better on simple tasks when they're in the presence of others, but I don't think that relates to groups taking extreme positions.\n\nB. Deindividuation is when people lose their sense of individual identity in a group, which can lead to impulsive and sometimes extreme behavior, but it's not specifically about taking more extreme positions on issues.\n\nC. Groupthink is when a group prioritizes harmony and consensus over critical evaluation of alternatives, often leading to poor decisions. It's similar to group polarization, but groupthink is more about the decision-making process going wrong because of the desire for agreement.\n\nD. Group polarization is when a group's initial inclination becomes more extreme after discussion. So, if a group tends to lean one way, discussions within the group can make them even more entrenched in that viewpoint.\n\nGiven that, group polarization seems to be the most accurate term for like-minded groups taking more extreme positions. But maybe I should consider if groupthink could also fit.\n\nGroupthink might lead to extreme positions if the group is so focused on unity that they dismiss alternative viewpoints and end up adopting more extreme positions to maintain cohesion. However, group polarization is more directly about the group's views becoming more extreme through discussion, even without the negative decision-making aspects of groupthink.\n\nSo, while both terms deal with group dynamics leading to extreme positions, group polarization is more specifically about the strengthening of the group's initial tendencies, whereas groupthink is about poor decision-making due to a desire for harmony.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. group polarization.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the definitions again:\n\n- Social facilitation: improvement in performance on simple tasks due to the presence of others.\n\n- Deindividuation: loss of self-awareness in group situations, leading to impulsive behavior.\n\n- Groupthink: faulty decision-making by groups prioritizing harmony over critical analysis.\n\n- Group polarization: strengthening of initial positions in a group through discussion.\n\nGiven these definitions, group polarization is the term that most accurately describes like-minded groups taking more extreme positions than the individuals comprising the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
