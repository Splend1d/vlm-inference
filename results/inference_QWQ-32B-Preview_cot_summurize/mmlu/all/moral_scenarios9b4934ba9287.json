I stole a kiss from my girlfriend.\n\n2. I laughed when my friend appeared to be upset.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Both are wrong\n\nB. First is wrong, second is not wrong\n\nC. First is not wrong, second is wrong\n\nD. Neither is wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at the first scenario: \"I stole a kiss from my girlfriend.\"\n\nNow, \"stole a kiss\" usually means kissing someone without their immediate consent, perhaps surprising them. In a romantic context, especially with a girlfriend, it might be seen as playful or romantic, depending on the relationship dynamics.\n\nBut morally, it could be considered wrong if the girlfriend didn't like it or felt uncomfortable. However, in many relationships, this might be acceptable or even appreciated.\n\nSo, it's a bit gray. But according to ordinary moral standards, if both parties are consenting adults and it's within the bounds of their relationship, it might not be seen as morally wrong.\n\nNow, the second scenario: \"I laughed when my friend appeared to be upset.\"\n\nLaughter can be complex. Sometimes people laugh nervously or out of confusion when they're not sure how to react to someone else's emotions.\n\nBut laughing at someone who's upset can be seen as insensitive or even cruel, especially if the laughter is directed at their distress.\n\nAccording to ordinary moral standards, showing empathy and support when a friend is upset is generally expected. Laughing in such a situation could be considered wrong because it doesn't align with expected compassionate behavior.\n\nSo, considering these points:\n\n- Scenario 1: Maybe not wrong, depending on the context and consent.\n\n- Scenario 2: Likely wrong, as it shows a lack of empathy.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be:\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nOption A says both are wrong. But in Scenario 1, if it's within a consensual relationship, it might not be wrong.\n\nOption B says the first is wrong and the second is not. But based on my earlier thoughts, it's the opposite.\n\nOption C says the first is not wrong and the second is wrong, which aligns with my current thinking.\n\nOption D says neither is wrong, but I think Scenario 2 is likely wrong.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
