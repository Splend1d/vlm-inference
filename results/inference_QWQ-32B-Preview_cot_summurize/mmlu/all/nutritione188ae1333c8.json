                    "text": "Gluconeogenesis is the process by which the body produces glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors. Several molecules can serve as substrates for this process, including amino acids, lactate, glycerol, and others. However, not all molecules can be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis.\n\nLet's evaluate each option to determine which one cannot be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.\n\n**Option A: Glutamic acid**\n\nGlutamic acid is an amino acid that can be deaminated to form \u03b1-ketoglutarate. \u03b1-Ketoglutarate can enter the citric acid cycle and be converted into oxaloacetate, which is a direct precursor for gluconeogenesis. Therefore, glutamic acid can be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.\n\n**Option B: Aspartic acid**\n\nAspartic acid is another amino acid that can be deaminated to form oxaloacetate directly. Oxaloacetate is a key molecule in gluconeogenesis, so aspartic acid can indeed serve as a substrate for glucose production.\n\n**Option C: Palmitic acid**\n\nPalmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid. Fatty acids are primarily metabolized through \u03b2-oxidation, which generates acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can enter the citric acid cycle, but the conversion of acetyl-CoA to glucose is not possible in mammals due to the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction. This means that fatty acids cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis. Therefore, palmitic acid cannot be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.\n\n**Option D: Galactose**\n\nGalactose is a monosaccharide that can be converted into glucose through a series of metabolic steps. Specifically, galactose can be phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate, which is then converted to glucose-1-phosphate and eventually to glucose. Therefore, galactose can be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n**C. Palmitic acid**\n\nFatty acids, such as palmitic acid, cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis in mammals due to the irreversibility of the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction."
