                    "text": "So here's this scenario: an employee nails a big contract for their company, and the boss orally promises them a $10,000 bonus at the end of the year for their \"good work.\" But when the year ends, the boss says, \"Sorry, company profits weren't as good as expected; no bonus for you.\" Now, the question is about the legal enforceability of that promised bonus. There are four options:\n\nA. It's enforceable because the employee provided a material benefit to the employer by negotiating the lucrative contract.\n\nB. It's enforceable because the employer had a moral obligation to pay the bonus.\n\nC. It's unenforceable because there wasn't legally sufficient consideration.\n\nD. It's unenforceable because it wasn't in writing.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, the promise was made orally, so that rules out any statute of frauds issues, which typically require certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. So option D seems unlikely.\n\nNow, option B talks about moral obligation. While it's certainly unethical for the employer to go back on their promise, morality isn't the same as legality. Just because someone has a moral obligation doesn't mean they have a legal one. So I think option B is probably not the right answer.\n\nOption A suggests that the promise is enforceable because the employee provided a material benefit. This sounds a lot like consideration in contract law. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties to make a contract binding. Here, the employee's action (negotiating the contract) could be seen as providing a benefit to the employer, which the employer promised to compensate with the bonus.\n\nHowever, in contract law, consideration has to be something that is bargained for and given in exchange for the promise. In this case, the employee didn't negotiate for the bonus; the bonus was promised after the fact. So, it might be argued that there was no bargained-for exchange, meaning there's no consideration, making the promise unenforceable.\n\nOn the other hand, some legal theories might hold that the employee's action constitutes consideration if it was induced by the promise of the bonus. But that seems a bit stretchy.\n\nOption C says it's unenforceable because there wasn't legally sufficient consideration. That aligns with what I was just thinking. Since the bonus was promised after the employee had already performed the act (negotiating the contract), and there was no explicit agreement that the bonus was conditional on the company's profits, it might lack the necessary consideration to make it enforceable.\n\nWait a minute, but what if we consider the promise of the bonus as inducing the employee to continue working until the end of the year? Maybe that could be considered consideration. But that seems a bit tenuous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the promise could be seen as a gratuity, which is generally not enforceable, or maybe as a promise to make a gift, which also typically doesn't require consideration.\n\nBut in employment contexts, there are sometimes exceptions or specific rules. For example, if there's an implied contract or if there are promissory estoppel principles that could apply.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that allows enforcement of a promise even without consideration, if the promisee relied on the promise to their detriment. So, if the employee relied on the promise of the bonus in some way, perhaps by staying with the company until the end of the year, they might have a claim under promissory estoppel.\n\nBut the question seems to be focusing on the enforceability based on consideration, not on estoppel.\n\nGiven that, I think option C is the most accurate: the promise is unenforceable because it wasn't supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\nOption A is attractive because it seems like the employee did provide a material benefit, but without a bargained-for exchange at the time the promise was made, it might not constitute consideration.\n\nOption D is likely incorrect because the promise was oral, and unless there's a specific statute requiring such promises to be in writing, which isn't mentioned, it shouldn't be a bar to enforceability.\n\nSo, my best guess is C: it's unenforceable because it was not supported by legally sufficient consideration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
