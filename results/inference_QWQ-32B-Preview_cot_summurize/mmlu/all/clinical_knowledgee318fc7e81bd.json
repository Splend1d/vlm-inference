In humans, each set consists of 23 chromosomes, so the total number is 46.\n\nTo break it down further:\n\n- Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes.\n\n- Each pair consists of one chromosome from the mother and one from the father.\n\n- Therefore, the total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell is 23 pairs \u00d7 2 = 46 chromosomes.\n\nThis is in contrast to reproductive cells, such as sperm and eggs, which are haploid and contain only one set of 23 chromosomes each.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 46."
