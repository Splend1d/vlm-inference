                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** Maximizing the likelihood of a logistic regression model yields multiple local optima.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how logistic regression works. Logistic regression is a model used for classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class. The model uses the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, to map predicted values to probabilities.\n\nThe likelihood function in logistic regression is defined as the probability of the observed data given the model parameters. To find the best parameters, we typically maximize this likelihood function, or equivalently, minimize the negative log-likelihood.\n\nNow, the question is whether this optimization problem has multiple local optima.\n\nI remember that the likelihood function for logistic regression is convex. That means that the function has a single global optimum, and there are no other local optima to get stuck in. Optimization algorithms, therefore, should converge to the same solution regardless of the starting point.\n\nWait, but maybe under certain conditions, it could have multiple local optima. For example, if there are interaction terms or higher-order terms in the model, maybe the likelihood surface becomes non-convex.\n\nLet me think about this. In standard logistic regression, with just linear terms, the likelihood function is convex. However, if you start adding non-linear terms, such as polynomial features or interaction terms, the likelihood function could become non-convex, leading to multiple local optima.\n\nBut the statement doesn't specify any modifications to the standard logistic regression model. It just says \"logistic regression model,\" which typically implies the standard linear model.\n\nSo, in that case, maximizing the likelihood should yield a single global optimum, with no multiple local optima.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 seems to be false.\n\n**Statement 2:** No classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known.\n\nThis statement is about the naive Bayes classifier and its performance relative to other classifiers when the data distribution is known.\n\nFirst, what is a naive Bayes classifier? It's a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. That is, it assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.\n\nThe \"naive\" part comes from this assumption of independence, which is often not true in real-world data. Despite this simplifying assumption, naive Bayes classifiers have been found to work well in many real-world situations.\n\nNow, the statement says that no classifier can do better than a naive Bayes classifier if the distribution of the data is known.\n\nHmm, this seems counterintuitive. If we know the true distribution of the data, shouldn't we be able to build a classifier that achieves the Bayes optimal error rate, which is the lowest possible error rate?\n\nThe Bayes optimal classifier is the one that assigns each instance to the class with the highest posterior probability, given the instance's features and the known data distribution.\n\nNaive Bayes is an approximation to the Bayes optimal classifier, but it's only optimal if the independence assumptions hold exactly. If the features are not independent given the class, then naive Bayes will make suboptimal decisions.\n\nTherefore, if we know the true distribution of the data and there are dependencies among the features, we could build a classifier that takes these dependencies into account and performs better than naive Bayes.\n\nFor example, a full Bayesian classifier that models the true dependencies among the features would outperform naive Bayes in such cases.\n\nSo, Statement 2 seems to be false as well.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a specific context in which naive Bayes is optimal even if the independence assumption is violated. Let me think about that.\n\nOne possible scenario is if the features are indeed conditionally independent given the class, then naive Bayes would be optimal. But the statement says \"if the distribution of the data is known,\" which includes knowing whether the independence assumption holds or not.\n\nSo, if we know the distribution and the features are not independent given the class, we can build a better classifier.\n\nTherefore, I still think Statement 2 is false.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: False\n\nSo, the answer should be B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
