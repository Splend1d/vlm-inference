So, multiplying them together usually gives you the total cost or the total revenue, depending on the context.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. The international trade gap.\n\nHmm, the trade gap is the difference between the value of a country's imports and its exports. It's related to international trade, but I don't think it directly measures price times quantity. Maybe it's more about the balance of trade rather than a direct multiplication of price and quantity.\n\nB. The budget deficit.\n\nA budget deficit occurs when spending exceeds revenue, often in the context of government finance. While it involves amounts of money, it doesn't directly relate to price times quantity in a market transaction. So, probably not this one.\n\nC. Total revenue.\n\nNow, this seems plausible. In microeconomics, total revenue for a firm is calculated as price multiplied by quantity sold. That sounds exactly like what \"price times quantity\" would measure.\n\nD. Price elasticity of demand.\n\nPrice elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So, it doesn't directly involve multiplying price by quantity.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like C, total revenue, is the most straightforward and direct answer to what \"price times quantity\" measures.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about it again.\n\nIn a market, when a seller sells a certain quantity of a product at a certain price, the total revenue is indeed price times quantity. Similarly, for a consumer, the total expenditure would be price times quantity.\n\nHowever, the question is a bit vague. It says \"price times quantity measures\", but it doesn't specify whose perspective it's from.\n\nBut in economics, especially in microeconomics, \"price times quantity\" most commonly refers to total revenue for sellers or total expenditure for buyers.\n\nGiven the options, total revenue seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlso, the other options don't directly relate to price times quantity in a general economic sense.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. total revenue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
