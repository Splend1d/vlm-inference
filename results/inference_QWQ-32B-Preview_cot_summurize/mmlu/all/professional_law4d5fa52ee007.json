There's a lot going on here, and I need to figure out what happens when the student defaults on his sublease payments and the new owner is trying to recover the remaining rent.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sequence of events:\n\n1. The landlord leases the house to his friend for 10 years with a monthly rental of $300 and a covenant to pay taxes. The lease also says the friend can't assign or sublease the premises.\n\n2. The friend lives there for two years but owes three months of back rent, then assigns his leasehold interest to a professor without the landlord's consent, although the landlord doesn't object.\n\n3. The assignment to the professor says the professor will pay $300 monthly rent but doesn't mention taxes.\n\n4. Six months after the assignment, the landlord sells the property to a new owner.\n\n5. The professor subleases the third floor to a student for two years at $100 per month.\n\n6. The student pays for six months but then defaults.\n\n7. The professor pays the new owner $200 and says to collect the remaining $100 from the student, but the student refuses to leave.\n\nNow, the new owner is suing the student to get the extra $100 for rent. The question is whether the new owner can recover that $100 from the student.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. Recover, because the landlord and sublessee are in privity of estate.\n\nB. Recover, even though he never objected to the sublease.\n\nC. Not recover, because the professor would only be held liable.\n\nD. Not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"privity of estate\" means. Privity of estate is a legal relationship between parties who have successive interests in the same property. In this case, the new owner (as the landlord) and the student (as the sublessee) do have a privity of estate because their interests are connected through the property.\n\nHowever, generally, privity of estate allows the new owner to enforce the terms directly with the sublessee, but only to the extent of the original lease's terms. But here, the original lease prohibited assignments and subleases, although the landlord didn't object when the assignment happened.\n\nThe professor assigned the lease to the student, but the original lease forbade assignments and subleases. Despite that, the landlord didn't object, which might imply some acceptance or waiver of that prohibition.\n\nWhen the landlord sold the property to the new owner, the new owner steps into the landlord's shoes and inherits the rights and obligations under the lease.\n\nNow, the professor paid $200 to the new owner, presumably covering his own rent obligation, and is asking the new owner to collect the remaining $100 from the student.\n\nBut the student has defaulted on his sublease payments. The question is whether the new owner can collect that $100 directly from the student.\n\nOption A suggests that the new owner can recover because of privity of estate. That seems plausible, but I need to consider whether the prohibition on subleases affects this.\n\nOption B says the new owner can recover even though he never objected to the sublease. Again, this seems possible, but I need to think about whether the new owner is bound by the original lease's prohibitions.\n\nOption C says the new owner cannot recover because only the professor is liable. But if there is privity of estate, perhaps the new owner can go after the student directly.\n\nOption D says the new owner cannot recover because the professor remains liable. This suggests that the professor is primarily liable, and the new owner cannot look to the student directly.\n\nI think the key here is understanding the relationship between the new owner and the student via privity of estate.\n\nGiven that the original lease prohibited subleases, but the landlord didn't object when the assignment and sublease occurred, it might be that the new owner can still enforce the terms against the student.\n\nHowever, since the original lease prohibited subleases, and the professor subleased despite that, it's possible that the sublease is invalid or void, and the new owner can only look to the professor for rent payments.\n\nOn the other hand, if the new owner accepted payments from the professor and didn't object to the sublease, it might be implied that he accepted the sublease, and thus can enforce the sublease terms against the student.\n\nBut considering that the student's sublease is with the professor, not directly with the landlord or new owner, it might be that the new owner's claim should be against the professor, not the student.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, the privity of estate allows the landlord to collect rent directly from the subtenant, especially if the main tenant defaults.\n\nIn this case, the professor owes $300, but has subleased part of the property to the student for $100. If the student defaults on his $100 payment, the professor is still obligated to pay the full $300 to the landlord.\n\nHowever, it seems that the professor is trying to pass on the student's liability to the new owner by paying $200 and asking for the remaining $100 to be collected from the student.\n\nBut legally, the professor is primarily liable for the full $300 to the landlord. The sublease is between the professor and the student, so the professor can pursue the student for the $100, but the landlord's direct relationship is with the professor, not the student.\n\nUnless there's an assumption of the sublease by the new owner, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nTherefore, it might be that the new owner cannot directly recover the $100 from the student, and should look to the professor for the full rent payment.\n\nHence, options C and D seem more plausible.\n\nBut option C says \"because the professor would only be held liable,\" and option D says \"because the professor remains liable.\"\n\nBoth suggest that the new owner cannot recover from the student directly.\n\nHowever, I need to consider if there's any basis for the new owner to recover from the student.\n\nOne possibility is if the new owner has accepted payments from the student or has otherwise indicated acceptance of the sublease, which would create a privity of estate allowing the new owner to collect from the student.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems that the new owner accepted payment from the professor, not directly from the student.\n\nThe professor paid $200 and asked the new owner to collect $100 from the student.\n\nSo, perhaps by accepting the $200, the new owner is acknowledging that the professor has paid what he can, and is willing to pursue the student for the remaining $100.\n\nBut legally, since the professor is the one bound by the lease to pay the full $300, the new owner should be able to recover the full amount from the professor.\n\nThe student's default affects the professor's ability to pay, but the professor remains primarily liable.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the new owner cannot directly recover from the student, and should look to the professor for the full rent.\n\nHence, the correct answer is likely option D: not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n\nThis makes more sense than option C, which says \"because the professor would only be held liable,\" but in reality, the professor is held liable, and the new owner cannot look to the student directly.\n\nUnless, of course, there's a specific legal principle that allows the landlord to collect directly from the subtenant under certain circumstances.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, the landlord can choose to enforce rent against the subtenant if the main tenant defaults, but this often requires specific language in the lease or local laws permitting it.\n\nIn this case, since the original lease prohibited subleases, and the landlord didn't consent to the sublease, it's possible that the new owner cannot enforce anything against the student directly.\n\nTherefore, the most probable outcome is that the new owner cannot recover the $100 from the student, and must pursue the professor for the full rent.\n\nSo, the answer is D: not recover, because the professor remains liable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) not recover, because the professor remains liable."
