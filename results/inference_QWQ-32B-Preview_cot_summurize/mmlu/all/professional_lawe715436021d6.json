The robberies were carried out by a single individual who entered the banks wearing a ski mask and carrying a machine gun. The police received information from a reliable informant that the defendant was the person responsible for the robberies. Acting on this tip, the police secured a valid arrest warrant and went to the defendant's home to apprehend him. When the officers rang the doorbell, the defendant opened the door and was placed under arrest. The defendant, who was wearing only underwear, asked the officers if he could put on a shirt and pants. One of the police officers asked the defendant if anyone else was present in the house. The defendant indicated that he was alone. The officer then accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change his clothes. When the defendant asked permission to enter the closet for his pants, the officer told him that he needed to inspect the closet first. While the officer was inside the closet, he saw a ski mask that he recognized as part of the apparel worn by the bank robber. The officer confiscated the ski mask and then allowed the defendant inside the closet to change his clothes. While the officer and the defendant were in the bedroom, the officer's partner decided to conduct a protective sweep of the other rooms of the dwelling to see if any accomplices were present. Upon entering a back storage room, the other officer saw a box containing a large amount of $100 bills. The officer confiscated the money, which was later determined to be part of the money stolen during one of the bank robberies. The defendant is subsequently prosecuted for bank robbery.

                    "text": "This question is about the admissibility of evidence in a criminal trial, specifically focusing on the Fourth Amendment rights regarding searches and seizures. Let's break down the scenario and analyze it step by step.\n\nFirst, there were 15 bank robberies committed by a single individual, and the police have a reliable informant pointing to the defendant as the culprit. They obtain a valid arrest warrant and go to the defendant's home to arrest him.\n\nWhen the officers arrive and ring the doorbell, the defendant answers the door and is arrested. He's only wearing underwear and asks if he can put on clothes. One officer asks if anyone else is in the house, and the defendant says he's alone. The officer then accompanies the defendant to his bedroom to change.\n\nNow, here's where things get interesting. When the defendant asks to enter the closet for his pants, the officer decides to inspect the closet first before allowing him in. While inside the closet, the officer sees a ski mask that resembles the one used in the robberies and confiscates it. Then, the defendant is allowed into the closet to change.\n\nMeanwhile, the other officer conducts a protective sweep of the other rooms to ensure there are no accomplices. In a back storage room, this officer finds a box containing a large amount of $100 bills, which later turns out to be money stolen from one of the robberies.\n\nNow, the defendant is prosecuted for bank robbery, and the prosecution wants to introduce both the ski mask and the money found in his home as evidence. The defense files a motion to exclude these items, and we need to determine whether the motion should be granted or denied with respect to each item.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider the legality of the searches that led to the discovery of these items. Specifically, we need to look at whether the searches were conducted in accordance with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nLet's start with the arrest. The police had a valid arrest warrant, so the arrest itself is lawful. When executing an arrest warrant, officers are generally allowed to search the immediate area around the arrestee for officer safety and to prevent destruction of evidence. This is known as the search incident to arrest.\n\nHowever, in this case, the officer accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to change clothes, which seems beyond the scope of a search incident to arrest. The defendant was already under arrest and in custody, so the primary concerns of officer safety and preventing destruction of evidence might not fully justify a search of the bedroom and closet.\n\nBut, the officer did ask if anyone else was in the house and was told no, which might have influenced his decision to accompany the defendant to the bedroom. Additionally, the officer's decision to inspect the closet before allowing the defendant to enter could be seen as a precaution for officer safety, given the nature of the crimes and the fact that the defendant was alone, according to his statement.\n\nNevertheless, the question is whether this inspection of the closet was lawful under the Fourth Amendment. Since the arrest was valid, and the officer had a reasonable belief that the defendant was alone, his presence in the bedroom and closet might be justified as part of the arrest procedure.\n\nNow, regarding the ski mask found in the closet: if the officer had a lawful right to be in the closet for officer safety reasons, then seeing the ski mask in plain view would likely make it admissible. The plain view doctrine allows officers to seize evidence without a warrant if they are lawfully present and the incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent.\n\nSimilarly, the protective sweep conducted by the other officer to check for accomplices is generally allowed when there is a reasonable belief that the house may harbor accomplices who could pose a danger to the officers or others.\n\nDuring this sweep, the officer found the box of $100 bills in a back storage room. Again, if the protective sweep was lawful, and the money was in plain view, it could be seized and admitted into evidence.\n\nHowever, the defense is arguing to exclude these items, suggesting that they were obtained through unlawful searches. So, we need to consider whether the officers' actions exceeded the scope of what was legally permitted.\n\nLet's look at each item separately.\n\nFirst, the ski mask:\n\n- The officer accompanied the defendant to the bedroom to change clothes, and then inspected the closet before allowing the defendant to enter.\n\n- The officer saw the ski mask in plain view during this inspection.\n\n- If the officer had a lawful right to be in the closet for officer safety reasons, then the seizure of the ski mask would be permissible under the plain view doctrine.\n\nBut was the officer's presence in the closet lawful? The defendant was already under arrest and in custody. The officer's request to inspect the closet could be seen as reasonable precaution given the circumstances of the crime and the defendant's status as a suspect in multiple bank robberies.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that the seizure of the ski mask was lawful, and the motion to exclude it should be denied.\n\nNow, the money found in the back storage room:\n\n- The other officer conducted a protective sweep of the house to ensure there were no accomplices.\n\n- During this sweep, he found the box of $100 bills.\n\n- If the protective sweep was lawful, and the money was in plain view, then it could be seized and admitted into evidence.\n\nProtective sweeps are allowed when officers have a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to the officers or others.\n\nIn this case, the officer was conducting a protective sweep after being told that the defendant was alone. However, given that the defendant was involved in multiple bank robberies, which could involve accomplices, there might be a reasonable basis for the sweep.\n\nTherefore, if the sweep was lawful, the discovery of the money in plain view would be admissible.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that both the ski mask and the money were discovered during lawful searches conducted in conjunction with the arrest.\n\nTherefore, the motion to exclude both items should be denied.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. denied with respect to both the ski mask and the money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
