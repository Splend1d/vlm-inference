This seems like a good starting point because before diving into specific tactics or technologies, it's important to have a clear grasp of the current landscape, the target audience, and the goals of the campaign.\n\nLet me think about this. A situation analysis would help identify key stakeholders, the current state of college tuition savings, any existing programs or competitors, and the overall market or environment. This foundational knowledge is crucial for developing an effective public relations strategy.\n\nOption A, researching pricing and development costs, seems more related to the implementation phase rather than the initial planning. While budget is important, without understanding the needs and context, the budgeting might not be aligned with the actual requirements.\n\nOption B, developing a survey to discover which factors impact families' savings, is a good idea, but it seems like a component of the situation analysis rather than the first step itself. Maybe it's part of the research within the situation analysis.\n\nOption D, holding a focus group to determine which messages are most effective, is also valuable, but again, it seems more appropriate after you have a clearer understanding of the situation and perhaps some initial ideas to test.\n\nSo, conducting a situation analysis seems like the most comprehensive first step. It would likely involve gathering data on the target audience, the program itself, the competitive environment, and the overall context in which the campaign will operate.\n\nMoreover, since the campaign is to promote a college tuition savings program using new technologies, the situation analysis should also consider the technological landscape: what platforms are popular among the target audience, how they prefer to receive information, and what new technologies could be effectively utilized in the campaign.\n\nIn summary, starting with a situation analysis allows for a thorough understanding of the environment and the needs, which will inform all subsequent steps in developing the public relations campaign.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
