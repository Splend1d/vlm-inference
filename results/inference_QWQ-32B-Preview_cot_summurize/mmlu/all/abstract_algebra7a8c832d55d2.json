                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two statements about abelian groups. Let's start with Statement 1: \"There exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank.\"\n\nI know that a free abelian group is one that has a basis, meaning every element can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements with integer coefficients. The rank of such a group is the number of elements in its basis.\n\nFor any positive integer n, I can consider the direct sum of n copies of the integers, denoted as Z^n. This group is free abelian with rank n because it has a basis consisting of n elements: the standard basis vectors. For example, Z^1 is just Z, Z^2 is Z x Z, and so on. So, it seems like for every positive integer n, there is a free abelian group of rank n. Therefore, Statement 1 appears to be true.\n\nNow, let's look at Statement 2: \"A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Betti number of a group is. In the context of abelian groups, the Betti number is the rank of the free part of the group. So, for a finitely generated abelian group G, it can be expressed as the direct sum of a free abelian group of rank r and a torsion group T: G \u2245 Z^r \u2295 T. The number r is the Betti number.\n\nA generating set of G is a set of elements such that every element of G can be expressed as a linear combination of these elements with integer coefficients. The minimal number of elements in a generating set is called the generating number or the rank of G as a Z-module.\n\nStatement 2 says that G is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\n\nIf G is free abelian, then T is trivial, so G \u2245 Z^r. In this case, any generating set must have at least r elements, and in fact, a minimal generating set has exactly r elements. So, in this case, the Betti number equals the number of elements in a minimal generating set.\n\nBut the statement says \"some generating set,\" which could be non-minimal. So, if G is free abelian, then indeed, the Betti number equals the number of elements in any minimal generating set, but not necessarily in a non-minimal one. For example, in Z, which is free abelian of rank 1, you could take {1, 2} as a generating set, which has two elements, but the Betti number is 1. So, in this case, the Betti number does not equal the number of elements in this particular generating set.\n\nWait, but the statement says \"some generating set,\" meaning there exists at least one generating set for which the number of elements equals the Betti number. In the free abelian case, there certainly exists such a set: the minimal generating set, or any basis.\n\nBut the question is whether this condition is sufficient to conclude that G is free abelian. In other words, if a finitely generated abelian group has a generating set whose number of elements equals its Betti number, does that imply G is free abelian?\n\nLet's consider an example. Take G = Z \u2295 Z_2, which is finitely generated. Its Betti number is 1, since the free part is Z. Now, consider the generating set {(1,0), (0,1)}. This set has two elements, which equals the Betti number plus the number of torsion components. Wait, no, the Betti number is 1, and this generating set has 2 elements.\n\nAlternatively, take G = Z \u2295 Z, which is free abelian of rank 2. Any generating set with 2 elements, like {(1,0), (0,1)}, satisfies the condition that the number of elements equals the Betti number (which is 2).\n\nBut to test the sufficiency, suppose G = Z \u2295 Z_2, Betti number 1, and consider a generating set like {(1,0), (0,1)}. This set has 2 elements, which is greater than the Betti number. So, in this case, there is no generating set with only 1 element because the group is not free abelian. Any generating set must have at least 2 elements.\n\nWait, but Z \u2295 Z_2 is not generated by a single element because it's not cyclic. So, the minimal generating set has 2 elements, but the Betti number is 1. Therefore, in this case, any generating set has at least 2 elements, which is greater than the Betti number.\n\nSo, if a finitely generated abelian group has a generating set whose number of elements equals its Betti number, then the minimal number of generators is less than or equal to the Betti number. But since the Betti number is the rank of the free part, and the minimal number of generators is at least the rank, equality implies that there is no torsion part.\n\nIn other words, if the minimal number of generators equals the Betti number, then the group has no torsion, meaning it's free abelian.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 seems to be true as well.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, G = Z \u2295 Z_2, Betti number is 1, minimal generating set has 2 elements, which is greater than the Betti number. So, in this case, there is no generating set with 1 element, which equals the Betti number. Therefore, the condition \"there exists a generating set whose number of elements equals the Betti number\" would not hold for G = Z \u2295 Z_2, which is not free abelian.\n\nOn the other hand, for G = Z \u2295 Z, which is free abelian of rank 2, there exists a generating set with 2 elements, which equals the Betti number.\n\nSo, in general, if a finitely generated abelian group has a generating set with number of elements equal to its Betti number, then it must be free abelian, because otherwise, the minimal number of generators would be greater than the Betti number due to the presence of torsion.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
