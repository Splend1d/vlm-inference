                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these performers made her film debut in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing.' The options are Jennifer Lopez, Rosie Perez, Paula Abdul, and Tisha Campbell.\n\nFirst, I remember that 'Do the Right Thing' is a famous movie directed by Spike Lee. It came out in 1989 and is known for its social commentary and strong performances. So, I need to recall who was in that movie and who debuted in it.\n\nLet me think about Rosie Perez. I know she's an actress and dancer, and I think she was in 'Do the Right Thing.' But was that her debut? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look that up.\n\nWait, perhaps Jennifer Lopez was in that movie. I know J-Lo has been in many movies, but I'm not sure if that was her first film. She's from New York, like the setting of the movie, so it's possible.\n\nPaula Abdul is a name I recognize more from her music career and her work as a judge on 'American Idol.' I don't recall her being in 'Do the Right Thing.'\n\nTisha Campbell is known for her role in 'A Different World' and later 'The View.' I don't think she was in that movie.\n\nHmm, maybe I should recall the main cast of 'Do the Right Thing.' There was Spike Lee himself, John Torturro, Danny Aiello, Robin Tunnel, Martin Lawrence, and others. I think Rosie Perez was in it, playing the character of Tina.\n\nLet me check what I know about Rosie Perez's career. I think she had roles before 'Do the Right Thing.' For example, she was in 'New York Dasni' in 1984 and 'Plaza Academy' in 1986. So, perhaps 'Do the Right Thing' wasn't her debut.\n\nWhat about Jennifer Lopez? I believe she made her acting debut in 'Look Who's Talking Too' in 1990, which is after 'Do the Right Thing.' So, that can't be her debut.\n\nPaula Abdul, as far as I know, started her career as a choreographer and then became a singer. I don't think she acted in 'Do the Right Thing.'\n\nTisha Campbell, again, I don't recall her being in that movie.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider smaller roles or perhaps extras. But the question seems to be referring to a notable performer who made her film debut in that movie.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a trick question, and none of these performers debuted in 'Do the Right Thing.' But that seems unlikely since it's a multiple-choice question.\n\nLet me try to remember if there were any up-and-coming actresses in 'Do the Right Thing.' I think Rosie Perez was already established to some extent by then.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the answer is Rosie Perez, even if she wasn't a complete newcomer, because perhaps relatively to this movie, she gained more recognition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's none of the above, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose the best available answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question is testing my knowledge of these performers' careers and 'Do the Right Thing.'\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, I would guess that Rosie Perez was in the movie, even if it wasn't her absolute debut.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Jennifer Lopez was in it, but I doubt it because her career started a bit later.\n\nI think I'll go with Rosie Perez.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
