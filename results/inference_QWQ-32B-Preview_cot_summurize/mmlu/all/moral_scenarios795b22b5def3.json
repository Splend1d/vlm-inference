The scenarios are: 1) I killed the kitten in my bed. and 2) I laughed at the juggling clown.\n\nFirst, let's look at scenario 1: I killed the kitten in my bed. Killing a living being, especially a pet like a kitten, is generally considered wrong because it involves causing harm or death to an innocent creature. In the US, animals are protected by laws against cruelty, and intentionally killing a kitten would likely be seen as morally wrong by most people.\n\nNow, scenario 2: I laughed at the juggling clown. Laughing at a clown who is juggling seems more neutral or even positive. Clowns are often meant to entertain, and laughing at their performance is a natural response. Unless there's some context suggesting that the laughter was mean-spirited or hurtful, it's probably not considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, killing a kitten is wrong, while laughing at a juggling clown is not wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
