                    "text": "So I've got these two statements about groups of 2x2 matrices, and I need to determine which one is true and which one isn't. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Statement 1 says: \"The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and nonzero determinant is a group under matrix multiplication.\" Okay, to check if this is a group, I need to verify the group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\n\nStarting with closure: if I take two matrices from this set and multiply them, does the result still have integer entries and a nonzero determinant? Well, the product of two matrices with integer entries will still have integer entries, that's straightforward. And the determinant of the product is the product of the determinants. Since both original matrices have nonzero determinants, their product will also have a nonzero determinant. So, closure seems to hold.\n\nNext, associativity: matrix multiplication is associative, so that's satisfied.\n\nIdentity: the identity matrix I (which is 2x2 with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere) is a 2x2 matrix with integer entries and determinant 1, which is nonzero. So, the identity is in the set.\n\nInverses: for each matrix in the set, there should be an inverse matrix in the set. The inverse of a matrix A is A^{-1}, and we know that A^{-1} = (1/det(A)) * adj(A), where adj(A) is the adjugate matrix. Now, since det(A) is nonzero and an integer (because entries are integers), and adj(A) also has integer entries, the inverse matrix should have entries that are fractions, unless det(A) is \u00b11. Wait a minute, if det(A) is \u00b11, then the inverse will have integer entries, but if det(A) is any other integer, the inverse will have fractional entries, which are not integers. So, the inverse may not be in the set unless det(A) is \u00b11. Hmm, that suggests that not every matrix in this set has its inverse also in the set, which would mean this set isn't a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose I have a matrix A with det(A) = 2, which is nonzero. Its inverse would have entries that are half-integers, which are not integers. So, A^{-1} is not in the set, meaning the set doesn't satisfy the inverse property. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, Statement 2: \"The set of 2x2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is a group under matrix multiplication.\"\n\nAgain, let's check the group axioms.\n\nClosure: Take two matrices with determinant 1. Their product will have determinant equal to the product of their determinants, which is 1*1=1. Also, the product will have integer entries, since both matrices do. So, closure holds.\n\nAssociativity: Matrix multiplication is associative.\n\nIdentity: The identity matrix has determinant 1 and integer entries, so it's in the set.\n\nInverses: The inverse of a matrix A with det(A)=1 will have det(A^{-1})=1 (since det(A^{-1}) = 1/det(A)), and as we saw earlier, A^{-1} will have integer entries because det(A)=1. So, the inverse is in the set.\n\nTherefore, all group axioms are satisfied, and Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. That corresponds to option D: False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
