                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option isn't something a federal subpoena can compel someone to do. Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"Submit to a physical or mental examination.\" I think subpoenas can require people to undergo medical exams, especially in personal injury cases or when someone's health is directly relevant to the case. So, I believe this is something a subpoena can command.\n\nOption B is, \"Attend and testify as to persons and/or events related to a cause of action.\" That sounds like a standard subpoena duces tecum, which requires someone to appear in court or before a grand jury to give testimony. Yeah, that's definitely within the power of a subpoena.\n\nOption C says, \"Produce designated documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person's possession, custody, or control.\" Again, this is a typical use of a subpoena. It's common for subpoenas to request specific documents or data that are relevant to the case. So, this seems acceptable.\n\nOption D is, \"Permit the inspection of premises.\" Hmm, I'm not sure about this one. I know that in some cases, like environmental litigation, courts might allow inspections of properties. But is this something a subpoena can directly command?\n\nWait a minute, I think there's a difference between a subpoena and a court order for inspection. Subpoenas are usually about testimony or producing documents, not about allowing access to physical premises. Maybe inspection of premises requires a different kind of legal document, like a search warrant or a court-ordered inspection.\n\nLet me double-check. In federal court, there are rules about discovery, and Rule 45, which deals with subpoenas, generally allows for commanding a person to attend and testify or to produce documents. But inspecting premises might fall under different rules, perhaps Rule 34, which pertains to producing documents and tangible things or entering onto land or other property for inspection and measuring.\n\nSo, perhaps a subpoena isn't the appropriate tool for inspecting premises. Instead, a party would need to seek a court order specifically allowing for an inspection of the premises.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the correct answer\u2014permitting the inspection of premises isn't something a federal subpoena can directly command.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any type of subpoena that allows for premises inspection?\n\nI recall that subpoenas can sometimes include requests for production of tangible things, which might include items on premises, but actually inspecting the premises themselves might require a different legal process.\n\nYes, I think that's the case. So, while a subpoena can request specific documents or items from premises, actually inspecting the premises would need a separate court order.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Permit the inspection of premises.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
