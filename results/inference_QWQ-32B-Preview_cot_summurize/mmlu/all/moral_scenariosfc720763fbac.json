Time-outs are a common disciplinary method used by parents to help children learn appropriate behavior. According to most parenting experts and child development research, time-outs can be an effective way to teach children about consequences without resorting to physical punishment. However, it's important that time-outs are used appropriately and not excessively. For a three-year-old, a time-out of five minutes seems reasonable, as time-outs are generally recommended to be one minute per year of age. So, in this case, the parent is using a standard disciplinary technique that is widely accepted as morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts face paint on a small child's face. Face painting is a common activity, especially at parties, festivals, and other events. It's generally considered harmless and fun for children. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind. First, the face paint should be non-toxic and safe for use on children's skin to avoid any adverse reactions. Second, the child should be comfortable with the process and consent to having their face painted. Assuming that these precautions are taken, applying face paint to a child's face is not morally wrong.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither scenario involves the main character doing something that is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
