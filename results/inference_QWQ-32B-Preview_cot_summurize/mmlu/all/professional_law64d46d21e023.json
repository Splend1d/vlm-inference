The artist was an established designer of collectible ceramic dinnerware, and the studio did production work for many artists who created ceramic dinnerware. The price and quantity term of the contract read: \"2,000 sets of the cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" The contract contained a merger clause. The studio produced the cups and saucers and delivered them along with a bill for $20,000 (4,000 pieces at $5 per piece). The artist refused to pay more than $10,000 (2,000 sets at $5 per set). At the trial of the studio's action against the artist for breach of contract, the studio introduced evidence of an established practice in the studio industry to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece, not a per-set, basis. Is the studio's evidence admissible?\n\nA. No, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract.\nB. No, because the agreement was completely integrated.\nC. Yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible.\nD. Yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract dispute between the ceramics studio and the artist. So, they had a contract that said: \"2,000 sets of cups and saucers at $5 each, payable on delivery.\" And there's a merger clause, which I think means the written contract is the final agreement and overrides any earlier discussions or agreements.\n\nThe studio made the cups and saucers and delivered them with a bill for $20,000, treating each piece (cup and saucer) as a separate item at $5 each, totaling 4,000 pieces. But the artist only wants to pay $10,000, considering it's 2,000 sets at $5 per set.\n\nNow, at trial, the studio wants to introduce evidence that in their industry, it's standard practice to price cup-and-saucer sets on a per-piece basis, not per set. So, they're trying to show that the term \"each\" in the contract refers to each piece, not each set.\n\nThe question is whether this evidence is admissible.\n\nOption A says no, because it would vary an unambiguous term of the contract. Option B says no, because the agreement was completely integrated. Option C says yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible. Option D says yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to understand if the term \"each\" is ambiguous. In the contract, it says \"2,000 sets at $5 each.\" Does \"each\" refer to each set or each piece within the set?\n\nWell, \"each\" is typically used to refer to individual items, but in this context, it's attached to \"sets.\" So, \"2,000 sets at $5 each\" suggests that each set costs $5. But the studio is arguing that in their industry, they price per piece, so each cup and each saucer is $5, and since each set has two pieces, it would be $10 per set, but the contract says \"sets\" so it's 2,000 sets at $5 each set.\n\nWait, but the studio is saying that industry practice is to price per piece, meaning each cup and each saucer is $5, and since there are 4,000 pieces (2,000 cups and 2,000 saucers), the total is $20,000.\n\nBut the artist is interpreting \"2,000 sets at $5 each\" as 2,000 sets, each set costing $5, so total $10,000.\n\nSo, is \"each\" clear here? It seems like it could be interpreted either way, especially given the industry practice.\n\nA merger clause typically means that the written contract incorporates all previous agreements and nothing outside the written contract can contradict or add to it.\n\nBut can industry practice be used to interpret the terms of the contract?\n\nI think the key here is whether the term \"each\" is ambiguous. If it's clear that \"each\" refers to each set, then introducing evidence of industry practice to change that meaning might not be allowed.\n\nBut if \"each\" is ambiguous, then perhaps evidence of industry practice can help clarify what was meant.\n\nOption A says no, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term of the contract. So, this option assumes that \"each\" is unambiguous.\n\nOption B says no, because the agreement was completely integrated. Again, suggesting that the written contract is final and nothing outside can change it.\n\nOption C says yes, because evidence of trade usage is always admissible. This seems too broad.\u80af\u5b9a\u4e0d\u662falways admissible.\n\nOption D says yes, because the usage of trade is offered to give meaning to the contract. This sounds plausible because trade usage can help interpret ambiguous terms.\n\nI think the term \"each\" in this context is ambiguous because it can refer to each set or each piece, and industry practice might shed light on which interpretation is more likely.\n\nTherefore, evidence of trade usage should be admissible to help interpret the meaning of \"each.\"\n\nSo, option D seems correct.\n\nBut wait, option A says no, because such evidence would vary an unambiguous term. But I think \"each\" is ambiguous in this context.\n\nOption B says no, because the agreement was completely integrated. But even in a completely integrated contract, external evidence can sometimes be used to interpret ambiguous terms.\n\nOption C says evidence of trade usage is always admissible, which is probably not true because there might be limitations or circumstances where it's not admissible.\n\nOption D seems the most appropriate because it acknowledges that trade usage can be used to give meaning to the contract terms.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
