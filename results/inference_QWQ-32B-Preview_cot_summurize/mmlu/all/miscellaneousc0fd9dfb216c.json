I believe he wrote around 600 of them, making him one of the most prolific composers in that genre.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is Beethoven. While Beethoven did compose some lieder, I don't think he wrote anywhere near 600. I think he composed only a few dozen songs.\n\nOption C is Liszt. Franz Liszt is known more for his piano music and symphonic poems. He did compose some art songs, but again, not close to 600.\n\nOption D is Mozart. Mozart composed a lot of music, including operas, symphonies, and chamber music. He did write some songs, but I don't think he wrote 600 lieder.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Schubert is the correct answer. He is often referred to as the \"song king\" because of his extensive output in lieder.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm the exact number of lieder Schubert composed. I recall it's around 600, but maybe it's slightly different.\n\nI know that Schubert composed well over 600 Lieder. In fact, some sources claim he wrote over 700 songs. So, approximately 600 is a reasonable estimate.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is A. Schubert.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
