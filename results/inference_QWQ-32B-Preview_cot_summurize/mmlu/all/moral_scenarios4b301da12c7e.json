                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 1: \"I sprayed salt all over my neighbor's vegetable garden.\"\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, someone is spraying salt on their neighbor's vegetable garden. Now, vegetable gardens are usually something people put a lot of time and effort into. They grow plants, take care of them, and probably look forward to harvesting them. Spraying salt on the garden would likely harm or kill the plants, right? Because salt can prevent plants from absorbing water and nutrients properly.\n\nSo, intentionally damaging someone else's property, especially something as personal as a vegetable garden, seems like it's against ordinary moral standards. It's like vandalizing someone's hard work without their consent. That doesn't sound okay.\n\nScenario 2: \"I would kill for that slice of pie, literally speaking.\"\n\nThis one is a bit tricky because of the way it's phrased. The phrase \"I would kill for that slice of pie\" is often used hyperbolically to express how much someone desires something. Like, \"I would kill for a slice of that pie\" meaning it's really, really delicious and they want it bad. But here, it says \"literally speaking,\" which suggests that the person is serious about being willing to kill for that slice of pie.\n\nSo, if taken literally, this means the person is willing to take someone's life in order to get a slice of pie. Now, pie is food, and while it can be delicious, it's not worth taking a human life for it. Killing someone over food is clearly immoral and against ordinary moral standards. It's akin to committing murder for trivial reasons.\n\nBut, perhaps there's some context here. Maybe \"literally speaking\" is just emphasizing how much they want the pie, and they don't actually intend to kill anyone. However, the way it's phrased seems to indicate that they are serious about being willing to kill.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n\n- In Scenario 1, the action is damaging someone's property intentionally.\n\n- In Scenario 2, the action is being willing to take a human life for personal gain.\n\nBoth seem clearly morally wrong, but maybe there's a difference in severity. Damaging property is wrong, but killing someone is much worse.\n\nHowever, the question is asking which scenario involves doing something \"clearly morally wrong,\" and both seem to fit that description.\n\nBut perhaps damaging property is sometimes justified in certain circumstances, like in acts of civil disobedience or self-defense, whereas killing is almost always considered wrong.\n\nBut in this specific scenario, spraying salt on a neighbor's garden doesn't seem to be in self-defense or for any justifiable reason. It seems like an act of malice or vandalism.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a twist. Maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking that one of them isn't wrong.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nScenario 1: Spraying salt on a neighbor's garden is damaging their property without consent, which is wrong.\n\nScenario 2: Being willing to kill for a slice of pie is committing murder for trivial reasons, which is also wrong.\n\nSo, both are wrong.\n\nThus, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
