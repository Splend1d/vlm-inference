                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about financial statements for a specific type of organization: a voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit. So, these are organizations that aren't part of the government and don't operate to make a profit; instead, they focus on health and welfare causes.\n\nThe question is about how these organizations classify their expenses in their financial statements. It mentions two classifications: functional and natural. I need to determine which of these classifications must be reported according to standard accounting practices for such organizations.\n\nFirst, I should understand what functional and natural classifications mean in this context.\n\nFunctional classification refers to how the expenses are used or the purposes they serve. In not-for-profit organizations, expenses are often classified by their function, such as program services, management and general expenses, and fundraising expenses. This helps stakeholders understand where the money is being spent in terms of the organization's activities.\n\nNatural classification, on the other hand, categorizes expenses by their nature or type, such as salaries, rent, utilities, and supplies. This classification groups expenses based on what they are, rather than what they are used for.\n\nNow, for voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations, there are specific accounting standards and guidelines they need to follow, often set by bodies like the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States.\n\nI recall that for not-for-profit organizations, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 116 (SFAS 116), \"Accounting for Contributions Received and Contributions Made,\" and SFAS 117, \"Financial Statements of Not-for-Profit Organizations,\" provide guidance on financial reporting.\n\nAccording to these standards, not-for-profit organizations are required to present their expenses by both functional and natural classifications in the statement of activities. This dual presentation is intended to provide a comprehensive view of how the organization is spending its resources.\n\nSpecifically, the functional classification shows how resources are expended in carrying out the organization's missions and supporting services, while the natural classification shows the types of expenses incurred.\n\nTherefore, both functional and natural classifications are important and must be reported.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nOption A seems to be the correct choice because it indicates that expenses must be reported by both functional and natural classifications.\n\nTo confirm, I can refer to the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 958, which pertains to not-for-profit entities. ASC 958-205-45 states that a not-for-profit organization should present its statement of activities with expenses presented both by function and by natural classification.\n\nAdditionally, the statement should include a reconciliation between the total expenses presented by function and by natural classification.\n\nTherefore, it's clear that both classifications are required.\n\nI should also consider if there are any updates or changes to these standards that might affect the answer. As of now, SFAS 116 and 117 have been incorporated into the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification, and no significant changes have been made to the requirements for expense classifications for not-for-profit organizations.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A. Yes Yes, meaning that expenses must be reported by both functional and natural classifications in the financial statements of voluntary health and welfare nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. Yes Yes"
