And the options are: A. a priori, B. Extension, C. Appeal to ignorance, D. plurium interrogationum.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to identify which logical fallacy this describes. The statement is about assuming something is true just because there's no evidence that it's false. That sounds familiar; I think it's related to assuming something is true by default in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. A priori: I know that a priori refers to knowledge that is independent of experience, like mathematical truths. But I'm not sure if that's a fallacy or if it fits here.\n\nB. Extension: I'm not sure what this means in the context of logical fallacies. Maybe it's not a fallacy at all.\n\nC. Appeal to ignorance: Yeah, I've heard of this one. It's when someone argues that a claim is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. That seems to match what the question is describing.\n\nD. Plurium interrogationum: I think this is also known as complex question or loaded question, like asking a question that presupposes something that hasn't been established.\n\nSo, between these options, C. Appeal to ignorance seems to fit best. But let me make sure.\n\nAppeal to ignorance, or argumentum ad ignorantiam, is indeed the fallacy of claiming something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or claiming something is false because it hasn't been proven true. That matches exactly with the description in the question.\n\nA priori is not a fallacy; it's a type of knowledge. Extension doesn't seem relevant here, and plurium interrogationum is about loaded questions, which is different.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Appeal to ignorance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Appeal to ignorance}} \\]"
