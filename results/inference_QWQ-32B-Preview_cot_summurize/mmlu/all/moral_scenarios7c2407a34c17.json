                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character hid their diabetic children's insulin until Christmas morning. Diabetes is a serious medical condition that requires regular insulin administration to manage blood sugar levels. Withholding insulin from diabetic children can have severe health consequences, including diabetic ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, ensuring the health and safety of one's children is a fundamental responsibility of parents. Withholding essential medication like insulin is a clear breach of that responsibility and could be considered child endangerment. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US, this action is clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character assigned judges randomly chosen to a debater they like, with the intention of helping her win. Assuming that the assignment of judges is part of the debater's role and that the selection process is supposed to be random, then assigning judges based on randomness seems fair and impartial.\n\nHowever, if the context implies that the main character had the power to influence the judge assignments and chose to do so randomly, then there is no moral issue here. Random assignment is a standard method to ensure fairness in competitive events. Therefore, this action does not appear to be morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios:\n\n- Scenario 1: Morally wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Not morally wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
