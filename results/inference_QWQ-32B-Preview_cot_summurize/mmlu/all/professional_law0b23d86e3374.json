                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal problem. It's about a man claiming to be the son and heir of a testator who left his entire estate to charity. The will was executed 10 days before the testator died, and the gift failed. The man is trying to claim the estate, but he doesn't have any proof of a ceremonial marriage. He did establish that his mother and the testator cohabited for many years and that his mother died one day before the testator.\n\nNow, at the trial, the man's attorney calls a clerk from a winter resort hotel. The clerk testifies that the testator and the man's mother came to the hotel for many years, and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator.\" The question is whether this testimony should be admitted or not, considering there's a Dead Man's Statute in effect.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a Dead Man's Statute is. From what I know, it's a law designed to prevent fraud and perjury by prohibiting certain parties from testifying about transactions with a deceased person, especially when it involves claims against the deceased's estate. The idea is to prevent people from making false claims after the deceased can't defend themselves.\n\nIn this case, the man is claiming to be the testator's son and heir, and he's filing a claim against the estate. So, he's a party to the action involving the deceased's estate.\n\nNow, the clerk is testifying about observations he made over many years: seeing the testator sign the register as \"Mr. and Mrs. Testator.\" The man's attorney is probably trying to show that the testator held himself out as married to the man's mother, which could be relevant to establishing a common-law marriage or some other relationship that might make the man the testator's heir.\n\nOption A says the testimony is admissible because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter. That seems correct; the clerk was there and saw the testator signing the register that way. Personal knowledge is a basis for testimony.\n\nOption B suggests it's admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule. I'm not sure about that. The pedigree exception usually allows for testimony about a family tree or relationships, but I'm not sure if this fits. The clerk is not testifying about the family relationships; he's testifying about what the testator wrote in a hotel register.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence. What's the best evidence here? Maybe the actual hotel registers would be the best evidence, but hearsay rules often allow for secondary evidence if the best evidence isn't available. So, maybe not inadmissible on that ground.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nI need to think about how the Dead Man's Statute applies here. Typically, these statutes prevent parties to actions with a deceased person from testifying about transactions with the deceased, to protect the estate from fraudulent claims.\n\nBut in this case, the clerk is not a party to the action; he's a witness being called by the man claiming to be the heir. The statute usually applies to parties to the action, not to witnesses.\n\nWait, but in some jurisdictions, the Dead Man's Statute may apply to witnesses who have interests in the outcome, but here, the clerk doesn't seem to have any direct interest in the outcome of the estate claim.\n\nMoreover, the clerk is testifying about observations he made independently, without any transaction or communication with the deceased beyond what's being testified about.\n\nSo, perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply to this witness.\n\nAlso, the statute is meant to prevent parties from making self-serving statements about their dealings with the deceased. Here, the clerk isn't a party, and his testimony is about objective observations.\n\nFurthermore, the testimony seems relevant to establishing the relationship between the testator and the man's mother, which is central to the man's claim as the testator's heir.\n\nIf there's no direct prohibition under the Dead Man's Statute for this type of testimony by a non-party witness, then perhaps it should be admitted.\n\nBut I need to be careful because Dead Man's Statutes can vary by jurisdiction, and some may have broader applications.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the opponent could argue that the clerk's testimony is hearsay, as it includes what the testator wrote on the register, which is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that is, that the testator was married to the man's mother.\n\nHowever, the testimony is more about the clerk's observations of the testator's behavior over many years, specifically signing the register in a certain way.\n\nPerhaps it's not purely hearsay but rather evidence of the testator's conduct or reputation.\n\nIn any case, considering that the clerk is not a party to the action and is providing independent observations, it seems that the Dead Man's Statute shouldn't bar his testimony.\n\nTherefore, the court should rule the clerk's testimony as admissible, likely under option A, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf the statute only applies to parties to the action, and the clerk is just a witness without a direct interest in the estate, then it shouldn't apply.\n\nMoreover, the testimony is about factual observations, not about transactions or communications with the deceased that could be susceptible to fraud.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is A: admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
