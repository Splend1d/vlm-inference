                    "text": "So I've got this question here about lampreys and lake trout. It says that lampreys attach to the skin of lake trout and absorb nutrients from its body. And I need to figure out what kind of relationship this is. The options are commensalism, parasitism, mutualism, and gravitropism.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these terms means. Commensalism is when one organism benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed. Parasitism is when one organism benefits at the expense of the other, meaning the other is harmed. Mutualism is when both organisms benefit from the relationship. And gravitropism, I think, is related to how plants grow in response to gravity, so maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nOkay, so in this case, lampreys are attaching to lake trout and absorbing nutrients from them. That sounds like the lampreys are getting something good for themselves, which is food, but the lake trout are probably not happy about it because they're losing nutrients and maybe getting injured where the lampreys attach.\n\nSo, if one is benefiting and the other is being harmed, that sounds like parasitism. Commensalism would be if the lake trout weren't being harmed, but just that the lampreys are benefiting. But in this description, the lake trout are being harmed because their nutrients are being taken.\n\nMutualism would require that both the lampreys and the lake trout benefit from this relationship, but it doesn't seem like the lake trout are getting any advantage here. And gravitropism doesn't fit because it's about response to gravity, not about relationships between organisms.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. parasitism.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. Are there any circumstances where this could be considered commensalism? Well, if the lake trout weren't being harmed, but just neutral, but in this case, they are being harmed because nutrients are being taken from them.\n\nCould it be mutualism? Only if the lake trout were getting some benefit from the lampreys, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nGravitropism is definitely not relevant here, as it's about how plants grow in relation to gravity.\n\nSo, yes, parasitism seems to be the correct term for this relationship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
