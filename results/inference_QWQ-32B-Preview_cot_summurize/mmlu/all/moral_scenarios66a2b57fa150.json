This seems careless and potentially dangerous. Hotels have rules about using appliances safely and properly, and leaving an iron on unattended could pose a fire hazard, which is a serious safety issue. So, from a moral standpoint, this action could be considered wrong because it endangers others and shows a lack of responsibility.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character abandons their family during a midlife crisis. This is a profound breach of familial duties and trust. Abandoning one's family typically causes significant emotional harm to spouses and children, and it's generally viewed as a severe moral failing. It goes against societal expectations of commitment and responsibility in relationships and parenting.\n\nGiven this analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
