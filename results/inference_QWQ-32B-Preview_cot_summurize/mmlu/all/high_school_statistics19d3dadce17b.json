                    "text": "To determine which company's fuse is more likely to last at least 1 hour, we need to calculate the probability that a fuse from each company will last at least 60 minutes, given their respective mean burn times and standard deviations, and assuming normal distributions.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n\nFor Company I:\n\n- Mean (\u03bc\u2081) = 50 minutes\n\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3\u2081) = 10 minutes\n\nFor Company II:\n\n- Mean (\u03bc\u2082) = 55 minutes\n\n- Standard deviation (\u03c3\u2082) = 5 minutes\n\nWe need to find P(X \u2265 60) for both companies, where X is the burn time of the fuse.\n\nSince the burn times are normally distributed, we can standardize the variable X to a standard normal variable Z using the formula:\n\nZ = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nThen, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the probabilities.\n\nLet's start with Company I:\n\n1. Calculate the Z-score for X = 60 minutes:\n\nZ\u2081 = (60 - 50) / 10 = 10 / 10 = 1\n\n2. Find P(Z \u2265 1). This is equal to 1 - P(Z < 1).\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, P(Z < 1) \u2248 0.8413.\n\nTherefore, P(Z \u2265 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \u2248 0.159\n\nNow, for Company II:\n\n1. Calculate the Z-score for X = 60 minutes:\n\nZ\u2082 = (60 - 55) / 5 = 5 / 5 = 1\n\n2. Find P(Z \u2265 1). Again, this is 1 - P(Z < 1).\n\nFrom the standard normal distribution table, P(Z < 1) \u2248 0.8413.\n\nTherefore, P(Z \u2265 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \u2248 0.159\n\nSo, for both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is approximately 0.159.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. For both companies, the probability that a fuse will last at least 1 hour is 0.159\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
