                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about Pluto's surface composition. The question is:\n\n\"Pluto's extremely cold (~40 K) surface is composed of:\n\nA. mainly water ice which always remains frozen\n\nB. nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion\n\nC. nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which always remain frozen\n\nD. roughly half ices and half rocky materials\"\n\nOkay, so first I need to recall what I know about Pluto. Pluto is a dwarf planet in our solar system, located in the Kuiper Belt, which is beyond Neptune. It's known for its very cold temperatures, as mentioned, around 40 Kelvin, which is like -233 degrees Celsius or -387 degrees Fahrenheit. That's incredibly cold!\n\nNow, about its surface composition. I remember that Pluto's surface is not made of rock like Earth or Mars; instead, it's made mostly of ices. But what kinds of ices? Well, it's not just water ice, although water might be present. From what I've learned, Pluto's surface has ices of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. So, that points towards options B or C.\n\nOption A says \"mainly water ice which always remains frozen.\" But I think Pluto has more than just water ice on its surface. I recall that nitrogen ice is actually the predominant ice on Pluto's surface. So, option A might not be accurate.\n\nOption B says \"nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices which sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion.\" Perihelion is the point in Pluto's orbit when it's closest to the Sun. At this point, it's slightly warmer, and I know that Pluto has a very thin atmosphere that forms when some of its surface ices sublimate\u2014turn from solid directly into gas\u2014due to the increased temperature.\n\nOption C is similar to B but says these ices \"always remain frozen.\" But that can't be right because we know that Pluto's atmosphere forms when some of these ices sublimate, which means they turn from solid to gas.\n\nOption D says \"roughly half ices and half rocky materials.\" I don't recall hearing that Pluto's surface is half rocky. I think it's mostly icy with some rocky components, but not necessarily half and half.\n\nSo, considering all this, option B seems the most accurate. Pluto's surface is composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices, which sublimate into an atmosphere when Pluto is near perihelion.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check some facts. I know that Pluto's surface has been imaged by the New Horizons spacecraft, which flew by Pluto in 2015. From that mission, we have detailed information about Pluto's composition.\n\nFrom what I remember, New Horizons detected vast plains of nitrogen ice, with scattered areas of water ice and small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide ice. So, the surface is indeed rich in nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices.\n\nAlso, regarding the atmosphere, Pluto has a tenuous atmosphere that consists mainly of nitrogen, with minor amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. This atmosphere is known to freeze out and condense onto the surface when Pluto is far from the Sun, and then sublimate back into gas when Pluto is closer to the Sun, near perihelion.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to correctly describe Pluto's surface composition and behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the surface isn't mainly water ice; it's predominantly nitrogen ice.\n\nOption C is incorrect because these ices do sublimate into the atmosphere near perihelion; they don't always remain frozen.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the surface isn't half ices and half rocky materials; it's mostly ices with some rocky components.\n\nSo, the best answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
