                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about an import quota on foreign automobiles and what effects it's expected to have. So, first things first, I need to understand what an import quota is.\n\nAn import quota is a type of trade restriction where a government sets a limit on the quantity of a particular good that can be imported into the country during a specific period. The purpose is usually to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.\n\nIn this case, it's about foreign automobiles, so the government is limiting how many foreign cars can be brought into the country. Now, I need to think about who this might affect and how.\n\nOption A says it will increase domestic efficiency and protect domestic producers at the expense of foreign producers. Hmm, protecting domestic producers makes sense because with fewer foreign cars coming in, domestic car makers face less competition. This might allow them to sell more cars and maybe invest in improving their efficiency. But does an import quota necessarily increase domestic efficiency? Maybe not directly; it just reduces competition. So, I'm not sure about that part.\n\nOption B says it will decrease the price of automobiles and protect domestic consumers at the expense of foreign producers. Wait, if there's a quota on imported cars, that means there are fewer cars available in the market, which should drive up prices, right? So, if there are fewer foreign cars, and assuming domestic production stays the same, the total supply of cars decreases, which should increase prices. So, this option seems contradictory because it says prices will decrease.\n\nOption C says it will increase the price of automobiles and protect domestic producers at the expense of consumers. This seems more logical. With a quota on imports, fewer foreign cars mean less supply, which should lead to higher prices. This benefits domestic producers because they can sell more and maybe charge higher prices too. However, consumers have to pay more for cars, so they're worse off.\n\nOption D says it will increase the price of automobiles and protect domestic consumers at the expense of domestic producers. This doesn't make much sense. If prices increase, consumers are worse off, not better off. So, it can't be protecting domestic consumers if prices are going up.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let's think again.\n\nAn import quota limits the number of foreign cars that can come into the country. This reduces the total supply of cars in the domestic market, which should lead to higher prices, assuming demand remains the same.\n\nHigher prices benefit domestic producers because they can charge more for their cars. So, domestic producers are protected from foreign competition and can earn higher profits.\n\nOn the other hand, consumers have to pay higher prices and have fewer choices since fewer foreign cars are available. So, consumers are worse off.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that an import quota increases the price of automobiles and protects domestic producers at the expense of consumers. That's option C.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no guarantee that domestic efficiency will increase just because of the quota. Maybe domestic producers become complacent without foreign competition and don't improve efficiency.\n\nOption B is incorrect because reducing the import quota should increase prices, not decrease them.\n\nOption D is incorrect because protecting domestic consumers wouldn't make sense if prices are increasing; consumers are actually worse off.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
