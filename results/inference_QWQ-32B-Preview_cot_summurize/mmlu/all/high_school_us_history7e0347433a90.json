It is not the cause of one poor printer, nor of New York alone, which you are now trying. No!

American desires for independence from Great Britain\n\nB. American rejection of Enlightenment ideals\n\nC. A long tradition of self-rule in the American colonies\n\nD. The weakening of economic ties between America and Great Britain\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Zenger case was about. John Peter Zenger was a printer who published articles critical of the governor of New York colony, William Cosby. He was charged with libel for these publications. Libel was a serious offense back then, especially since it could be used to suppress criticism of those in power.\n\nAndrew Hamilton was Zenger's lawyer, and in his closing argument, he basically argued that the truth should be a defense against libel charges, which was not the case at that time. The jury acquitted Zenger, which was a big deal because it set a precedent for freedom of the press and free speech.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. American desires for independence from Great Britain\n\nWell, the Zenger case happened in 1735, which is about 30 years before the American Revolution. So, at that time, most colonists didn't desire independence yet. They considered themselves loyal British subjects. However, the case did plant seeds of resistance against unjust authority, which later contributed to the push for independence. But I'm not sure if \"most directly reflects\" would point to this option.\n\nB. American rejection of Enlightenment ideals\n\nHmm, Enlightenment ideals emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards authority, among other things. The Zenger case seems to align with some Enlightenment ideas, like challenging authority and valuing free speech. So, rejecting Enlightenment ideals doesn't make sense here.\n\nC. A long tradition of self-rule in the American colonies\n\nThis is interesting. The American colonies did have some experience with self-governance, like through their local assemblies and town meetings. The Zenger case could be seen as an extension of that tradition, where colonists asserted their rights and resisted arbitrary power. This seems plausible.\n\nD. The weakening of economic ties between America and Great Britain\n\nEconomic ties between the colonies and Britain were generally strong at that time, and the Zenger case doesn't seem directly related to economic issues. It was more about political freedom and the right to criticize those in power.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems the most directly reflective of Hamilton's success in the Zenger case. It shows that there was a tradition of self-rule and resistance to unwarranted authority in the colonies, which the acquittal of Zenger reinforced.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe option A is tempting because it was a step towards independence, but as I said, at that time, independence wasn't the main desire. It was more about asserting rights within the British Empire.\n\nOption B is definitely not correct because the case seems to align with Enlightenment ideals rather than reject them.\n\nOption D doesn't fit because the case was about political freedom, not economics.\n\nSo, I think C is the best answer. It highlights the tradition of self-rule and the assertion of rights that were important in the development of American colonial identity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
