                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. We have a group of 10 scores, and the largest score is increased by 40 points. We need to find out what happens to the mean of these scores.\n\nFirst, I recall that the mean of a set of numbers is the sum of all the numbers divided by how many there are. So, if we have 10 scores, the mean is the total sum of these scores divided by 10.\n\nNow, if we increase the largest score by 40 points, that means the total sum of all the scores will increase by 40 points, right? Because only one score is increased by 40, and the others stay the same.\n\nSo, if the original sum of the scores is S, then the new sum will be S + 40.\n\nThe original mean was S / 10.\n\nThe new mean will be (S + 40) / 10.\n\nTo find out how much the mean increases, I can subtract the original mean from the new mean:\n\n(New mean) - (Original mean) = (S + 40)/10 - S/10 = (S + 40 - S)/10 = 40/10 = 4.\n\nSo, the mean increases by 4 points.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I add 40 points to one score, and there are 10 scores in total, then the average should increase by 40 divided by 10, which is 4. That makes sense.\n\nLet me consider an example to confirm.\n\nSuppose the original scores are: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.\n\nThe largest score is 100. If I increase it by 40, it becomes 140.\n\nOriginal sum: 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 + 60 + 70 + 80 + 90 + 100 = 550.\n\nOriginal mean: 550 / 10 = 55.\n\nNew sum: 550 + 40 = 590.\n\nNew mean: 590 / 10 = 59.\n\nIncrease in mean: 59 - 55 = 4.\n\nYes, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that adding 40 points to one score is like adding 4 points to each score, since 40 divided by 10 is 4. So, the mean increases by 4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. It will increase by 4 points.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The other options don't seem logical based on this calculation.\n\nOption A says it will remain the same, but we saw that it increases by 4 points.\n\nOption C says it will increase by 10 points, but that would be if we added 10 points to each score, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption D says it will increase by 40 points, which would only happen if we added 40 points to each score, not just one.\n\nSo, definitely, B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
