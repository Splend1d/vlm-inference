Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to plug in n = 11 into the expression. So, it's 10 - (11 + 6). I should probably handle what's inside the parentheses first because of the order of operations. Yeah, PEMDAS right? Parentheses first.\n\nSo, 11 plus 6 is 17. Now the expression is 10 - 17. Okay, subtracting 17 from 10. That should be negative 7, right? Because 10 minus 10 is 0, and then minus 7 more is -7.\n\nLet me double-check that. If I have 10 and I'm subtracting 17, it's like owing 7 if you think of it in terms of money. So, 10 - 17 = -7. That makes sense.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. -7\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 7\n\nD. 27\n\nSo, A is -7, which matches what I just calculated. But wait, maybe I should check if there's any other way to interpret the expression. Maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations.\n\nLet me see: 10 - (n + 6), and n is 11. So, 10 - (11 + 6). Yes, parentheses first, so 11 + 6 is 17, then 10 - 17 is -7.\n\nAlternatively, if I mistakenly subtracted 6 first or something, but no, the parentheses make it clear to do the addition first.\n\nI think -7 is the correct answer. So, option A.\n\nBut why are there other options like 5, 7, and 27? Maybe someone might think to do 10 - 11 first, which is -1, then add 6, which would be 5. That would be option B. But that's not the correct order of operations.\n\nOr maybe they might have added 10 + 6 first to get 16, then subtract 11 to get 5 again. But again, that doesn't follow the parentheses.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they just subtracted 11 from 10 to get -1, and then added 6 to get 5. But again, that's not following the parentheses.\n\nOr perhaps they ignored the parentheses and did 10 - n plus 6, which would be 10 - 11 + 6, which is -1 + 6, which is 5 again.\n\nBut according to the expression, it's 10 minus the quantity of n plus 6, which is 10 - (11 + 6) = 10 - 17 = -7.\n\nSo, I think A, -7, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
