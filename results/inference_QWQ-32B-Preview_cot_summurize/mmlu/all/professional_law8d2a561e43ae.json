A baseball fan traveled all night to the stadium, planning to purchase tickets from a scalper at the stadium. However, the fan arrived at the stadium after the game had started, and no tickets were available. He proceeded to sneak around the guard at the entrance gate and illegally entered the stadium. He watched the remainder of the game in the standing room only section. The fan became so enraged when the opposition took the lead in the ninth inning that he pulled out a gun from under his jacket and aimed it at the section of spectators in front of him. Before he could be subdued he had fired three shots, killing one person and severely injuring another.\nB. A customer was in a bank filling out a deposit slip when a robber entered. The robber went to the teller's window and quietly slipped a note to the teller, demanding everything in the cash drawer. The customer, who was unaware of the robbery taking place, went to the adjoining teller's window and made his deposit. Upon obtaining his receipt, the customer suddenly collapsed and died of a heart attack. When the robber saw this, he panicked and left the bank before the teller could comply with his demand.\nC. Two men planned to rob a luncheonette during the noontime rush. At 12:30 p. m. , as planned, one of the men entered the luncheonette and pointed a gun at the cashier, who handed over the money. The man left to meet the other man outside as he was standing guard as a lookout. As soon as the man ran out of the door, a police officer tried to grab him. The man evaded the officer for a brief moment. Thinking that the other man had double-crossed him and informed the police of their plans, he fatally shot the other man.\nD. A man and a woman had been feuding for years. In order to show him a thing or two, the woman decided to set fire to the man's house. Before dawn one morning, the woman went to the man's house and lit a match to gasoline she had poured at the man's front door. The house caught fire and quickly spread to the man's bedroom, where the man was able to leap out of the window without injury. A police officer who was driving by saw the woman running away one block from the man's house. The police officer pulled his car up to the woman to determine if she was involved in setting the fire. Upon seeing the officer, the woman starts to flee the scene. As she is running away, the woman pulled out a revolver and started shooting indiscriminately behind her. The police officer was struck by one of the shots and was killed.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these scenarios would most likely result in a defendant being found guilty of felony murder. I need to understand what felony murder is first. Felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if they didn't directly cause the death.\n\nSo, in option A, a baseball fan sneaks into the stadium, gets upset during the game, pulls out a gun, and shoots people, killing one and injuring another. This seems like a straightforward murder case, but is there a felony involved here? Sneaking into the stadium is probably trespassing, which is a felony or misdemeanor depending on the jurisdiction. Shooting people is attempted murder or assault. The death occurs during the commission of these crimes, so maybe felony murder applies here.\n\nOption B involves a bank robbery. A customer has a heart attack while a robbery is happening. The robber panics and leaves without getting any money. Here, the felony is robbery, and someone died during its commission. But the death was from a heart attack, not directly caused by the robber's actions. Would this qualify as felony murder?\n\nOption C is about two men planning to rob a luncheonette. One man enters, commits the robbery, and then, outside, mistakenly thinks the other man double-crossed him and shoots him, causing his death. The death happened after the felony was completed, and it was due to a misunderstanding. Is this still considered felony murder?\n\nOption D involves a woman who sets fire to a man's house as revenge. She pours gasoline and sets it alight. The man escapes without injury, but while fleeing the scene after being spotted by a police officer, she starts shooting at the officer, who is killed. Here, the felony is arson, and the death occurs during the flight from the scene. Is that still considered part of the felony?\n\nI need to think about when the death occurs in relation to the felony. In option A, the death happens during the felony of trespassing and assault. In option B, the death is during the robbery, but it's from a natural cause. In option C, the death is after the felony is completed. In option D, the death is during the flight from the arson.\n\nI recall that felony murder requires that the death occurs during the commission of the felony or during flight from the felony, if the flight is immediate and uninterrupted.\n\nSo, in option A, the death is during the felony. In option B, it's during the felony, but the cause is different. In option C, it's after the felony is completed. In option D, it's during flight from the felony.\n\nI think option D is the strongest candidate for felony murder. The woman set the fire, which is arson, a felony, and while fleeing, she shot and killed the police officer. Since the flight is considered part of the felony for felony murder purposes, she could be charged with felony murder for the officer's death.\n\nOption A might also qualify, but trespassing might not be considered a felony in all jurisdictions, and the shooting seems more like a separate crime of attempted murder.\n\nOption B is tricky because the death is during the robbery, but it's from a heart attack, not directly caused by the robber's actions. I'm not sure if that would count.\n\nOption C has the death after the felony is completed, which might not qualify for felony murder.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
