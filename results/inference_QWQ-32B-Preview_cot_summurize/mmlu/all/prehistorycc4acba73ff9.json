                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question. It's asking about a culture that used hide boats and spread across the Arctic from Alaska to Greenland starting around 700 years ago. This seems to be related to migrations from the Old World to the New World, and it's described as a \"third wave\" of migration.\n\nFirst, I need to understand who these options are:\n\nA. Paleo-Eskimos: I think they were some of the earliest people to inhabit the Arctic regions of North America, but I'm not sure about their boat technology or when they migrated.\n\nB. Dorset: I've heard of the Dorset culture; they were known for their distinctive art and tools. They lived in the Arctic before the Thule people arrived. Maybe they were around earlier than 700 years ago.\n\nC. Thule: The Thule culture is often associated with the ancestors of modern Inuit people. I believe they migrated from Alaska across the Arctic to Greenland relatively recently.\n\nD. Clovis: Now, the Clovis culture is famous for its stone tool technology and is generally associated with the first peopling of the Americas around 13,000 years ago. They weren't in the Arctic region, as far as I know.\n\nGiven that the question mentions a migration starting about 700 years ago, which would be around the 1300s CE, I need to think about which of these cultures was on the move during that time.\n\nLet me consider the Thule culture more closely. I recall that the Thule people were skilled maritime hunters who used umiaks and kayaks, which are boats made from hides stretched over wooden frames. This matches the \"hide boats\" mentioned in the question.\n\nThe Thule migration is believed to have started around 1000 years ago from Alaska, spreading eastward across Arctic Canada to Greenland. This timeline fits with the \"about 700 years ago\" mentioned in the question, especially considering that migrations take time to cover such vast distances.\n\nIn contrast, the Paleo-Eskimos and Dorset cultures predate the Thule migration. The Dorset culture, for example, was present in the Arctic before the Thule arrival and is thought to have either declined or been assimilated by the Thule people.\n\nThe Clovis culture is much earlier, dating back to around 13,000 years ago, and is associated with the initial colonization of the Americas, not with Arctic migrations in the last millennium.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is C. Thule.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about the sequence of Arctic cultures. The Paleo-Eskimos were first, followed by the Dorset culture, and then the Thule culture arrived more recently, around 1000 years ago, bringing new technologies and spreading rapidly across the Arctic.\n\nAlso, the use of hide boats like umiaks and kayaks is consistent with the Thule culture's adaptability to maritime environments, which would have facilitated their migration across the Arctic coastlines.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. Thule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
