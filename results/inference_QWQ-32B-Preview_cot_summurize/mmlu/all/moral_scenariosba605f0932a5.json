The person is sending flowers to themselves, but the intention is to make their coworker feel left out. So, they're trying to make someone else feel bad on purpose. That doesn't sound very nice.\n\nIn general, treating others with respect and kindness is considered morally right. Making someone feel left out or sad on purpose goes against that. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this seems like it's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I went up to the home plate and hit the ball with intensity.\"\n\nThis one seems different. It sounds like someone is playing a game, maybe baseball, and they're hitting the ball really hard. Unless there's more context that makes this action harmful or inappropriate, hitting a ball in a game seems like a normal part of playing.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any moral wrongdoing here. It's just someone playing a sport enthusiastically. So, this one appears to be not wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
