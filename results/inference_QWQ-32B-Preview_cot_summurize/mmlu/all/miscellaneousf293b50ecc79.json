Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what perpendicular lines are. I think perpendicular lines are lines that intersect each other at a 90-degree angle. Like, if you draw one line going horizontal and another vertical, they meet at right angles. Is that right?\n\nOkay, so if two lines are perpendicular, they form a 90-degree angle where they meet. Now, I need to recall what different types of angles are there. I think angles are classified based on their measure. There are acute angles, which are less than 90 degrees; right angles, which are exactly 90 degrees; obtuse angles, which are more than 90 but less than 180 degrees; and straight angles, which are 180 degrees.\n\nGiven that, if perpendicular lines meet at 90 degrees, that should be a right angle. So, the answer should be C. right.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any chance that perpendicular lines could form other types of angles? I don't think so, because the definition of perpendicular is that they intersect at right angles. So, it should always be 90 degrees.\n\nWhat about option D, invisible? That doesn't make any sense. Angles are geometric properties that we can measure and visualize, so they're not invisible. That must be a trick option.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider each option:\n\nA. Obtuse: That's more than 90 degrees. But perpendicular lines meet at exactly 90 degrees, so it's not obtuse.\n\nB. Acute: That's less than 90 degrees. Again, perpendicular lines meet at exactly 90 degrees, not less.\n\nC. Right: Exactly 90 degrees, which matches the definition of perpendicular lines.\n\nD. Invisible: Doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
