To answer your question about the goals of vaccination, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Prevent infection: Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. By doing so, they can prevent the pathogen from establishing an infection in the body. So, preventing infection is indeed one of the primary goals of vaccination.\n\nB. Prevent disease: Even if a pathogen manages to infect a person, the immune response generated by vaccination can often prevent the development of disease symptoms. This is because the immune system is better prepared to control and eliminate the pathogen before it can cause significant harm. Therefore, preventing disease is another important goal of vaccination.\n\nC. Prevent transmission: Some vaccines not only protect the vaccinated individual from getting sick but also reduce the likelihood of that person transmitting the pathogen to others. This is known as herd immunity or community immunity. When a high proportion of the population is vaccinated, it becomes difficult for the pathogen to spread, thereby protecting even those who are not vaccinated. So, preventing transmission is also a goal of vaccination.\n\nD. All of the above: Given that options A, B, and C are all valid goals of vaccination, selecting \"all of the above\" would be the most comprehensive answer.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is D. All of the above. Vaccination aims to prevent infection, prevent disease, and prevent transmission, thereby protecting both individuals and communities from the spread of infectious diseases.\n\n**Reference:**\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
