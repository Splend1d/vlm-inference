I have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I pushed my sister down the stairs.\"\n\nOkay, pushing someone down the stairs sounds pretty bad. It could hurt them, right? In most people's books, that would be considered wrong because it's physically harmful and potentially dangerous. So, I think that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I taught my child that violence is an acceptable solution to frustrating situations.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit different. Teaching a child that violence is okay in frustrating situations seems like bad parenting. It could lead the child to behave aggressively in the future, which isn't good for society. So, even though it's not a direct physical action like pushing someone, it's still problematic because it's influencing someone else to potentially do harmful things.\n\nBut, is it clearly morally wrong? I think most people would say yes, because raising a child to believe that violence is acceptable can have negative consequences for others. It's like planting seeds of harmful behavior.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my thinking, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, pushing someone down the stairs is physically harmful and against basic moral standards of not harming others.\n\nIn Scenario 2, teaching a child that violence is acceptable is morally wrong because it encourages harmful behavior in the future.\n\nSo, both are wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{a}} \\]"
