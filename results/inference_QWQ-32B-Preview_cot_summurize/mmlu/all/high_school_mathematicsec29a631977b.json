                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this probability problem. We have to find the probability that when we pick 3 cards at random from a standard 52-card deck, they form a pair. That means two cards have the same rank, and the third one is different.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a standard deck looks like. There are 52 cards, divided into 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit has 13 ranks: ace through 10, and then jack, queen, and king. So, there are 4 cards of each rank.\n\nNow, to find the probability of getting a pair, I should probably figure out two things:\n\n1. The total number of possible 3-card hands from the deck.\n\n2. The number of 3-card hands that actually form a pair.\n\nThen, the probability would be the number of pair hands divided by the total number of possible hands.\n\nLet's start with the total number of possible 3-card hands. Since the order doesn't matter, this is a combination problem. The number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 52 is C(52, 3), which is calculated as 52! / (3! * (52 - 3)!).\n\nSimplifying that, it's (52 * 51 * 50) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 22100.\n\nSo, there are 22,100 possible 3-card hands.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many of these hands are pairs. A pair consists of two cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank.\n\nLet's think about how to count these.\n\nFirst, choose the rank for the pair. There are 13 possible ranks (ace through king).\n\nThen, for that rank, choose 2 out of the 4 suits. So, C(4, 2) = 6 ways to choose the suits for the pair.\n\nNext, choose the rank for the third card. Since it has to be a different rank, there are 12 remaining ranks to choose from.\n\nThen, choose the suit for that third card. There are 4 suits to choose from for that rank.\n\nSo, the total number of pair hands should be:\n\n13 (ranks for the pair) * 6 (ways to choose suits for the pair) * 12 (ranks for the third card) * 4 (suits for the third card).\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n13 * 6 = 78\n\n78 * 12 = 936\n\n936 * 4 = 3744\n\nSo, there are 3,744 pair hands.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of pair hands divided by the total number of possible hands:\n\n3744 / 22100\n\nI can simplify this fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 16.\n\n3744 \u00f7 16 = 234\n\n22100 \u00f7 16 = 1381.25, which is not an integer. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps 16 isn't the greatest common divisor. Let's check smaller numbers.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n3744 \u00f7 4 = 936\n\n22100 \u00f7 4 = 5525\n\nSo, 936 / 5525\n\nIs this reducible further? Let's see.\n\nLet's check if 936 and 5525 have any common divisors.\n\n936 \u00f7 13 = 72\n\n5525 \u00f7 13 = 425\n\nSo, 936 / 5525 = 72 / 425\n\nNow, 72 and 425 don't seem to have any common divisors. 72 is 8 * 9, and 425 is 17 * 25. No common factors there.\n\nSo, the probability is 72 / 425.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1/8 = 52.5 / 425\n\nB. 1/36 = 11.8 / 425\n\nC. 1/78 = 5.45 / 425\n\nD. 72/425\n\nSo, option D matches the answer I got.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that in some probability problems, the way pairs are counted might be different. Maybe I need to consider that the third card doesn't match the pair's rank.\n\nLet me double-check my calculation.\n\nI have:\n\n- 13 ranks for the pair.\n\n- C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose the suits for the pair.\n\n- 12 remaining ranks for the third card.\n\n- 4 suits for that third card.\n\nTotal pair hands: 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3744\n\nTotal possible hands: C(52,3) = 22100\n\nProbability: 3744 / 22100 = 72 / 425\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the sequence in which the cards are drawn.\n\nFor example, the probability that the first two cards form a pair, and the third card is different.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, it's better to stick with combinations.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as:\n\n- Choose the rank for the pair: 13 choices.\n\n- Choose the suits for the pair: C(4,2) = 6 choices.\n\n- Choose the rank for the third card: 12 choices.\n\n- Choose the suit for the third card: 4 choices.\n\nAgain, that's 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 = 3744.\n\nTotal hands: C(52,3) = 22100.\n\nProbability: 3744 / 22100 = 72 / 425.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can calculate it using permutations.\n\nIf we consider the order in which the cards are drawn, the total number of possible sequences is P(52,3) = 52 * 51 * 50 = 132600.\n\nNow, for the pair:\n\n- Choose the rank for the pair: 13 choices.\n\n- Choose the suits for the pair: C(4,2) = 6 choices.\n\n- Choose the rank for the third card: 12 choices.\n\n- Choose the suit for the third card: 4 choices.\n\n- Arrange the three cards: the pair can be in any two of the three positions, so C(3,2) = 3 ways.\n\nSo, total pair sequences: 13 * 6 * 12 * 4 * 3 = 11664.\n\nProbability: 11664 / 132600 = 72 / 425.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nSo, I think 72/425 is indeed the correct probability.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 72/425, which matches my calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 72/425.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{72}{425}} \\]"
