During that period of time, it had been his regular practice to stay at a hotel in the state's capital while the legislature was in session (namely from September through March). As a general rule, the senator stayed at the hotel each and every night during that seven-month period. When the senator checked into the hotel on September 1, 2007 for the 2007 \u0080\u00942008 term, the hotel manager quoted the senator his usual senatorial discount rate of $50 per night. Although nothing was said regarding payment terms, the senator customarily paid the bill in weekly installments. During the months of September and October, he paid the hotel at the end of each week $350 plus tax and other accumulated expenses. On the last day of October, the senator made his usual weekly payment covering the rental period from October 25 to October 31. Then, on the morning of November 4 (before checkout time for that day), the senator decided to suddenly move out of the hotel and register at a new motel located two blocks away. He notified the manager at the hotel of his intent to check out and tendered a check for $150 plus tax and other incidental charges incurred from November 1 through November 3. When the manager noticed that the senator was paying only for three days, she remarked, \"You still owe us $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus taxes for an additional week because you didn't give us a week's notice that you planned to vacate. \" The senator refused to pay the additional charges.

So, we have a senator who has been staying at a hotel in the state's capital while the legislature is in session, which is from September through March. He stays there every night during this period and pays weekly installments. The hotel gives him a senatorial discount rate of $50 per night.\n\nIn September and October, he paid $350 plus tax and other expenses at the end of each week. The last payment he made was on the last day of October, covering the period from October 25 to October 31.\n\nThen, on November 4, before checkout time, he decided to move out and stay at a new motel two blocks away. He notified the manager and tendered a check for $150 plus tax and other incidental charges for November 1 through November 3.\n\nThe manager said that he still owes $200 plus tax for the rest of the week (presumably November 4 to November 7) and $350 plus tax for an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice that he planned to vacate.\n\nThe senator refuses to pay the additional charges, and the hotel sues to recover the unpaid balance. The question is, how many additional days of lodging will the senator be required to pay for?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. None.\n\nB. Four.\n\nC. Seven.\n\nD. Eleven.\n\nFirst, let's understand the payment terms. The senator customarily paid weekly installments of $350, which at $50 per night would cover seven nights ($50 x 7 = $350). So, it seems like he was paying for each week in advance or in arrears, but the question doesn't specify.\n\nOn November 4, he decides to check out and tenders a check for $150 plus tax and other charges for November 1 through November 3. So, he's acknowledging that he stayed from November 1 to November 3, which is three nights, and thus pays $150 for those nights ($50 x 3 = $150).\n\nThe manager claims that he still owes $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus tax for an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- If the week starts on Monday, and November 1 is a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, depending on the year. But since it's November 1, let's assume it's a Friday for simplicity.\n\nSo, if November 1 is a Friday, then the week would be October 29 to November 4.\n\nBut according to the problem, he paid up to October 31, and then on November 4, he checks out, paying for November 1-3.\n\nSo, from November 1 to November 3 is three days, and he paid for that.\n\nThe manager says he owes $200 plus tax for the rest of the week and $350 plus tax for an additional week due to lack of notice.\n\nIf he paid up to October 31, and then paid for November 1-3 separately, then the remaining days in that week would be November 4-7, which is four days.\n\n$200 would be for those four days ($50 x 4 = $200).\n\nAnd $350 for an additional week ($50 x 7 = $350).\n\nBut the senator refuses to pay the additional charges.\n\nNow, the question is, in a lawsuit, how many additional days would the senator be required to pay for?\n\nTo answer this, we need to understand the lease terms between the senator and the hotel. Since it's a hotel, it's likely a month-to-month tenancy, but with specific payment terms.\n\nGiven that the senator stayed for seven months each year, and paid weekly installments, it seems like there's an implied lease agreement.\n\nIn lease agreements, there often are provisions for notice periods when a tenant wishes to terminate the lease early.\n\nIf the senator didn't give the required notice, he might be liable to pay for the notice period.\n\nIn this case, the manager says he owes an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nSo, potentially, the senator could be required to pay for the remaining four days of the current week and an additional seven days for not giving notice, totaling eleven days.\n\nBut we need to see what the law says in this scenario.\n\nIn general, hotel room rentals are considered tenancies at will, which can be terminated by either party at any time, usually with some notice.\n\nHowever, if there's a written or implied agreement requiring a certain notice period, the tenant may be liable for rent during the notice period if they fail to give proper notice.\n\nIn this case, the manager claims that the senator owes an additional week because he didn't give a week's notice.\n\nIf such a notice requirement exists in their agreement, then the senator might be liable for that additional week.\n\nAdditionally, the manager claims that there are four days left in the current week that the senator hasn't paid for.\n\nSo, altogether, that would be four days plus seven days, totaling eleven days.\n\nHowever, the senator might argue that he only occupied the room until November 3, and thus shouldn't be liable for the remaining days.\n\nBut according to many hotel agreements, if a guest checks out early, they may still be liable for the notice period or a certain number of days' rent.\n\nAlternatively, if there's no such clause, the senator might only be liable for the days he actually occupied the room.\n\nGiven the options, D. Eleven seems to be the total of four days plus seven days.\n\nBut we need to consider if the senator is really liable for both the remaining four days and the additional week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he's only liable for the remaining four days, making the answer B. Four.\n\nOr, if there's no liability for the remaining days since he checked out, then A. None.\n\nOption C. Seven might correspond to the additional week for not giving notice.\n\nTo make a better judgment, let's consider the legal principles involved.\n\nIn lease agreements, if a tenant fails to give the required notice, they may be liable for the rent during the notice period.\n\nIn this case, if the agreement requires a week's notice, and the senator didn't provide it, he might be liable for seven days' rent.\n\nAdditionally, if he owes rent for the days he occupied the room but didn't pay for, which is four days, then the total would be eleven days.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the liability for the notice period replaces the liability for the remaining days, meaning he only needs to pay for the notice period, which is seven days.\n\nAlternatively, he might be liable for both the remaining days and the notice period, totaling eleven days.\n\nGiven that, option D. Eleven seems plausible.\n\nBut let's consider another angle.\n\nIf the senator checked out on November 4, and the week runs from, say, November 1 to November 7, then the remaining days would be November 4,5,6,7, which is four days.\n\nIf the agreement requires a week's notice, and he didn't provide it, he might be liable for an additional week, which is seven days.\n\nTherefore, total liability would be four days plus seven days, equaling eleven days.\n\nHence, the answer is D. Eleven.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any overlap or if the notice period covers some of the days he already owes for.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notice period starts from the date he should have given notice.\n\nFor example, if he was supposed to give a week's notice before checking out, and he didn't, then the liability might be for the week starting from the date he should have given notice.\n\nThis could complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the notice period is meant to allow the hotel to find a new tenant, and if they can't, the original tenant is liable for the rent during that period.\n\nIn this case, since the senator checked out early, the hotel might claim that they lost potential rent for the notice period.\n\nBut ultimately, the legal interpretation would depend on the specific terms of the lease agreement between the senator and the hotel.\n\nGiven that, and based on the manager's claim, it seems that the senator owes four days for the current week and an additional seven days for not giving notice, totaling eleven days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Eleven.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. Eleven."
