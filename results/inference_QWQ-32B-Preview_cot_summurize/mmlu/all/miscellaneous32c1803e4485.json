Okay, so I need to figure out which one among these isn't a Hindu god.\n\nFirst, I know that Hinduism has many deities, and Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma are all well-known gods in Hindu mythology. Shiva is often referred to as the destroyer, Vishnu as the preserver, and Brahma as the creator. So, those three seem to be deities.\n\nNow, Sanskrit is listed here as option C. I recall that Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-Aryan language that's been used in Hindu scriptures and religious texts. It's more of a language than a deity. So, perhaps Sanskrit isn't a Hindu deity.\n\nTo make sure, let me double-check. Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma are definitely Hindu gods. Sanskrit is the language in which many Hindu texts are written, but it's not a deity itself. So, it makes sense that Sanskrit would be the answer here.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to it. Is there any connection between Sanskrit and deities in Hinduism? Well, in Hindu mythology, Sanskrit is considered a divine language, and it's used in rituals and prayers. But still, it's the language itself, not a god.\n\nAlternatively, is there a deity associated with language or Sanskrit in Hinduism? I think there might be gods related to knowledge or language, like Saraswati, who is the goddess of knowledge, music, art, etc. But Sanskrit itself isn't a deity.\n\nSo, overall, it seems clear that among these options, Sanskrit is not a Hindu deity, while the others are.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
