The scenarios are:\n\n1. I added a red sock to my roommate's white laundry.\n\n2. I asked the homeless shelter for food even though I make plenty of money.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: adding a red sock to my roommate's white laundry.\n\nSo, laundry colors matter because you don't want colors to bleed onto white clothes, right? So, if I add a red sock to white laundry, the red might dye the white clothes pink or something. That could be a problem for my roommate, especially if they have favorite white shirts or something that could get ruined.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this seems like a prank or a mean thing to do. It could cause damage to my roommate's clothes, which isn't nice. Roommates are supposed to respect each other's stuff and be considerate.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems wrong. It's not nice to mess with someone's belongings in a way that could harm them, especially without their consent.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: asking a homeless shelter for food even though I make plenty of money.\n\nHmm. Homeless shelters often provide food for people who are in need, especially those who are homeless or struggling financially. If I have plenty of money, that probably means I can afford to buy my own food.\n\nIn this case, seeking food from a shelter when I can afford to pay for it might be seen as taking resources away from people who really need them. It's like using services meant for those in greater need while I have the means to support myself.\n\nThat doesn't seem morally right. It's important to use resources responsibly and leave help for those who are truly in need.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, messing with roommate's laundry could be seen as a prank, but it has the potential to cause real damage. Pranks that cause harm are generally not okay.\n\nIn Scenario 2, taking food from a shelter when I don't need it is exploiting a system designed for those who are less fortunate. That's not fair.\n\nTherefore, both actions seem morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some nuances I'm missing.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe if it was just one sock and unlikely to cause bleeding, it might not be that bad. But still, it's not considerate.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps if I really needed the food for some unexpected reason, but no, the scenario says I make plenty of money, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nOverall, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
