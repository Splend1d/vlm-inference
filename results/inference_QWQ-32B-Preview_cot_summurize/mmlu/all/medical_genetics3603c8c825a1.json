                    "text": "Malignant hyperthermia, also known as malignant hyperpyrexia, is a genetic disorder that is triggered by certain anesthetic drugs, leading to a rapid increase in body temperature and muscle rigidity. The pattern of inheritance for this condition is autosomal dominant.\n\nIn autosomal dominant inheritance, a single copy of the mutated gene from one parent is sufficient to cause the disorder. This means that if one parent has the condition, there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit the mutated gene and develop the disorder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. autosomal dominant.\n\nOption B, autosomal recessive, would require both copies of the gene to be mutated for the disorder to manifest, which is not the case for malignant hyperthermia.\n\nOption C, X-linked dominant, refers to disorders caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome, where even a single copy of the mutated gene can cause the disorder. However, malignant hyperthermia is not linked to the X chromosome.\n\nOption D, X-linked recessive, applies to disorders where the mutated gene is on the X chromosome, and the disorder manifests only in individuals who have two copies of the mutated gene (in the case of females) or one copy (in the case of males). Again, this does not apply to malignant hyperthermia.\n\nIt's important to note that while the primary inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, there can be reduced penetrance, meaning that not all individuals who inherit the mutated gene will develop symptoms, especially under normal circumstances without exposure to triggering agents.\n\nFor medical professionals and anesthesiologists, recognizing the family history of malignant hyperthermia is crucial, as it can guide the choice of anesthesia and prevent life-threatening complications during surgery.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.
