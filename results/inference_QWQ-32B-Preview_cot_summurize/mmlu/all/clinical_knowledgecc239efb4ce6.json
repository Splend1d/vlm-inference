                    "text": "Let's see, I need to figure out which statement about the knee joint is correct. I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The knee is a ball and socket joint.\" Hmm, I think that's not right. I recall that the knee is more like a hinge joint, allowing for bending and straightening motions. Ball and socket joints, like the shoulder and hip, allow for a wider range of motion, including rotation. So, A doesn't seem correct.\n\nOption B: \"A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee.\" I think baker's cysts are usually found behind the knee, not in front. I remember that they are fluid-filled cysts that can develop when there's too much fluid in the joint, often due to arthritis or injury. So, anterior to the knee doesn't sound right; it should be posterior. Therefore, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion.\" Now, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think a patellar tap, also known as a bulge sign or patellar tap test, is a way to check for fluid accumulation in the knee joint, which is called an effusion. When there's extra fluid in the joint, it can cause the patella to move differently when tapped. So, this sounds plausible.\n\nOption D: \"'Knock knee' deformity is due to bilateral genu varum.\" Wait, knock knees are actually genu valgum, where the knees angle inward and touch each other when the legs are straightened. Genu varum is the opposite, where the knees angle outward, like in bowlegs. So, this statement seems backwards. It should say that knock knees are due to bilateral genu valgum. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems that option C is the correct statement about the knee joint. But I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nLet me verify each option again quickly.\n\nA: Knee is a hinge joint, not a ball and socket. Correct.\n\nB: Baker's cysts are posterior to the knee. Correct.\n\nC: Patellar tap tests for effusion. Seems right.\n\nD: Knock knees are genu valgum, not varum. Correct.\n\nAlright, I'm confident that C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
