                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a 10 kg box sliding horizontally without friction at an initial speed of 1 m/s. Then, a constant force is applied in the direction of its motion over a distance of 5 meters. After the force is removed, the box is moving at 2 m/s. We need to find the magnitude of that applied force.\n\nFirst, since there's no friction, the only force affecting the box's motion is the applied force. This force does work on the box, which changes its kinetic energy. So, I think we can use the work-energy theorem here.\n\nThe work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy:\n\n\\[ W = \\Delta K \\]\n\nThe work \\( W \\) done by the force is:\n\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\]\n\nSince the force is in the direction of motion, \\( \\theta = 0^\\circ \\), and \\( \\cos(0^\\circ) = 1 \\), so:\n\n\\[ W = F \\cdot d \\]\n\nThe change in kinetic energy \\( \\Delta K \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_f^2 - v_i^2) \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the box, \\( v_f \\) is the final velocity, and \\( v_i \\) is the initial velocity.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ m = 10 \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\n\\[ v_i = 1 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ v_f = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 5 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ W = F \\cdot 5 \\]\n\n\\[ \\Delta K = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10 \\cdot (2^2 - 1^2) = 5 \\cdot (4 - 1) = 5 \\cdot 3 = 15 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nSetting \\( W = \\Delta K \\):\n\n\\[ F \\cdot 5 = 15 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( F \\):\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{15}{5} = 3 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nSo, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 N.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem, like using Newton's second law and kinematic equations.\n\nUsing Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ F = m \\cdot a \\]\n\nWe can find the acceleration \\( a \\) if we know the change in velocity and the distance over which the force is applied.\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[ v_i = 1 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ v_f = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\n\\[ d = 5 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nWe can use the kinematic equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and distance:\n\n\\[ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a d \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ 2^2 = 1^2 + 2 a \\cdot 5 \\]\n\n\\[ 4 = 1 + 10 a \\]\n\n\\[ 3 = 10 a \\]\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\]\n\nNow, using Newton's second law:\n\n\\[ F = m \\cdot a = 10 \\cdot 0.3 = 3 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nAgain, we get \\( F = 3 \\, \\text{N} \\).\n\nAlright, both methods give the same answer, which is 3 N. So, the correct choice is C. 3 N.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor we might have missed. The problem mentions that the force is applied in the direction of motion, and then removed, leaving the box with a final speed of 2 m/s. Since there's no friction, once the force is removed, the box moves at constant velocity, which matches the given final speed.\n\nAlso, the mass is 10 kg, which is consistent in both methods. The distance is 5 meters, and the velocities are 1 m/s initial and 2 m/s final. Everything seems to be in order.\n\nI think 3 N is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3 \\, \\text{N}} \\]\n\n"
