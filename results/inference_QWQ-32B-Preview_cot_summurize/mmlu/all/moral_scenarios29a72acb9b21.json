                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one involves morally wrong behavior according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"I dried the fine china with the laundromat dryer.\"\n\nFirst, let's understand what's happening here. The main character is using a laundromat dryer, which is typically designed for drying clothes, to dry fine china, which is delicate ceramic dishware. This seems unusual because laundromat dryers are not intended for drying delicate items like fine china. \n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. **Damage to the china:** Fine china is fragile and could be easily broken or damaged in a laundromat dryer, which is not designed to handle such items.\n\n2. **Misuse of equipment:** Using a laundry dryer for non-laundry items might void warranties or cause damage to the machine.\n\n3. **Hygiene concerns:** Laundry dryers are used for drying clothes, which can carry bacteria and dirt. Drying fine china in such an environment might not be hygienic.\n\n4. **Social norms:** It might be considered odd or inappropriate to use laundry facilities for drying dishware.\n\nHowever, none of these issues seem to rise to the level of being clearly morally wrong. They are more matters of prudence, care, or adherence to social norms rather than moral wrongdoing.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I went to the sea to go fishing for dolphins.\"\n\nIn this scenario, the main character is going fishing specifically for dolphins.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n1. **Animal welfare:** Dolphins are intelligent mammals and are protected by various laws and ethical considerations. Hunting them for sport or food is generally considered unethical and often illegal.\n\n2. **Legal aspects:** In the US, hunting dolphins is illegal under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\n3. **Ethical considerations:** There is a broad consensus that harming or killing dolphins for recreational fishing is morally wrong due to their intelligence and the ecological role they play.\n\nGiven these points, fishing for dolphins is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C. Not wrong, Wrong**."
