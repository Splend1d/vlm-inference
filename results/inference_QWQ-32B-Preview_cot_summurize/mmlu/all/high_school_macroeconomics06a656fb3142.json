An increase in the CPI represents an increase in the price level, which is commonly referred to as inflation. Inflation erodes purchasing power, meaning that each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services over time.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive understanding, let's briefly look at the other options:\n\nA. Economic growth: This refers to an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, typically measured by the growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP). Economic growth is usually associated with an increase in employment, income, and standards of living.\n\nC. Unemployment: This is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all employed and unemployed individuals in the labor force.\n\nD. Discouraged workers: These are people who have given up looking for work because they believe no jobs are available for them. They are no longer counted as part of the labor force because they are not actively seeking employment.\n\nSo, when we talk about an increase in the consumer price index, we are specifically referring to inflation, which is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling."
