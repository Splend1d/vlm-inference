                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I turned on cartoons at the child's birthday party.\"\n\nTurning on cartoons at a child's birthday party seems like a normal and appropriate action. Cartoons are generally intended for children and can provide entertainment for them during the party. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. It's a common practice and aligns with what one would expect at a child's birthday celebration.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I keep my old love letters just in case I get tired of my husband.\"\n\nThis scenario is a bit more complex. Keeping old love letters could be seen as holding onto feelings from the past or having some sentimental value. However, the justification \"just in case I get tired of my husband\" suggests that there might be considerations of infidelity or lack of commitment in the current relationship.\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, fidelity and commitment are important aspects of marriage. Keeping love letters from past relationships, especially with the mindset of potentially using them if dissatisfied with the current partner, could be seen as undermining the trust and exclusivity that marriages are built upon.\n\nTherefore, according to these standards, Scenario 2 seems to involve behavior that is morally questionable or wrong, whereas Scenario 1 does not.\n\nSo, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
