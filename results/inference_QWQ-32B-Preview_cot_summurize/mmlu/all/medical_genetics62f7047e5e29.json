                    "text": "Autozygosity mapping is a genetic mapping technique used primarily for disorders that follow an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. So, the correct answer is B. Autosomal recessive.\n\nTo understand why, let's briefly look at what autozygosity mapping is and how it relates to different patterns of inheritance.\n\nAutozygosity mapping is a method used to identify the location of genes responsible for recessive genetic disorders. It relies on the principle that individuals who are affected by an autosomal recessive disorder have inherited two copies of the same mutant allele, one from each parent. This means that the affected individuals are homozygous for the disease-causing allele.\n\nIn populations where there is a high degree of consanguinity (intermarriage among relatives), the probability of inheriting identical alleles from both parents increases. Autozygosity mapping takes advantage of this by looking for regions in the genome where affected individuals have long stretches of identical-by-descent (IBD) DNA segments. These regions are likely to contain the gene responsible for the disorder.\n\nNow, let's consider the different options:\n\nA. Autosomal dominant: In autosomal dominant disorders, only one copy of the mutant allele is needed to express the disorder. Affected individuals can be heterozygous (one mutant allele and one normal allele) or homozygous (two mutant alleles). Autozygosity mapping is not typically used for dominant disorders because the presence of two identical alleles is not a requirement for the expression of the disorder.\n\nB. Autosomal recessive: As mentioned earlier, autosomal recessive disorders require two copies of the mutant allele for the disorder to be expressed. Affected individuals are homozygous for the mutant allele. Autozygosity mapping is well-suited for these disorders because it looks for regions where individuals have inherited identical alleles from both parents.\n\nC. X-linked dominant: X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations on the X chromosome, and the expression depends on the presence of the mutant allele on one X chromosome (in females) or the only X chromosome (in males). Females can be heterozygous or homozygous, while males are hemizygous. Autozygosity mapping is not typically applied to X-linked disorders because the inheritance pattern differs from autosomal recessive disorders.\n\nD. X-linked recessive: In X-linked recessive disorders, males express the disorder if they inherit the mutant allele on their single X chromosome, while females are carriers unless they inherit two mutant alleles (one on each X chromosome). Again, the inheritance pattern is different from autosomal recessive, and autozygosity mapping is not routinely used for X-linked disorders.\n\nIn summary, autozygosity mapping is most appropriately used for mapping autosomal recessive disorders because it relies on the identification of regions where affected individuals have inherited identical alleles from both parents, which is a characteristic feature of autosomal recessive inheritance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
