                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these options\u2014novation, accord and satisfaction, anticipatory repudiation, or impossibility of performance\u2014generally causes a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law. I need to understand each term and see how it relates to discharging contractual obligations.\n\nFirst, let's look at novation. Novation is when a new contract is created to replace an existing one, and the old contract is terminated as a result. So, in novation, the parties agree to substitute a new contract for the old one, effectively discharging the original contractual duties. That seems like it causes a discharge by operation of law, but I need to check the other options to see if any are more applicable.\n\nNext, accord and satisfaction is a legal concept where the parties to a contract agree to accept a different performance from what was originally agreed upon. Essentially, it's a mutual agreement to modify the contract, and once performed, it discharges the original duties. So, this also seems like it causes a discharge by operation of law.\n\nNow, anticipatory repudiation is when one party indicates that they will not perform their contractual obligations before the performance is due. This allows the other party to treat the contract as breached and seek remedies immediately, rather than waiting for the performance date. While this does affect the contract, it's more about allowing the non-breaching party to take action earlier rather than discharging the contract by operation of law.\n\nLastly, impossibility of performance refers to a situation where performance of the contract becomes impossible due to some event beyond the control of the parties. For example, if a key element necessary for performance is destroyed and cannot be replaced. In such cases, the contract may be discharged because performance is impossible, and this discharge occurs by operation of law.\n\nComparing all these, novation and accord and satisfaction both involve mutual agreements to modify or replace the contract, leading to the discharge of original duties. Anticipatory repudiation allows for early remedy but doesn't necessarily discharge the contract unless the non-breaching party chooses to do so. Impossibility of performance discharges the contract automatically due to external circumstances.\n\nThe question is asking for the circumstance that generally causes a discharge of contractual duties by operation of law. Between the options, impossibility of performance seems to fit best because it's a situation where the law steps in to discharge the contract due to circumstances beyond the parties' control, rather than by their agreement.\n\nHowever, accord and satisfaction also discharges the contract by operation of law once the new terms are satisfied. But in accord and satisfaction, the discharge is based on the parties' agreement to accept different performance, whereas in impossibility, it's due to external events making performance impossible.\n\nNovation involves creating a new contract that replaces the old one, and once the new contract is in place, the old one is discharged by operation of law.\n\nAnticipatory repudiation allows the non-breaching party to treat the contract as discharged, but it's more about allowing early remedy rather than discharging the contract by operation of law.\n\nConsidering all this, I think impossibility of performance is the most straightforward answer because it's a circumstance where the law automatically discharges the contract due to impossibility, without needing further action or agreement from the parties.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options are also discharged by operation of law.\n\nIn novation, the discharge of the original contract is by operation of law because the new contract replaces the old one, and the old one is legally discharged.\n\nIn accord and satisfaction, once the new terms are satisfied, the original contract is discharged by operation of law.\n\nAnticipatory repudiation allows the non-breaching party to treat the contract as discharged, but it's their choice to do so, not necessarily a discharge by operation of law.\n\nImpossibility of performance leads to automatic discharge by operation of law.\n\nSo, all of novation, accord and satisfaction, and impossibility of performance can cause a discharge by operation of law, but in different ways.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question is looking for the option that most purely represents a discharge by operation of law, without requiring mutual agreement.\n\nIn that case, impossibility of performance would be the best answer because it's discharged automatically by law due to external circumstances, not because the parties have agreed to something new.\n\nNovation and accord and satisfaction both require agreements between the parties to discharge the original contract, whereas impossibility leads to discharge regardless of the parties' wishes.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Impossibility of performance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
