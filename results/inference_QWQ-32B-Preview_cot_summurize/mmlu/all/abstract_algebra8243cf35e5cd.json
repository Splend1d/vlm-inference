The first one is about groups of order p squared, where p is a prime number, and it says that every such group is Abelian. The second statement is about Sylow p-subgroups and whether they're normal subgroups under certain conditions.\n\nLet me tackle the first statement. I know that a group is Abelian if its operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements a and b in the group, a * b equals b * b. Now, for a group of order p squared, where p is prime, I think there's a theorem that says something about its structure.\n\nI recall that for a group of order p^2, it's either cyclic, which would make it Abelian, or it's isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order p, which is also Abelian. Wait, but is that always the case?\n\nLet me think about this. If the group is cyclic, then it's generated by a single element, and hence Abelian. If it's not cyclic, then by the classification of finite Abelian groups, it would be isomorphic to Z/pZ \u00d7 Z/pZ, which is still Abelian. But is there a non-Abelian group of order p^2?\n\nHmm, I can't think of any non-Abelian groups of order p^2. For example, take p=2, so order 4. The groups of order 4 are Z/4Z, which is Abelian, and the Klein four-group, which is also Abelian. Wait, but I thought there was a non-Abelian group of order 4, but I guess not.\n\nWait, actually, the Klein four-group is Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, which is Abelian. So both groups of order 4 are Abelian. Similarly, for p=3, order 9, there are two groups: Z/9Z and Z/3Z \u00d7 Z/3Z, both Abelian. So maybe in general, groups of order p^2 are always Abelian.\n\nI think there's a theorem that states that any group of order p^2 is Abelian. I believe this is true because the center of a p-group is non-trivial, and for order p^2, if the center has order p, then the quotient group would have order p, which is cyclic, making the whole group Abelian. If the center has order p^2, then the group is Abelian anyway. So yeah, I think statement 1 is true.\n\nNow, moving on to statement 2. It says: For a fixed prime p, a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G is a normal subgroup of G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup of G.\n\nOkay, let's recall what a Sylow p-subgroup is. Given a finite group G and a prime p dividing the order of G, a Sylow p-subgroup is a maximal p-subgroup of G, meaning it's a subgroup of G whose order is the highest power of p dividing the order of G.\n\nI know that Sylow's Theorems tell us about the existence and conjugacy of Sylow p-subgroups. Specifically, Sylow's Third Theorem says that the number of Sylow p-subgroups, denoted by n_p, satisfies:\n\n1. n_p divides the index [G : P], where P is a Sylow p-subgroup.\n\n2. n_p is congruent to 1 modulo p.\n\nNow, the statement says that a Sylow p-subgroup is normal in G if and only if it is the only Sylow p-subgroup.\n\nWell, I know that normal subgroups are those that are fixed under conjugation by any element of G. Also, Sylow's Theorems tell us that all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other.\n\nSo, if there is only one Sylow p-subgroup, then it must be normal because conjugating it by any element of G would just give itself back. That makes sense.\n\nConversely, if a Sylow p-subgroup is normal, then it's the only Sylow p-subgroup because any other Sylow p-subgroup would have to be conjugate to it, but since it's normal, conjugation doesn't change it, so there can't be any others.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to be correct. So, statement 2 is also true.\n\nWait a minute, but is there any exception to this? Let me think. Suppose G is a p-group itself, meaning that the order of G is a power of p. In that case, G itself is a Sylow p-subgroup, and it's normal because it's the whole group. Also, there's only one Sylow p-subgroup, which is G. So, the statement holds.\n\nIn general, for any group G and a prime p dividing its order, the Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate, and the number of them is n_p, which is 1 if and only if the Sylow p-subgroup is normal.\n\nSo, yes, statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
