It's asking for the term that describes an organization which can adapt to changes in its environment by quickly responding to shifts in supply and demand. The options are:\n\nA. Opportunistic organization\n\nB. Enterprising organization\n\nC. International organization\n\nD. Agile organization\n\nHmm, let's think about this. First, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nAn opportunistic organization sounds like one that takes advantage of opportunities as they arise. That seems related to adapting to changes, but I'm not sure if it specifically refers to responding to supply and demand shifts.\n\nAn enterprising organization probably refers to a company that is entrepreneurial or proactive in pursuing business opportunities. Again, this seems related to adaptation, but maybe not specifically to the context of supply and demand.\n\nAn international organization is one that operates across multiple countries. While such organizations might have to adapt to different environments, the term itself doesn't specifically denote agility in responding to supply and demand changes.\n\nAn agile organization, on the other hand, is one that is flexible and able to adapt quickly to changes. Agile is a term often used in business and management to describe organizations that can respond swiftly to market trends and customer needs.\n\nGiven that, I think \"agile organization\" is the most appropriate term for describing an organization that adapts to environmental changes by quickly responding to shifts in supply and demand.\n\nBut let me double-check. What does \"agile\" really mean in this context? Agile methodologies are popular in software development for their flexibility and ability to respond to changing requirements. In a broader business context, agility refers to an organization's capacity to adapt quickly to market changes, which aligns perfectly with the description in the question.\n\nOpportunistic organization might seem similar, but it has a slightly different connotation. It suggests taking advantage of opportunities, which may not necessarily involve responding to supply and demand shifts in a flexible manner.\n\nEnterprising organization sounds more like a company that is proactive in starting new ventures or initiatives, but again, it doesn't specifically imply the flexibility to adapt to supply and demand changes.\n\nInternational organization is clearly unrelated to the adaptability described in the question.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Agile organization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
