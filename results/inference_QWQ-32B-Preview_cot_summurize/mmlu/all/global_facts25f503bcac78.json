                    "text": "I'm trying to recall the statistics on obesity among adults in 2016. I remember that obesity has been a growing concern worldwide, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage for that year. Let's see, the options are 6%, 13%, 27%, and 46%. 6% seems too low; obesity was definitely more prevalent than that. 46% seems too high; that would mean almost half of all adults were obese, which I don't think was the case back then. So, it's probably between 13% and 27%. I think the correct answer is C. 27%. But I should verify this to be sure.\n\nLet me think about this differently. I know that the World Health Organization (WHO) tracks obesity rates globally. According to WHO, in 2016, around 13% of the world's adult population was obese. Wait, that would be option B. But earlier I thought 13% was too low. Maybe I need to consider regional differences. Perhaps in some countries, the obesity rate was higher.\n\nFor instance, in the United States, obesity rates have been much higher than the global average. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that about 38% of U.S. adults were obese. That's higher than any of the options provided. So, if the question is about global percentages, 13% might be more accurate, but if it's about a specific country like the U.S., it could be higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to a different definition of obesity. Obesity is typically defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher. But there are different BMI thresholds in some countries. However, the standard definition uses BMI of 30 and above for obesity.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question is about severe obesity, which is a BMI of 40 or higher. But that would still not match the percentages given. In 2016, the prevalence of severe obesity was around 5-6% in the U.S., which is option A. But again, that seems too low for general obesity.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the source of this question. If it's from a general knowledge test, it might be expecting the global average, which is around 13%. But if it's from a health statistics course, it might be more specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misremembered, and the years are different. Obesity rates have been increasing over the years, so in more recent years, the percentages might be higher.\n\nWait a minute, the question specifies \"as of 2016,\" so I need to focus on that year. Let's try to recall specific studies or reports from 2016.\n\nI recall that in 2016, the World Obesity Federation published a report estimating that over 600 million adults worldwide were obese. Given the world population at that time, that would translate to around 13% of adults being obese. So, option B seems correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought 13% was too low. Maybe I was thinking of the percentage of the population classified as overweight, not obese. Overweight is a BMI of 25 to 29.9, while obesity is 30 and above. Perhaps the combined percentage of overweight and obese individuals is higher, but the question specifically asks about obesity.\n\nLet me check the body mass index categories:\n\n- Underweight: BMI <18.5\n\n- Normal weight: BMI 18.5-24.9\n\n- Overweight: BMI 25-29.9\n\n- Obese: BMI 30 and above\n\nSo, obesity is defined as BMI 30 and above.\n\nNow, considering global statistics, in 2016, the prevalence of obesity was indeed around 13% worldwide. However, in some countries, particularly in North America and the Middle East, obesity rates were much higher.\n\nFor example, in the United States, as I mentioned earlier, the obesity rate was around 38% in 2016. In some Gulf countries, obesity rates exceeded 40%. So, depending on the region, the percentage can vary significantly.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify a particular country or region, it's likely referring to the global average. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 13%.\n\nHowever, I'm still a bit unsure because I feel like obesity rates are higher than that. Maybe I'm confusing the percentage with another statistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of adults who were overweight or obese combined. In that case, the percentage would be higher. For example, globally, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was around 39% in 2016.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions \"obese,\" not \"overweight or obese.\" So, sticking to the definition, it should be around 13%.\n\nAnother point to consider is that obesity rates are often reported differently for men and women, and they vary by age group as well. But again, since the question is about adults aged 18 years or older, without specifying gender or age subgroup, the global average of 13% seems appropriate.\n\nPerhaps to confirm, I can look up the World Health Organization's data from 2016. According to WHO, in 2016, 13% of the world's adult population was obese. So, option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, I also recall that the obesity rate has been increasing rapidly, and 13% might be an underestimate. However, based on the official WHO statistics, 13% is the figure for global obesity in adults in 2016.\n\nIt's possible that some sources may have different percentages, depending on how obesity is defined and measured. For instance, some studies might use different BMI cutoffs or include different age groups.\n\nAdditionally, measurement methods can vary between countries, which could affect the overall estimates. But assuming that the question is referring to the standard BMI definition and global averages, 13% is the most accurate answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B. 13%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
