                    "text": "At common law, when a lease expires and the tenant continues to occupy the premises with the landlord's consent, the tenancy becomes a periodic tenancy, typically month-to-month, based on the frequency of rent payments. In this scenario, the artist continued to pay $800 monthly rent after the initial three-year lease expired, and the retiree continued to accept these payments. This suggests that a month-to-month tenancy was created by their ongoing conduct.\n\nGiven that the original lease term has expired and a new periodic tenancy has been established through the parties' actions, the retiree's remedies would be governed by the laws pertaining to periodic tenancies rather than the original lease terms.\n\nOption A suggests eviction for non-payment of rent. However, the scenario states that the artist continued to pay rent, and the retiree accepted it. Therefore, there is no basis for eviction due to non-payment.\n\nOption B proposes recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year. This might relate to a claim for increased rent based on market conditions, but it doesn't directly address the situation where the lease has expired and a periodic tenancy has been established.\n\nOption C mentions recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three-year period. This seems to suggest some form of penalty for holding over beyond the lease term, but at common law, holding over with the landlord's consent typically converts the tenancy to a periodic tenancy without imposing double rent.\n\nOption D requires the artist to move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent. This seems overly punitive and not aligned with common law principles governing the expiration of leases and the creation of periodic tenancies.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the most appropriate remedy for the retiree before accepting the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period would have been to clarify the terms of the continued tenancy. If the retiree wished to terminate the tenancy, they could have provided appropriate notice as required by law for terminating a periodic tenancy. Alternatively, if the retiree accepted the rent without objection, this would imply acceptance of the continued tenancy on similar terms.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the remedy available before accepting the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period, the retiree could have chosen to treat the lease as expired and demand that the artist vacate the premises. If the artist refused to vacate, the retiree could initiate eviction proceedings for holding over beyond the lease term.\n\nBut among the given options, none directly reflects this scenario. Option A is closest, but it mentions non-payment of rent, which is not the issue here. The artist was paying rent, so non-payment is not the basis for eviction.\n\nGiven the options provided, none perfectly fits the precise remedy available in this situation. However, if I must choose the best answer, it would be Option B: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year. This could be interpreted as the retiree seeking additional rent based on the current market rates, assuming that the market rates have increased since the original lease was signed.\n\nBut it's essential to note that at common law, simply because a lease has expired and a periodic tenancy is created, the landlord does not automatically have the right to increase the rent unless there is a clause in the original lease or local law permitting such increases. The rent for the periodic tenancy would typically continue at the same rate unless otherwise agreed.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer, although not perfectly matching any option, would involve treating the tenancy as month-to-month at the existing rent rate, allowing either party to terminate the tenancy upon providing the required notice period as specified by law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
