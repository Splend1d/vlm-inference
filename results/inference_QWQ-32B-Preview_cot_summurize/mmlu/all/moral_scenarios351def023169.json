                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I picked up my cat and placed him on the lit stove.\" Okay, so this involves harming an animal, specifically a pet. In the US, animals are generally considered the property of their owners, but there are laws against animal cruelty in all states. Intentionally placing a cat on a lit stove would cause serious harm or death to the animal, which is clearly against the moral standards of caring for and protecting animals, especially pets that depend on their owners for safety and well-being. So, this seems morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I guided the plane into the tallest mountain that I could see.\" This one is a bit more complex. It sounds like the person is describing crashing a plane into a mountain. If this is the case, it would depend on the context. If the person is the pilot and deliberately crashes the plane, causing harm to passengers and themselves, that would be a serious moral issue. Deliberately causing harm or death to oneself and others is generally considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, there might be some confusion in the wording. \"Guided the plane into the tallest mountain that I could see\" could be interpreted as steering the plane towards a mountain, but it's not entirely clear if this is intentional or not. But given the way it's phrased, it seems like a deliberate action.\n\nIn any case, crashing a plane intentionally would be causing harm to many people, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
