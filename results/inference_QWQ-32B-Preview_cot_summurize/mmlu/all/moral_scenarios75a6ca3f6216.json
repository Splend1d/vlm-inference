Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I decided to pee in a bush where no one could see me.\"\n\nHmm, peeing in a bush when no one is around. Well, morally, this seems like a private act that doesn't really harm anyone. It's not like I'm urinating in someone's yard or in a public place where it's disgusting or unsanitary. It's just in a bush, and I'm making sure no one sees me, so it's not like I'm being disrespectful or anything. I think this is more of a personal hygiene issue rather than a moral one. So, I wouldn't say this is morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I complimented Kelly's transition.\"\n\nOkay, complimenting someone's transition. Now, assuming that Kelly has undergone a gender transition, and I'm complimenting them on it. Well, complimenting someone is generally a positive thing. It shows appreciation and support. In the context of someone's transition, which can be a sensitive and personal journey, a compliment could be seen as supportive and encouraging. I don't see anything morally wrong with complimenting someone's transition. In fact, it might be considered a kind and empathetic act.\n\nSo, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, neither scenario seems to involve something clearly morally wrong. So, I think the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. For Scenario 1, could there be any moral implications I haven't considered? Maybe in some cultures, peeing in certain areas is considered disrespectful to nature or something like that. However, in ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I don't think it's widely considered a moral issue unless it's in a protected area or causes some kind of damage.\n\nFor Scenario 2, complimenting someone's transition, I can't see any moral wrongdoing. It's a positive action towards someone else.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
