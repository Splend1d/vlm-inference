The options are:\n\nA. facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks\n\nB. facilitate the performance of easy tasks\n\nC. hinder the performance of all tasks\n\nD. hinder the performance of easy tasks\n\nI think this has something to do with social psychology, maybe about how people perform differently when they're being watched or when they're with others.\n\nI recall there's a theory called Social Facilitation, which suggests that people perform better on tasks in the presence of others. But I'm not sure if that applies to all tasks or just certain types.\n\nLet me think about option A: facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks. That seems plausible because sometimes having others around can motivate you to do better on challenging tasks. But I'm not sure if that's always the case.\n\nOption B says facilitate the performance of easy tasks. That also makes sense because when tasks are easy, people might feel more confident with others around, and thus perform better.\n\nOption C says hinder the performance of all tasks. That seems too broad. While sometimes having others around can be distracting or stressful, it's unlikely that it always hinders performance across the board.\n\nOption D says hinder the performance of easy tasks. That's interesting. Maybe when tasks are easy, people rely more on automatic processes, and the presence of others can disrupt that.\n\nWait, I think Social Facilitation theory suggests that people perform better on well-learned tasks in the presence of others, but poorer on complex or new tasks. That would contradict option A.\n\nLet me look up Social Facilitation quickly.\n\nAccording to my notes, Social Facilitation refers to the phenomenon where people perform better on simple or well-practiced tasks in the presence of others, but worse on complex or new tasks.\n\nThat means for easy tasks, performance is facilitated, but for difficult or novel tasks, performance is hindered.\n\nSo, option B seems correct: facilitate the performance of easy tasks.\n\nBut option A says facilitate novel and difficult tasks, which according to Social Facilitation, might actually be hindered by the presence of others.\n\nOption C says hinder the performance of all tasks, which isn't accurate because Social Facilitation shows improvement on easy tasks.\n\nOption D says hinder the performance of easy tasks, which again contradicts Social Facilitation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: facilitate the performance of easy tasks.\n\nBut wait, I remember there's also something called the Distraction Conflict Theory, which might explain why performance varies based on the task difficulty and the presence of others.\n\nAccording to Distraction Conflict Theory, in the presence of others, there's an evaluation appraised by the actor, leading to arousal and potential interference with task performance, especially if the task requires cognitive resources.\n\nSo, for easy tasks, the arousal might help, but for difficult tasks, it might hinder performance.\n\nThat aligns with Social Facilitation.\n\nAnother theory is the Evaluation Apprehension theory, which suggests that people are concerned about being evaluated by others, which can affect performance.\n\nAgain, this might lead to better performance on easy tasks and worse on difficult ones.\n\nBut maybe there are exceptions or other factors at play.\n\nFor example, if someone is very confident in their ability to perform a difficult task, the presence of others might motivate them to do better.\n\nAlternatively, if they're not confident, the same situation might cause anxiety and poor performance.\n\nSo, it might also depend on the individual's self-efficacy.\n\nBut based on general social psychology principles, it seems that the presence of others facilitates easy tasks and hinders difficult ones.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: facilitate the performance of easy tasks.\n\nBut let's consider option A again: facilitate the performance of novel and difficult tasks.\n\nIs there any scenario where the presence of others would help with novel and difficult tasks?\n\nMaybe if the individual perceives the audience as supportive and encouraging, it could boost their confidence and help them perform better on difficult tasks.\n\nOr if the task is seen as a challenge that they want to rise to in front of others.\n\nBut according to the main theories, it's more likely that difficult tasks would be hindered by the presence of others.\n\nSo, I think sticking with option B is the safest choice.\n\nOption C is too extreme, as it says hinder all tasks, which isn't supported by the theories.\n\nOption D says hinder easy tasks, which again contradicts Social Facilitation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B: facilitate the performance of easy tasks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
