                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out why breast milk is good for babies, and choose the best explanation from these options.\n\nOption A says that breast milk has vitamins that fix mutations in sperm or egg. Hmm, I don't think that's right. Mutations in sperm or egg are genetic changes that happen before the baby is even conceived. Vitamins in breast milk are important for the baby's growth and development, but I don't think they can repair genetic mutations from parents. So, maybe A isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B says that breast milk contains maternal antibodies that protect against gastrointestinal pathogens. That sounds familiar. I know that mothers pass on their antibodies to their babies through breast milk, which helps protect babies from infections, especially in their digestive system. So, this seems like a good choice.\n\nOption C says that breast milk contains maternal vaccines that destroy common childhood pathogens. Wait, vaccines are substances that help stimulate the immune system to fight specific diseases. Breast milk does contain antibodies, which can help fight pathogens, but I don't think it contains actual vaccines. Vaccines are usually given separately. So, maybe C is not accurate.\n\nOption D says that breast milk contains red blood cells with adult hemoglobin that are beneficial to the infant's developing brain. That sounds wrong because breast milk doesn't contain red blood cells. Blood and milk are separate, and babies get their blood supply independently. Also, babies have their own hemoglobin suited for their needs. So, D doesn't seem right.\n\nComparing all these options, B seems to be the most accurate. Breast milk does contain maternal antibodies that help protect babies from gastrointestinal infections, which are common in infants.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
