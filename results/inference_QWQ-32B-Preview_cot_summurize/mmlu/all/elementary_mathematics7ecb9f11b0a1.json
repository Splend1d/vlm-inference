Let me do that:\n\n152 - 96 = 56\n\nSo, he has 56 roses left after the sale.\n\nNow, he wants to put these 56 roses into 8 vases equally. To find out how many roses go into each vase, I need to divide 56 by 8.\n\n56 \u00f7 8 = 7\n\nTherefore, each vase will have 7 roses.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 7\n\nB. 12\n\nC. 48\n\nD. 56\n\nThe correct answer is A. 7.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, 152 - 96:\n\n152 - 90 = 62\n\n62 - 6 = 56\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 56 \u00f7 8:\n\n8 times 7 is 56.\n\nSo, indeed, each vase gets 7 roses.\n\nI think that's right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nMr. Kohlberg starts with 152 roses and sells 96 of them. To find out how many roses are left, we subtract the number sold from the initial amount:\n\n\\[ 152 - 96 = 56 \\]\n\nNext, he wants to distribute these remaining 56 roses equally among 8 vases. To find out how many roses each vase will contain, we divide the remaining roses by the number of vases:\n\n\\[ 56 \\div 8 = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, each vase will contain 7 roses."
