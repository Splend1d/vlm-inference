So, he hiked 6 miles per day for 2 days. That would be 6 miles/day times 2 days, which is 12 miles in total. That seems like multiplication.\n\nOption B: Rocco had six baseballs and gave away two of them. This sounds like subtraction: 6 minus 2, which is 4. Not multiplication.\n\nOption C: Rocco had a total of six tennis balls in two cans. This could mean there are six tennis balls divided into two cans, maybe three per can. That might be division: 6 divided by 2 equals 3. Not multiplication.\n\nOption D: Rocco biked six miles and then continued for two more miles. This sounds like addition: 6 plus 2 equals 8 miles. Not multiplication.\n\nSo, only option A involves multiplication, where you multiply the number of miles hiked each day by the number of days to find the total miles hiked.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
