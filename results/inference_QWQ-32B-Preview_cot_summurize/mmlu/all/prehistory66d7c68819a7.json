This combination is often referred to as the \"Three Sisters\" because they were planted together and supported each other's growth. Maize provided structure for the beans to climb, beans fixed nitrogen in the soil, and squash spread along the ground, preventing weeds and retaining moisture.\n\nThis trio offered a balanced diet rich in proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins, which was essential for the health and sustenance of these civilizations. The other options include crops that were not as integral to the New World subsistence base or were introduced later from other parts of the world."
