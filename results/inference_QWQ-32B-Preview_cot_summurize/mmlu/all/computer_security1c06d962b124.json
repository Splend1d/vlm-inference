                    "text": "Let's dive into this question based on the paper about SSL and HTTPS. I need to identify which statements are false among the options provided. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\n**Statement A: Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.**\n\nFirst, I need to recall what DV and EV certificates are. DV stands for Domain Validation, and EV stands for Extended Validation. DV certificates confirm that the applicant controls the domain, while EV certificates involve a more thorough verification process, including checking the legal identity of the organization.\n\nGiven that EV certificates have a more rigorous validation process, they should provide higher confidence that the user is connecting to the intended party. So, statement A seems false because it suggests that DV certificates provide more confidence than EV certificates, which contradicts their nature.\n\n**Statement B: OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn\u2019t been revoked.**\n\nOCSP stands for Online Certificate Status Protocol. OCSP stapling is a method where the server retrieves the certificate's revocation status from the Certificate Authority (CA) and \"staples\" that information to the certificate when handing it to the browser. This way, the browser can verify that the certificate has not been revoked without having to contact the CA directly.\n\nSo, yes, OCSP stapling does allow the server to prove to the browser that its certificate hasn\u2019t been revoked. Therefore, statement B seems to be true.\n\n**Statement C: DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack.**\n\nDANE stands for DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities. It's a method that allows domain owners to associate their certificates with their domain names using DNS records, specifically TLSA records. This can help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by allowing clients to verify that they are connecting to the correct server.\n\nHowever, SSL stripping attacks involve downgrading the connection from HTTPS to HTTP, making it easier for an attacker to intercept and modify data. DANE primarily focuses on associating certificates with domains and verifying their authenticity, but it doesn't directly prevent SSL stripping attacks, which are more about protocol downgrades.\n\nTherefore, statement C might be false because DANE doesn't inherently make it difficult for an adversary to launch SSL stripping attacks. To mitigate SSL stripping, other measures like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) are more directly effective.\n\n**Statement D: Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site.**\n\nKey pinning is a security mechanism where a browser remembers (or \"pins\") the expected cryptographic identity of a website. This can be done using public key pins (HPKP) or certificate transparency.\n\nBy pinning the server's public key, the browser can detect if a different certificate is presented, which might indicate a man-in-the-middle attack. However, key pinning doesn't prevent an adversary from convincing a CA to issue a fraudulent certificate; it makes it harder for the adversary to use that certificate successfully because the browser will detect the mismatch.\n\nSo, in a way, key pinning does make it harder for an adversary to launch an MITM attack even if they manage to get a certificate from a CA. Therefore, statement D seems to be true.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Statement A: False\n\n- Statement B: True\n\n- Statement C: False\n\n- Statement D: True\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A and C}} \\]"
