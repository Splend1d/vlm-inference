                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on the details of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), but I remember that it's a symmetric-key algorithm that was widely used in the past. DES operates on blocks of data, and it uses a 56-bit key, but I think the way the key is used is a bit more complex than that.\n\nI recall that in DES, the key is changed slightly for each of the 16 rounds of the algorithm. This process is called key scheduling, where the initial key is manipulated to produce a different subkey for each round. This is done to enhance the security of the algorithm by making each round unique.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the subkey length at each round of DES. I know that the initial key is 56 bits, but I think the subkeys are shorter than that. Let me think about this.\n\nIn DES, the 56-bit key is divided and manipulated to create subkeys for each round. I think that for each round, a 48-bit subkey is used. Yes, that sounds familiar. So, perhaps the answer is C. 48.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that the 56-bit key is split into two 28-bit halves, and in each round, each half is rotated left by one or two bits, depending on the round. Then, the two halves are combined and passed through a permutation table that selects 48 bits, which become the round's subkey.\n\nSo, indeed, each subkey is 48 bits long. That makes sense because the round function in DES involves expanding the 32-bit right half of the data to 48 bits, then XORing it with the 48-bit subkey, passing it through an S-box substitution, and finally permuting the result.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 48.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure. Maybe I'm misremembering. Let me consider the options again:\n\nA. 32 - That's the size of each half of the data block in DES, but not the subkey size.\n\nB. 56 - That's the initial key size, but as I recall, the subkeys are derived from this and are shorter.\n\nC. 48 - That seems correct based on my memory of the key scheduling process.\n\nD. 64 - That's the block size of DES, but not the subkey size.\n\nYes, I'm confident that C. 48 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
