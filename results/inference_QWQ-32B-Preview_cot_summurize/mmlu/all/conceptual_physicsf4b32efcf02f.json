Harmonics are integer multiples of this fundamental frequency. Specifically, the second harmonic is twice the frequency of the fundamental tone.\n\nLet's denote the fundamental frequency as \\( f \\). Therefore, the second harmonic would be \\( 2f \\), the third harmonic would be \\( 3f \\), and so on.\n\nGiven this relationship, if the fundamental frequency is \\( f \\), then the second harmonic is \\( 2f \\), which is twice as much as the fundamental frequency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. twice as much\n"
