After missing her period for three months and experiencing other symptoms of pregnancy, the wife consulted the physician. Without administering a pregnancy test, the physician examined the wife and concluded that she had the flu. He prescribed tetracycline, an antibiotic drug, which the wife took for two weeks. After discontinuing the tetracycline, the wife continued to experience nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms of pregnancy. She then consulted a different doctor, who administered a pregnancy test, which revealed that the wife was, in fact, four months pregnant. Thereafter, she gave birth to a child. When the child developed teeth, they were black and discolored. At the age of 12, the child learned that the black discoloration of his teeth resulted from the tetracycline that the wife took during her pregnancy.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a husband and wife who've been trying to have a child, but the wife was told by her family physician that she's infertile and can't get pregnant. But then, she misses her period for three months and has other pregnancy symptoms. She goes back to the doctor, who doesn't give her a pregnancy test and instead says she has the flu and prescribes tetracycline, an antibiotic.\n\nShe takes the medicine for two weeks, stops, but still has pregnancy symptoms. Then she sees another doctor who does a pregnancy test and confirms she's four months pregnant. She gives birth, and the child has black, discolored teeth, which are linked to the tetracycline the mother took during pregnancy.\n\nNow, the child, at age 12, learns about this and someone is considering filing a lawsuit on his behalf against the first physician for malpractice. The question is, if such a claim is brought, who is judgment likely to be for?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The physician, because an unborn child doesn't have legal rights stemming from conduct that happened before birth.\n\nB. The physician, because no duty of care is owed to an unborn child not in existence at the time medical treatment is rendered.\n\nC. The child, because a child, if born alive, can sue for consequences of prenatal injuries.\n\nD. The child, because the wife was negligent in failing to seek proper prenatal care.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about legal principles here, specifically regarding medical malpractice, duties of care, and the rights of unborn children.\n\nFirst, medical malpractice generally involves a doctor failing to meet the standard of care expected of a medical professional, and that failure causes harm to the patient.\n\nIn this case, the patient at the time was the wife, and the doctor didn't administer a pregnancy test and prescribed tetracycline, which turned out to cause dental problems in the child.\n\nBut the child is now bringing the lawsuit, not the wife. So, the question is whether the child has standing to sue for injuries that occurred before birth due to the doctor's actions.\n\nOption A says the physician wins because an unborn child doesn't have legal rights from conduct before birth. Option B is similar, saying no duty of care is owed to an unborn child not in existence at the time of treatment.\n\nOption C is that the child can sue because, if born alive, they can maintain an action for prenatal injuries. Option D blames the child because the wife was negligent in seeking prenatal care.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal status of an unborn child in terms of liability and rights.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, unborn children are not considered legal persons with rights until they're born alive. This means that injuries to a fetus may not give rise to a cause of action until the child is born.\n\nHowever, there is a concept called \"wrongful life\" or \"wrongful birth,\" but that's usually in cases where a doctor fails to diagnose a condition that leads to the birth of a child with disabilities, and parents sue for the costs associated with raising that child.\n\nIn this scenario, it's different because the child is suing for their own injuries, not the parents suing for additional costs.\n\nOption C seems promising because it suggests that if the child is born alive, they can sue for prenatal injuries. So, perhaps the child does have the right to sue for the damages caused by the doctor's negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, options A and B suggest that the physician wins because there was no duty owed to the unborn child.\n\nBut here's the thing: the duty of care in medical malpractice is usually owed to the patient, which in this case was the wife. So, the doctor owed a duty to the wife, not directly to the unborn child.\n\nHowever, if the doctor's negligence in treating the wife caused harm to the unborn child, who later born alive, perhaps that child can sue for those injuries.\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, a child can sue for prenatal injuries if they were born alive, because once born, they are legal persons and can seek redress for harms that occurred before birth.\n\nMoreover, tetracycline is known to cause dental problems and other issues in fetuses, so prescribing it to a pregnant woman is a clear breach of the standard of care, especially if the doctor should have known or suspected the pregnancy.\n\nIn this case, the doctor didn't perform a pregnancy test despite symptoms, which might be seen as negligence.\n\nSo, if the doctor was negligent in not diagnosing the pregnancy and prescribing a harmful drug, and that negligence caused harm to the unborn child, who was later born alive, it seems plausible that the child could have a cause of action.\n\nTherefore, option C seems correct: the child can maintain an action for the consequences of prenatal injuries, provided they were born alive.\n\nOption D is interesting because it suggests that the child loses because the wife was negligent in seeking proper prenatal care. But in this scenario, the wife did seek medical care; she went to the doctor when she had symptoms, but the doctor failed to diagnose her pregnancy and prescribed a harmful drug.\n\nSo, it doesn't seem fair to blame the child for the wife's alleged negligence, especially since the wife was following medical advice.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, the doctrine of vicarious liability might apply, where the doctor's negligence is imputed to the medical practice or hospital, but that's beside the point here.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the principles of medical malpractice and the rights of born children to sue for prenatal injuries, judgment is likely to be for the child, as per option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
