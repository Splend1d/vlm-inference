So, the correct answer is C. 14.\n\nTo explain this in more detail, let's understand the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is divided into several phases: the menstrual phase, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase.\n\n1. **Menstrual Phase**: This is the first day of your period and is considered day 1 of the cycle. It typically lasts for about 3-7 days.\n\n2. **Follicular Phase**: This phase starts on day 1 and continues until ovulation. During this time, the body prepares for ovulation by thickening the uterine lining and maturing an egg in the ovaries. The follicular phase can vary in length, but in a 28-day cycle, it usually ends around day 14.\n\n3. **Ovulation**: This is when a mature egg is released from the ovary. It's the midpoint of the cycle and is most likely to occur around day 14 in a 28-day cycle. However, it's essential to note that ovulation can occur earlier or later, depending on the individual's cycle length and regularity.\n\n4. **Luteal Phase**: This phase begins after ovulation and lasts until the start of the next menstrual period. It typically lasts about 14 days and is relatively consistent across different cycle lengths.\n\nSo, in summary, in a standard 28-day cycle, ovulation generally happens around day 14. However, it's crucial to remember that every woman's cycle can vary, and factors like stress, health conditions, and lifestyle can affect ovulation timing.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
