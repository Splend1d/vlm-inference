So, Nat has a fear of enclosed spaces, and the therapist tells him to relax, close his eyes, and breathe slowly when he starts feeling afraid. I need to match this approach to one of the options: person-centered therapy, psychoanalysis, rational-emotive therapy, or systematic desensitization.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these therapies is about.\n\nPerson-centered therapy, I think, is where the therapist creates a supportive environment and helps the client to explore their own feelings and self-actualize. It's more about the relationship and empathy.\n\nPsychoanalysis is Freud's approach, focusing on unconscious thoughts and past experiences, often through techniques like free association and dream analysis.\n\nRational-emotive therapy, also known as RET, is about identifying and challenging irrational beliefs to change negative emotions and behaviors.\n\nSystematic desensitization is a type of behavior therapy used to help people overcome phobias and anxieties. It involves gradually exposing the person to the feared object or situation while teaching them relaxation techniques to manage their anxiety.\n\nNow, looking back at what the therapist is doing with Nat. The therapist is telling Nat to relax, close his eyes, and breathe slowly when he starts to feel fear in enclosed spaces. This sounds like the therapist is teaching Nat relaxation techniques to manage his anxiety in stressful situations.\n\nSystematic desensitization seems to fit here because it involves teaching relaxation techniques and then gradually exposing the person to the fear-inducing stimulus while maintaining relaxation. The other options don't directly involve teaching relaxation techniques for anxiety management in the way described.\n\nPerson-centered therapy is more about providing a supportive environment for self-exploration, not specifically teaching relaxation techniques for phobias.\n\nPsychoanalysis would probably delve into Nat's past experiences to find the root of his fear, using techniques like free association, not directly teaching relaxation.\n\nRational-emotive therapy would focus on identifying and changing irrational beliefs that lead to the fear, rather than teaching relaxation techniques.\n\nTherefore, the technique being used here is most likely systematic desensitization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
