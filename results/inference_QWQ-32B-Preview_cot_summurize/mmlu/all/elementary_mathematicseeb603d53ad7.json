                    "text": "Let's tackle this seating arrangement problem step by step. We have 7 desks in a row, and we need to figure out the positions of Hector, Kim, and Tonya based on the given relationships.\n\nFirst, let's understand the relationships:\n\n1. Hector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim.\n\n2. Tonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nAnd finally, we need to find out how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits.\n\nLet's assign positions to each desk for clarity. Let's number the desks from 1 to 7, from left to right.\n\nSo, desk 1 is the far left, and desk 7 is the far right.\n\nNow, let's denote Kim's position as K, Hector's as H, and Tonya's as T.\n\nFrom the first relationship:\n\nHector sits 2 seats to the right of Kim.\n\nSo, if Kim is at position K, then Hector is at position K + 2.\n\nFrom the second relationship:\n\nTonya sits 3 seats to the right of Hector.\n\nSo, if Hector is at position H, then Tonya is at position H + 3.\n\nBut since H = K + 2, then T = (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5.\n\nSo, Tonya is 5 seats to the right of Kim.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits.\n\nSince Tonya is 5 seats to the right of Kim, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward. But let's make sure we're not missing anything.\n\nLet's consider the positions:\n\nIf Kim is at position K, Hector at K + 2, and Tonya at K + 5.\n\nSo, the difference between Tonya's position and Kim's position is T - K = (K + 5) - K = 5.\n\nSo, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nBut the options provided are:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 12\n\nOption C seems to be the correct answer based on this calculation.\n\nHowever, let's double-check to make sure there aren't any mistakes.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding of \"to the left of.\"\n\nLet me visualize the seating arrangement.\n\nSuppose the desks are arranged like this:\n\nDesk 1 | Desk 2 | Desk 3 | Desk 4 | Desk 5 | Desk 6 | Desk 7\n\nLeft ------------------------------------------------------------------> Right\n\nKim is sitting at some desk, say desk K.\n\nHector is 2 seats to the right of Kim, so Hector is at desk K + 2.\n\nTonya is 3 seats to the right of Hector, so Tonya is at desk (K + 2) + 3 = K + 5.\n\nSo, Kim is at K, Hector at K + 2, Tonya at K + 5.\n\nNow, how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\n\nThe number of seats between Kim and Tonya is T - K - 1 = (K + 5) - K - 1 = 4 seats between them.\n\nBut the question is how many seats to the left of Tonya Kim sits, which should be the number of seats from Tonya back to Kim.\n\nWait, maybe I need to interpret it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit\" means how many seats separate Tonya and Kim when moving left from Tonya.\n\nSince Tonya is at K + 5, and Kim is at K, the number of seats between them is 4 (K+1, K+2, K+3, K+4).\n\nBut Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya, as T - K = 5.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused now.\n\nLet me consider an example.\n\nSuppose Kim is at desk 1.\n\nThen Hector is at desk 1 + 2 = desk 3.\n\nThen Tonya is at desk 3 + 3 = desk 6.\n\nSo, Kim is at desk 1, Tonya is at desk 6.\n\nHow many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit?\n\nFrom Tonya at desk 6, moving left, Kim is at desk 1, which is 5 seats to the left.\n\nSo, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let's try another example to confirm.\n\nSuppose Kim is at desk 2.\n\nThen Hector is at desk 4.\n\nTonya is at desk 7.\n\nSo, Kim is at desk 2, Tonya at desk 7.\n\nFrom Tonya's position, moving left to Kim's position: desks 7 to 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2, which is 5 seats to the left.\n\nAgain, 5 seats.\n\nAnother example: if Kim is at desk 3.\n\nThen Hector at desk 5, Tonya at desk 8, but desk 8 doesn't exist; there are only 7 desks.\n\nSo, this arrangement isn't possible because Tonya would need desk 8, which doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, Kim can only be at desk 1 or 2, to keep Tonya within the 7 desks.\n\nIn both cases, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let's look back at the options:\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 5\n\nD. 12\n\nOption C is 5, which matches our conclusion.\n\nBut why is there an option D. 12, which seems unrealistic for 7 desks.\n\nMaybe there's a misinterpretation of the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"how many seats to the left of Tonya does Kim sit\" is interpreted as the number of seats between them, not the positional difference.\n\nIn that case, from Kim to Tonya, there are 4 seats in between (if K to T is 5 seats apart).\n\nBut according to the calculation, T - K = 5, meaning Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nBut in the first example, Kim is at desk 1, Tonya at desk 6; that's 5 seats apart.\n\nIn the second example, Kim at desk 2, Tonya at desk 7; again, 5 seats apart.\n\nSo, consistently, Kim is 5 seats to the left of Tonya.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
