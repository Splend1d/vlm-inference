                    "text": "Let's see what this auditor is dealing with here. So, the auditor is testing whether cash disbursements were properly authorized, and they're using statistical sampling for this. That means they're looking at a sample of transactions to draw conclusions about the entire population of disbursements.\n\nNow, the sample results indicate that the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate. Okay, so first, let's break down what these terms mean.\n\nThe \"sample rate of deviation\" is the percentage of items in the sample that didn't have proper authorization. The \"allowance for sampling risk\" is basically a buffer that accounts for the fact that the sample might not perfectly represent the entire population. And the \"tolerable rate\" is the maximum deviation rate that the auditor is willing to accept without changing their assessment of the control's effectiveness.\n\nSo, if the sample rate of deviation plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable rate, that means the auditor's estimate of the population deviation rate is higher than what they consider acceptable.\n\nNow, the question is asking what the auditor most likely would do in this situation. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\nB. Reduce the assessed level of control risk.\n\nC. Reduce the planned reliance on substantive tests.\n\nD. Reduce the tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nOption A: Reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\nIf the sample results suggest that the deviation rate is higher than tolerable, that means the control may not be working as well as expected. Therefore, the auditor should reduce their reliance on this control. That makes sense.\n\nOption B: Reduce the assessed level of control risk.\n\nWait a minute. If the control isn't working as well as expected, that should indicate a higher control risk, not a lower one. Control risk is the risk that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the entity's internal controls. So, if controls are weaker than thought, control risk should be assessed higher, not lower. Therefore, reducing the assessed level of control risk wouldn't make sense in this scenario.\n\nOption C: Reduce the planned reliance on substantive tests.\n\nSubstantive tests are audit procedures that directly detect material misstatements. If the controls aren't working well, the auditor might need to perform more substantive testing, not less, to compensate for the weaker controls. So, reducing reliance on substantive tests seems counterintuitive here.\n\nOption D: Reduce the tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nThe tolerable rate is set by the auditor based on the materiality and other factors. If the sample results exceed the tolerable rate, adjusting the tolerable rate to a higher level might make the sample results acceptable, but that seems like manipulating the tolerances to fit the sample results, which isn't a proper approach. Auditors should set tolerable rates based on their assessment of materiality and not adjust them based on sample results.\n\nSo, considering all this, option A seems to be the most appropriate action: reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIf the deviation rate exceeds the tolerable rate, it suggests that the control is not operating effectively. Therefore, the auditor should rely less on this control and possibly perform additional substantive testing to gather more assurance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because assessing a lower control risk would imply that the controls are working better than evidence suggests.\n\nOption C is incorrect because reducing reliance on substantive tests when controls are weak could lead to insufficient evidence.\n\nOption D is incorrect because adjusting the tolerable rate based on sample results isn't a standard auditing practice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Reduce the planned reliance on the prescribed control.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
