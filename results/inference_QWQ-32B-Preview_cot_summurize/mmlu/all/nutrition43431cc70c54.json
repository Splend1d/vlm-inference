                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about dietary calcium is true. I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Typical calcium intake in most adults is between 0.5mg and 2.0mg per day.\" Hmm, that seems really low. I thought the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for calcium is higher than that. I think for adults, it's around 1000 to 1300 mg per day, depending on age and other factors. So, 0.5 to 2.0 mg sounds way too low. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be grams instead of milligrams, but even then, it doesn't make sense. So, I doubt A is correct.\n\nOption B: \"Activated Vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium.\" I know that vitamin D is important for calcium absorption. In fact, it helps the intestines absorb calcium more efficiently. So, activated vitamin D should increase calcium absorption, not decrease it. Therefore, B seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: \"There is clear evidence that people who consume more than the average amount of calcium have a lower risk of bone fractures.\" This is an interesting one. I've heard mixed things about this. Some studies suggest that higher calcium intake can help strengthen bones and reduce fracture risk, especially in combination with vitamin D. However, other studies have shown that the relationship isn't as clear-cut, and very high intakes might not offer additional benefits or could even have some risks. So, I'm not sure if there's unequivocal evidence to support this statement. It might be too absolute.\n\nOption D: \"Absorption efficiency is inversely related to calcium intake, so that a higher proportion is absorbed when calcium intake is low.\" This sounds plausible. I recall that when calcium intake is low, the body tries to absorb a higher percentage of the calcium available to meet its needs. Conversely, when calcium intake is high, absorption efficiency decreases to prevent overloading the system with calcium. This seems like a regulatory mechanism to maintain calcium homeostasis.\n\nLet me think again. If I have a low calcium intake, say 200 mg per day, my body might absorb a larger percentage of that, like 30% or more, to get enough calcium. But if I take in 1000 mg, maybe only 20% is absorbed, because that's sufficient to meet my needs. Does that make sense?\n\nI think D is the most accurate statement among the options given.\n\nSo, my answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
