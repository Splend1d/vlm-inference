So, it's like taking twice the value of m and then adding 7 to it. That sounds a lot like option A: \"7 more than 2 times m.\" Let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B says \"2 more than 7 times m.\" That would be 7m + 2, which is different from 2m + 7.\n\nOption C says \"2 times the sum of 7 and m.\" That would be 2*(7 + m), which is 14 + 2m. That's not the same as 2m + 7, although it is equivalent since addition is commutative, but the structure is different.\n\nOption D says \"7 times the sum of 2 and m.\" That would be 7*(2 + m), which is 14 + 7m. That's definitely different from 2m + 7.\n\nSo, option A seems to be the correct description. To double-check, let's break it down:\n\n- \"2 times m\" is 2m.\n\n- \"7 more than\" that is 2m + 7.\n\nYes, that matches the expression. So, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
