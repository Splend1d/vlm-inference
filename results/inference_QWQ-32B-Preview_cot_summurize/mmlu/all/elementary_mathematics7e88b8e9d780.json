                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the population of Louisiana in 2010. It says that when rounded to the nearest 10,000, the population was 4,530,000. And then it gives me four options for the actual population, and I need to figure out which one could be correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to round to the nearest 10,000. So, if a number is rounded to the nearest 10,000, that means we're looking at the thousands place to decide whether to round up or down.\n\nLet me think about how rounding works. If the digit in the thousands place is 5 or higher, we round up. If it's less than 5, we round down.\n\nSo, for a number to be rounded to 4,530,000, it must have been closer to 4,530,000 than to 4,520,000 or 4,540,000.\n\nThat means the actual population would have to be at least 4,525,000 but less than 4,535,000.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf we have 4,525,000, that's exactly halfway between 4,520,000 and 4,530,000. Normally, when rounding, if it's exactly halfway, we round up to the higher number. So, 4,525,000 would round up to 4,530,000.\n\nSimilarly, any number from 4,525,000 up to but not including 4,535,000 would round to 4,530,000.\n\nBecause 4,535,000 is exactly halfway between 4,530,000 and 4,540,000, and it would round up to 4,540,000.\n\nSo, the actual population must be greater than or equal to 4,525,000 and less than 4,535,000.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. 4,500,321\n\nThis is less than 4,525,000, so it would round down to 4,500,000, not 4,530,000. So, this can't be correct.\n\nB. 4,524,491\n\nThis is also less than 4,525,000, so it would round down to 4,520,000. Not 4,530,000.\n\nC. 4,533,372\n\nThis is greater than 4,525,000 and less than 4,535,000, so it falls within the range that would round to 4,530,000.\n\nD. 4,535,343\n\nThis is greater than or equal to 4,535,000, so it would round up to 4,540,000, not 4,530,000.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits within the range is C. 4,533,372.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the rounding rule. I recall that there are different conventions for rounding, especially when it comes to numbers that are exactly halfway between two rounding options.\n\nIn some cases, rounding up is the standard, but in some contexts, other rules might apply, like rounding to the nearest even number to avoid bias.\n\nHowever, for this problem, I think the standard rule of rounding up at 5 applies.\n\nGiven that, my conclusion remains that option C is the correct choice.\n\nLet me just double-check the boundaries.\n\nIf the actual population was 4,525,000, it would round up to 4,530,000.\n\nIf it was 4,524,999, it would round down to 4,520,000.\n\nSimilarly, 4,534,999 would round down to 4,530,000, and 4,535,000 would round up to 4,540,000.\n\nSo, the range is from 4,525,000 to 4,534,999 inclusive.\n\nOption C, 4,533,372, falls within this range.\n\nOptions A and B are too low, and option D is too high.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 4,533,372.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
