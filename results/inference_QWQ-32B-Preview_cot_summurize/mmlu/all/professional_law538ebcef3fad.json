                    "text": "This is a tricky question about evidence admissibility in a criminal trial, specifically regarding the confrontation clause and statements against penal interest. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the context: A defendant is on trial for robbing a bank with his best friend, who has left the country and can't be found. The prosecutor wants to call the friend's mother to testify about a conversation she had with her son before he left, where he admitted being involved in the robbery.\n\nThe key issue here is whether this statement by the friend to his mother is admissible in court, considering the confrontation clause and the nature of the statement.\n\nOption A says no, because inculpatory statements against penal interest don't satisfy the confrontation clause. Option B also says no, but because the friend's statement wasn't corroborated. Option C says yes, as a statement against penal interest that isn't testimonial under the confrontation clause. Option D says yes, as a statement of the friend's state of mind that isn't testimonial.\n\nLet's start by understanding the confrontation clause. It's part of the Sixth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and guarantees that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against them. This means that generally, testimonial statements by witnesses who don't testify in person can't be used against the defendant.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions, and one of them is statements against interest. A statement against penal interest is a statement that would subject the declarant to criminal liability. The idea is that such a statement is so against the declarant's own interests that it's considered reliable.\n\nIn this case, the friend told his mother, \"I have to go. I was involved in a robbery at [the bank], and I don't want them to catch me.\" This is clearly against his penal interest because he's admitting to a crime.\n\nNow, the question is whether this statement is testimonial or not. Testimonial statements are those made under circumstances that would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\n\nStatements made in a casual conversation, without any expectation that they'll be used in court, are often considered nontestimonial. In this scenario, the friend was talking to his mother privately, likely in a personal setting, and probably didn't anticipate that his words would be used in court.\n\nGiven that, option C seems plausible: the statement is against penal interest and nontestimonial, so it should be admissible.\n\nOption D suggests that it's a statement of the friend's state of mind, which might also be admissible for some purposes, but in this context, it's more directly relevant as an admission of involvement in the robbery.\n\nOption A is incorrect because statements against penal interest can satisfy the confrontation clause if they are nontestimonial.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because corroboration isn't necessarily required for such statements to be admissible, although it might affect their weight.\n\nTherefore, the most correct answer is C: yes, as a statement against penal interest that is not testimonial under the confrontation clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
