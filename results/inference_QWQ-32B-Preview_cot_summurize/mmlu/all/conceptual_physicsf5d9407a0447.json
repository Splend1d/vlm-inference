                    "text": "The Moon always showing the same face to Earth is a phenomenon known as tidal locking. This means that the Moon's rotational period matches its orbital period around Earth. So, the Moon rotates on its axis in the same amount of time it takes to orbit Earth once.\n\nGiven that, let's look at the options:\n\nA. day - A day typically refers to one rotation of Earth on its axis, which is about 24 hours. But the Moon's rotation period is much longer.\n\nB. month - A month generally refers to the period it takes for the Moon to orbit Earth, which is about 29.5 days for a synodic month or about 27.3 days for a sidereal month.\n\nC. year - A year is the time it takes Earth to orbit the Sun, which is about 365.25 days.\n\nD. None of these for the moon does not rotate about an axis - This is incorrect because the Moon does rotate about its axis.\n\nSo, the Moon's rotation period is about once per month, specifically a sidereal month of about 27.3 days.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. month.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
