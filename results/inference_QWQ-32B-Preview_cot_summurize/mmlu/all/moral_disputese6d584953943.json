The question is: \"Corresponding to the practical aim of moral theory is the principle of...\" and then it gives options A. parsimony, B. practical guidance, C. explanatory power, D. none of the above. I think I need to understand what the \"practical aim of moral theory\" is before I can pick the right principle.\n\nSo, moral theory, as I understand it, is about figuring out what's right and wrong, how we should live our lives, and make decisions that affect ourselves and others. It's not just theoretical; it's meant to guide our actions in the real world. So, the practical aim would be to provide some kind of guidance for how to act in moral situations.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Parsimony - I know this term from science; it's about simplicity, like Occam's razor, where you choose the simplest explanation that fits the facts. But I'm not sure how that relates to the practical aim of moral theory.\n\nB. Practical guidance - This seems directly related to the practical aim. If moral theory is supposed to help us make moral decisions, then practical guidance would be key.\n\nC. Explanatory power - This sounds more like a theoretical aspect. It's about how well a theory explains moral phenomena, but not necessarily about guiding action.\n\nD. None of the above - Well, if I have to choose between these options, I might not need this option if one of the others fits better.\n\nGiven this, I think the principle that corresponds to the practical aim of moral theory is practical guidance. So, I would go with option B.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should think about this differently. Is there a principle in moral theory that is specifically about being practical and guiding action? I remember something about consequentialism focusing on outcomes and trying to maximize good, which seems practical. But that's a specific theory, not a principle corresponding to the practical aim.\n\nAlternatively, deontological theories focus on duties and rules, which also provide guidance, but in a different way. Maybe the practical aim encompasses both\u2014providing guidance regardless of the specific approach.\n\nWait, maybe parsimony could be relevant if a moral theory is simpler and easier to apply in real-life situations. But still, simplicity is more about the theory itself rather than its practical application.\n\nExplanatory power is important for a theory to be credible, but again, it's more about understanding morality rather than guiding action.\n\nSo, I still think practical guidance is the best answer here. It directly relates to the practical aim of moral theory, which is to help us make moral decisions in real life.\n\nMaybe I should look up what some philosophers say about the aims of moral theory. That might help clarify.\n\nAfter a quick search, I see that some philosophers discuss moral theory in terms of its ability to guide action, to provide justifications for moral beliefs, and to resolve moral disputes. All of these seem practical in nature.\n\nFor example, Ralph Savarese and David Svolba, in their work, emphasize that moral theory should have practical implications and guide moral agents in their decisions.\n\nAdditionally, Thomas Scanlon's contractualism is often praised for its practical applicability in real-world ethical dilemmas.\n\nSo, it seems that the practical aim of moral theory is indeed to provide practical guidance.\n\nTherefore, the principle that corresponds to this aim would be practical guidance, which is option B.\n\nI think I'll go with B. practical guidance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
