                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about truck weights on the interstate highway system. It says that the weights are normally distributed, and gives me two pieces of information: 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds. I need to find the mean and standard deviation of the weights based on this information.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The empirical rule tells me that about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations. But here, I have percentages greater than specific weights, so I think I need to use z-scores and possibly a z-table to find the mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet me denote the mean by \u03bc and the standard deviation by \u03c3. The z-score formula is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere X is the value of interest.\n\nGiven that 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, that means 30% weigh less than or equal to 12,000 pounds. Similarly, 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds, so 20% weigh less than or equal to 10,000 pounds.\n\nI can use these percentages to find the z-scores corresponding to 12,000 and 10,000 pounds.\n\nFirst, for 12,000 pounds:\n\nP(Z < z1) = 0.30\n\nAnd for 10,000 pounds:\n\nP(Z < z2) = 0.20\n\nI need to find the z-scores that correspond to these cumulative probabilities. I can look these up in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator with a z-table function.\n\nLooking up P(Z < z) = 0.30, I find that z1 is approximately -0.5244.\n\nSimilarly, for P(Z < z) = 0.20, z2 is approximately -0.8416.\n\nNow, I can set up equations using the z-score formula for both weights.\n\nFor 12,000 pounds:\n\nz1 = (12000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.5244\n\nFor 10,000 pounds:\n\nz2 = (10000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.8416\n\nNow I have two equations with two unknowns (\u03bc and \u03c3). I can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \u03bc and \u03c3.\n\nLet me write down the equations again:\n\n1) (12000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.5244\n\n2) (10000 - \u03bc) / \u03c3 = -0.8416\n\nI can rearrange both equations to solve for \u03bc:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n12000 - \u03bc = -0.5244 * \u03c3\n\n\u03bc = 12000 + 0.5244 * \u03c3\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n10000 - \u03bc = -0.8416 * \u03c3\n\n\u03bc = 10000 + 0.8416 * \u03c3\n\nNow, since both expressions equal \u03bc, I can set them equal to each other:\n\n12000 + 0.5244 * \u03c3 = 10000 + 0.8416 * \u03c3\n\nNow, solve for \u03c3:\n\n12000 - 10000 = 0.8416 * \u03c3 - 0.5244 * \u03c3\n\n2000 = 0.3172 * \u03c3\n\n\u03c3 = 2000 / 0.3172 \u2248 6304.35 pounds\n\nNow that I have \u03c3, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find \u03bc. Let's use the first equation:\n\n\u03bc = 12000 + 0.5244 * 6304.35 \u2248 12000 + 3299.99 \u2248 15299.99 pounds\n\nAlternatively, using the second equation:\n\n\u03bc = 10000 + 0.8416 * 6304.35 \u2248 10000 + 5300 \u2248 15300 pounds\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest hundred, \u03bc \u2248 15,300 pounds and \u03c3 \u2248 6,300 pounds.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u03bc = 14,900; \u03c3 = 6100\n\nB. \u03bc = 15,100; \u03c3 = 6200\n\nC. \u03bc = 15,300; \u03c3 = 6300\n\nD. \u03bc = 15,500; \u03c3 = 6400\n\nMy calculations match option C.\n\nHowever, I should double-check my z-scores to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking up the z-scores again:\n\nFor P(Z < z) = 0.30, z \u2248 -0.5244\n\nFor P(Z < z) = 0.20, z \u2248 -0.8416\n\nThese seem correct.\n\nAlso, verifying the calculations:\n\n\u03c3 = 2000 / 0.3172 \u2248 6304.35\n\nThen, \u03bc = 12000 + 0.5244 * 6304.35 \u2248 12000 + 3299.99 \u2248 15299.99\n\nWhich rounds to 15,300.\n\nAlternatively, \u03bc = 10000 + 0.8416 * 6304.35 \u2248 10000 + 5300 \u2248 15300\n\nSo, it consistently points to option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \u03bc = 15,300; \u03c3 = 6,300\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ \\mu = 15,300; \\ \\sigma = 6,300} \\]"
