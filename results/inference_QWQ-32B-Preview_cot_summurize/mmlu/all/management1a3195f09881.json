                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which economist advocated individualism as a guiding moral philosophy. The options are John Kenneth Galbraith, John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman, and Alfred Marshall.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what individualism means in this context. Individualism, as a moral philosophy, emphasizes the moral worth of the individual and the importance of personal freedom and self-reliance. So, I'm looking for an economist who promoted these ideas.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\nStarting with John Kenneth Galbraith. He was a Canadian-American economist, known for his critiques of consumer culture and his support for government intervention in the economy. His views seem more aligned with a focus on the collective good and regulation, which might not align perfectly with individualism as defined.\n\nNext, John Maynard Keynes. He's famous for his theories on economic interventionism, particularly through fiscal policy, to counteract economic downturns. Again, his focus was more on government action to stabilize the economy, which might not directly support individualism as a moral philosophy.\n\nNow, Milton Friedman. He was a staunch advocate of free-market capitalism and individual liberty. He believed in minimizing government intervention in the economy and emphasized personal responsibility and freedom. His ideas are closely associated with libertarianism, which is strongly individualistic. So, he seems like a strong candidate for advocating individualism as a moral philosophy.\n\nLastly, Alfred Marshall. He was a prominent neoclassical economist who developed theories on supply and demand and the elasticity of products. While he contributed greatly to economic theory, I don't recall him being particularly known for advocating a specific moral philosophy like individualism.\n\nComparing all four, Milton Friedman seems to be the most aligned with individualism as a guiding moral philosophy, given his advocacy for free markets, limited government, and personal liberty.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Milton Friedman.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
