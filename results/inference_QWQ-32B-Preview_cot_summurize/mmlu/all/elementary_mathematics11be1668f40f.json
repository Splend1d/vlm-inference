                    "text": "So Chris is selling roses in bunches, and each bunch costs $16.99. At the end of the day, he's collected $339.80 from selling these bunches. The question is, how many bunches did he sell? The options are 22, 18, 20, or 16.\n\nOkay, so to find out how many bunches he sold, I need to divide the total amount he collected by the price per bunch. That makes sense because if each bunch is $16.99, then the number of bunches sold would be the total money divided by the price per bunch.\n\nSo, number of bunches = total collected / price per bunch\n\nThat is, number of bunches = $339.80 / $16.99\n\nLet me do that calculation. 339.80 divided by 16.99.\n\nFirst, I'll check if 16.99 times 20 is close to 339.80.\n\n16.99 times 20 would be 16.99 * 20 = 339.80. Wait, that's exactly 339.80.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\n16.99 * 20:\n\n10 * 16.99 = 169.90\n\nAnother 10 * 16.99 = 169.90\n\nAdding them up: 169.90 + 169.90 = 339.80\n\nYes, that's exactly 339.80.\n\nSo, 20 bunches times $16.99 per bunch equals $339.80.\n\nLooking back at the options, 20 is one of the choices.\n\nBut let me make sure there isn't a mistake here.\n\nMaybe I should try another calculation to confirm.\n\nLet's say I take 19 bunches: 19 * 16.99.\n\n10 * 16.99 = 169.90\n\n9 * 16.99 = 152.91\n\nAdding them up: 169.90 + 152.91 = 322.81\n\nThat's less than 339.80.\n\nSo, 19 bunches would give $322.81, which is below the total collected.\n\nSimilarly, 21 bunches: 20 * 16.99 = 339.80 + 16.99 = 356.79\n\nThat's more than 339.80.\n\nSo, only 20 bunches give exactly 339.80.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of equation.\n\nLet x be the number of bunches sold.\n\nThen, 16.99 * x = 339.80\n\nSolving for x: x = 339.80 / 16.99 = 20\n\nSo, x = 20\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 20 bunches.\n\nBut let's cross-verify with another method.\n\nPerhaps using approximation.\n\nRound 16.99 to 17 and 339.80 to 340.\n\nThen, 17 * 20 = 340, which is close to 339.80.\n\nBut since 17 * 20 = 340 and 16.99 * 20 = 339.80, it's almost the same.\n\nSo, again, it points to 20 bunches.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the options:\n\nA. 22\n\nB. 18\n\nC. 20\n\nD. 16\n\nWe already saw that 20 bunches give exactly 339.80.\n\nLet's quickly check 22 and 18 to ensure.\n\n22 bunches: 22 * 16.99\n\n20 * 16.99 = 339.80\n\n2 * 16.99 = 33.98\n\nAdding them up: 339.80 + 33.98 = 373.78, which is more than 339.80.\n\nSimilarly, 18 bunches: 18 * 16.99\n\n10 * 16.99 = 169.90\n\n8 * 16.99 = 135.92\n\nAdding up: 169.90 + 135.92 = 305.82, which is less than 339.80.\n\nAnd 16 bunches: 16 * 16.99 = 271.84, which is also less.\n\nTherefore, the only option that gives exactly 339.80 is 20 bunches.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 20.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
