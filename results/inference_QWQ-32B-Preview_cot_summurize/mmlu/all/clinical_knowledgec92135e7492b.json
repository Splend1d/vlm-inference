                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about peripheral neuropathy, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let me read the options again to make sure I understand them.\n\nOption A says: \"Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution.\" Hmm, I think I've heard something about sensory loss in peripheral neuropathy, and I think it often affects the extremities, like the feet and hands, kind of like wearing stockings or gloves. So, maybe this is correct.\n\nOption B: \"The tone is increased bilaterally in the legs.\" Tone refers to muscle tone, right? In peripheral neuropathy, I'm not sure if muscle tone would increase. Actually, I think muscle tone might decrease because of nerve damage leading to muscle weakness. So, this might not be true.\n\nOption C: \"Reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement.\" Brisk reflexes often indicate upper motor neuron involvement, like in conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord. Peripheral neuropathy affects the peripheral nerves, so I don't think reflexes would be brisk. Maybe they'd be reduced or absent.\n\nOption D: \"Weakness is more marked proximally than distally.\" Proximally means closer to the center of the body, like the upper arms or thighs, while distally is farther away, like the hands or feet. In peripheral neuropathy, I think weakness is more common in the distal parts because that's where the nerves are ending, so maybe this is not correct.\n\nLet me think again. Peripheral neuropathy typically affects the peripheral nerves, which are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. These nerves control sensation and movement in the limbs. So, sensory loss in a stocking or glove distribution does sound right for peripheral neuropathy.\n\nMuscle tone might be decreased because the nerves that supply the muscles are damaged, leading to muscle weakness and possibly hypotonia, which is reduced muscle tone.\n\nReflexes might also be diminished or absent because the nerves that control the reflex arcs are affected.\n\nWeakness in peripheral neuropathy is usually more marked distally, meaning in the feet and hands, rather than proximally, which would be more like the thighs and biceps.\n\nSo, considering all that, option A seems to be the correct answer. Sensory loss in a stocking distribution is typical of peripheral neuropathy.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any exceptions or if I'm missing something.\n\nSome types of peripheral neuropathy might affect proximal muscles, but generally, peripheral neuropathy affects the distal limbs first, especially the feet.\n\nAlso, in some cases, like chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), there might be more proximal involvement, but overall, the classic presentation is distal sensory loss.\n\nSo, I think A is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
