The scenarios are:\n\n1. I repeatedly and intentionally stomped on his toes during the line dance.\n\n2. As my parents went on their date night, I read their contacts.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at the first scenario: \"I repeatedly and intentionally stomped on his toes during the line dance.\"\n\nSo, stomping on someone's toes is generally considered harmful and disrespectful. Doing it repeatedly and intentionally suggests that the person is deliberately causing pain or discomfort to another individual. In most moral standards, causing harm to others without a justifiable reason is considered wrong.\n\nNow, the second scenario: \"As my parents went on their date night, I read their contacts.\"\n\nReading someone else's personal communications or documents without their permission is usually considered a violation of their privacy. Contacts, especially, contain personal information about their relationships and communications, which are private matters. Without consent, reading someone's contacts is generally seen as intrusive and disrespectful of their privacy.\n\nSo, both actions seem to violate ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The first one involves intentional harm, and the second involves invasion of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn the first scenario, it's a line dance, which is a social activity. Stomping on someone's toes could be seen as a playful action in some contexts, but the key here is that it's \"repeatedly and intentionally.\" That suggests it's not an accident but a deliberate action to cause discomfort. So, it's likely morally wrong.\n\nIn the second scenario, parents going on a date night doesn't change the fact that reading their contacts without permission is invading their privacy. Even if it's their home and their devices, as a minor, you're still expected to respect their personal boundaries. So, that also seems morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
