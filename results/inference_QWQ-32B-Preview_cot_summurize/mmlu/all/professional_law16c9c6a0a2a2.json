                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best defense for these two defendants who are being prosecuted for felony murder. Let me first understand what happened. So, there were two defendants playing poker with some friends, and everyone was drinking heavily. The defendants lost a lot of money and accused the victim of cheating. When the victim tried to leave, they beat him up, causing a fractured skull, which led to his death from severe head trauma. After that, they stole his wallet. They were arrested and charged with murder, but it's unclear which defendant actually caused the skull fracture.\n\nNow, they're being prosecuted under felony murder rules. Felony murder is when someone dies during the commission of a felony, and the person committing the felony can be charged with murder, even if they didn't directly cause the death or intended to kill anyone.\n\nSo, I need to look at the different theories and requirements of felony murder in different jurisdictions and see which one would provide the best defense for these defendants.\n\nOption A is that the jurisdiction adheres to the inherently dangerous felony requirement. This means that for felony murder to apply, the underlying felony has to be one that's inherently dangerous to human life. So, if the felony is inherently dangerous, then felony murder applies.\n\nOption B is that the jurisdiction follows the independent felony murder rule. I think this might refer to the idea that the felony must be independent of the act that caused death. For example, if the death was caused by the felony itself, or by an act in furtherance of the felony.\n\nOption C is that the jurisdiction follows the proximate cause theory. This likely refers to the legal cause of the death, meaning that the felony must be a direct and proximate cause of the death.\n\nOption D is that the jurisdiction follows the agency theory. In agency theory, only the person who directly causes the death can be charged with felony murder, not accomplices.\n\nGiven these options, I need to think about which one would be most beneficial for the defendants.\n\nFirst, considering option A, the inherently dangerous felony requirement. If the jurisdiction requires that the underlying felony be inherently dangerous to human life, then the defendants might argue that the felony they committed\u2014probably robbery, since they stole the wallet after the beating\u2014is not inherently dangerous. But robbery usually is considered inherently dangerous, so this might not be a strong defense.\n\nOption B, the independent felony murder rule. If the jurisdiction follows this rule, it might mean that the felony must be separate from the act causing death. In this case, the felony was the robbery, and the death was caused by the beating. So, perhaps the robbery is independent of the beating, which was part of the assault. This could potentially be an argument, but it's a bit vague.\n\nOption C, proximate cause theory. This would require that the felony be a direct cause of the death. In this scenario, the death was caused by the beating, not the robbery. So, perhaps the defendants could argue that the robbery was not the proximate cause of the death, but that seems weak because the robbery was part of the sequence of events leading to the death.\n\nOption D, agency theory. This is interesting. If the jurisdiction follows agency theory, only the person who directly caused the death can be charged with felony murder. In this case, since it's unclear which defendant caused the skull fracture, perhaps they can argue that neither of them individually can be directly linked to the fatal blow, and therefore, under agency theory, neither can be charged with felony murder.\n\nBut wait, agency theory usually holds that accomplices can be liable for felony murder if a co-felon causes a death during the commission of the felony. So, even if it's unclear which one did it, they both can be held responsible as accomplices.\n\nHowever, if the jurisdiction follows a strict agency theory, where only the actual killer is liable for felony murder, then perhaps the defendants could argue that since it's unclear which one caused the fatal injury, neither can be definitively linked to the killing, and therefore neither should be charged with felony murder.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how it works. Maybe I need to look deeper into the agency theory.\n\nLet me think about this differently. If the jurisdiction follows the agency theory, and only the person who directly causes the death can be charged with felony murder, then in a situation where multiple people are involved in the felony and it's unclear who caused the death, perhaps the prosecution would need to prove which specific defendant caused the fatal injury to charge them with felony murder.\n\nIn this case, since it's impossible to determine which defendant caused the skull fracture, maybe under agency theory, neither can be charged with felony murder, unless the prosecution can specifically link one of them to the fatal blow.\n\nWait, but in most jurisdictions that follow agency theory, accomplices can still be liable for felony murder if a co-felon causes a death during the felony. So, even if it's unclear who specifically caused the death, they can both be held responsible as accomplices.\n\nBut perhaps there's a variation in agency theory where unless it's clear who caused the death, neither can be charged with felony murder. I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider proximate cause theory again. If the jurisdiction follows proximate cause, and the robbery is considered the proximate cause of the death, then even if the death was caused by the beating, the robbery set off the chain of events leading to the death, and thus felony murder could apply.\n\nBut again, it seems like the beating was the direct cause of death, not the robbery.\n\nWait, perhaps the defendants could argue that the robbery was complete once they took the wallet, and the beating occurred before that, so the death was caused during the assault, not during the robbery. That might be a line of defense under proximate cause theory.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look back at the options.\n\nOption A: inherently dangerous felony requirement. Robbery is usually considered inherently dangerous, so this might not help the defendants.\n\nOption B: independent felony murder rule. Not sure exactly what this means in this context.\n\nOption C: proximate cause theory. Maybe they can argue that the robbery was not the proximate cause of the death, but the beating was.\n\nOption D: agency theory. Perhaps they can argue that since it's unclear which one caused the fatal injury, neither should be charged with felony murder under agency theory.\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the best defense for the defendants would be if the jurisdiction follows the agency theory, because in that case, only the person who directly caused the death can be charged with felony murder. Since it's impossible to determine which defendant caused the skull fracture, neither can be definitively linked to the fatal act, and therefore neither should be charged with felony murder.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, in many jurisdictions that follow agency theory, accomplices can still be liable for felony murder if a co-felon causes a death during the felony. So, even if it's unclear who specifically caused the death, both defendants could still be held responsible.\n\nHowever, perhaps in some variations of agency theory, the prosecution must identify which specific defendant caused the death, and in the absence of such identification, neither can be charged with felony murder.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defendants can argue that the death was not a foreseeable result of the robbery, but since the beating was part of the incident, that might not hold up.\n\nWait, perhaps if the jurisdiction follows a modified agency theory, where accomplices are only liable for felony murder if they had intent or recklessness in causing death, then the defendants could argue that they did not intend to kill the victim, and therefore should not be charged with felony murder.\n\nBut that might be more related to mens rea than to the theory of felony murder.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's consider the facts again.\n\nThe defendants were involved in a violent assault that led to the victim's death, and then they stole the wallet. So, there's both assault and robbery involved.\n\nIf the jurisdiction follows the agency theory in felony murder, and only the actual killer is liable for felony murder, then in this case, since it's unclear which defendant caused the fatal injury, perhaps neither can be charged with felony murder.\n\nBut, as I recall, in agency theory, accomplices can still be liable for felony murder if a co-felon causes a death during the felony. So, even if it's unclear which one did it, they both can be held responsible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some jurisdictions, the prosecution must establish which specific defendant caused the death for felony murder charges to stick.\n\nI need to think about this differently.\n\nLet me consider what each theory entails.\n\nInherent dangerousness: The felony must be one that's inherently dangerous to human life.\n\nIndependent felony: The felony must be independent of the act causing death.\n\nProximate cause: The felony must be the proximate cause of the death.\n\nAgency theory: Only the person who directly causes the death is liable for felony murder.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best defense for the defendants would be if the jurisdiction follows the agency theory, because then, since it's unclear which defendant caused the fatal injury, neither can be definitively charged with felony murder.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, in many jurisdictions following agency theory, accomplices can still be liable for felony murder if a co-felon causes a death during the felony.\n\nHowever, perhaps in some jurisdictions, agency theory is applied more strictly, and only the actual killer is liable for felony murder.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defendants can argue that the robbery was completed before the fatal beating occurred, and therefore the death did not occur during the commission of the felony.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, because the robbery and the assault were part of a continuous course of conduct.\n\nAnother possibility is to argue that the death was not a foreseeable result of the robbery, but given the violent nature of the assault, that might not hold up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can argue that the assault was not in furtherance of the robbery, but that might be difficult, given that the robbery occurred after the assault.\n\nWait, the robbery occurred after the assault, since they stole the wallet after beating the victim to the ground.\n\nSo, perhaps the defendants can argue that the robbery was not part of the same course of conduct as the assault, and therefore the death did not occur during the commission of the robbery.\n\nBut that seems unlikely to succeed, because the events were part of a continuous sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can argue that the assault was an independent act not related to the robbery, and therefore the death should not be attributed to the robbery for felony murder purposes.\n\nBut again, given the close connection between the assault and the robbery, that might not hold up.\n\nI'm starting to think that option D, the agency theory, might indeed be the best defense for the defendants.\n\nIf the jurisdiction follows agency theory, and only the actual killer can be charged with felony murder, then in this case, since it's impossible to determine which defendant caused the fatal injury, neither can be definitively linked to the killing, and therefore neither should be charged with felony murder.\n\nBut, as I recall, in agency theory, accomplices can still be liable for felony murder if a co-felon causes a death during the felony.\n\nSo, even if it's unclear which one did it, they both can be held responsible.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a scenario where the prosecution must prove which specific defendant caused the death, and in the absence of such proof, neither can be convicted of felony murder.\n\nThat might be a possible defense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can argue that since the death was caused by the beating, which was separate from the robbery, the robbery should not serve as the basis for felony murder.\n\nBut that seems weak, given that the robbery was part of the same course of conduct.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps they can argue that the robbery was not an inherently dangerous felony in this jurisdiction, but that's unlikely, since robbery usually is considered inherently dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can argue that the death was not a direct result of the robbery, but again, that's questionable given the sequence of events.\n\nComparing all the options, I think option D, the agency theory, provides the best defense for the defendants.\n\nIf the jurisdiction follows agency theory, and only the actual killer can be charged with felony murder, then in this case, where it's unclear which defendant caused the fatal injury, neither can be definitively linked to the killing, and therefore neither should be charged with felony murder.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D}} \\]"
