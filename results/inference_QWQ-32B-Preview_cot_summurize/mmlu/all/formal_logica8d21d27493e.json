                    "text": " So I have this argument to evaluate: ~A \u00b7 ~B, (A \u2228 C) \u2228 B / C. I need to construct a truth table for it and determine if it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nFirst, let's understand the argument. It has two premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. Premise: ~A \u00b7 ~B\n\n2. Premise: (A \u2228 C) \u2228 B\n\nConclusion: C\n\nMy goal is to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, whenever both premises are true, does the conclusion have to be true?\n\nTo do this, I'll construct a truth table that includes all the variables involved: A, B, and C. There are three variables, so there will be 2^3 = 8 possible combinations of truth values.\n\nI need to list all these combinations and then evaluate the truth values of each premise and the conclusion for each combination.\n\nLet's list the eight combinations:\n\n1. A = T, B = T, C = T\n\n2. A = T, B = T, C = F\n\n3. A = T, B = F, C = T\n\n4. A = T, B = F, C = F\n\n5. A = F, B = T, C = T\n\n6. A = F, B = T, C = F\n\n7. A = F, B = F, C = T\n\n8. A = F, B = F, C = F\n\nNow, for each of these, I'll evaluate the premises and the conclusion.\n\nFirst, let's write down the premises and the conclusion:\n\nPremise 1: ~A \u00b7 ~B\n\nPremise 2: (A \u2228 C) \u2228 B\n\nConclusion: C\n\nI need to find rows where both premises are true, and see if in those rows, the conclusion is also true.\n\nLet's start evaluating.\n\n**Row 1: A = T, B = T, C = T**\n\n~A = F\n\n~B = F\n\nPremise 1: F \u00b7 F = F\n\nPremise 2: (T \u2228 T) \u2228 T = T \u2228 T = T\n\nConclusion: T\n\nSince Premise 1 is false, this row doesn't satisfy both premises being true. So, it's irrelevant for determining validity.\n\n**Row 2: A = T, B = T, C = F**\n\n~A = F\n\n~B = F\n\nPremise 1: F \u00b7 F = F\n\nPremise 2: (T \u2228 F) \u2228 T = T \u2228 T = T\n\nConclusion: F\n\nAgain, Premise 1 is false.\n\n**Row 3: A = T, B = F, C = T**\n\n~A = F\n\n~B = T\n\nPremise 1: F \u00b7 T = F\n\nPremise 2: (T \u2228 T) \u2228 F = T \u2228 F = T\n\nConclusion: T\n\nPremise 1 is false.\n\n**Row 4: A = T, B = F, C = F**\n\n~A = F\n\n~B = T\n\nPremise 1: F \u00b7 T = F\n\nPremise 2: (T \u2228 F) \u2228 F = T \u2228 F = T\n\nConclusion: F\n\nPremise 1 is false.\n\n**Row 5: A = F, B = T, C = T**\n\n~A = T\n\n~B = F\n\nPremise 1: T \u00b7 F = F\n\nPremise 2: (F \u2228 T) \u2228 T = T \u2228 T = T\n\nConclusion: T\n\nPremise 1 is false.\n\n**Row 6: A = F, B = T, C = F**\n\n~A = T\n\n~B = F\n\nPremise 1: T \u00b7 F = F\n\nPremise 2: (F \u2228 F) \u2228 T = F \u2228 T = T\n\nConclusion: F\n\nPremise 1 is false.\n\n**Row 7: A = F, B = F, C = T**\n\n~A = T\n\n~B = T\n\nPremise 1: T \u00b7 T = T\n\nPremise 2: (F \u2228 T) \u2228 F = T \u2228 F = T\n\nConclusion: T\n\nHere, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.\n\n**Row 8: A = F, B = F, C = F**\n\n~A = T\n\n~B = T\n\nPremise 1: T \u00b7 T = T\n\nPremise 2: (F \u2228 F) \u2228 F = F \u2228 F = F\n\nConclusion: F\n\nIn this row, Premise 2 is false, so both premises are not true.\n\nSo, from the truth table, the only row where both premises are true is row 7, and in that row, the conclusion is also true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid because whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is necessarily true.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A says \"Valid,\" and options B, C, and D say \"Invalid\" with different counterexamples.\n\nHowever, based on the truth table, the argument is valid, so option A should be correct.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any possibility of invalidity.\n\nIs there any row where both premises are true, and the conclusion is false?\n\nFrom the truth table, in row 7, both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.\n\nIn all other rows, at least one premise is false.\n\nTherefore, there is no counterexample where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nHence, the argument is valid.\n\nSo, the correct answer is option A: Valid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
