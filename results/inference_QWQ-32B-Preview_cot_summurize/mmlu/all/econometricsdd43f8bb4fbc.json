                    "text": "So I've got this question about autocorrelation coefficients, and I need to figure out which ones are statistically significant at the 5% level. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, there are three lag coefficients:\n\n- Lag 1: 0.2\n\n- Lag 2: -0.15\n\n- Lag 3: -0.1\n\nAnd it says that there are 250 data points, and that these coefficients are approximately normally distributed. The question is, which of these coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level?\n\nNow, I remember that to test for statistical significance, we usually look at the t-statistic or something similar, and compare it to a critical value from the t-distribution or the standard normal distribution, depending on the situation.\n\nBut here, it doesn't give me any standard errors or standard deviations for these coefficients. That seems like a problem because without knowing the variability of these estimates, I can't really assess their significance.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to estimate the standard error for autocorrelation coefficients. Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that for large samples, the sample autocorrelation coefficient at lag k, denoted as r_k, has an approximate standard error of 1/sqrt(n), where n is the number of data points. In this case, n is 250.\n\nSo, the standard error (SE) would be approximately 1/sqrt(250). Let me calculate that.\n\nsqrt(250) is roughly 15.81, so SE \u2248 1/15.81 \u2248 0.0632.\n\nAlright, so SE \u2248 0.0632.\n\nNow, to test if a coefficient is significantly different from zero at the 5% level, I can use the rule that the coefficient is significantly different from zero if its absolute value is greater than approximately 2 standard errors. This is because for a standard normal distribution, the 95% confidence interval is approximately \u00b11.96 standard deviations, and 2 is a close enough approximation for quick calculations.\n\nSo, the significance threshold would be approximately 2 * 0.0632 \u2248 0.1264.\n\nNow, let's look at each lag coefficient:\n\n1. Lag 1: 0.2\n\n   Absolute value: 0.2\n\n   0.2 > 0.1264, so it's significant.\n\n2. Lag 2: -0.15\n\n   Absolute value: 0.15\n\n   0.15 > 0.1264, so it's significant.\n\n3. Lag 3: -0.1\n\n   Absolute value: 0.1\n\n   0.1 < 0.1264, so it's not significant.\n\nSo, based on this, only Lag 1 and Lag 2 are significant at the 5% level.\n\nWait a minute, but the question says \"which of the coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level?\" and the options are:\n\nA. 1 only\n\nB. 1 and 2 only\n\nC. 1, 2 and 3 only\n\nD. It is not possible to determine the statistical significance since no standard errors have been given\n\nAccording to my calculation, the answer should be B. 1 and 2 only.\n\nBut let's double-check my assumptions.\n\nFirst, I assumed that the standard error for the autocorrelation coefficient is approximately 1/sqrt(n). Is that correct?\n\nI think so, because in time series analysis, for large n, the sample autocorrelations are approximately normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation 1/sqrt(n).\n\nSecond, I used the approximation that coefficients with absolute values greater than 2 SE are significant at the 5% level. Is that accurate?\n\nYes, because for a two-tailed test at 5% significance level, the critical value is approximately 1.96 for a standard normal distribution, and 2 is a commonly used rule of thumb.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion should be that Lag 1 and Lag 2 are significant, while Lag 3 is not.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option B says \"1 and 2 only,\" which aligns with my conclusion.\n\nHowever, option D says \"It is not possible to determine the statistical significance since no standard errors have been given.\"\n\nBut I did manage to determine the significance by estimating the standard error based on the sample size. So, option D is not correct in this case.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 1 and 2 only.\n\nWait, but the question says \"assuming that the coefficients are approximately normally distributed.\" Does that mean that I can proceed with the normality assumption, and use the standard error formula I used?\n\nYes, it does. So, my approach seems valid.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing.\n\nIs there any adjustment needed for multiple comparisons since we are testing multiple lags?\n\nThat's an interesting point. When testing multiple coefficients, there's a chance of increased type I error rate. Maybe I should consider adjusting the significance level using something like the Bonferroni correction.\n\nIn that case, for three tests, the adjusted alpha level would be 0.05 / 3 \u2248 0.0167.\n\nThen, the corresponding critical value would be higher, meaning that the coefficients would need to be larger in absolute value to be significant.\n\nBut in practice, for introductory time series analysis, I don't think such adjustments are typically made for autocorrelation coefficients. I think the standard approach is to use the individual 5% level without adjustment.\n\nMoreover, the question doesn't mention anything about multiple comparisons, so I think it's safe to proceed with the individual 5% level.\n\nTherefore, my initial conclusion remains: B. 1 and 2 only.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's calculate the t-statistics for each coefficient.\n\nThe t-statistic is coefficient / SE.\n\nSE \u2248 0.0632.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Lag 1: 0.2 / 0.0632 \u2248 3.16\n\n2. Lag 2: -0.15 / 0.0632 \u2248 -2.37\n\n3. Lag 3: -0.1 / 0.0632 \u2248 -1.58\n\nNow, compared to the critical value of approximately 1.96 for a two-tailed test at 5% significance:\n\n- Lag 1: 3.16 > 1.96 \u2192 significant\n\n- Lag 2: 2.37 > 1.96 \u2192 significant\n\n- Lag 3: 1.58 < 1.96 \u2192 not significant\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 1 and 2 only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
