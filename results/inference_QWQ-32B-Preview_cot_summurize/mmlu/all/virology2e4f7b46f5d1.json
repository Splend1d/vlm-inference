The vaccine for yellow fever is important because it helps prevent this serious illness that can lead to fever, jaundice, bleeding, and sometimes death.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Killed virus vaccine - This type of vaccine uses viruses that have been inactivated or killed, so they can't reproduce or cause disease. They stimulate an immune response without the risk of causing the disease.\n\nB. Live attenuated virus vaccine developed by Pasteurian passage - This refers to a vaccine that contains live viruses that have been weakened or attenuated so that they don't cause disease in humans but can still replicate and induce immunity. The term \"Pasteurian passage\" might refer to the method of attenuation, possibly involving serial passage in different hosts or cell cultures to weaken the virus.\n\nC. Live attenuated vaccine produced by direct mutation of the virus genome - This is another type of live attenuated vaccine, but here the attenuation is achieved by directly modifying the virus's genetic material to reduce its virulence.\n\nD. Experimental vaccine only - This would mean that the vaccine is still in the research or testing phase and not yet approved for general use.\n\nSo, which one is the yellow fever vaccine? I recall that the yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine. It's been around for quite some time and is widely used to prevent yellow fever. The vaccine is very effective and provides long-lasting immunity against the disease.\n\nLooking back at the options, both B and C describe live attenuated vaccines, but they differ in how the attenuation was achieved. Option B mentions \"Pasteurian passage,\" which sounds like the virus was weakened through serial passage in different environments, possibly similar to how Louis Pasteur developed some of his vaccines. Option C specifies that the attenuation was achieved through direct mutation of the virus genome.\n\nI think the yellow fever vaccine was developed through serial passage in chick embryos, which would align with the \"Pasteurian passage\" method. So, I believe the correct answer is B. Live attenuated virus vaccine developed by Pasteurian passage.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm this. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine. It was developed by Max Theiler and his colleagues at the Rockefeller Foundation in the 1930s. They attenuated the virus through serial passage in mouse brains and then in chick embryos.\n\nSo, the method used was indeed serial passage, which fits with the description in option B. Therefore, I can confidently say that the yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated virus vaccine developed by Pasteurian passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
