Is that morally wrong? Well, morally wrong usually means doing something that hurts others or breaks some ethical rule. Here, the person is just working hard on their own project. They're not hurting anyone else by staying up all night to write their thesis. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person wants to quit piano lessons and asks their parents about it. Again, is this morally wrong? Asking parents for something seems pretty normal. Kids ask parents for things all the time, like permission to quit activities or to do something else. As long as they're asking nicely and not being deceitful, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are not morally wrong. The person in Scenario 1 is just working hard on their thesis, and the person in Scenario 2 is asking their parents about quitting piano lessons. Neither of these actions seems to harm anyone or violate any moral rules.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
