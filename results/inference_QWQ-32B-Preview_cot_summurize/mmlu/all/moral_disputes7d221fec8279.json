                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what the main goal of cognitive-behavioral therapy is. There are four options here: building grit, minimizing distorted thinking, rewarding good behavior, and achieving stoic wisdom. I need to figure out which one is the primary aim of CBT.\n\nFirst, I know that cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT, is a type of psychotherapy that helps people change the way they think and behave. It's commonly used to treat mental health issues like depression and anxiety. So, it's focused on thoughts and actions.\n\nOption A is \"build grit.\" Grit is about perseverance and passion for long-term goals. While CBT might help someone develop perseverance by changing negative thought patterns, building grit isn't the main goal of CBT. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B is \"minimize distorted thinking.\" Distorted thinking refers to irrational or inaccurate thoughts that can lead to emotional distress. CBT is known for identifying and challenging these distortions to help people have more realistic and healthy thought patterns. This seems like a key component of CBT.\n\nOption C is \"reward good behavior.\" Rewarding behavior sounds more like a behaviorist approach, where positive reinforcement is used to encourage desired behaviors. While CBT does involve behavioral techniques, its core focus is on changing thoughts as well as behaviors. So, while rewarding good behavior might be a part of it, it's not the primary goal.\n\nOption D is \"achieve stoic wisdom.\" Stoicism is a philosophical approach that emphasizes logical thinking and acceptance of things outside one's control. While there might be some overlap between stoic principles and CBT, the main goal of CBT is to address and change problematic thoughts and behaviors, not necessarily to achieve stoic wisdom.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like option B, \"minimize distorted thinking,\" is the most accurate description of the goal of cognitive-behavioral therapy. CBT aims to help individuals recognize and alter their negative thought patterns, which in turn can lead to better emotional regulation and behavioral changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
