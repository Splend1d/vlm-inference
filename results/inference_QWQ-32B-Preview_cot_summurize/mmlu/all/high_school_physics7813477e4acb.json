                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. First, we need to understand what's happening here.\n\nWe have a battery that's charging a capacitor. Initially, there's a 2 \u03bcF capacitor connected directly to the battery, and when it's fully charged, it stores 600 \u03bcC of charge. From this information, we can figure out the voltage of the battery.\n\nThe formula that relates charge, capacitance, and voltage is:\n\n\\[ q = c \\times v \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( q \\) is the charge stored on the capacitor,\n\n- \\( c \\) is the capacitance, and\n\n- \\( v \\) is the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nGiven that \\( q = 600 \\, \\mu C \\) and \\( c = 2 \\, \\mu F \\), we can solve for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{q}{c} = \\frac{600 \\, \\mu C}{2 \\, \\mu F} = 300 \\, V \\]\n\nSo, the battery voltage is 300 volts.\n\nNext, the experimenter replaces the single 2 \u03bcF capacitor with three 18 \u03bcF capacitors connected in series, still connected to the same battery. We need to find out how much charge each of these capacitors stores once they are fully charged.\n\nFirst, let's recall how capacitors behave when connected in series. For capacitors in series, the total or equivalent capacitance \\( c_{eq} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{c_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{c_1} + \\frac{1}{c_2} + \\frac{1}{c_3} + \\dots + \\frac{1}{c_n} \\]\n\nIn this case, there are three capacitors, each of 18 \u03bcF, connected in series. So:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{c_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{18 \\, \\mu F} + \\frac{1}{18 \\, \\mu F} + \\frac{1}{18 \\, \\mu F} = \\frac{3}{18 \\, \\mu F} = \\frac{1}{6 \\, \\mu F} \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( c_{eq} = 6 \\, \\mu F \\).\n\nNow, the equivalent capacitance of the three capacitors in series is 6 \u03bcF. Since they are connected to the same battery with a voltage of 300 V, the total charge stored on this equivalent capacitor is:\n\n\\[ q_{total} = c_{eq} \\times v = 6 \\, \\mu F \\times 300 \\, V = 1800 \\, \\mu C \\]\n\nHowever, in a series circuit, the charge stored on each capacitor is the same. That's a key property of capacitors in series: the charge on each capacitor is equal.\n\nTherefore, each of the three 18 \u03bcF capacitors will store the same amount of charge, which is equal to the total charge divided by the number of capacitors. Wait a minute, no. Actually, in series, the charge on each capacitor is the same, so it's not divided; each capacitor holds the same charge.\n\nSo, the charge on each capacitor is equal to the total charge, which is 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nBut let's double-check this understanding. In a series circuit, the same current flows through each component, and since capacitors store charge based on the current that flows into them, each capacitor will have the same charge.\n\nTherefore, each of the three capacitors stores 1800 \u03bcC of charge.\n\nBut now, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 100 \u03bcC\n\nB. 200 \u03bcC\n\nC. 600 \u03bcC\n\nD. 1800 \u03bcC\n\nOption D seems to match our calculation.\n\nHowever, let's consider if there's any misunderstanding here. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the voltage across each capacitor in the series configuration.\n\nIn series, the total voltage is divided among the capacitors. The voltage across each capacitor is given by:\n\n\\[ v_i = \\frac{q}{c_i} \\]\n\nSince all capacitors have the same capacitance (18 \u03bcF), the voltage across each would be:\n\n\\[ v_i = \\frac{1800 \\, \\mu C}{18 \\, \\mu F} = 100 \\, V \\]\n\nAnd since there are three capacitors, the total voltage would be:\n\n\\[ v_{total} = v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = 100 \\, V + 100 \\, V + 100 \\, V = 300 \\, V \\]\n\nWhich matches the battery voltage. So, everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, each capacitor stores 1800 \u03bcC of charge.\n\nBut again, looking at the options, D is 1800 \u03bcC, which seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because option D is the same as the total charge calculated for the equivalent capacitor. But in series, each capacitor holds the same charge, so it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the calculation of the equivalent capacitance.\n\nLet me double-check the equivalent capacitance for three capacitors in series, each of 18 \u03bcF:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{c_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nSo, \\( c_{eq} = 6 \\, \\mu F \\), which seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( q_{total} = c_{eq} \\times v = 6 \\, \\mu F \\times 300 \\, V = 1800 \\, \\mu C \\), and since in series, each capacitor holds the same charge, 1800 \u03bcC per capacitor.\n\nBut perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the charge on each capacitor is equal to the total charge. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the definition of capacitors in series. In a series configuration, the charge on each capacitor is indeed the same, but the voltages can be different, depending on their capacitances.\n\nHowever, in this case, all capacitors have the same capacitance, so the voltages will be equal, as calculated earlier.\n\nGiven that, each capacitor stores 1800 \u03bcC of charge.\n\nBut now, I'm looking back at the options, and 1800 \u03bcC is option D, but the other options are lower values, so maybe I made a mistake in calculating the equivalent capacitance or the total charge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the charge on each individual capacitor, not the total charge.\n\nWait, no, it's asking for the charge stored on each capacitor.\n\nGiven that, and based on the series configuration, each capacitor should hold the same charge, which is 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nBut maybe there's a conceptual error here.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I need to calculate the charge based on the voltage across each capacitor.\n\nWe know that in series, the voltage is divided among the capacitors. Given that all capacitors have the same capacitance, the voltage across each is the same, which is 100 V, as calculated earlier.\n\nThen, the charge on each capacitor can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ q = c \\times v = 18 \\, \\mu F \\times 100 \\, V = 1800 \\, \\mu C \\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 1800 \u03bcC.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other factor that I might have missed.\n\nFor example, perhaps the internal resistance of the battery or some other component affects the charge, but the problem doesn't mention any such factors, so we can assume ideal conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the capacitors are connected affects the charge distribution, but in a simple series connection, the charge on each capacitor is equal.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. 1800 \u03bcC.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
