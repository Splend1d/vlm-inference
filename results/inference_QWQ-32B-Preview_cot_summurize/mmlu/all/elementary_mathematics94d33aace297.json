                    "text": "So last week, Paul ate 2 cookies each day for 5 days. That means he ate 2 cookies multiplied by 5 days, right? So that's 2 times 5.\n\nThis week, he ate 2 cookies each day for 4 days. So that's 2 cookies multiplied by 4 days, which is 2 times 4.\n\nTo find the total number of cookies he ate in these two weeks, I need to add those two amounts together. So it should be (2 times 5) plus (2 times 4).\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 2x (5 + 4), which is 2 multiplied by the sum of 5 and 4. That would be 2 times 9, which is 18. But if I calculate (2 times 5) plus (2 times 4), that's 10 plus 8, which is also 18. So option B gives the same result.\n\nOption A is 2x (5x4), which is 2 times 20, which is 40. That's too much.\n\nOption C is (2x5) x (2x4), which is 10 times 8, which is 80. That's way too much.\n\nOption D is (2+5) x (2+4), which is 7 times 6, which is 42. That's also not right.\n\nSo, option B seems correct because 2x (5 + 4) is the same as 2x5 + 2x4, which is the distributive property of multiplication over addition.\n\nBut let me double-check. Last week: 2 cookies/day for 5 days = 10 cookies.\n\nThis week: 2 cookies/day for 4 days = 8 cookies.\n\nTotal: 10 + 8 = 18 cookies.\n\nOption B: 2x (5 + 4) = 2x9 = 18.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nOption A: 2x (5x4) = 2x20 = 40. That's not correct.\n\nOption C: (2x5) x (2x4) = 10x8 = 80. Not correct.\n\nOption D: (2+5) x (2+4) = 7x6 = 42. Not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is option B: 2x (5 + 4).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
