Now, mtDNA is a bit different from the regular DNA we inherit from both parents because mtDNA is passed down only from the mother to her children. This is because mitochondria, which contain this DNA, are present in the egg cell from the mother, but not in the sperm cell from the father.\n\nSo, in this scenario, we have an affected male and a normal female reproducing. Since mtDNA comes only from the mother, and the mother is normal, none of their children should inherit the mutated mtDNA from the affected male because he doesn't pass on mtDNA to his offspring.\n\nTherefore, none of the offspring should be affected by MERRF in this case.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. None of the offspring will be affected\n\nB. All males and no females will be affected\n\nC. Half of males and half of females will be affected\n\nD. One-fourth of the offspring will be affected\n\nThe correct answer should be A. None of the offspring will be affected, because the mother is normal and only she passes on the mtDNA to her children.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about it again. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally, meaning only from the mother. So, if the mother is normal, her children should also be normal, regardless of the father's condition.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
