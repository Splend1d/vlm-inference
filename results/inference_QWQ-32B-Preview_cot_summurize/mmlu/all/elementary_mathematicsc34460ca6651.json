                    "text": "To find the prime factorization of 48, we need to break it down into its prime factors and express it using exponents where possible. Let's go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is prime factorization? It's the process of finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.\n\nSo, let's start with 48.\n\nStep 1: Divide 48 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n48 \u00f7 2 = 24\n\nSo, 2 is a prime factor.\n\nStep 2: Now, take the result, which is 24, and divide it by 2 again.\n\n24 \u00f7 2 = 12\n\nSo, another 2 in the prime factors.\n\nStep 3: Take 12 and divide by 2.\n\n12 \u00f7 2 = 6\n\nAnother 2 in the prime factors.\n\nStep 4: Now, take 6 and divide by 2.\n\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n\nAnother 2 in the prime factors.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we're left with 3, which is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 48 are: 2, 2, 2, 2, and 3.\n\nNow, to express this using exponents, we count how many times each prime number appears.\n\n- The number 2 appears four times, so we write it as 2^4.\n\n- The number 3 appears once, so we write it as 3^1, but since any number to the power of 1 is itself, we can just write it as 3.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of 48 using exponents is 2^4 \u2022 3.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 4 \u2022 8\n\nB. 6 \u2022 8\n\nC. 2^3 \u2022 3^2\n\nD. 2^4 \u2022 3\n\nOption D matches our answer.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure.\n\nOption A: 4 \u2022 8\n\n4 is 2^2 and 8 is 2^3, so 4 \u2022 8 = 2^2 \u2022 2^3 = 2^(2+3) = 2^5 = 32, which is not 48.\n\nOption B: 6 \u2022 8\n\n6 is 2 \u2022 3 and 8 is 2^3, so 6 \u2022 8 = 2 \u2022 3 \u2022 2^3 = 2^4 \u2022 3 = 48.\n\nWait, this also equals 48, but it's not expressed in prime factors. Prime factorization should only include prime numbers raised to their respective exponents.\n\nOption C: 2^3 \u2022 3^2\n\n2^3 is 8 and 3^2 is 9, so 8 \u2022 9 = 72, which is not 48.\n\nOption D: 2^4 \u2022 3\n\n2^4 is 16 and 3 is 3, so 16 \u2022 3 = 48, which matches.\n\nHowever, option B also equals 48, but it's not in prime factorized form because 6 and 8 are not prime numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: 2^4 \u2022 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
