                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what kind of system a digital signature needs. The options are a private-key system, a shared-key system, a public-key system, or all of them. I think I remember something about public-key cryptography being used for digital signatures, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a digital signature is. A digital signature is a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document. It's like a handwritten signature, but for digital data, and it should ensure that the message comes from the claimed sender and hasn't been altered in transit.\n\nNow, thinking about key systems, there are mainly two types: symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric cryptography uses a pair of keys\u2014public and private.\n\nA private-key system sounds like symmetric cryptography, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. But for digital signatures, I think the signing process should be something that only the signer can do, so using a private key makes sense. But I'm not sure if a private-key system is the same as symmetric cryptography.\n\nA shared-key system also seems related to symmetric cryptography, where the sender and receiver share the same key. But again, for signatures, it's important that only the signer can create the signature, so maybe shared-key isn't the best fit.\n\nA public-key system is asymmetric cryptography, where there are public and private keys. The private key is used for signing, and the public key is used for verification. This seems to align well with the requirements of a digital signature, as only the signer has the private key to create the signature, and anyone can use the public key to verify it.\n\nWait, but the question says \"a digital signature needs a\" and lists these systems. Is it possible that digital signatures need all of them? Maybe there are scenarios where different systems are used, or perhaps the term is being used differently.\n\nLet me look up some basics of digital signatures. According to standard cryptographic practices, digital signatures typically use public-key cryptography. The signer uses their private key to sign the data, and the verifier uses the corresponding public key to verify the signature. This ensures that only the signer can create the signature, and anyone can verify it as long as they have the public key.\n\nSo, in this case, a public-key system seems to be the correct answer. But maybe there are other ways to do it.\n\nIs it possible to have digital signatures with a private-key system? If both the signer and the verifier share the same private key, could they use it for signing and verification? Maybe, but that seems insecure because if the key is shared, anyone who has it could potentially create signatures.\n\nSimilarly, a shared-key system would involve both parties sharing the same key, which again might not provide the necessary non-repudiation that public-key systems offer.\n\nSo, considering the standard practices and the importance of non-repudiation in digital signatures, a public-key system seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if all of them are used in some way. Perhaps in certain scenarios, multiple key systems are combined for signing. However, from what I know, most digital signature schemes rely primarily on public-key cryptography.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Public-key system.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
