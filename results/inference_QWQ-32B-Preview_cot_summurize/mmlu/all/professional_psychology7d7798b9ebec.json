The question is asking what's allowed regarding bartering.\n\nOption A says it's allowable only if it's not clinically contraindicated and the relationship isn't exploitative. That sounds pretty responsible. If bartering could harm the client or if the psychologist is taking advantage of the client, then it shouldn't happen.\n\nOption B says it's not allowable under any circumstance. But that seems too strict. Maybe there are situations where bartering could be okay.\n\nOption C says it's okay only if the dollar values are established in advance. That makes sense for keeping things fair and clear, but maybe it's not the only consideration.\n\nOption D says it's okay only if the psychologist thinks the client would be denied services otherwise. That seems a bit self-serving. The psychologist's needs shouldn't override the client's welfare.\n\nI think Option A is the best answer because it prioritizes the client's well-being and prevents exploitation. Bartering can be complex, and it's important to ensure that it doesn't compromise the therapeutic relationship or the client's treatment.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to consider. Ethically, psychologists need to consider potential boundaries and make sure that any arrangement is in the best interest of the client.\n\nOption C seems important too, because valuing the exchange appropriately can prevent disputes and ensure fairness. Maybe Option A and Option C are both important, but since I have to choose one, I'll go with Option A because it emphasizes the clinical appropriateness and non-exploitative nature of the relationship.\n\nOption D sounds too much like the psychologist is making an exception for their own convenience, which isn't ethical.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
