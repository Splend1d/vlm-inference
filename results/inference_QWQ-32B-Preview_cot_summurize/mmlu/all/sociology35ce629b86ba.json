Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Functionalism - I think this is about how different parts of society work together like parts of a machine to keep everything functioning properly. It seems like it would focus on maintaining order and stability.\n\nB. Interactionism - This sounds more like it deals with how people interact with each other on a personal level, maybe looking at symbols and meanings in communication. Not sure if this is about overall social order.\n\nC. Rational-choice theory - This seems to be about individuals making choices based on logic and what's best for them. It might explain why people behave certain ways, but I'm not sure if it directly addresses how society maintains order.\n\nD. Conflict theory - This one is probably about struggles between different groups in society, like the rich and the poor, or different ethnic groups. It seems more focused on tension and change rather than stability.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is A, Functionalism, because it's about how society's parts work together to maintain order. But I should double-check to make sure.\n\nLet me recall what I've learned about these theories. Functionalism looks at society as a system with interconnected parts that work together to maintain social stability and equilibrium. Each institution, like family, education, religion, and government, has a function to perform that contributes to the overall functioning of society.\n\nInteractionism, on the other hand, is more micro-level, focusing on face-to-face interactions and how people make sense of their social world through communication and symbolism.\n\nRational-choice theory is often used in sociology and economics to explain how individuals make decisions based on maximizing benefits and minimizing costs.\n\nConflict theory, associated with Marx, sees society as being based on inequalities and struggles between different groups vying for resources and power.\n\nSo, again, Functionalism seems to be the one that directly addresses how society manages to carry out activities necessary for maintaining order and stability.\n\nMaybe I should consider if any of the other theories also contribute to social order. For example, Conflict theory could argue that stability comes from resolving conflicts, but that seems more indirect compared to Functionalism's direct focus on social order.\n\nInteractionism might be relevant in maintaining order through social norms and expectations in interactions, but again, it's more micro-level compared to Functionalism's macro-level view.\n\nRational-choice theory could suggest that individuals choose to follow rules because it's in their best interest, which contributes to order, but it's not primarily a social theory about order.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is A, Functionalism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
