                    "text": "So I've got this passage from John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and I need to infer what he believes about when a government loses its legitimacy. The options are:\n\nA. when it is weak and can be overthrown\n\nB. when the people wish to change governors\n\nC. when it becomes corrupt\n\nD. when it tries to exercise absolute power\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Locke is saying here. He talks about the power in the hands of the magistrate, which is the government, and says that its purpose is to preserve the lives, liberties, and possessions of the members of society. He emphasizes that this power is not absolute but is meant to make laws and impose penalties that contribute to the preservation of the whole society, removing only those parts that are corrupt and threaten the rest.\n\nLocke argues that this power originates from a compact or agreement among the people who make up the community. So, the government's authority is based on the consent of the governed.\n\nThen, he states that whenever the legislative body\u2014presumably the law-making part of the government\u2014transgresses the fundamental rules of society by seeking absolute power over people's lives, liberties, and estates, either through ambition, fear, folly, or corruption, they breach the trust that was placed in them. By doing so, they forfeit the power that was given to them for entirely different purposes.\n\nSo, Locke is saying that if the government starts to use its power to gain absolute control over people's lives, liberties, and properties, it is acting against the very reason for which it was established. Therefore, it loses its legitimacy.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. when it is weak and can be overthrown\u2014Locke doesn't say that weakness causes a loss of legitimacy. In fact, he seems more concerned with governments that become too powerful and tyrannical.\n\nB. when the people wish to change governors\u2014this seems more like a normal part of politics, perhaps through elections, but Locke doesn't specify that as a reason for losing legitimacy.\n\nC. when it becomes corrupt\u2014this is mentioned by Locke as one of the motivations for the legislative to transgress the fundamental rules, but it's part of a larger issue.\n\nD. when it tries to exercise absolute power\u2014this aligns closely with Locke's statement about the legislative transgressing the fundamental rules by seeking absolute power over lives, liberties, and estates.\n\nSo, while corruption is a factor, it's specifically in the context of the government seeking absolute power that Locke says the government forfeits its authority.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D. it tries to exercise absolute power.\n\nBut let's double-check. Option C, \"when it becomes corrupt,\" is mentioned by Locke as one of the ways the legislative might transgress, but it's not the sole criterion for losing legitimacy. It's the act of seeking absolute power that is the key transgression.\n\nOption A about weakness isn't mentioned at all in the passage as a reason for loss of legitimacy.\n\nOption B about people wishing to change governors seems like a normal political desire and isn't presented as a basis for illegitimacy.\n\nSo, yes, D seems to be the most accurate inference from the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
