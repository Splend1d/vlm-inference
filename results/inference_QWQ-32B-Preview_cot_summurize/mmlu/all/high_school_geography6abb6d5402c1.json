Reference map: I think this is like a regular map that shows geographical features, countries, cities, that sort of thing. It's more about general locations.\n\nB. Topographic map: This one shows elevation and terrain, like hills and valleys. It's useful for hiking or understanding the physical landscape, but I'm not sure if it would show where coal is found.\n\nC. Thematic map: This sounds interesting. Thematic maps focus on specific themes or topics. So, if I need information on the distribution of a particular resource like coal, this might be the way to go.\n\nD. Location map: I'm not entirely sure about this one. It might be similar to a reference map, focusing on specific locations.\n\nGiven that I need to find where coal is distributed globally, I think a thematic map would be the most appropriate choice because it can specifically highlight the areas where coal is found, perhaps even showing the abundance or quality of the coal deposits.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Thematic map.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
