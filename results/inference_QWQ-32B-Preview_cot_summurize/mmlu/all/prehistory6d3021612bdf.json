                    "text": "Let's see. Clovis points are these ancient stone tools that were made by early people in North America. They're named after Clovis, New Mexico, where they were first found. So, they're typically associated with the continental United States.\n\nBut the question is asking where Clovis points are NOT found. Let's think about the options:\n\nA. Alaska. Now, Alaska is part of the United States, but it's up in the Arctic. I'm not sure if Clovis points have been found there. Maybe they haven't because the climate was different back then.\n\nB. Mexico. Mexico is right below the United States, and there was probably a lot of movement between what's now the U.S. and Mexico thousands of years ago. So, it's possible that Clovis points are found there.\n\nC. Canada. Canada is above the United States, and again, there was likely movement across that border. So, maybe Clovis points are found in Canada.\n\nD. the continental United States. Well, that's where they were first found, so they should be found there.\n\nHmm. The question is a bit tricky because Clovis points are associated with the continental United States, but maybe they're not found in all parts of it.\n\nWait a minute. The Clovis culture is thought to have existed around 13,000 to 12,800 years ago, mainly in the continental United States. But over time, similar artifacts have been found in other places.\n\nLet me check what I remember about Clovis points in Mexico. I think there are some sites in northern Mexico where Clovis points have been found. So, maybe B is not the correct answer.\n\nCanada: I recall that there are some sites in Canada with tools similar to Clovis points, although perhaps not exactly the same. So, maybe C is not the right answer either.\n\nAlaska: Given its location and the climate during the Clovis period, it's possible that Clovis people didn't make it that far north, or perhaps the environment wasn't suitable for the same kind of tools. So, maybe A is the correct answer.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the time period and the migration patterns of early people in the Americas.\n\nThe Clovis culture is thought to be one of the first widespread cultures in the Americas, coming across the Bering Land Bridge from Asia. So, if they were moving south from Alaska through Canada into the continental United States, it's possible that their tools are found along that path.\n\nBut the question is asking where Clovis points are NOT found.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Clovis points are only found in the continental United States and not in Alaska, Canada, or Mexico.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because I think they have been found in those places.\n\nWait, maybe Clovis points are specifically associated with the continental United States, and not found in Alaska, Canada, or Mexico.\n\nBut that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nI need to recall the geographical range of Clovis points.\n\nFrom what I remember, Clovis points have been found throughout the continental United States, and there are some sites in northern Mexico and maybe a few in southern Canada.\n\nBut Alaska is a different story. The climate and environment were different during the Clovis period, and perhaps the tools adapted to that environment were different.\n\nSo, perhaps Clovis points are not found in Alaska.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are found in Alaska, and my assumption is wrong.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me consider the time frames. Clovis culture is around 13,000-12,800 years ago. Alaska, during that time, was connected to Asia via the Bering Land Bridge, but it was also a glacial area, which might not have been conducive to the same kind of tool culture.\n\nMoreover, perhaps the Clovis culture developed after the initial migration into Alaska, so the people who stayed in Alaska might have had different tool technologies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Clovis points have been found in Alaska, and my assumption is incorrect.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nIf Clovis points are found in the continental United States, Mexico, and Canada, then perhaps the answer is A, Alaska.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Clovis points are found in all these places, and the answer is none of the above, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is D, the continental United States, because Clovis points are found elsewhere but not in the continental United States. But that can't be right because that's where they were first discovered.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that Clovis points are found in the continental United States, Mexico, and Canada, but not in Alaska.\n\nThat would make A, Alaska, the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Clovis points are found in all these places, and the answer is none of the above, but since that's not an option, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is D, the continental United States, because Clovis points are not found there, but that doesn't make sense because that's where they were first found.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to recall specific examples.\n\nI know that Clovis points have been found in many states in the continental United States, like New Mexico, Texas, Florida, and others.\n\nIn Mexico, there are sites like Chiapa in Mexico where Clovis points have been found.\n\nIn Canada, there are sites in Ontario and other provinces with tools similar to Clovis points.\n\nBut in Alaska, I don't recall any Clovis points being found.\n\nPerhaps the environment wasn't suitable for the preservation of such artifacts, or maybe the Clovis culture didn't extend that far north.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the people who migrated to Alaska had already developed different tool technologies before reaching there.\n\nGiven that, perhaps Clovis points are not found in Alaska.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, Alaska.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nMaybe I should consider that Clovis points are found in all the other options, but not in Alaska.\n\nThat would make A the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Clovis points are not found in Canada, but I think that's incorrect because I recall sites in Canada with Clovis-like tools.\n\nSimilarly, in Mexico, there are sites with Clovis points.\n\nSo, perhaps Alaska is the only place where they're not found among the options given.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with A, Alaska.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
