                    "text": "This question is about identifying the type of contract based on the specification of a delivery point. Let's consider each option to understand which one fits best.\n\nOption A: F.A.S. Contract\n\nF.A.S. stands for \"Free Alongside Ship.\" In this type of contract, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods alongside the buyer's ship, usually at the named port of shipment. The risk passes to the buyer when the goods are placed alongside the ship. So, in this case, the delivery point is specified at the port of shipment.\n\nOption B: Destination Contract\n\nA destination contract is one where the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to a specific destination, such as a port or terminal at the buyer's location. The seller bears the risk and cost of transportation until the goods reach the destination.\n\nOption C: Shipment Contract\n\nA shipment contract is one where the seller's obligation is to arrange for the shipment of goods to the buyer, but the risk passes to the buyer once the goods are loaded onto the carrier. The buyer is responsible for arranging insurance and bearing the risk during transit.\n\nOption D: F.O.B. Contract\n\nF.O.B. stands for \"Free On Board.\" There are different types of F.O.B. terms, but generally, F.O.B. specifies the point at which the risk and responsibility for the goods pass from the seller to the buyer. For example, F.O.B. shipping point means the risk passes when the goods are loaded onto the carrier at the shipping point, while F.O.B. destination means the risk passes when the goods reach the destination.\n\nGiven that the question mentions \"a contract that specifies a delivery point,\" we need to determine which of these contracts specifically defines a delivery point.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- F.A.S. Contract: Specifies delivery alongside the ship at the port of shipment.\n\n- Destination Contract: Specifies delivery at a particular destination.\n\n- Shipment Contract: Focuses on the shipment arrangement but may not specify a particular delivery point in the same way.\n\n- F.O.B. Contract: Can specify either the shipping point or the destination as the delivery point.\n\nConsidering this, both F.A.S., destination, and F.O.B. contracts specify delivery points, but the question seems to be asking for a general category.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. F.A.S. Contract: This is a specific Incoterm.\n\nB. Destination contract: This is a type of sales contract where delivery is made at the destination.\n\nC. Shipment contract: This is another type where delivery is made when the goods are shipped.\n\nD. F.O.B. Contract: Another Incoterm.\n\nGiven that F.A.S. and F.O.B. are specific Incoterms related to international trade, while destination and shipment contracts are broader categories, the question might be aiming to distinguish between these broader categories.\n\nIn international sales, contracts are often classified into shipment contracts and destination contracts based on when the risk passes and where the delivery is considered complete.\n\n- In a shipment contract, the seller's obligation is to arrange for the shipment, and the risk passes when the goods are shipped.\n\n- In a destination contract, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to a specific location, and the risk passes upon arrival.\n\nGiven that the question mentions \"specifies a delivery point,\" it seems to be referring to a contract where the delivery location is specified, which aligns more with a destination contract.\n\nHowever, F.A.S. and F.O.B. are specific terms that specify delivery points as well.\n\nConsidering that F.A.S. specifies delivery alongside the ship, and F.O.B. can specify either shipping point or destination, the most general answer that covers specifying a delivery point would be a destination contract.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Destination contract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
