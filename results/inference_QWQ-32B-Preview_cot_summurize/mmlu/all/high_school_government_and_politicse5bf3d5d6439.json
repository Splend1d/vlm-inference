                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about why congressional committees might not always reflect public opinion. So, the question is: \"The opinions of congressional committees often fail to accurately mirror public opinion because...\" and then it gives four options. I need to pick the one that best explains why this happens.\n\nOption A says: \"the membership of committees often overrepresents constituencies with the greatest stake in the committee's business.\" Hmm, that makes sense. Committees are usually made up of members who have a particular interest or expertise in that area. For example, the Agriculture Committee would have members from districts with a lot of farming. So, these members might have stronger opinions or be more influenced by the interests of their constituents who are directly involved in agriculture. That could mean they don't represent the broader public opinion, which might have different priorities.\n\nOption B says: \"most committees are too small to include representatives of all popular opinions.\" That's also a valid point. Committees are smaller groups within the larger Congress, so they might not have members from all regions or with all diverse viewpoints. This could lead to a lack of representation of various public opinions. But I wonder if this is the main reason.\n\nOption C states: \"the minority party controls nearly half of all committees.\" Wait, is that accurate? In the U.S. Congress, committee chairs are typically from the majority party, especially in the House of Representatives. So, I think this option might be incorrect. Maybe I need to double-check that.\n\nOption D says: \"committee members often lose track of their constituents' priorities because of their frequent contact with special-interest lobbyists.\" This is an interesting point. Lobbyists can have a lot of influence on lawmakers, and if committee members are frequently interacting with them, they might become more aligned with the lobbyists' views rather than their constituents'. This could indeed cause a disconnect between committee opinions and public opinion.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these options. Option A suggests that committees overrepresent certain constituencies, which might not reflect the general public. Option B says committees are too small to include all viewpoints. Option C seems factually incorrect, as minority parties don't control nearly half of all committees. Option D suggests that influence from lobbyists can skew committee members' opinions away from their constituents.\n\nBetween A and D, both seem plausible, but I think A might be a stronger answer because it directly addresses the composition of the committee and how that composition can lead to a misrepresentation of public opinion. Option D, while valid, might be more about influence rather than the inherent structure of the committee.\n\nHowever, Option B also has merit. If committees are small and can't include representatives from all regions or with all viewpoints, that could certainly lead to a lack of diversity in opinions, not matching the broader public.\n\nMaybe the best answer is a combination of A and B: committees are small and overrepresent certain constituencies, leading to a mismatch with public opinion. But since I have to choose one, I'll go with Option A because it specifically points out the overrepresentation issue, which can be a significant factor.\n\nLet me just consider Option C again. If the minority party controls nearly half of all committees, that might actually lead to a more balanced representation. But in reality, committee chairs are usually from the majority party, so this option seems incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I think Option A is the most accurate answer: \"the membership of committees often overrepresents constituencies with the greatest stake in the committee's business,\" which can cause congressional committees' opinions to not accurately mirror public opinion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
