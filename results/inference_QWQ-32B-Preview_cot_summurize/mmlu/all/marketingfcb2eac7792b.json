                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"These store goods for moderate to long periods.\" And then it gives four options: A. Storage warehouses; B. Distribution centres; C. Haulage transport; D. Electronic data interchange.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which of these options are used for storing goods for moderate to long periods. Let's look at each one individually.\n\nFirst, A. Storage warehouses. What are warehouses used for? Well, warehouses are large buildings where goods are stored before they are sold or distributed. So, they are definitely used for storing goods, and often for moderate to long periods, especially for items that don't sell quickly or are seasonal.\n\nNext, B. Distribution centres. Distribution centres are places where goods are received, sorted, and shipped out to their final destinations, like retail stores or directly to customers. While they do store goods temporarily, the stay is usually short-term because the focus is on moving the goods quickly to meet demand. So, compared to warehouses, distribution centres aren't typically used for long-term storage.\n\nOption C. Haulage transport. Haulage refers to the transportation of goods, usually in large vehicles like trucks. Transportation is about moving goods from one place to another, not storing them. So, this doesn't fit the description of storing goods for moderate to long periods.\n\nLastly, D. Electronic data interchange, or EDI. EDI is a way of exchanging business documents, like invoices and purchase orders, electronically between organizations. It's about the transfer of data, not the physical storage of goods. So, this option isn't relevant to storing goods.\n\nBased on this, it seems that storage warehouses are the primary option for storing goods for moderate to long periods. Distribution centres handle shorter-term storage, haulage is about transportation, and EDI is about data exchange.\n\nBut wait, maybe distribution centres sometimes do store goods for longer periods. For example, if there's a delay in distribution, goods might stay longer in the centre. However, their main function is not long-term storage; it's more about facilitating the flow of goods efficiently.\n\nAlso, some warehouses might be designed for short-term storage, but generally, when we think of storage for moderate to long periods, warehouses come to mind.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is A. Storage warehouses.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any other options could also be used for storing goods for moderate to long periods.\n\nHaulage transport: While goods are in transit, they are on the vehicles, but the primary purpose is movement, not storage. Sometimes, due to delays, goods might spend more time on transport, but that's not the intended use.\n\nElectronic data interchange: Again, this is about data, not physical storage of goods.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that storage warehouses are the main option for storing goods for moderate to long periods among the given choices.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
