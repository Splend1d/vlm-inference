                    "text": "This question is about the marital and spousal privileges in evidence law, particularly in the context of a divorce and criminal charges. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what the marital and spousal privileges are:\n\n1. **Marital Privilege**: This generally allows a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse in criminal proceedings where one is accused of a crime against the other or a crime against a child of either spouse. It's designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the marital relationship.\n\n2. **Spousal Privilege**: This is sometimes used interchangeably with marital privilege, but in some jurisdictions, it refers specifically to the privilege of not being compelled to testify about communications made during the marriage.\n\nHowever, the question mentions that the jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. So, we need to consider both.\n\nNow, let's look at the facts:\n\n- The husband and wife were married for 10 years.\n\n- The wife obtained a divorce after learning about the husband's extramarital affair.\n\n- After the divorce, the husband is charged with embezzlement.\n\n- The wife is called to testify about statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding the crime.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n- The statements were made during the marriage.\n\n- The wife is testifying after the divorce.\n\n- The husband is objecting to her testimony.\n\nWe need to determine whether her testimony is admissible under these privileges.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n**A. Admissible, under both the marital and spousal privileges.**\n\nThis seems unlikely because privileges are generally designed to protect communications and prevent testimony that would breach confidentiality. If both privileges apply, they would likely prevent the wife from testifying.\n\n**B. Admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.**\n\nThis is confusing because privileges typically prevent testimony, not make it admissible. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\n**C. Admissible, under the marital privilege but not admitted under the spousal privilege.**\n\nAgain, privileges usually prevent testimony, so this seems contradictory.\n\n**D. Inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.**\n\nThis seems more plausible, as privileges would protect the husband from his wife testifying about their private communications.\n\nHowever, we need to dig deeper.\n\nFirst, let's consider the marital communications privilege. This privilege protects confidential communications between spouses during the marriage. It generally prevents either spouse from testifying about these communications without the consent of the other spouse.\n\nIn this case, the wife is being asked to testify about statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding the embezzlement. These would likely be considered confidential communications between spouses.\n\nNow, the question is whether this privilege continues to apply after the divorce.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, the marital communications privilege survives the divorce. This means that even after the marriage ends, spouses cannot testify about confidential communications made during the marriage.\n\nTherefore, under the marital communications privilege, the wife's testimony should be inadmissible.\n\nNext, let's consider the spousal privilege.\n\nThe spousal privilege can refer to different things, but often it includes the privilege against adverse testimony. This means that a spouse cannot be compelled to testify against the other spouse in criminal proceedings.\n\nHowever, in this case, the wife is voluntarily testifying, so perhaps this privilege doesn't directly apply.\n\nBut more importantly, the husband's attorney is objecting to her testimony, so the spousal privilege (if it applies) would be protecting the husband from her testimony.\n\nNow, regarding the spousal privilege, some jurisdictions distinguish between the privilege belonging to the witness spouse and the privilege belonging to the defendant spouse.\n\n- **Witness Spouse's Privilege**: The witness spouse has a privilege to refuse to testify about certain matters.\n\n- **Defendant Spouse's Privilege**: The defendant spouse has a privilege to prevent the witness spouse from testifying about certain matters.\n\nIn this case, since the husband is the defendant and is objecting to his ex-wife's testimony, it's the defendant spouse's privilege that's at play.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, the spousal privilege is waived by divorce, especially if the divorce is final.\n\nGiven that the wife has already obtained a divorce, it's possible that the spousal privileges have been waived.\n\nHowever, the marital communications privilege may still apply, protecting the confidentiality of communications during the marriage.\n\nSo, even after divorce, the wife cannot testify about confidential communications made during the marriage.\n\nTherefore, the husband's attorney can object to her testimony based on the marital communications privilege.\n\nThus, the correct answer should be:\n\n**D. Inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.**\n\nBut wait, the question is a bit tricky because it asks whether the wife's testimony will be admissible \"under both the marital and spousal privileges\" or \"under one but not the other,\" etc.\n\nGiven that privileges typically make evidence inadmissible, options A, B, and C suggest that the testimony is admissible under certain privileges, which seems counterintuitive.\n\nOption D says \"inadmissible under either the marital or spousal privileges,\" which aligns with the understanding that privileges would prevent the testimony.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's consider if there are any exceptions or specific rules that might make the testimony admissible.\n\nOne possible exception is if the crime committed by the husband was against the wife or against a child of the marriage, but in this case, the embezzlement appears to be against his employer, not against the wife or a child.\n\nAnother exception might be if the statements were not confidential or were made in the presence of others, but the question states that they were communications during the marriage, implying confidentiality.\n\nAdditionally, since they are ex-spouses, there might be jurisdiction-specific rules about the survivability of these privileges post-divorce.\n\nBut given that the jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges, and considering general principles, it's likely that the marital communications privilege survives the divorce and prevents the wife from testifying about the husband's statements.\n\nTherefore, the husband's attorney can successfully object to her testimony based on the marital communications privilege, making the testimony inadmissible.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n**D. inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.**\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect:\n\n**A. Admissible, under both the marital and spousal privileges.**\n\nThis can't be right because privileges are designed to make evidence inadmissible, not admissible.\n\n**B. Admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.**\n\nThis is confusing because spousal privilege typically prevents testimony, not makes it admissible.\n\n**C. Admissible, under the marital privilege but not admitted under the spousal privilege.**\n\nAgain, marital privilege usually prevents testimony about confidential communications.\n\nTherefore, D is the most logical choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges."
