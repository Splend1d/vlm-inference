                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question. It's asking about a subfield of anthropology that studies \"other people's garbage.\" So, first off, I need to recall what the different subfields of anthropology are.\n\nI know that anthropology is divided into several subfields, including cultural anthropology, physical or biological anthropology, archaeology, and linguistic anthropology. Let me see which one of these might be related to studying garbage.\n\nOption A is primatology, which is the study of primates, like monkeys and apes. That doesn't seem related to garbage.\n\nOption B is archaeology, which is the study of human history and prehistory through the excavation of sites and the analysis of artifacts. Now,\u8003\u53e4\u5b66\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u6316\u6398\u53e4\u4ee3\u9057\u5740\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u201c\u5783\u573e\u201d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\u8ba9\u6211\u6709\u70b9\u56f0\u60d1\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u7814\u7a76\u53e4\u4ee3\u7684\u5783\u573e\u5806\u6765\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\nOption C is paleoanthropology, which is a branch of anthropology that studies the fossil record of human ancestors. Again, this seems more related to bones and fossils, not garbage.\n\nOption D is linguistics, which is the study of language. While important in anthropology, it doesn't directly relate to studying garbage.\n\nSo, between these options, archaeology seems the most plausible answer. I recall that there is a specific type of archaeology called \"garbage anthropology\" or \"urban archaeology\" where researchers study modern trash to understand contemporary lifestyles and consumer behavior. But I'm not entirely sure if that's a recognized subfield.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the question is referring to the idea that archaeologists sometimes study the waste products of past cultures to gain insights into their daily lives. For example, analyzing refuse dumps can reveal information about diet, tool use, and social structures.\n\nIn that case, archaeology would be the correct answer. But I'm a bit unsure because I don't recall the term \"studying other people's garbage\" being specifically associated with one subfield.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that \"other people's garbage\" could refer to cultural relativism, a key concept in cultural anthropology, where researchers seek to understand other cultures on their own terms rather than judging them based on their own culture's standards. But that doesn't directly relate to studying garbage.\n\nWait a minute, there is a field called \"garbology.\" I think I've heard of it before. Garbology is the study of modern trash to understand human behavior and consumer patterns. It's often associated with archaeology because the methods are similar to those used in traditional archaeology, but applied to contemporary contexts.\n\nIf that's the case, then archaeology would be the correct answer, as garbology is a subset of archaeological methods applied to modern trash.\n\nLet me double-check. Is garbology considered a part of archaeology? From what I remember, yes, it is. Archaeologists use the same techniques to study both ancient and modern trash to understand human behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the subfield that studies \"other people's garbage\" is archaeology.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
