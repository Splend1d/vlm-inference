                    "text": "So I've got this law school exam question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nSo, there's a plaintiff who was driving and stopped at a red light, and then there's a defendant who didn't see the red light, crashed into her car, pushed her into a tree. The plaintiff felt fine physically right after, but was emotionally upset seeing her car damaged. The next day she gets an estimate for $1,950 to repair her car, consults an attorney, and then that evening develops sudden back pains. Then, two years after the accident, one day before trial, she takes a photograph of the accident scene, and the question is about the admissibility of that photograph at trial.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Inadmissible if the defendant objects, because the photograph is non-verbal hearsay.\n\nB. Inadmissible if the defendant objects, because the photograph was taken two years after the accident.\n\nC. Admissible if the plaintiff identifies the photograph at trial.\n\nD. Admissible if the photograph correctly and accurately portrays the accident scene.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But here, it's a photograph, which is a non-verbal item. So, is a photograph considered hearsay? I think photographs can be considered a type of hearsay if they're being offered for the truth of what they depict, but often they're treated differently because they're considered real evidence, not hearsay.\n\nSo, option A says it's inadmissible if the defendant objects, because it's non-verbal hearsay. I'm not sure about that. Maybe photographs can be hearsay, but I think they're usually admissible as real evidence unless there's some specific problem with them.\n\nOption B says it's inadmissible because it was taken two years after the accident. Well, two years is a long time, and the scene might have changed. So, maybe the timing affects its admissibility.\n\nOption C says it's admissible if the plaintiff identifies the photograph at trial. Identification might be part of establishing foundation, but is that enough to make it admissible?\n\nOption D says it's admissible if it correctly and accurately portrays the accident scene. That seems important\u2014accuracy is key for any evidence.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is the purpose of introducing this photograph? Is it to show what the scene looked like at the time of the accident, or is it for some other reason?\n\nIf it's to recreate the scene as it was at the time of the accident, then taking it two years later might be a problem because the scene could have changed significantly over that time.\n\nOn the other hand, if the photograph is being used for some other purpose, maybe to show something else, it might be admissible.\n\nBut in personal injury cases, especially, recreations of the scene are sometimes used to help the jury understand what happened.\n\nHowever, if it's taken two years later, there might be issues with its accuracy in representing the scene at the time of the accident.\n\nAlso, maybe the plaintiff is trying to use it to show where the accident happened, and that hasn't changed over two years.\n\nBut still, it's possible that the scene has changed.\n\nIn terms of hearsay, as I thought earlier, photographs can be considered hearsay if they're being offered for the truth of what they depict, but they're often admitted as real evidence.\n\nMaybe the better way to look at this is through the rules of evidence, specifically the rules about photographs and their admissibility.\n\nI recall that for a photograph to be admitted, it needs to be relevant and have a proper foundation laid, showing that it accurately represents what it purports to represent.\n\nSo, in this case, the plaintiff would need to show that the photograph accurately depicts the accident scene as it was at the time of the accident.\n\nBut since it was taken two years later, that could be problematic.\n\nPerhaps the plaintiff could testify that, to the best of her knowledge, the scene hasn't changed in two years, but that might not be sufficient, especially if there's any indication that changes have occurred.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are records or other evidence showing that the scene remains unchanged.\n\nBut without that, relying solely on the plaintiff's assertion might not be enough.\n\nSo, option D says it's admissible if it correctly and accurately portrays the accident scene. That seems like it's getting at this issue.\n\nBut how does one determine that it correctly and accurately portrays the scene, especially two years later?\n\nMaybe expert testimony or other evidence could establish that.\n\nBut in any case, it seems like there would need to be a solid foundation laid to show that the photograph accurately represents the scene as it was at the time of the accident.\n\nOption C says it's admissible if the plaintiff identifies the photograph at trial.\n\nIdentification is part of establishing foundation, but just identifying it doesn't necessarily establish that it accurately portrays the scene two years later.\n\nSo, maybe that's not sufficient.\n\nOption A suggests it's non-verbal hearsay, which might not be the most accurate characterization, but as I thought earlier, photographs can sometimes be considered hearsay.\n\nHowever, they're often admitted as real evidence, so maybe that's not the primary issue here.\n\nOption B says it's inadmissible because it was taken two years after the accident, which gets at the heart of the problem\u2014whether the photograph accurately reflects the scene at the time of the accident.\n\nGiven that, I think the most important factor is whether the photograph accurately portrays the scene as it was when the accident occurred.\n\nTherefore, option D seems like the best answer.\n\nBut let's consider if there are any other issues.\n\nFor example, is there a rule against introducing photographs taken too long after the fact?\n\nI don't recall a specific time limit, but certainly, the passage of time could affect the photograph's accuracy in representing the scene.\n\nAlso, maybe the opposing party could argue that the photograph was staged or altered, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the photograph could be used for identification purposes, showing where the accident took place, even if details have changed.\n\nBut again, that would require establishing that the relevant features haven't changed.\n\nIn summary, I think the key is whether the photograph accurately portrays the accident scene, and given that it was taken two years later, there needs to be sufficient evidence to support that it still accurately represents the scene as it was at the time of the accident.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
