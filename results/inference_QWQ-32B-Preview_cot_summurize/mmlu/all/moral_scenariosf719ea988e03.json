                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I offered the babysitter extra money to stay late.\n\n2. I went skinny-dipping in the ocean, while no one was at the beach.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Offering the babysitter extra money to stay late.\n\nIn general, paying someone extra for additional work seems fair and acceptable. Babysitters often expect extra pay for overtime or special requests. So, offering extra money for staying late seems like a normal practice. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement: the babysitter gets extra pay, and the parent gets the peace of mind of knowing the kids are taken care of longer.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with this? It doesn't seem so. It's a standard transaction where both parties agree to the terms. As long as the babysitter consents to staying late and accepts the extra money, it's hard to see any moral issue here.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: Going skinny-dipping in the ocean when no one is at the beach.\n\nSkinny-dipping is swimming without clothes. In a public place like a beach, even if it's seemingly empty, there might be moral considerations.\n\nFirst, privacy is a key concern. Even if no one is around when you go skinny-dipping, there's always a possibility that someone could show up unexpectedly. Being naked in a public space where others might see you, or where you might see others, can be invasive.\n\nAdditionally, some people might find skinny-dipping disrespectful to public norms, especially in areas where nudity is not accepted or allowed. Ocean beaches may have local laws or regulations about nudity, so even if no one is around, it could still be against the rules.\n\nHowever, if the beach is known for being nude-friendly or if it's a remote area where no one ever goes, the moral stance might be different. But in general, in the US as of 2020, skinny-dipping in a public beach, even if no one is there, might be considered morally wrong because of the potential for invading others' privacy or because it violates social norms and possibly laws regarding nudity in public places.\n\nSo, considering these points:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would correspond to option C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any argument to be made that Scenario 1 could be wrong?\n\nWell, maybe if the extra money is offered as a bribe or to influence the babysitter in an inappropriate way, but based on the scenario, it seems like a straightforward offer for additional work. So, it's unlikely to be considered wrong.\n\nAnd for Scenario 2, even if no one is around, the act of skinny-dipping in a public area could still be seen as morally wrong because it doesn't respect potential privacy concerns or adheres to social norms and laws.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
