                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these phrases specifically refers to a crisis, not just an issue. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"A gap between corporate and stakeholder expectations.\" Hmm, that sounds like a problem or a challenge that a company might face. It could lead to issues in relationships or even to a crisis if it's not handled properly. But is it specifically a crisis? Maybe not necessarily. It's more of an ongoing issue that needs management.\n\nOption B says, \"When an organization's trading is interrupted.\" Okay, trading interruption\u2014that sounds serious. If a company can't trade, that could be a big problem, especially for businesses that rely on continuous operations. This could be due to various reasons like technical glitches, natural disasters, or other emergencies. This seems more like a crisis because it's a sudden disruption of normal operations.\n\nOption C says, \"Can be avoided with constant monitoring and relationship building.\" This seems like a general statement about preventing problems. It doesn't specifically refer to a crisis or an issue; it's more about proactive measures to avoid problems in general. So, this doesn't directly answer the question.\n\nOption D says, \"It happens suddenly.\" Now, crises are often characterized by their suddenness and the need for immediate attention. Issues, on the other hand, can be more gradual and manageable over time. So, this phrase does point towards something that is abrupt and requires urgent response, which is a characteristic of a crisis.\n\nBetween options B and D, both seem relevant to crises. Option B describes a specific situation that could be a crisis, while option D describes a general characteristic of crises. The question asks for the phrase that refers specifically to a crisis, rather than an issue.\n\nI think option B is more specific because it describes a particular event\u2014\"trading is interrupted\"\u2014which is a concrete example of a crisis. Option D is more general and could apply to various situations that happen suddenly, some of which might not be crises.\n\nSo, I believe the answer is B. When an organization's trading is interrupted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
