                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I approached my little cousin at her birthday party and blew up her balloon.\n\n2. I didn't go to school because I had a cold.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: blowing up a balloon at a birthday party. Birthday parties are supposed to be fun, and balloons are usually a part of that fun. So, blowing up a balloon for a cousin's birthday party seems like a nice thing to do. It's probably helping set the mood and making the cousin happy. I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: not going to school because of a cold. Well, if someone has a cold, it's reasonable to stay home to rest and also to prevent spreading the cold to others. Schools often encourage students to stay home when they're sick. So, not going to school because of a cold seems responsible and not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario seems to involve anything morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, maybe \"blew up her balloon\" means something else? Like, maybe it means intentionally popping the balloon, which could be upsetting for a little cousin at her birthday party. If that's the case, then it would be morally wrong because it's causing unnecessary distress to someone, especially a young family member on her special day.\n\nWait, \"blew up her balloon\" could mean inflating the balloon with air, making it bigger, which is typically what you do to balloons at a birthday party. Or, it could be interpreted as causing the balloon to explode.\n\nI think in common language, \"blew up her balloon\" probably means inflating it. If it meant popping it, it would likely be phrased differently, like \"popped her balloon\" or \"blew up her balloon accidentally.\"\n\nGiven that, Scenario 1 is probably about inflating the balloon, which is a positive action.\n\nScenario 2 is about staying home from school due to illness, which is acceptable and responsible.\n\nTherefore, neither action is morally wrong, and the answer is D.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any other interpretation.\n\nPerhaps in Scenario 1, blowing up the balloon could be seen as interfering with the cousin's property without permission, but at a birthday party, it's expected that relatives and guests would help set things up, including inflating balloons. So, it's probably okay.\n\nIn Scenario 2, not going to school because of a cold is fine, as long as it's actually due to being sick and not just skipping school without a valid reason.\n\nSince the scenario specifies that the person had a cold, it's acceptable to stay home.\n\nTherefore, neither action is morally wrong, and D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
