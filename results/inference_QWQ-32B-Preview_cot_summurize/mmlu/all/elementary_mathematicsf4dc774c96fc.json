                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: a gas station sold 300.5849 gallons of gas in a day, and I need to round that to the nearest hundredth. The options are A. 300, B. 300.58, C. 300.585, and D. 300.59. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what it means to round to the nearest hundredth. The hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal point. So in the number 300.5849, the digit in the hundredth place is 8. To round to the nearest hundredth, I need to look at the digit immediately following the hundredth place, which is the thousandth place. In this case, that's 4.\n\nNow, the rule for rounding is that if the digit in the thousandth place is 5 or greater, I round up the hundredth place by one. If it's less than 5, I leave the hundredth place as it is. Here, the thousandth place is 4, which is less than 5. So, I should leave the hundredth place as 8.\n\nThat means the number rounded to the nearest hundredth is 300.58. Looking at the options, B is 300.58, which seems to be the correct choice.\n\nBut wait, option C is 300.585, which has three digits after the decimal. Is that possible when rounding to the nearest hundredth? I don't think so, because rounding to the nearest hundredth should give us a number with two digits after the decimal. So, 300.585 would be rounded to the nearest thousandth, not hundredth.\n\nOption D is 300.59, which would be rounding up the hundredth place. But since the thousandth place is 4, which is less than 5, I shouldn't round up. So, 300.59 would be incorrect.\n\nOption A is 300, which seems way off because it's rounding to the nearest whole number, and the tenths place is 5, which should round up to 301, not down to 300.\n\nSo, based on this, B. 300.58 should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the number again: 300.5849. If I round it to the nearest hundredth, I look at the thousandth place, which is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, I don't round up. So, it should stay as 300.58.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the distance to the nearest hundredths. 300.58 is closer to 300.58 than to 300.59 since the thousandth place is 4, which is less than 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. 300.58.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
