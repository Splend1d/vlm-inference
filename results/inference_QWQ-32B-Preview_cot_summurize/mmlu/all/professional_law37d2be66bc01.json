They were driving to the game together when the fan sped up to cross an intersection while the traffic signal was changing from amber to red.

                    "text": "So here's this scenario involving a baseball fan, his friend, and a car accident. Let's break it down step by step to understand what's going on and how to determine the correct judgment amount.\n\nFirst, we have the baseball fan who bought two tickets for a World Series game and invited his best friend, who's also a big baseball fan. They plan to go to the game together, leaving around 5:00 p.m. to arrive early and watch batting practice, with the game starting at 7:00 p.m.\n\nWhile driving to the game, the fan decides to speed up to cross an intersection as the traffic signal is changing from amber to red. He's going at 50 mph in a 25 mph zone. At the same time, another car enters the intersection on a red light, and they collide. The friend gets a broken pelvis from the accident.\n\nNow, the friend decides to sue the driver of the car that ran the red light to recover damages for his injury. In this jurisdiction, they have a \"modified\" comparative negligence statute. According to this statute, a negligent plaintiff can still recover damages as long as their negligence isn't equal to or greater than that of the defendant's. If the plaintiff's negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant's, they can't recover anything.\n\nSo, in this case, the friend is the plaintiff, and the driver who ran the red light is the defendant.\n\nA jury returned a special verdict with these findings:\n\n1. The fan (presumably the plaintiff's friend who was driving) was 55% negligent for speeding.\n\n2. The driver (the defendant) was 45% negligent for driving through the red light.\n\n3. The friend (the plaintiff) suffered $100,000 in damages.\n\nNow, the question is, based on this information and the jurisdiction's comparative negligence rule, what judgment should the court enter for the friend?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. $100,000.00\n\nB. $55,000.00\n\nC. $45,000.00\n\nD. Nothing, because the fan was more negligent than the driver.\n\nFirst, we need to understand how comparative negligence works in this jurisdiction.\n\nThe statute says that the plaintiff can recover damages as long as their negligence is not equal to or greater than the defendant's. If the plaintiff's negligence is less than the defendant's, they can recover, but their damages are reduced by their own percentage of negligence.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff's negligence is 55%, and the defendant's is 45%. According to the statute, since the plaintiff's negligence is greater than the defendant's, the plaintiff cannot recover any damages.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check that.\n\nThe statute says: \"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted.\"\n\nSo, if the plaintiff's negligence is greater than the defendant's, no recovery is allowed.\n\nHere, the plaintiff's negligence is 55%, and the defendant's is 45%. Since 55% is greater than 45%, the plaintiff cannot recover any damages.\n\nTherefore, the court should enter a judgment of nothing for the friend.\n\nBut let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the 55% negligence applies to the fan who was driving, but the friend is the plaintiff who was just a passenger. Was the friend also negligent?\n\nWait, the verdict says the fan was 55% negligent for speeding, and the driver (defendant) was 45% negligent for running the red light. The friend is the plaintiff who suffered $100,000 in damages.\n\nBut the friend was just a passenger, right? So, was the friend negligent at all?\n\nThe question doesn't mention any negligence on the part of the friend. It only mentions the fan's negligence in speeding and the defendant's negligence in running the red light.\n\nSo, perhaps the friend, as a passenger, isn't considered negligent, meaning his negligence is 0%.\n\nBut the verdict assigns 55% negligence to the fan and 45% to the defendant.\n\nIs the fan the same as the plaintiff? Wait, no, the friend is the plaintiff, and the fan is the one driving.\n\nSo, is the fan also a party in this lawsuit?\n\nThe friend is suing the defendant driver, but the fan isn't mentioned as a party here.\n\nMaybe the fan is considered an agent of the friend or something, but I think we need to look at the plaintiff's own negligence.\n\nSince the friend was just a passenger, perhaps his negligence is zero, and only the fan's negligence is relevant.\n\nBut the verdict assigns 55% negligence to the fan and 45% to the defendant.\n\nI'm a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend is being held jointly responsible for the fan's negligence because they were together.\n\nBut that seems unfair.\n\nWait, perhaps in this jurisdiction, passengers are not held liable for the driver's negligence.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe the plaintiff's negligence is considered separate from the fan's negligence.\n\nBut the verdict lumped the fan's negligence at 55% and the defendant's at 45%.\n\nI think the key is to determine the plaintiff's own negligence.\n\nIf the friend was just a passenger and not negligent, then his own negligence is 0%, and he can recover full damages.\n\nBut according to the verdict, the fan (who is probably the driver) was 55% negligent.\n\nIs the friend being held jointly liable with the fan?\n\nOr is the friend's own negligence considered separate?\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the friend is being held responsible for the fan's negligence because they are friends.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense legally.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, passengers aren't liable for the driver's negligence unless they somehow caused it.\n\nWait, perhaps the friend encouraged the fan to speed or something.\n\nBut the question doesn't indicate that.\n\nSo, perhaps the friend's own negligence is zero.\n\nIn that case, since the plaintiff's negligence is zero, which is less than the defendant's 45%, the plaintiff can recover damages.\n\nBut then, in comparative negligence, the damages are reduced by the plaintiff's percentage of negligence.\n\nBut since the plaintiff's negligence is zero, the damages shouldn't be reduced at all.\n\nSo, the full $100,000 would be recoverable.\n\nBut according to the options, that would be answer A.\n\nHowever, considering that the fan was 55% negligent, which might affect the friend's recovery.\n\nBut if the friend himself was not negligent, perhaps he can still recover.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fan's negligence is imputed to the friend because they are going together.\n\nBut again, that seems unfair.\n\nWait, perhaps the friend is considered jointly liable with the fan.\n\nIf that's the case, and the fan is 55% negligent, then maybe the friend's recovery is reduced by that percentage.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps the friend is suing the defendant driver, and the defendant is arguing comparative negligence based on the fan's actions.\n\nIn that case, the plaintiff's (friend's) recovery would be reduced by the combined negligence of the fan and the plaintiff.\n\nBut since the plaintiff (friend) was not negligent, only the fan was, perhaps the reduction is only based on the fan's negligence.\n\nWait, but the fan and the friend are separate entities.\n\nThis is getting too confusing.\n\nMaybe I need to look at the statute again.\n\nThe statute says: \"A negligent plaintiff is entitled to obtain a recovery provided plaintiff's negligence is not equal to or greater than that of the defendant's; otherwise no recovery is permitted.\"\n\nSo, it's focusing on the plaintiff's own negligence compared to the defendant's.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff is the friend, who was a passenger.\n\nIf the friend had no negligence, then his negligence is 0%, which is less than the defendant's 45%, so he can recover full damages.\n\nBut the verdict assigned 55% negligence to the fan and 45% to the defendant.\n\nIt doesn't specify the friend's own negligence.\n\nPerhaps the friend is being held jointly liable with the fan.\n\nBut I think, legally, passengers aren't liable for the driver's negligence unless they forced or encouraged the negligent behavior.\n\nSince there's no indication of that, perhaps the friend's own negligence is zero.\n\nTherefore, he can recover full damages.\n\nBut according to the options, that would be A. $100,000.00.\n\nHowever, considering that the fan was more negligent than the defendant, and the friend was with the fan, maybe the friend's recovery is barred.\n\nBut that seems harsh.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend's recovery is reduced by the fan's percentage of negligence.\n\nSo, if the fan was 55% negligent, then the friend's damages are reduced by 55%, meaning he can only recover 45% of $100,000, which is $45,000.\n\nThat would correspond to option C.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's how comparative negligence works.\n\nWait, in comparative negligence, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their own percentage of negligence.\n\nBut in this case, the friend's own negligence is zero, so he should recover full damages.\n\nHowever, if the fan's negligence is imputed to the friend, then the friend's recovery would be reduced by 55%.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the friend can only recover the percentage of damages not caused by the fan's negligence.\n\nSo, if the fan is 55% negligent, and the defendant is 45% negligent, the friend can recover 45% of the damages, which is $45,000.\n\nBut that seems like an application of contributory negligence, not comparative negligence.\n\nWait, no, in comparative negligence, the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their own percentage of negligence.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps the fan's negligence is considered the plaintiff's negligence.\n\nBut legally, that might not be accurate.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that since the friend was a passenger and not negligent, his own negligence is zero, and he can recover full damages.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $100,000.00.\n\nBut considering that the fan was more negligent than the defendant, and the friend was with the fan, perhaps the friend's recovery is barred.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier thought.\n\nI need to make a decision.\n\nGiven the options, and considering that the plaintiff's own negligence is zero, and only the fan's negligence is 55%, which is separate from the plaintiff, I think the friend can recover full damages.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. $100,000.00.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, if the fan's negligence is imputed to the friend, then the friend's recovery would be reduced by 55%, resulting in $45,000, which is option C.\n\nBut I tend to think that passengers aren't liable for the driver's negligence.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with A. $100,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
