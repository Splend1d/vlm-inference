It says: \"Exposing individuals to arguments against their views, arguments that are then strongly refuted, may serve to...\" and gives four options. Let's see.\n\nOption A is \"increase their attitudinal ambivalence.\" Ambivalence means having mixed feelings or conflicting emotions about something. So, if someone is exposed to arguments against their views and then those arguments are refuted, maybe they become more unsure or have more mixed feelings about their own views. That seems possible.\n\nOption B is \"weaken their resistance to later persuasive appeals.\" If someone is exposed to counterarguments and then those are refuted, maybe they become less resistant to future attempts to persuade them. Maybe they're more open to considering other perspectives because they've already thought about counterarguments.\n\nOption C is \"render them indifferent to the attitude object.\" Indifferent means not caring one way or the other. So, if someone is exposed to arguments against their views and then those are refuted, maybe they just become apathetic about the whole thing. I'm not sure about that.\n\nOption D is \"inoculate them against later persuasive appeals.\" Inoculation means making someone resistant to something, like how a vaccine inoculates you against a disease. So, if someone is exposed to weak counterarguments and then those are refuted, maybe they become better at resisting stronger persuasive appeals in the future. That sounds similar to the concept of inoculation in psychology.\n\nI think option D makes the most sense here. It's based on the idea of inoculation theory, which suggests that exposing people to weak attacks on their beliefs and then refuting those attacks can make them more resistant to stronger attacks later on. It's like building up their psychological immunity.\n\nOption A might be possible in some cases, but the main goal of this approach seems to be strengthening their own beliefs, not increasing uncertainty. Option B seems contradictory because if they're exposed to counterarguments and then those are refuted, they should be more resistant to later appeals, not less. Option C doesn't make much sense because it's unlikely that going through this process would make them indifferent; probably the opposite, they would become more committed to their views.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D: inoculate them against later persuasive appeals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
