The options are: quarterback, tight end, striker, and free safety.\n\nFirst off, I know that quarterback and tight end are definitely positions in American football. The quarterback is the one who usually throws the ball, and the tight end is a big guy who can block and also catch passes.\n\nFree safety sounds familiar too. I think that's a position in the defensive backfield, responsible for defending against passes and runs.\n\nBut what about striker? I'm not sure if that's an American football position. Striker sounds more like a position in soccer, where players are focused on scoring goals.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems like striker is the odd one out. It's not a position in American football but rather in soccer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Could striker be another name for a certain position in football? For example, in some sports, positions might have different names.\n\nLet me think about it. In American football, positions are pretty specific and well-defined. We have offensive positions like quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight end, and offensive line. On the defensive side, we have defensive line, linebackers, defensive backs (which include safeties and cornerbacks), and special teams positions.\n\nStriker doesn't sound like any of these. Maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps it's a position in another sport altogether.\n\nI recall that in association football, which is called soccer in the U.S., a striker is a forward player whose main job is to score goals. So, it makes sense that striker is not an American football position.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. striker.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's quickly recap:\n\n- A. Quarterback: Yes, American football position.\n\n- B. Tight end: Yes, American football position.\n\n- C. Striker: No, that's a soccer position.\n\n- D. Free safety: Yes, American football position.\n\nSo, striker is the one that doesn't belong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
