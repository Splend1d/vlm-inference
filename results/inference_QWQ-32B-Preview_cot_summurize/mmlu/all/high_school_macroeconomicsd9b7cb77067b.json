                    "text": "So I've got this question here about fiscal and monetary policy and how they can reduce a recessionary gap. Let me see if I can wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, what's a recessionary gap? I think it's when the economy's output is less than what it should be at full capacity. So, there's unused capacity, unemployment, that sort of thing. The goal would be to stimulate the economy to close that gap.\n\nNow, fiscal policy is about government spending and taxation. Monetary policy is about the money supply and interest rates, mostly controlled by the central bank.\n\nOption A: Increase taxes and increase the reserve ratio.\n\nIncreasing taxes takes money out of people's pockets, which should decrease consumption and maybe slow down the economy. That seems counterintuitive for reducing a recessionary gap; you'd want to encourage spending, not decrease it.\n\nIncreasing the reserve ratio means banks have to hold more money in reserve and can't lend as much. That should decrease the money supply and make loans harder to get, which again seems like it would slow down the economy.\n\nSo, option A seems like it would make a recessionary gap worse, not better.\n\nOption B: Decrease spending and sell Treasury securities.\n\nDecreasing government spending directly reduces demand in the economy, which isn't helpful for closing a recessionary gap.\n\nSelling Treasury securities means the central bank is taking money out of the economy, which also reduces the money supply and likely increases interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. Again, not helpful for stimulating the economy.\n\nSo, option B also seems counterproductive.\n\nOption C: Decrease taxes and buy Treasury securities.\n\nDecreasing taxes puts more money in people's hands, which should increase consumption and investment, stimulating the economy.\n\nBuying Treasury securities by the central bank increases the money supply, which should lower interest rates, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment and spending.\n\nThis seems like a double whammy of stimulation, which should help reduce a recessionary gap.\n\nOption D: Increase spending and increase the reserve ratio.\n\nIncreasing government spending directly injects money into the economy, which is good for closing a recessionary gap.\n\nHowever, increasing the reserve ratio, as I mentioned earlier, restricts banks' ability to lend, which could offset some of the stimulation from increased government spending.\n\nSo, while part of this option is helpful, the other part is not.\n\nComparing all the options, option C seems to be the best combination for reducing a recessionary gap. Both components\u2014decreasing taxes and buying Treasury securities\u2014work to stimulate the economy and close the gap.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think about it again. In a recessionary gap, you want to increase aggregate demand. Fiscal policy that decreases taxes does that by increasing disposable income, leading to higher consumption. Monetary policy that buys Treasury securities increases the money supply, lowering interest rates and encouraging investment and spending.\n\nSo, both policies are expansionary and should help reduce the recessionary gap.\n\nOption A is contractionary on both fronts, which would exacerbate the gap.\n\nOption B is also contractionary, same as A.\n\nOption D is a mix: expansionary fiscal policy but contractionary monetary policy, which might not be as effective as option C, where both policies are expansionary.\n\nTherefore, the most likely combination to reduce a recessionary gap is option C: decrease taxes and buy Treasury securities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
