(~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 ~S)\n\nB. (~E \u2283 F) \u2228 (C \u2283 S)\n\nC. (~F \u2283 E) \u2228 (C \u2261 S)\n\nD. ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n\nOption D matches exactly with what I have: ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any equivalent way to write ~(F \u2192 E)?\n\nWell, F \u2192 E is equivalent to ~F \u2228 E\n\nSo, ~(F \u2192 E) is ~(~F \u2228 E), which by De Morgan's law is F \u2227 ~E\n\nBut in the options, ~(F \u2283 E) is used, which probably means the same as ~(F \u2192 E)\n\nSo, option D is ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C), which matches what I have.\n\nThe other options don't seem to match:\n\nOption A has (~F \u2283 E), which is F \u2192 E, and (C \u2261 ~S), which is C \u2194 ~S, which doesn't correspond to our parts.\n\nOption B has (~E \u2283 F), which is E \u2228 F, and (C \u2283 S), which is ~C \u2228 S\n\nOption C has (~F \u2283 E), same as Option A, and (C \u2261 S), which is C \u2194 S\n\nNone of these match our required parts.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization is option D: ~(F \u2283 E) \u2228 (S \u2283 C)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
