There are two employees: one earns $600 per week and took two weeks off, and the other earns $800 per week and didn't take any vacation time. Each employee gets two weeks of paid vacation per year, and these rights accumulate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what vacation liability and expense are. Vacation liability is the amount the company owes for vacation time that has been earned but not yet taken. Vacation expense is the cost of the vacation time that has been taken.\n\nLet me start by calculating the vacation expense. The first employee took two weeks off, and their weekly salary is $600. So, the vacation expense for this employee is 2 weeks * $600/week = $1200. The second employee didn't take any vacation time, so their vacation expense is $0. Therefore, the total vacation expense for the year is $1200.\n\nNow, for the vacation liability. Since vacation rights accumulate, even if an employee doesn't take their vacation time, the liability increases.\n\nFor the first employee, they took their two weeks off, so they didn't accumulate any additional vacation time. They had two weeks coming to them, and they took them.\n\nFor the second employee, who didn't take any vacation time, they still have their two weeks' worth of vacation time accumulated. So, the vacation liability for this employee is 2 weeks * $800/week = $1600.\n\nTherefore, the total vacation liability that Elan should report is $1600, and the vacation expense is $1200.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $1600 $1200\n\nB. $1600 $2800\n\nC. $0 $1200\n\nD. $0 $2800\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs there any possibility that the vacation expense includes both the time taken and the liability accumulated?\n\nLet me think about the accounting entries.\n\nWhen vacation time is earned, the company should recognize a liability. When it's taken, the liability is reduced, and the expense is recognized.\n\nSo, for the first employee:\n\n- Earned 2 weeks: liability increases by 2 * $600 = $1200\n\n- Took 2 weeks: liability decreases by $1200, expense increases by $1200\n\nFor the second employee:\n\n- Earned 2 weeks: liability increases by 2 * $800 = $1600\n\n- Took 0 weeks: liability remains $1600\n\nSo, total vacation liability at year-end is $1600 (from the second employee), and vacation expense is $1200 (from the first employee who took vacation).\n\nThis confirms that option A is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vacation expense includes both the time taken and the liability accumulated. But that doesn't make sense because expense is for the time taken, and liability is for the time earned but not taken.\n\nYes, I think I have it right. The answer is A. $1600 liability and $1200 expense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. $1600 $1200"
