To answer this correctly, I need to recall information about the common ancestors of humans and these apes.\n\nFirst, I know that humans belong to the Hominidae family, which includes chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans as well. So, we are all great apes. But the question is asking from which of these primates humans descend.\n\nI think the key here is to understand that humans did not descend directly from any of these existing species, but rather share a common ancestor with them at some point in the past.\n\nChimpanzees are our closest living relatives, sharing about 98-99% of our DNA. Scientists believe that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor around 5-7 million years ago.\n\nGorillas are a bit more distantly related, with around 98% DNA similarity, and orangutans even more so, with about 97% DNA similarity.\n\nSo, while we share a common ancestor with all these primates, the most recent common ancestor is with chimpanzees.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"from which of the following primates do humans descend?\" and the options are individual species: chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, or none of the above.\n\nGiven that humans did not descend directly from any of these species but share a common ancestor with them, the most accurate answer would be \"none of the above.\"\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because chimpanzees are our closest relatives. Maybe the question is testing whether I know that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplistic and expects the answer to be chimpanzees, considering them the closest relatives.\n\nBut scientifically, it's more precise to say that humans did not descend from chimpanzees, but both descended from a common ancestor.\n\nI think the best answer is D. none of the above, because humans did not descend from any of these existing primate species, but share common ancestors with them.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
