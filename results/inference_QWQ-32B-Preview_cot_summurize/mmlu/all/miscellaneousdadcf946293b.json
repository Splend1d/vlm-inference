Let's see what each option is saying.\n\nOption A: Increasing both government spending and taxes. Hmm, if the government spends more and also taxes more, it's like they're putting more money into the economy but also taking more out. So, net effect might be neutral, right?\n\nOption B: Increasing government spending and decreasing taxes. Okay, this seems interesting. More government spending means more money going into the economy, and decreasing taxes means people have more disposable income to spend themselves. So, both actions should stimulate economic activity.\n\nOption C: Decreasing government spending and increasing taxes. This sounds like the opposite of expansionary. If the government spends less and takes more out through taxes, that should slow down the economy. So, this must be a contractionary policy.\n\nOption D: Decreasing both government spending and taxes. Wait, so spending less and taxing less. I'm not sure about this one. On one hand, less government spending could slow things down, but lower taxes could stimulate private spending. So, it might depend on which effect is stronger.\n\nBut the question is asking for the most expansionary action. So, I think Option B makes the most sense because it combines two actions that should both boost economic activity: increased government spending and decreased taxes.\n\nLet me double-check. Expansionary fiscal policy is aimed at stimulating the economy, usually during a recession or slow growth period. So, actions that increase overall demand are what we're looking for.\n\nOption A: Increased spending boosts demand, but increased taxes reduce disposable income, which might offset the spending increase.\n\nOption B: Increased spending and decreased taxes both boost demand, so this should be the most expansionary.\n\nOption C: Decreased spending and increased taxes both reduce demand, making it contractionary.\n\nOption D: Decreased spending reduces demand, but decreased taxes increase disposable income. So, it's a mix, but probably less expansionary than Option B.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is Option B: Increasing government spending and decreasing taxes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
