The question is: \"Labor productivity and economic growth increase if\" and then it gives four options. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"a nation subsidizes education for all citizens.\" Hmm, subsidizing education could potentially increase labor productivity because better-educated workers are often more skilled and efficient. Economic growth could also benefit from a more educated workforce as they can innovate and adapt to new technologies more easily. So, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption B: \"a nation imposes tariffs and quotas on imported goods.\" Imposing tariffs and quotas can protect domestic industries from foreign competition, which might allow those industries to grow and become more productive. However, it can also lead to higher prices for consumers and potentially reduce efficiency if domestic industries don't have to compete globally. I'm not sure if this is the best answer.\n\nOption C: \"a nation removes penalties for firms that pollute natural resources.\" Removing penalties for pollution might encourage firms to produce more, but at the cost of environmental degradation. This could have negative long-term effects on labor productivity and economic growth, especially if environmental damage affects worker health or reduces natural resources. So, this seems like it could have negative impacts rather than positive ones.\n\nOption D: \"a nation ignores societal barriers like discrimination.\" Ignoring discrimination could actually hinder labor productivity and economic growth because discrimination can lead to unequal opportunities and underutilization of talent. When certain groups are discriminated against, the overall workforce might not be as efficient or innovative as it could be. So, this doesn't seem like a good choice.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems the most straightforward and positive approach to increasing labor productivity and economic growth. Subsidizing education benefits the workforce and the economy in the long run.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
