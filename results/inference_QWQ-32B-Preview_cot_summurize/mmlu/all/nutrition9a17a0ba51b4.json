So, vitamin A is really important for lots of things in our bodies, like vision, immune system function, and growth. When kids don't get enough of it, it can lead to some serious problems.\n\nOption A is goitre, which I think is related to iodine deficiency, not vitamin A. Goitre is when the thyroid gland enlarges, and it's usually because the body is trying to get more iodine. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B is poor cognitive development. Now, vitamin A is important for brain function, but I'm not entirely sure if its deficiency directly causes poor cognitive development. Maybe it's a factor, but I'm not positive.\n\nOption C is poor bone growth. Hmm, I know that vitamins like D and C are more directly associated with bone health. Vitamin D helps absorb calcium, which is essential for bones, and vitamin C is important for collagen production. I'm not sure about vitamin A's role in bone growth.\n\nOption D is increased risk of mortality. This sounds really serious, and maybe it's because vitamin A is so important for the immune system. If kids don't have enough vitamin A, their immune systems might not work as well, making them more susceptible to infections, which could increase the risk of death.\n\nLet me think about this again. Vitamin A is crucial for vision, as I mentioned, and it's also important for cell growth and development, immune function, and reproduction. In children, a deficiency could affect their growth and development in various ways.\n\nI recall that in developing countries, where vitamin A deficiency is more common, it can lead to a condition called xerophthalmia, which affects the eyes and can cause blindness. So, that's a severe consequence. Also, a weakened immune system could indeed increase the risk of mortality from infectious diseases.\n\nComparing all the options, while poor cognitive development and poor bone growth might be indirect effects, the most direct and severe consequence seems to be the increased risk of mortality.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with option D: increased risk of mortality.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
