                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the global ageing population. I need to pick the correct statement from the options given. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"It is predicted that by 2040 over 25% of the world's population will be 65 years or older.\" Hmm, I remember reading about population ageing, but I'm not sure about the exact percentage for 2040. I think the proportion of older people is indeed increasing, but I'm not sure if it's going to be over 25% by 2040. Maybe I should look up the latest projections from the United Nations or the World Health Organization.\n\nOption B says: \"The rate of increase in the median age of populations is greater in developing countries than in wealthy countries.\" Now, developing countries often have higher birth rates, but I think wealthy countries have lower mortality rates, especially among older adults. So, maybe the median age is increasing faster in developing countries as they transition to lower birth and death rates. But I'm not entirely sure about this.\n\nOption C states: \"In older age groups, men outnumber women.\" I know that generally, women live longer than men. So, in older age groups, there are usually more women than men. For example, in nursing homes or in centenarians, the majority are women. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"Men have a lower mortality rate than women over the life course.\" Wait a minute, again, I know that women tend to live longer than men, which would imply that men have higher mortality rates at various ages. So, this statement seems contrary to what I know.\n\nLet me eliminate some options based on what I know. Option C seems incorrect because men do not outnumber women in older age groups; it's usually the opposite. Option D also seems wrong because men generally have higher mortality rates over the life course.\n\nNow, between options A and B, I need to decide which one is correct. I recall that the global population is ageing, and developing countries are ageing faster due to declines in fertility and improvements in life expectancy. So, option B might be correct in saying that the rate of increase in median age is greater in developing countries.\n\nBut I should verify the prediction for 2040 in option A. According to the World Health Organization, the global population of people aged 65 and older is indeed growing, but I need to check the specific percentage for 2040.\n\nLet me imagine that I have access to recent data. According to the United Nations, by 2050, the proportion of the world's population aged 65 and older is projected to reach 16%, up from 9% in 2015. So, by 2040, it might be around 13-14%, which is less than 25%. Therefore, option A seems exaggerated.\n\nMoreover, developing countries are ageing faster than developed countries because of more rapid declines in fertility. This means that the median age is increasing more rapidly in developing countries.\n\nSo, considering all this, option B seems to be the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
