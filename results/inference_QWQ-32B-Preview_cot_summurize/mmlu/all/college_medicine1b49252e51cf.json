                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which of these children is most likely to attach to a male psychologist who's a stranger in a psychological study. The question is based on attachment theory, which I think is about how kids form bonds with caregivers. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what attachment theory says. I think it was developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, and it's about how early relationships with caregivers affect a person's ability to form and maintain relationships later in life. Attachment styles can be secure or insecure, and they develop based on how caregivers respond to the child's needs.\n\nOkay, so in this question, we have four different children:\n\nA. A two-month-old female infant raised in a safe, stable environment.\n\nB. A five-month-old male infant raised in a safe, stable environment.\n\nC. An eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child.\n\nD. A thirteen-month-old female infant raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child.\n\nI need to figure out which one is most likely to attach to this male psychologist who's a stranger.\n\nHmm. For the younger infants, like two and five months old, I'm not sure if they're at an age where they can form attachments to strangers easily. I think attachment usually starts with primary caregivers, and strangers might be more frightening to them at that age.\n\nAttachment theory says that around six to eight months, babies start to show stranger wariness or distress when separated from their primary caregivers. So, an eight-month-old might be more likely to be wary of a stranger, but in this case, the child is neglected by the caregiver, which might affect their attachment behavior.\n\nNeglect could lead to insecure attachment styles, like avoidant attachment, where the child doesn't seek comfort from the caregiver and might not show much emotion with strangers either.\n\nOn the other hand, a child who is occasionally neglected might develop an insecure/ambivalent attachment style, where they're overly clingy and anxious about the caregiver's availability.\n\nSo, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Two-month-old female in a safe, stable environment. At this age, babies are generally attached to their primary caregivers and might not form attachments to strangers easily. Plus, the environment is safe and stable, so she's likely to have a secure attachment to her caregivers.\n\nB. Five-month-old male in a safe, stable environment. Similar to the two-month-old, probably not ready to form attachments to strangers yet. Secure attachment to primary caregivers.\n\nC. Eight-month-old male raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects the child. At eight months, he should be developing attachment behaviors, but neglect can lead to avoidant attachment, where the child doesn't seek comfort from the caregiver and might not show much preference for strangers versus familiar people.\n\nD. Thirteen-month-old female raised by two caregivers who occasionally neglect the child. Thirteen months is old enough to have formed attachments to primary caregivers. Occasional neglect might lead to insecure/ambivalent attachment, where she's anxious about the availability of caregivers and might be more clingy.\n\nHmm. So, between C and D, both have some level of neglect, but C has frequent neglect, which might lead to avoidant attachment, meaning she might not seek attachment to the stranger psychologist. Whereas D has occasional neglect, which might lead to ambivalent attachment, where she's anxious and clingy.\n\nWait, but D is a thirteen-month-old female, which is older than C, who is eight months. Attachment behaviors are more established by thirteen months, so perhaps she's more likely to have a secure attachment if the neglect is only occasional.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the child who is neglected more frequently, option C, might be more likely to attach to a stranger because they're not getting their needs met by the primary caregiver.\n\nBut attachment theory suggests that frequent neglect leads to avoidant attachment, where the child learns not to rely on the caregiver for comfort and might not seek attachment to strangers.\n\nIn contrast, occasional neglect might lead to ambivalent attachment, where the child is uncertain about the caregiver's availability and might be more clingy and anxious.\n\nSo, perhaps the child in option D, with occasional neglect, might be more likely to attach to the stranger psychologist because they're anxious about their attachment to the primary caregivers and might seek comfort from anyone available.\n\nBut wait, in attachment theory, ambivalent/-resistant attached children might be ambivalent towards strangers\u2014sometimes seeking contact, sometimes not.\n\n\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u578b\u9644\u7740\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7279\u522b\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7167\u987e\u8005\u3002\n\n\u90a3\u4e48\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9009\u9879\u4e2d\uff0cA\u548cB\u7684\u5a74\u513f\u7531\u4e8e\u5e74\u9f84\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u5c55\u5230\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u5f62\u6210\u9644\u7740\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\n\nC\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u6708\u5927\u7684\u7537\u5a74\u53d7\u5230\u9891\u7e41\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u578b\u9644\u7740\uff0c\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u964c\u751f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\n\nD\u7684\u5341\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u5927\u7684\u5973\u5a74\u53d7\u5230\u5076\u5c14\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u77db\u76fe\u578b\u9644\u7740\uff0c\u5979\u5728\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u95ee\u7684\u662f\u201c\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u201d\u9644\u7740\u4e8e\u7537\u6027\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e4b\u524d\u4e0d\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u7684\u964c\u751f\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9644\u7740\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u9c8d\u5c14\u6bd4\u548c\u827e\u6069\u65af\u6c83\u65af\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5a74\u513f\u5728\u5927\u7ea66-8\u4e2a\u6708\u5927\u65f6\u5f00\u59cb\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u7684\u8b66\u60d5\u548c\u5bf9\u4e3b\u8981\u7167\u987e\u8005\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u7126\u8651\u3002\n\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5a74\u513f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u592a\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u719f\u6089\u7684\u4eba\u548c\u964c\u751f\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9644\u7740\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879A\u548cB\u7684\u5a74\u513f\u53ef\u80fd\u592a\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u7684\u9644\u7740\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879C\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u6708\u5927\u7684\u7537\u5a74\u53d7\u5230\u9891\u7e41\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u578b\u9644\u7740\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u964c\u751f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879D\u7684\u5341\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u5927\u7684\u5973\u5a74\u53d7\u5230\u5076\u5c14\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u77db\u76fe\u578b\u9644\u7740\uff0c\u5979\u5728\u4e0e\u964c\u751f\u4eba\u4e92\u52a8\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e2\u5bfb\u6c42\u63a5\u89e6\u53c8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6297\u62d2\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9898\u76ee\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u662f\u201c\u9644\u7740\u201d\u5230\u7537\u6027\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6307\u7684\u662f\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u9644\u7740\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u65f6\u7684\u4eb2\u8fd1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e
