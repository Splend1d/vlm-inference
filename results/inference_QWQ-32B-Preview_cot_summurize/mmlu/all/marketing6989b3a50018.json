Threat of substitutes.\n3. Bargaining power of suppliers.\n4. Bargaining power of buyers.\n5. Competitive rivalry among existing firms.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Threat of substitutes: This is one of the five forces.\n\nB. Threat of suppliers: This seems to be referring to the bargaining power of suppliers, which is also one of the five forces.\n\nC. Power of buyers: This is similar to the bargaining power of buyers, which is another force in the model.\n\nD. Threat from government: This is not one of the five forces in Porter's model.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Threat from government.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that while government influence isn't directly one of the five forces, it can impact some of the forces. For example, government regulations can affect the threat of new entrants or the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers. But in the context of the Five Forces model, \"threat from government\" is not explicitly included as one of the five forces."
