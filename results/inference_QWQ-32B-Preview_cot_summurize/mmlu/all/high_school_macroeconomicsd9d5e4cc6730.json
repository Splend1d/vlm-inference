There's unused capacity and unemployment is higher than it should be. So, I need to think about what fiscal policy would help close that gap.\n\nOption A suggests increasing taxes. Hmm, increasing taxes would take money out of people's pockets, which might reduce consumer spending. That sounds like it would make things worse during a recession. So, that probably isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B is to decrease spending. Again, decreasing government spending might not be helpful in a recession because it would reduce overall demand in the economy. That could lead to even lower real GDP and higher unemployment. So, that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C is to decrease taxes. That makes sense because decreasing taxes puts more money in people's hands, which could increase consumer spending and investment. That should help to increase real GDP. But the option says that unemployment would increase. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If real GDP increases, unemployment should decrease, right? Because more economic activity usually means more jobs.\n\nOption D is also to decrease taxes, which again should increase real GDP. And this time, it says that unemployment would decrease, which aligns with what I just thought.\n\nSo, between options C and D, both suggest decreasing taxes and increasing real GDP, but one says unemployment increases and the other says it decreases. Logically, if real GDP increases, unemployment should decrease, assuming that more production requires more labor.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to make the most sense. Decrease taxes to stimulate the economy, increase real GDP, and decrease unemployment.\n\nBut let me double-check. In a recessionary gap, the economy is operating below its potential. Fiscal policy should aim to boost aggregate demand to close that gap. Decreasing taxes is a way to do that by increasing disposable income and encouraging spending. As a result, real GDP should increase, and with more economic activity, unemployment should decrease.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
