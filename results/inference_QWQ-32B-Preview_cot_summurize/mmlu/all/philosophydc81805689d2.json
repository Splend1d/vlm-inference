                    "text": "I think the question is about John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism and how he suggests we decide on how to act. So, I need to recall Mill's views on utilitarianism and decision-making.\n\nFirst off, Mill is a utilitarian, which means he believes that actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they cause unhappiness. The principle of utility is central here, which aims at the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\n\nNow, the question is asking about how Mill claims we should decide how to act, and there are four options:\n\nA. Always calculate the expected consequences of our action.\n\nB. Depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\n\nC. Consult tradition.\n\nD. Consult scripture.\n\nLet me think about each option.\n\nOption A suggests that we should always calculate the expected consequences of our actions. This sounds a lot like act-utilitarianism, where each individual action is judged based on its consequences. However, Mill also discusses rule-utilitarianism, where actions are guided by rules that, if followed generally, lead to the greatest happiness.\n\nOption B mentions depending on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility. This seems to align with rule-utilitarianism, where general rules are established based on what promotes the greatest happiness, and individuals follow these rules in their decision-making.\n\nOption C suggests consulting tradition. While Mill was influenced by Enlightenment thinking and valued progress, he also recognized the wisdom contained in traditions. However, I don't recall him making tradition the primary guide for moral decision-making.\n\nOption D is about consulting scripture. Mill was a secular thinker, and his utilitarianism is based on empirical considerations rather than religious doctrines. So, it's unlikely that he would advocate for consulting scripture as the primary method for deciding how to act.\n\nConsidering Mill's philosophy, he did discuss the importance of both act and rule utilitarianism. In his work, \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill acknowledges that in many cases, it's impractical to calculate the consequences of every action. Therefore, he seems to favor adhering to general rules that are utility-approved, which would align more with option B.\n\nMoreover, Mill emphasizes the importance of moral rules that have been tested over time and are generally conducive to happiness. These rules can be seen as rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility. So, in day-to-day decision-making, individuals should follow these rules rather than engaging in complex calculations for each action.\n\nOption A, which suggests always calculating expected consequences, seems too demanding and impractical for everyday decisions. Mill recognizes this impracticality, which is why he favors rule-utilitarianism.\n\nOption C, consulting tradition, might have some merit in Mill's thought, but it's not the primary guide. He would likely view traditions as useful heuristics that have stood the test of time and may embody wisdom, but ultimately, their validity should be judged by the principle of utility.\n\nOption D, consulting scripture, doesn't fit with Mill's secular approach to ethics. His utilitarianism is based on human well-being and happiness, not on divine command or religious texts.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer seems to be option B: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\n\nTo further support this, I recall Mill writing about the importance of moral rules that are utility-approved. He suggests that most people should follow these rules as a guide for conduct, while a more advanced few might be able to make direct utilitarian calculations in exceptional cases.\n\nIn \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill writes: \"It is a misapprehension of the utilitarian mode of thought to conceive it as implying that people should fix their minds upon so wide a generality as the world, or society at large. The great majority of good actions are intended not for the benefit of the world, but for that of individuals, of which the good of the world is made up; and the thoughts of the most virtuous man need not on these occasions travel beyond the particular persons concerned, except so far as is necessary to assure himself that in benefiting them he is not violating the rights, that is, the legitimate and authorized expectations, of any one else.\"\n\nThis passage suggests that while the ultimate standard is the greatest happiness for the greatest number, in practice, people should focus on the immediate effects of their actions on individuals, provided they do not conflict with broader moral rules.\n\nFurthermore, Mill discusses the idea of \"second-order\" moral rules that are derived from the principle of utility and can be followed as guidelines for conduct. This again points towards option B.\n\nIn contrast, option A seems too demanding, as it would require constant calculation and consideration of all possible consequences, which is not feasible in everyday life.\n\nOption C, consulting tradition, might have some role in informing what moral rules are utility-approved, but it's not the primary method for deciding how to act.\n\nOption D is clearly not in line with Mill's secular approach.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B: we should depend on rules of thumb derived from the principle of utility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
