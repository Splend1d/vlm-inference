The question is from 2018, and it asks for the percentage of US adults who think this is an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision-making. The options are 26%, 41%, 56%, or 71%.\n\nFirst, I need to recall or find information on public opinions regarding algorithmic decision-making in the criminal justice system around 2018. I remember that there have been discussions and studies on how the public perceives the use of algorithms in various aspects of life, including criminal justice.\n\nI think Pew Research Center often conducts surveys on technology and public opinion, so maybe they have data on this topic. A quick search in my memory suggests that Pew has reported on public attitudes toward algorithms and their applications.\n\nLet me try to recall specific numbers. I seem to remember that around that time, there was a survey indicating that a significant portion of Americans were concerned about the use of algorithms in making decisions that affect people's lives, including criminal risk assessments.\n\nLooking back, I think the percentage was around 56%. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me consider the other options. 26% seems too low, as public concern about algorithmic decision-making was quite high. 71% might be too high, suggesting that the majority strongly disagreed with this application, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it was 41%. But I need to think carefully. Let me consider the context. In 2018, there was growing awareness about the biases and limitations of algorithms, especially in sensitive areas like criminal justice. So, it's likely that a substantial proportion of the public would view this as an unreasonable application.\n\nGiven that, 56% seems plausible, but I should check if I can find any specific studies or reports that might confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. If 56% of US adults say that it's unreasonable, that would mean a little over half hold that view. Is that consistent with what I know about public opinion at the time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it was higher, at 71%, indicating strong disagreement with using algorithms for criminal risk assessment in parole decisions.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider eliminating some options.\n\nOption A, 26%, seems too low because public concern about algorithmic bias was quite prominent by 2018. So, it's unlikely that only 26% would find this application unreasonable.\n\nOption D, 71%, seems high but possible if there was significant mistrust in algorithms for such critical decisions.\n\nOption C, 56%, is in the middle, suggesting a majority view this as unreasonable.\n\nOption B, 41%, would indicate that less than half of US adults view it as unreasonable.\n\nConsidering that, and recalling that there was a lot of discourse around algorithmic fairness in criminal justice, I would guess that a majority might have found this application unreasonable.\n\nTherefore, between 56% and 71%, I need to decide which one is more plausible.\n\nPerhaps 56% is a reasonable estimate for the percentage of US adults who viewed algorithmic decision-making in parole decisions as unreasonable in 2018.\n\nSo, I'll go with C. 56%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
