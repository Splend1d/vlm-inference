                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about the divine command theory. So, the divine command theory is a concept in ethics that suggests that what is morally right and wrong is determined by God's commands. Basically, something is good because God says it's good, and bad because God says it's bad.\n\nNow, the question is asking about criticisms of this theory. It says that critics argue that the theory implies that God's commands are something specific. The options are:\n\nA. well supported\n\nB. unclear\n\nC. unknowable\n\nD. arbitrary\n\nI need to think about what the main issues are with the divine command theory from a critic's perspective.\n\nOne major criticism is that if morality is solely based on God's commands, then it seems like morality is arbitrary. That means that God could have commanded anything, and it would be considered moral just because he commanded it. For example, God could have commanded that killing is good, and then killing would be good. It's just based on his command, not on any independent moral reasoning.\n\nThis raises questions about the nature of morality. If morality is arbitrary in this way, then it seems like moral truths aren't objective or universal; they're just based on divine fiat.\n\nAnother criticism is that this theory makes morality dependent on God's will, which some people find uncomfortable or even disturbing. It can also lead to the Euthyphro dilemma, which is a famous problem in philosophy. The dilemma is: Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it's good?\n\nIf you choose the first option, that something is good because God commands it, then morality becomes arbitrary, as I mentioned earlier. If you choose the second option, that God commands something because it's good, then it seems like there are moral standards independent of God's will, which contradicts the divine command theory.\n\nGiven these criticisms, I think the best answer is D. arbitrary, because critics argue that if morality is based solely on God's commands, then those commands could be anything, and there's no objective standard beyond God's will.\n\nOption A, well supported, doesn't seem to fit because critics are probably not saying that God's commands are well supported in this context.\n\nOption B, unclear, might be a possible criticism, but it's not as central as the arbitrariness issue.\n\nOption C, unknowable, could be a related criticism, but again, the main point seems to be about the arbitrariness of God's commands.\n\nSo, I think D. arbitrary is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
