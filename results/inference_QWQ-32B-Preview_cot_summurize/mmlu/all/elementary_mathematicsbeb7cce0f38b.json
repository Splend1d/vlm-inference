                    "text": "So Roya bought 12 cartons of orange juice and paid $48 in total. We need to find out how much she paid per carton. That means we're looking for the unit rate, which is the cost per one carton.\n\nTo find the unit rate, I think I need to divide the total cost by the number of cartons. So, that would be $48 divided by 12 cartons.\n\nLet me do the division: 48 divided by 12.\n\n12 times 4 is 48, so 48 divided by 12 is 4.\n\nSo, the unit rate is $4 per carton.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $3\n\nB. $4\n\nC. $6\n\nD. $12\n\nOption B is $4, which matches what I calculated.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. If she bought 12 cartons for $48, and each carton is $4, then 12 times 4 is indeed 48. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider option A, $3 per carton, then 12 cartons would cost 12 times 3, which is $36. But she paid $48, not $36, so that's too low.\n\nOption C is $6 per carton. 12 cartons at $6 each would be 12 times 6, which is $72. But she only paid $48, so that's too high.\n\nOption D is $12 per carton. 12 cartons at $12 each would be 12 times 12, which is $144. That's way more than she paid.\n\nSo, clearly, the correct answer is $4 per carton.\n\nI think that makes sense. Dividing the total cost by the number of items gives the unit rate, which is what we're looking for here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
