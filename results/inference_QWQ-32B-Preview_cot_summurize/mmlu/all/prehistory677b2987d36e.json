The options are brushes, trowels, dental picks, or all of the above. I think it might be different tools for different situations, but I'm not sure.\n\nFirst, let's consider brushes. Brushes are probably really useful for gently sweeping away loose soil without damaging delicate artifacts. They come in different sizes and stiffness, so you can choose the right one for the job. For example, a soft-bristled brush for fragile items and a stiffer one for more robust materials.\n\nTrowels are another option. These are like small shovels used for scraping away soil in a controlled manner. They might be better for areas where there aren't as many delicate artifacts, or for removing larger chunks of soil.\n\nThen there are dental picks. These are really fine tools, good for precise work and getting into small spaces. They could be useful for detailed cleaning around small artifacts or for removing soil from crevices.\n\nSo, it seems like each tool has its own purpose depending on the situation. Maybe all of them are used together in different stages of excavation and cleaning.\n\nBut the question is, which one is used to remove the soil enclosing site materials? It sounds like it's asking for the general tool used for this purpose.\n\nPerhaps the answer is D, all of the above, because different tools are used depending on the specific needs of the excavation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a single answer, and I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nLet me think differently. If I had to pick one tool that is most commonly associated with removing soil from around artifacts, maybe it's trowels. Trowels are iconic in archaeology for carefully scraping away soil layer by layer.\n\nOn the other hand, brushes are also very commonly used for sweeping away loose soil without damaging artifacts.\n\nDental picks are more for detailed work, so maybe they're used after the initial soil has been removed with brushes and trowels.\n\nPerhaps the answer is B, trowels, because they are primarily used for removing soil in a controlled manner during excavation.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up what tools are used in archaeology for soil removal.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that archaeologists use a variety of tools, including trowels, brushes, dental picks, and even specialized tools like whisk brooms and paintbrushes for very delicate items.\n\nSo, it seems that all of these tools are used in the process of removing soil from around artifacts.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be D, all of the above, because different tools are used depending on the specific needs and the delicacy of the artifacts.\n\nHowever, maybe the question is expecting a more specific answer or is referring to a particular context where only one tool is primarily used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the context of the course or material this question is from, there is a specific tool that is emphasized for soil removal.\n\nSince I don't have that context, I'll have to make an educated guess based on general knowledge.\n\nGiven that, I think the best answer is D, all of the above, because all these tools are used in archaeological excavation for removing soil from around artifacts, each serving a different purpose depending on the situation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
