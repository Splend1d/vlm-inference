                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement about calcium metabolism is true. I remember that calcium is really important for our bodies, especially for our bones and teeth, but also for muscle function and nerve signals. So, metabolism of calcium involves how our body regulates the levels of calcium in our blood and within our cells.\n\nOption A says: \"Calcitonin causes a rise in plasma calcium.\" Hmm, I think calcitonin actually does the opposite. I recall that calcitonin is a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland, specifically by the C-cells or parafollicular cells. Its main function is to lower blood calcium levels when they get too high. It does this by inhibiting the breakdown of bone, which reduces the release of calcium into the blood, and it also increases the excretion of calcium by the kidneys. So, if calcitonin lowers plasma calcium, then statement A is false.\n\nMoving on to option B: \"Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.\" Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more of the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is crucial for regulating calcium levels; it increases blood calcium by stimulating bone resorption, increasing gastrointestinal absorption of calcium, and reducing renal excretion of calcium.\n\nNow, whether primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic or not, I need to recall. I think in mild cases, it might be asymptomatic, but as the condition progresses, symptoms can appear. Common symptoms include kidney stones, bone pain, fatigue, depression, and in more severe cases, confusion and coma due to very high calcium levels. So, while it might be asymptomatic in some cases, saying it's usually asymptomatic might not be entirely accurate. Maybe this statement isn't entirely true.\n\nOption C: \"Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\" I know that vitamin D is important for calcium absorption in the intestines, and it's involved in bone health. But where is it secreted from? I think vitamin D is synthesized in the skin upon exposure to sunlight, and it can also be obtained from certain foods. Then, it's converted to its active form in the liver and kidneys. I don't recall the parathyroid glands being involved in vitamin D secretion. In fact, PTH secreted by the parathyroid glands stimulates the conversion of vitamin D to its active form in the kidneys, but the parathyroid glands don't secrete vitamin D themselves. So, statement C seems false.\n\nOption D: \"Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\" Oliguria is a condition where there is a decreased amount of urine produced, usually less than 400 milliliters per day. Hypercalcaemia is having high levels of calcium in the blood. I need to think about whether hypercalcaemia can lead to oliguria.\n\nHigh calcium levels can affect kidney function in several ways. It can cause kidney stones, which might block the urinary tract and lead to reduced urine output. Additionally, hypercalcaemia can directly impair kidney function by affecting the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine and by causing nephrocalcinosis, which is calcium deposition in the kidneys. All of these can lead to oliguria. So, it seems plausible that oliguria could be a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\nLet me double-check. I know that one of the manifestations of severe hypercalcaemia is kidney dysfunction, which can include decreased urine output. So, yes, oliguria can be a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\nGiven that, let's summarize:\n\n- Option A is false because calcitonin lowers, not raises, plasma calcium.\n\n- Option B might not be entirely accurate because while some cases of primary hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic, many present with symptoms.\n\n- Option C is false because vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands.\n\n- Option D is true because oliguria can be a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
