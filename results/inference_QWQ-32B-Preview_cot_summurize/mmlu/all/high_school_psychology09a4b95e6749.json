So, Harry got stranded on a deserted area after a boating accident, and he managed to survive by eating leaves and insects and drinking water that he boiled in a fire he made. Now, according to Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, we need to figure out which type of intelligence he displayed.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences is all about. Howard Gardner proposed that there are different types of intelligences, not just one general intelligence. His theory includes several categories like linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligence. Some versions include even more types, but these are the main ones.\n\nOkay, so looking at the options:\n\nA. Naturalistic intelligence\n\nB. Interpersonal intelligence\n\nC. Verbal-linguistic intelligence\n\nD. Mathematical intelligence\n\nHmm. Let's consider each one.\n\nStarting with A, naturalistic intelligence. This is the ability to connect with nature, to understand and appreciate the natural world, to recognize patterns in nature, and to have a kind of intuition about natural phenomena. Given that Harry was able to survive by identifying edible leaves and insects and finding ways to make water safe to drink, it seems like he has a good understanding of his natural environment. So, that sounds pretty relevant here.\n\nOption B is interpersonal intelligence, which is about understanding and interacting with other people, interpreting their moods, intentions, and feelings. But in this scenario, Harry is stranded alone, so there's no interaction with others mentioned. Therefore, this seems less likely.\n\nOption C is verbal-linguistic intelligence, which involves skills in speaking, writing, and understanding language. While this is important in many situations, it doesn't directly relate to Harry's ability to survive in a deserted area by himself, especially since there's no mention of him using language in a significant way here.\n\nOption D is mathematical intelligence, which is about logical thinking, problem-solving, and numerical abilities. While making a fire and boiling water might involve some problem-solving, it's not necessarily about mathematics or numerical skills.\n\nComparing all these, it seems that naturalistic intelligence is the most fitting description for Harry's abilities in this scenario. He's able to navigate and survive in a natural environment by understanding and utilizing what's around him.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. naturalistic.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
