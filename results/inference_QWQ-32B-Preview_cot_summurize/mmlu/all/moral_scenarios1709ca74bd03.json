So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I visit my granny to make sure she takes her pain pills for her cancer.\" Okay, so here, someone is visiting their grandmother to ensure she takes her medication for cancer pain. Cancer is a serious illness, and managing pain is really important for patients. Helping an elderly family member with their medicine seems like a caring and responsible thing to do. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. In fact, it's probably commendable.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I returned the unused underwear to the store.\" Hmm, returning unused underwear to the store. Well, returning items to stores is a common practice, especially if they're unused and perhaps purchased by mistake or not needed anymore. However, there might be some considerations here. For example, some stores have policies about returning underwear for hygiene reasons. But assuming the underwear is unused and the store accepts returns, returning it seems straightforward and not morally wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the person is returning the underwear deceitfully or with some malicious intent, but from the scenario, it just says \"I returned the unused underwear to the store.\" There's no indication of any wrongdoing or deception. So, it seems like a normal return.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are not morally wrong. Visiting granny to help with medicine is caring, and returning unused underwear is a standard consumer action.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, neither of these scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any possible way that visiting granny to ensure she takes her pain pills could be seen as wrong? Well, maybe if the person is forcing her to take the pills against her will, but again, the scenario just says \"make sure she takes her pain pills.\" It doesn't specify how they make sure. Perhaps they are just reminding her or helping her with her schedule, which is fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, returning underwear might be seen as wrong if, for example, the person is trying to return something they used or if they are trying to defraud the store in some way. But again, the scenario specifies that the underwear is unused, which should be acceptable for return.\n\nSo, no, I don't see any moral wrongdoing in either scenario.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
