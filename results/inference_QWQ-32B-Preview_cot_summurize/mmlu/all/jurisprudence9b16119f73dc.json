This means that when there are questions about what a law means or how it should be applied, the courts step in to provide interpretations. This is a crucial function because it helps ensure that laws are applied consistently and fairly across the country.\n\nTo give you a better understanding, let's look at the roles of the three branches of the U.S. government:\n\n1. **Legislative Branch (Congress):** This branch is responsible for making the laws. It consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate. When Congress passes a law, it lays out the rules and regulations that govern the country.\n\n2. **Executive Branch (President and Administration):** This branch is responsible for enforcing the laws. The President, as the head of the executive branch, ensures that the laws passed by Congress are carried out. This includes managing federal agencies and departments that implement and enforce these laws.\n\n3. **Judicial Branch (Courts):** This branch interprets the laws. When there are disputes about what a law means or how it should be applied, the courts step in to provide interpretations. The Supreme Court, being the highest court in the land, has the final say on constitutional matters.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, the judicial branch has the power to interpret the law. This is why option A is correct.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not correct:\n\n- **B. Make:** Making laws is the job of the legislative branch, specifically Congress.\n\n- **C. Enforce:** Enforcing laws is the responsibility of the executive branch, led by the President.\n\n- **D. Override:** The term \"override\" in this context isn't accurate. The judicial branch can declare laws unconstitutional, which in effect invalidates them, but it doesn't \"override\" laws in the same way that the executive branch can veto legislation or the legislative branch can override a veto.\n\nUnderstanding the separation of powers among these three branches is fundamental to understanding how the U.S. government functions. Each branch has its own distinct roles and responsibilities, and they work together to ensure a system of checks and balances.\n\n**Example:**\n\nSuppose Congress passes a law that is vague or open to multiple interpretations. In such a case, if someone challenges the law in court, the judicial branch would interpret what the law means and how it should be applied. This interpretation can then set a precedent for future cases and guide both the executive branch in enforcing the law and the legislative branch in revising or clarifying the law if necessary.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n\nThe power of judicial review, which allows the courts to interpret the constitutionality of laws, was established by the Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison in 1803. This case\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u5ba1\u67e5\u56fd\u4f1a\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u603b\u7edf\u884c\u653f\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5baa\u6cd5\u7684\u6743\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u53f8\u6cd5\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, the judicial branch's primary role is to interpret the law, ensuring its proper application and alignment with the Constitution. This power is essential for maintaining the rule of law and the balance of power within the U.S. government.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n- **U.S. Constitution:** Article III outlines the structure and powers of the judicial branch.\n\n- **Marbury v. Madison (1803):** This landmark case established the principle of judicial review.\n\n- **Federalist Papers:** Particularly Federalist No. 78, written by Alexander Hamilton, discusses the role and importance of the judicial branch.\n\nI hope this explanation helps you understand the role of the judicial branch more clearly.
