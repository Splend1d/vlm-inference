As he drove up to the drive- through line, the manager of the hamburger stand informed him through the intercom system that the restaurant was closing and no further orders would be accepted. She told the man that the last car to be served was the one directly in front of him. The man became angry and yelled into the intercom machine, \"Listen, babe, I am hungry. I want two cheeseburgers, a large order of fries, and a Coke. \" The manager retorted, \"I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot accept your order. \"Shortly thereafter, the manager handed the food order to the passengers in the car immediately in front of the man's. When the man saw the manager serving that car, he became very angry, drove his automobile up to the service window and shouted at the manager, \"You can't do this to me. \" When the manager laughed, the man suddenly reached into the car's glove compartment and pulled out a gun. He aimed at the manager and fired the weapon, intending to hit her. The bullet missed the manager but hit a customer, wounding him in the head.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this law problem. It's about a guy who gets angry at a hamburger stand manager and ends up shooting and wounding a customer instead of the manager. The question is whether the customer can sue the angry guy for battery. The options are about intent and foreseeability.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what battery is in legal terms. Battery is typically defined as an intentional, unpermitted contact with someone else's person. So, in this case, the customer was contacted by the bullet, which was fired by the angry guy.\n\nOption A says the customer will be successful because the man intended to shoot the manager. But the manager wasn't hit; the customer was. So, did the guy intend to touch the customer? No, he intended to touch the manager. So, maybe this isn't the right answer.\n\nOption B says the customer will be successful because there was a \"substantial certainty\" that the customer would be hit by the bullet. Hmm, I'm not sure what \"substantial certainty\" means in this context. Does it mean that the guy should have known that his action would probably hurt someone, even if not specifically the manager? Maybe.\n\nOption C says the customer will be unsuccessful because the man could not foresee that the bullet would hit anyone other than the manager. But, in reality, when you fire a gun in a public place, especially in a drive-through where there are other people, it's reasonably foreseeable that you might hit someone other than your intended target. So, maybe this isn't the case.\n\nOption D says the customer will be unsuccessful because the man did not intend to shoot the customer. This seems similar to option A. The guy didn't mean to shoot the customer; he meant to shoot the manager. So, does that mean the customer can't sue for battery?\n\nI think the key here is understanding transfer of intent in tort law. In battery, intent can transfer to an unintended victim. So, if someone intends to hit A but accidentally hits B instead, B can sue for battery because the intent to harm was present, even if it was directed at someone else.\n\nAlso, there's the concept of foreseeability. If the act was foreseeable to cause harm to someone, even if not specifically to B, then maybe the battery claim stands.\n\nIn this scenario, the guy intended to shoot the manager, but he should have foreseen that his action could harm others in the area. Especially in a drive-through, there are likely other customers around.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Successful because he intended to shoot the manager. But he didn't hit the manager; he hit the customer. So, is the intent transferable to the customer?\n\nB. Successful because there was substantial certainty that someone would be hit. This seems broad, but maybe applicable since firing a gun in a public area is likely to hit someone.\n\nC. Unsuccessful because he couldn't foresee hitting anyone else. But, as I thought earlier, firing a gun in a public area is foreseeable to hit someone.\n\nD. Unsuccessful because he didn't intend to shoot the customer. But in tort law, intent to harm one person that results in harm to another can still be actionable.\n\nI recall that in tort law, intent in battery is about the intention to make contact, not necessarily to harm or to contact a specific person. So, if someone intends to make contact with A but ends up contacting B, B can still bring a battery claim.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the bullet missed the manager and hit the customer doesn't negate the intent to make contact; it just resulted in contact with a different person.\n\nSo, perhaps option A is correct: the customer will be successful because the man intended to shoot the manager.\n\nBut option D says unsuccessful because the man did not intend to shoot the customer. That seems contradictory.\n\nI need to think about how intent transfers in torts. In criminal law, intent can transfer in certain situations, like assault or battery. If you intend to hit A but end up hitting B, B can still hold you liable for battery.\n\nSimilarly, in civil law, the intent to make contact transfers to whoever is actually contacted.\n\nTherefore, since the guy intended to make contact (by shooting) the manager, and he did make contact with the customer, the customer can bring a battery claim.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nOption B mentions \"substantial certainty,\" which is more related to recklessness or negligence, not necessarily to intent. In battery, intent is key, not just negligence.\n\nOption C says the man could not foresee hitting anyone else. But, as I thought earlier, firing a gun in a public area is foreseeable to hit someone, so this might not hold up.\n\nOption D says the man did not intend to shoot the customer, but in tort law, intent to make contact is what matters, not the specific person intended.\n\nTherefore, the customer should be successful in his battery claim against the angry guy, based on the transfer of intent.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
