We have a operation defined by three conditions:\n\n1. \\( r \\# 0 = r \\)\n\n2. \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\)\n\n3. \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r \\# s) + s + 1 \\)\n\nAnd we need to find the value of \\( 11 \\# 5 \\).\n\nFirst, I notice that the operation is commutative because \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\). That might be helpful.\n\nAlso, the third condition seems like a recursive relationship that allows us to build up the value of \\( r \\# s \\) by incrementing \\( r \\).\n\nMaybe I can start by understanding what \\( r \\# s \\) is in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( s \\). Let's see if I can find a pattern or a general formula.\n\nLet's try to compute some small values to see if a pattern emerges.\n\nLet's compute \\( 0 \\# s \\):\n\nFrom condition 1, \\( 0 \\# s = s \\# 0 = s \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0 \\# s = s \\).\n\nNow, let's compute \\( 1 \\# s \\):\n\nUsing condition 3, \\( 1 \\# s = (0 + 1) \\# s = (0 \\# s) + s + 1 = s + s + 1 = 2s + 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 1 \\# s = 2s + 1 \\).\n\nNext, let's compute \\( 2 \\# s \\):\n\nAgain, using condition 3, \\( 2 \\# s = (1 + 1) \\# s = (1 \\# s) + s + 1 = (2s + 1) + s + 1 = 3s + 2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 2 \\# s = 3s + 2 \\).\n\nLet's do \\( 3 \\# s \\):\n\n\\( 3 \\# s = (2 + 1) \\# s = (2 \\# s) + s + 1 = (3s + 2) + s + 1 = 4s + 3 \\).\n\nHmm, a pattern is emerging here. It seems like \\( r \\# s = (r + 1)s + r \\).\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nFor \\( r = 0 \\), \\( 0 \\# s = s = (0 + 1)s + 0 = s \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( r = 1 \\), \\( 1 \\# s = 2s + 1 = (1 + 1)s + 1 \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( r = 2 \\), \\( 2 \\# s = 3s + 2 = (2 + 1)s + 2 \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( r = 3 \\), \\( 3 \\# s = 4s + 3 = (3 + 1)s + 3 \\). Correct.\n\nSo, it seems like in general, \\( r \\# s = (r + 1)s + r \\).\n\nWait a minute, but let's verify this with the conditions given.\n\nFirst condition: \\( r \\# 0 = r \\).\n\nUsing our formula: \\( r \\# 0 = (r + 1)(0) + r = 0 + r = r \\). Correct.\n\nSecond condition: \\( r \\# s = s \\# r \\).\n\nUsing our formula: \\( r \\# s = (r + 1)s + r \\) and \\( s \\# r = (s + 1)r + s \\).\n\nAre these equal?\n\n\\( (r + 1)s + r = (s + 1)r + s \\)\n\nLet's expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\( rs + s + r \\)\n\nRight side: \\( sr + r + s \\)\n\nThey are equal since multiplication is commutative. So, the commutative property holds.\n\nThird condition: \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r \\# s) + s + 1 \\)\n\nUsing our formula:\n\nLeft side: \\( (r + 1) \\# s = (r + 1 + 1)s + (r + 1) = (r + 2)s + r + 1 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( (r \\# s) + s + 1 = [(r + 1)s + r] + s + 1 = (r + 1)s + r + s + 1 = (r + 1 + 1)s + r + 1 = (r + 2)s + r + 1 \\)\n\nBoth sides match, so our formula seems consistent with all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, \\( r \\# s = (r + 1)s + r \\).\n\nNow, to find \\( 11 \\# 5 \\):\n\n\\( 11 \\# 5 = (11 + 1)(5) + 11 = 12 \\times 5 + 11 = 60 + 11 = 71 \\).\n\nSo, the value is 71.\n\nLooking back, I see that option D is 71, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the recursive relationship repeatedly until I reach \\( 11 \\# 5 \\).\n\nStarting with \\( 0 \\# s = s \\), then:\n\n\\( 1 \\# s = 2s + 1 \\)\n\n\\( 2 \\# s = 3s + 2 \\)\n\n\\( 3 \\# s = 4s + 3 \\)\n\n\\( 4 \\# s = 5s + 4 \\)\n\n\\( 5 \\# s = 6s + 5 \\)\n\n\\( 6 \\# s = 7s + 6 \\)\n\n\\( 7 \\# s = 8s + 7 \\)\n\n\\( 8 \\# s = 9s + 8 \\)\n\n\\( 9 \\# s = 10s + 9 \\)\n\n\\( 10 \\# s = 11s + 10 \\)\n\n\\( 11 \\# s = 12s + 11 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 11 \\# 5 = 12 \\times 5 + 11 = 60 + 11 = 71 \\).\n\nThis matches our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, since the operation is commutative, \\( 11 \\# 5 = 5 \\# 11 \\).\n\nLet's compute \\( 5 \\# 11 \\):\n\nUsing our formula, \\( r \\# s = (r + 1)s + r \\), so \\( 5 \\# 11 = (5 + 1) \\times 11 + 5 = 6 \\times 11 + 5 = 66 + 5 = 71 \\).\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think it's safe to conclude that the value is 71.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{71} \\]"
