                    "text": "To find the standard deviation of the total student costs per semester, we need to consider all the different components of the costs and how they vary. The total cost is the sum of several independent components: tuition, books, room and board, and personal expenditure. Since these components are independent, the variance of the total cost is the sum of the variances of each component. The standard deviation is then the square root of this total variance.\n\nLet's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the components and their costs:**\n   - Tuition: $4500 (this is a fixed cost, so its standard deviation is $0)\n   - Books: mean $350, standard deviation $65\n   - Room and board: mean $2800, standard deviation $380\n   - Personal expenditure: mean $675, standard deviation $125\n\n2. **Calculate the variance for each component:**\n   - Variance is the square of the standard deviation.\n   - Tuition: since it's fixed, variance = \\(0^2 = 0\\)\n   - Books: variance = \\(65^2 = 4225\\)\n   - Room and board: variance = \\(380^2 = 144400\\)\n   - Personal expenditure: variance = \\(125^2 = 15625\\)\n\n3. **Sum the variances:**\n   - Total variance = 0 + 4225 + 144400 + 15625 = 164250\n\n4. **Calculate the standard deviation:**\n   - Standard deviation = \\(\\sqrt{164250} \\approx 405.28\\)\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of the total student costs is approximately $405.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. $405.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
