After a recital of a case of peculiar hardship one of them exclaimed: \"Wouldn't it be fine if we had a boarding club of our own, and then we could stand behind each other in a time like this?\" After that events moved quickly.

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Jane Addams' book \"Twenty Years at Hull House,\" and it's about a meeting she had with working girls during a strike at a shoe factory. So, Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago where Jane Addams and other social reformers lived and worked to help improve the lives of the poor and immigrant populations in the area.\n\nIn this particular instance, during the meeting, the girls were discussing their struggles, especially those who were paying board and were worried about being evicted if they fell behind on payments because of the strike. One of them suggested having their own boarding club where they could support each other during tough times like strikes.\n\nSo, Jane Addams and others at Hull House helped them get started by renting and furnishing two apartments near Hull House. Hull House covered the furniture and the first month's rent, but after that, the members were supposed to manage the club themselves.\n\nBy the end of the third year, the club had grown to occupy all six apartments in the building and had fifty members. So, it seems like the initiative was successful and helped the working girls support each other.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option best reflects Jane Addams' perspective in this passage. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Poor people need the leadership of reformers like herself.\n\nB. Poor people need support in helping themselves.\n\nC. Poor people don't need outside help.\n\nD. Poor people don't deserve help.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that poor people need the leadership of reformers like Jane Addams. While it's true that Jane Addams and Hull House provided some initial help, like covering furniture and the first month's rent, the passage emphasizes that beyond that, the members managed the club themselves. So, it seems like Jane Addams believed in empowering the poor to help themselves rather than just leading them.\n\nOption B says that poor people need support in helping themselves. This seems consistent with what happened here. Hull House provided some initial support, but the members were expected to manage the club themselves, which aligns with the idea of supporting them in helping themselves.\n\nOption C states that poor people don't need outside help. But in this case, Hull House did provide some outside help, so this doesn't seem to reflect Jane Addams' perspective accurately.\n\nOption D says that poor people don't deserve help. Clearly, Jane Addams and Hull House were providing help, so this is opposite to her perspective.\n\nBetween options A and B, I think option B is better because the passage emphasizes that after the initial support, the members managed the club themselves. This suggests that Jane Addams believed in supporting the poor to help themselves rather than just leading them.\n\nAlso, throughout her work at Hull House, Jane Addams was known for her philosophy of \"social housekeeping,\" which involved providing resources and opportunities for the poor to improve their own lives, rather than simply dictating what they should do.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Poor people need support in helping themselves.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
