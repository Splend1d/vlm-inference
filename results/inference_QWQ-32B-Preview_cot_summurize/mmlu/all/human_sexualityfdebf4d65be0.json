                    "text": "I'm trying to remember what mini-pills contain. I think they are a type of birth control pill, right? I recall that there are different kinds of birth control pills, some with both estrogen and progestin, and others with just one hormone. So, mini-pills probably contain only one hormone. But which one is it? Estrogen or progestin?\n\nLet me think about this. I know that combined oral contraceptives have both estrogen and progestin. So, if mini-pills are different, maybe they have only progestin. That seems plausible. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up or recall from when I learned about this.\n\nWait, I think I've heard that progestin-only pills are sometimes called mini-pills. So, if that's the case, then they must contain only progestin. But maybe they have something else too. Option B says \"progestin only,\" which seems likely.\n\nOption A is \"estrogen only.\" That sounds possible too, but I think estrogen-only pills exist, but they're not typically called mini-pills. Maybe for menopausal hormone therapy or something like that.\n\nOption C is \"synthetic androgens and estrogen.\" Hmm, synthetic androgens are like synthetic testosterone, right? I don't think birth control pills contain androgens; in fact, androgens are often used in treatments for conditions like hyperandrogenism, but not in mini-pills.\n\nOption D is \"synthetic estrogen.\" Well, if mini-pills contain synthetic estrogen only, that could be a possibility, but I think they're progestin-only.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me try to recall the mechanism of action. Progestin thickens cervical mucus and inhibits ovulation, preventing sperm from reaching the egg. Estrogen does different things, like regulating the menstrual cycle. So, if mini-pills are designed to prevent pregnancy through progestin's actions, then it makes sense that they contain progestin only.\n\nMoreover, I think there are reasons why someone might choose progestin-only pills, like if they can't take estrogen for medical reasons. So, that reinforces the idea that mini-pills are progestin only.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether there are any estrogen-only mini-pills. I'm not sure; perhaps in some contexts, but based on what I know, progestin-only pills are the standard mini-pills.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B: progestin only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
