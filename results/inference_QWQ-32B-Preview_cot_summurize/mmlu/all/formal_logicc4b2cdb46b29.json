The proposition we're given is:\n\n(\u2203x)[Hx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy)]\n\nFirst, let's break it down using the translation key provided:\n\n- Ax: x is an apartment\n\n- Hx: x is a house\n\n- Lx: x is large\n\n- Bxy: x is bigger than y\n\nSo, the proposition is:\n\n(\u2203x)[Hx \u2022 (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy)]\n\nThis can be read as:\n\n\"There exists an x such that x is a house and for all y, if y is an apartment, then x is bigger than y.\"\n\nLet's try to translate this into plain English.\n\nFirst, (\u2203x)[Hx ...] means \"there is at least one house\" or \"some house.\"\n\nThen, (\u2200y)(Ay \u2283 Bxy) means \"for all y, if y is an apartment, then x is bigger than y.\" In other words, \"every apartment is smaller than x.\"\n\nPutting it together: \"There is some house that is bigger than every apartment.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Some houses are smaller than all apartments.\n\nB. Every house is bigger than every apartment.\n\nC. Some apartment is smaller than every house.\n\nD. Some houses are bigger than every apartment.\n\nOption A says \"some houses are smaller than all apartments.\" That's not what our proposition says. Our proposition says that there is at least one house that is bigger than all apartments.\n\nOption B says \"every house is bigger than every apartment.\" But our proposition only says that there exists at least one house that is bigger than all apartments, not that all houses are bigger than all apartments.\n\nOption C says \"some apartment is smaller than every house.\" This is different from our proposition. Our proposition is about a house being bigger than all apartments, not about an apartment being smaller than all houses.\n\nOption D says \"some houses are bigger than every apartment.\" This matches our interpretation of the proposition.\n\nTherefore, the best English interpretation is option D: \"Some houses are bigger than every apartment.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
