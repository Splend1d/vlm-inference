                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. Mr. Hamm puts $0.45 worth of sauce on each pizza he makes. The question is about identifying what this cost of sauce represents in terms of his costs.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the different types of costs in economics:\n\n1. **Total Fixed Costs (TFC):** These are costs that don't change with the level of output. For example, rent, salaries of permanent staff, etc.\n\n2. **Total Variable Costs (TVC):** These costs vary directly with the level of output. For example, raw materials, utilities that increase with production, etc.\n\n3. **Marginal Cost (MC):** This is the cost of producing one additional unit of output. It's calculated as the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity.\n\n4. **Total Costs (TC):** This is the sum of total fixed costs and total variable costs. TC = TFC + TVC.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the sauce is something that Mr. Hamm uses for each pizza he makes. So, the cost of sauce depends on how many pizzas he makes. If he makes more pizzas, he needs more sauce, and thus the cost increases. Conversely, if he makes fewer pizzas, he uses less sauce, and the cost decreases.\n\nGiven this, the cost of sauce seems to be a variable cost because it varies with the output level. So, it should be part of the Total Variable Costs (TVC).\n\nNext, Marginal Cost is the cost of producing one more pizza. Since each additional pizza requires an extra $0.45 worth of sauce, the sauce cost would be a part of the marginal cost.\n\nTotal Costs include all costs, both fixed and variable. Since the cost of sauce is a variable cost, it is included in total costs.\n\nTotal Fixed Costs are costs that don't change with output, and since the sauce cost varies with the number of pizzas, it shouldn't be included in total fixed costs.\n\nSo, the cost of pizza sauce is a component of:\n\n- Total Variable Costs (II)\n\n- Marginal Cost (III)\n\n- Total Costs (IV)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. II, III, and IV only.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is the cost of sauce really part of marginal cost? Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit. Since each additional pizza requires $0.45 worth of sauce, yes, that $0.45 is indeed part of the marginal cost.\n\nAlso, since total costs include all costs, and sauce is a variable cost, it's part of total costs.\n\nAnd it's not part of total fixed costs because it varies with output.\n\nSo, yes, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any way that the cost of sauce could be considered a fixed cost. For example, if Mr. Hamm buys sauce in bulk and has to pay a fixed amount regardless of how much he uses, but in this scenario, it's specified that he places $0.45 worth of sauce on each pizza. This suggests that the cost is directly proportional to the number of pizzas, which makes it a variable cost.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. II, III, and IV only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
