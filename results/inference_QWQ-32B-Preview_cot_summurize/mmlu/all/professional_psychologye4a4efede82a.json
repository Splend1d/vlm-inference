The options are:\n\nA. state/provincial regulatory boards\n\nB. state/provincial psychological associations\n\nC. individual psychologists\n\nD. the APA and the Canadian Psychological Association\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"statutory responsibility\" means. I think it refers to a legal obligation that is established by laws or statutes. So, it's about which entity has the legal duty to set these standards.\n\nLet's consider option A: state/provincial regulatory boards. These are usually government bodies that oversee a particular profession. They often have the power to license professionals, set practice standards, and handle complaints or disciplinary actions. It seems plausible that they would have the statutory responsibility for setting minimal standards for professional competency.\n\nOption B: state/provincial psychological associations. These are usually professional organizations that psychologists can join. They might provide resources, continuing education, and support for their members, but I'm not sure if they have the legal authority to set mandatory standards for the entire profession.\n\nOption C: individual psychologists. While individual psychologists are responsible for their own competence and adhering to ethical standards, it's unlikely that each individual would have the statutory responsibility to set minimal standards for the entire profession.\n\nOption D: the APA and the Canadian Psychological Association. These are the American Psychological Association and the Canadian Psychological Association, respectively. They are national professional organizations that provide guidelines and standards for the practice of psychology. However, I think their role is more advisory and they don't have statutory authority to set legal standards across all states or provinces.\n\nConsidering this, it seems like state/provincial regulatory boards would be the most likely answer because they have the legal authority to regulate the profession and set standards that practitioners must meet to be licensed and practice legally.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a shared responsibility or some variation based on the country or region.\n\nIn the United States, each state has its own psychological association and regulatory board. The state regulatory boards are responsible for licensing psychologists and enforcing practice standards to protect the public. The APA provides guidelines and ethical standards, but it's up to the state boards to enforce them.\n\nSimilarly, in Canada, provincial psychological associations and regulatory colleges have the responsibility for regulating the practice of psychology in their respective provinces.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the state or provincial regulatory boards have the statutory responsibility for establishing minimal standards for professional competency.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. state/provincial regulatory boards.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
