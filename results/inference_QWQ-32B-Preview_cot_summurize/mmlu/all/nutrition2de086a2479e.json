                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the glycaemic index, and I need to pick the correct definition from these options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A says: \"The increase in blood glucose concentration after consuming the food.\" Hmm, that sounds related, but I think there's more to it. The glycaemic index is about how quickly foods raise blood sugar levels, but I recall that it's compared to something else to standardize it.\n\nOption B says: \"The increase in blood glucose concentration after consuming the food compared with that after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread.\" Okay, this sounds more comprehensive. It mentions comparing the food to white bread, which I think is a standard reference food in glycaemic index measurements.\n\nOption C is: \"The increase in blood insulin concentration after consuming the food.\" Wait, this is about insulin, not glucose. I think glycaemic index is specifically about glucose, not insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels, but the index itself measures the glucose response.\n\nOption D is: \"The increase in blood insulin concentration after consuming the food compared with that after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread.\" Again, this is about insulin, not glucose. Even though insulin and glucose are related, I believe the glycaemic index is focused on glucose levels.\n\nSo, based on what I remember, the glycaemic index is a ranking system of foods based on their immediate effect on blood glucose levels. It compares the blood glucose response to a particular food to that of a reference food, which is often glucose or, in some systems, white bread.\n\nI think option B is the correct definition because it mentions the comparison to white bread, which is a common reference point in determining the glycaemic index. Using white bread as a reference allows for standardization across different foods.\n\nOption A is too vague because it doesn't mention any comparison. The glycaemic index isn't just about how much blood glucose increases after eating a food; it's about how that increase compares to a standard reference food.\n\nOptions C and D are about insulin, which is not directly what the glycaemic index measures. The glycaemic index is specifically about glucose response, not insulin response.\n\nLet me double-check this. I recall that the glycaemic index is a measure of the potency of foods to increase blood glucose levels. It's a relative ranking, meaning it's compared to a standard reference food. White bread is often used as that reference, especially in some countries, while in others, pure glucose is used.\n\nSo, if a food has a high glycaemic index, it means that it causes a rapid increase in blood glucose levels compared to the reference food. Conversely, a low glycaemic index food causes a more gradual and sustained increase in blood glucose.\n\nTherefore, the correct definition should include both the measurement of blood glucose increase and the comparison to a reference food, which in this case is white bread.\n\nHence, option B seems to be the accurate definition.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider why options C and D are incorrect. These options talk about insulin concentration instead of glucose. While it's true that insulin levels can correlate with glucose levels, because insulin helps regulate blood glucose, the glycaemic index specifically refers to glucose response, not insulin response.\n\nThere is actually another concept called the insulin index, which measures the insulin response to foods, but that's different from the glycaemic index.\n\nSo, in summary, the glycaemic index is about the glucose response compared to a reference food, which is why option B is the correct definition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
