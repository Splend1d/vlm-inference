                    "text": "I think the answer is D. Green Revolution. I've heard about it in my economics class. It was a movement that started in the mid-20th century where developed countries tried to help increase agricultural production in developing countries by introducing new technologies, like better seeds and fertilizers. The goal was to reduce hunger and poverty by making farming more efficient.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. The First Agricultural Revolution, that's probably the Neolithic Revolution, right? When humans first started farming instead of hunting and gathering. That doesn't fit here.\n\nThe Second Agricultural Revolution might refer to the improvements in agriculture during the Industrial Revolution, with machinery and new farming techniques. But that was mainly in core countries, not focused on helping the periphery.\n\nThe Third Agricultural Revolution could be related to genetic engineering and biotechnology in farming, which is more recent. But the question seems to be referring to a mid-20th century effort.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D. Green Revolution is the correct answer. I remember reading about Norman Borlaug and his work on developing high-yield wheat varieties that were distributed to developing countries. That was a key part of the Green Revolution.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look it up online to confirm. Wait, actually, since this is a quiz question, I should probably stick to what I know and not cheat by looking it up. Plus, I'm pretty confident with my answer.\n\nAlright, I'll go with D. Green Revolution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
