Yes, because the rules permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility.\nB.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. It's a bit sensitive, but I'll try to approach it objectively based on the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\nSo, the scenario is that a college student is charged with rape, and he wants to call witnesses who will testify about the victim's sexual history, specifically that she was promiscuous and had relations with multiple men. The question is whether the trial court is likely to allow this testimony.\n\nOption A says yes, because the rules permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility. But I think I need to check what the Federal Rules of Evidence say about this.\n\nI recall that there are specific rules regarding evidence of a victim's sexual history in sexual assault cases. I think it's Rule 412 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which deals with evidence of a victim's sexual behavior or alleged sexual predisposition.\n\nLet me look that up.\n\nOkay, Rule 412 states that in cases involving sexual assault, evidence about the victim's sexual behavior or sexual predisposition is not admissible. There are some exceptions, but they are very limited.\n\nSo, generally, evidence of the victim's sexual history is excluded to protect the victim from unfair prejudice and to prevent the trial from focusing on the victim's past rather than on the accused's actions.\n\nGiven that, option A seems incorrect because the rules do not permit evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition to test credibility. In fact, Rule 412 specifically prohibits such evidence.\n\nOption B says yes, because the evidence will help the jury see that there may be two sides to the story and that the woman was thus the sexual predator instead of the man.\n\nThis seems like an attempt to shift blame onto the victim based on her past sexual behavior. However, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, especially Rule 412, such evidence is generally inadmissible. The victim's past sexual behavior is not relevant to whether the accused committed the act of rape.\n\nMoreover, suggesting that because someone is promiscuous, they are more likely to be a sexual predator is illogical and potentially sexist. Promiscuity does not make someone a predator; it's about consent and force, which are the key elements in a rape case.\n\nOption C says no, because such \"sexual predisposition\" evidence is generally prohibited by the rules of evidence except under narrow exceptions.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I've found in Rule 412. The rule prohibits evidence of the victim's sexual behavior or predisposition, with limited exceptions, such as when the accused presents evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual behavior with others to prove that someone else was the source of physical evidence, or when the evidence is essential to prove a claim of sexual assault by a third party.\n\nBut in this case, the witnesses are simply testifying to the woman's promiscuity, which doesn't seem to fit into any of the exceptions.\n\nTherefore, option C appears to be correct.\n\nOption D says no, because the rules of evidence prohibit all evidence of a victim's prior sexual history.\n\nThis is similar to option C, but it's a bit too broad. While Rule 412 generally prohibits such evidence, there are exceptions where it can be admitted. So, saying \"all evidence\" might not be entirely accurate because there are circumstances where such evidence can be admitted.\n\nComparing options C and D, option C is more precise because it acknowledges that there are narrow exceptions to the rule, whereas option D suggests that all such evidence is prohibited without exception.\n\nTherefore, option C is likely the best answer.\n\nTo summarize, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 412, evidence of a victim's sexual predisposition is generally prohibited in sexual assault cases, except under narrow circumstances. Therefore, the trial court is unlikely to permit the witnesses to testify about the woman's sexual history in this rape case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
