                    "text": "To determine which of these substances releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body, we need to look at their energy yields per gram. The energy yield is typically measured in kilocalories (kcal) or kilojoules (kJ) per gram.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. One gram of glucose\n\nGlucose is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates generally provide about 4 kcal per gram. So, one gram of glucose would yield approximately 4 kcal.\n\nB. One gram of palmitic acid\n\nPalmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms. Fats and fatty acids typically provide about 9 kcal per gram. Therefore, one gram of palmitic acid would yield approximately 9 kcal.\n\nC. One gram of leucine\n\nLeucine is an amino acid, which is a building block of proteins. Proteins generally provide about 4 kcal per gram. So, one gram of leucine would yield approximately 4 kcal.\n\nD. One gram of alcohol\n\nAlcohol, specifically ethanol, provides about 7 kcal per gram. Therefore, one gram of alcohol would yield approximately 7 kcal.\n\nNow, comparing these values:\n\n- Glucose: 4 kcal/g\n\n- Palmitic acid: 9 kcal/g\n\n- Leucine: 4 kcal/g\n\n- Alcohol: 7 kcal/g\n\nFrom this, it's clear that palmitic acid releases the most energy per gram when completely oxidized in the body.\n\nIt's important to note that while fats provide more energy per gram, they also require more oxygen for complete oxidation, and their metabolism is a bit more complex than that of carbohydrates or proteins. Additionally, the body's ability to utilize these different macronutrients can vary depending on the individual's metabolic state and other factors.\n\nIn summary, among the options provided, one gram of palmitic acid releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
