It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has \"the world before her.\" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the \"early and improvident marriage,\" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. \"I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,\" said a lodger in one of the Girls' Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.\n\u2014Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives, 1890\nRiis's work as an investigator of the lives of the poor can most directly be associated with which of the following?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about Jacob Riis and his work \"How the Other Half Lives\" from 1890. It seems like he was looking into the lives of poor people, especially focusing on their living and working conditions. The quote mentions a woman earning only three dollars a week, paying for a room and barely affording one meal a day. It also talks about how such conditions might drive young women to make difficult choices just to survive.\n\nSo, Riis was an investigator of the lives of the poor. The question is asking which of the options\u2014Yellow Journalism, Abolitionism, The muckrakers, or Socialism\u2014his work is most directly associated with.\n\nFirst, let's think about Yellow Journalism. I know that Yellow Journalism was a type of journalism that was very sensationalistic, often exaggerating facts to sell more newspapers. It was prominent around the 1890s, the same time Riis was writing. But Riis's work seems more focused on exposing real social issues rather than sensationalizing them for profit. So, maybe not Yellow Journalism.\n\nNext, Abolitionism. That was a movement to end slavery, which was abolished by the 1860s, before Riis's book in 1890. While Riis might have been against slavery, his book is about poverty and living conditions in urban areas, not about abolishing slavery. So, probably not Abolitionism.\n\nThen, The muckrakers. I've heard this term before. Muckrakers were journalists who exposed corruption and social issues in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They aimed to bring about reform by revealing the truth about various problems in society, such as political corruption, corporate misconduct, and poor living conditions. Riis's work sounds a lot like that. He's exposing the harsh realities of poverty and advocating for change. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nLastly, Socialism. Socialism is an economic and political system where the means of production are owned collectively. While Riis might have been sympathetic to socialist ideas, his book is more about documenting the lives of the poor and raising awareness about their struggles, rather than advocating for a specific political system. So, while there might be some connection, it doesn't seem as direct as with the muckrakers.\n\nComparing all the options, it seems like The muckrakers is the most directly associated with Riis's work. He was investigating and exposing social issues to bring about reform, which is exactly what the muckrakers were known for.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
