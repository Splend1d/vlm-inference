                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these conditions shows anticipation in paternal transmission. Anticipation is when a genetic disorder becomes more severe or appears earlier in life as it is passed from one generation to the next. Paternal transmission means the trait is passed from the father to the child.\n\nFirst, I should recall what each of these conditions is.\n\nHuntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. It's known for anticipation, especially when inherited from the father.\n\nMarfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. It's an autosomal dominant condition, but I don't recall it being associated with anticipation.\n\nCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It's not typically associated with anticipation.\n\nFragile X syndrome is caused by expansions of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. It's known for anticipation, particularly in male transmission.\n\nSo, both Huntington disease and Fragile X syndrome are known for anticipation. But the question specifies paternal transmission.\n\nIn Huntington disease, anticipation is more pronounced in paternal transmission because the repeat expansion tends to be larger when passed from the father.\n\nIn Fragile X syndrome, anticipation is also observed, especially when transmitted through the male line, as the CGG repeats can expand more significantly in male gametogenesis.\n\nBut the question is asking for the condition that shows anticipation specifically in paternal transmission.\n\nLet me think about it. Both Huntington disease and Fragile X syndrome show anticipation, and in both, paternal transmission is associated with greater expansion.\n\nHowever, Huntington disease is perhaps more classically associated with anticipation in paternal transmission.\n\nBut Fragile X syndrome is also well-known for anticipation, particularly in male transmission.\n\nMaybe I need to look up which one shows more significant anticipation in paternal transmission.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether I know that both conditions show anticipation in paternal transmission, but to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Marfan syndrome or cystic fibrosis does show anticipation, and I forgot.\n\nWait, no, Marfan syndrome and cystic fibrosis are not typically associated with anticipation.\n\nSo, between Huntington disease and Fragile X syndrome, I need to choose which one is being asked about.\n\nPerhaps the answer is Huntington disease, as it's a more classic example of anticipation in paternal transmission.\n\nBut Fragile X syndrome is also correct in that regard.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting Huntington disease as the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Fragile X syndrome is the better answer because it's X-linked, and paternal transmission would involve the father passing the X chromosome to his daughters, but I think anticipation in Fragile X is more prominent in male transmission.\n\nWait, males have one X chromosome, so when they pass it to their daughters, the CGG repeats can be more unstable.\n\nBut I think in both Huntington disease and Fragile X syndrome, paternal transmission is associated with greater repeat expansion and thus greater anticipation.\n\nMaybe the question is trying to test the understanding that anticipation occurs in trinucleotide repeat disorders, of which Huntington disease and Fragile X syndrome are examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Marfan syndrome or cystic fibrosis can sometimes show anticipation, but I don't think that's standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, Marfan syndrome can show variable expression, but anticipation is not a typical feature.\n\nSimilarly, cystic fibrosis is caused by specific mutations and doesn't typically show anticipation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is either Huntington disease or Fragile X syndrome.\n\nIf I had to choose one, I would go with Huntington disease, as it's perhaps the most well-known example of anticipation in paternal transmission.\n\nBut I should double-check.\n\nLet me recall: Huntington disease is caused by CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene, and these expansions tend to be larger when inherited from the father, leading to earlier onset and possibly more severe disease in the offspring.\n\nFragile X syndrome is caused by CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene, and similar to Huntington disease, these repeats can expand more when transmitted through the father.\n\nHowever, in Fragile X syndrome, the anticipation is also significant, but perhaps the question is focusing on Huntington disease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is both A and D, but since it's a single-choice question, perhaps I need to choose the one that is most prominently associated with anticipation in paternal transmission.\n\nGiven that, Huntington disease might be the best answer.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. Huntington disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
