                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about international law. The question is: \"Are the peremptory norms of international law the only norms that set out obligations erga omnes?\" And we have options A through D to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"peremptory norms\" and \"obligations erga omnes\" mean in international law.\n\nPeremptory norms, also known as jus cogens, are fundamental principles of international law that are accepted by the international community as a whole. They are norms from which no derogation is permitted, and they take precedence over other norms of international law. Examples include prohibitions against genocide, slavery, torture, and wars of aggression.\n\nObligations erga omnes are legal obligations that a state has towards the international community as a whole, not just towards specific states. These obligations are meant to protect certain interests that are common to all states or to humanity as a whole.\n\nNow, the question is asking whether peremptory norms are the only source of obligations erga omnes.\n\nOption A says \"Yes,\" meaning that only peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes. Option B says \"No, acts of international organizations also set out such obligations.\" Option C says \"No, decisions of international courts also set out such obligations.\" Option D says \"No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts.\"\n\nI need to think about whether peremptory norms are the sole source of obligations erga omnes or if there are other sources as well.\n\nI recall that obligations erga omnes can arise from various sources in international law, not just from peremptory norms. For example, certain treaty provisions can create obligations that benefit the international community as a whole. Also, unilateral acts by states, such as declarations or commitments, can sometimes give rise to erga omnes obligations.\n\nMoreover, acts of international organizations and decisions of international courts can interpret and apply existing norms, including obligations erga omnes, but I'm not sure if they directly set out new obligations.\n\nLet me consider option B: \"No, acts of international organizations also set out such obligations.\" While international organizations can play a role in codifying and interpreting international law, I'm not sure if their acts directly create new erga omnes obligations. Perhaps in some cases, like adopting resolutions that reflect customary international law, but it might not be accurate to say that their acts set out such obligations in the same way as peremptory norms or treaties.\n\nOption C: \"No, decisions of international courts also set out such obligations.\" International courts, such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), interpret and apply international law, but they don't typically create new obligations. Their decisions can clarify existing obligations, including erga omnes obligations, but I don't think they set out new ones ex nihilo.\n\nOption D: \"No, even though all peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, the latter may also spring from treaties regulating objective regimes or unilateral acts.\" This seems plausible. Treaties that regulate objective regimes, such as the law of the sea or outer space, can create obligations that benefit all states. Unilateral acts, like declarations of permanent neutrality or offers of assistance, can also give rise to obligations erga omnes.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that peremptory norms are not the only source of obligations erga omnes. Other sources, such as treaties and unilateral acts, can also create such obligations.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. But let me double-check.\n\nOption A is too narrow, as it suggests that only peremptory norms create obligations erga omnes, which doesn't align with my understanding.\n\nOption B mentions acts of international organizations, but I'm not entirely sure if they directly set out such obligations.\n\nOption C refers to decisions of international courts, which again, primarily interpret existing law rather than set out new obligations.\n\nOption D acknowledges that peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes but allows for other sources as well, which aligns with my thinking.\n\nTo be thorough, I should consider if there are any other sources of obligations erga omnes. Customary international law is another source of international law, and it could potentially give rise to erga omnes obligations. For example, the prohibition against piracy is a customary norm that benefits all states.\n\nHowever, customary international law is distinct from peremptory norms, although some customary norms may rise to the level of jus cogens. But not all customary norms are peremptory norms.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that customary international law, apart from peremptory norms, can also create obligations erga omnes.\n\nGiven that, option D seems the most comprehensive, as it acknowledges that while peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, these obligations can also arise from other sources like treaties and unilateral acts.\n\nI should also consider if acts of international organizations or decisions of international courts can create obligations erga omnes. For instance, a resolution by the United Nations General Assembly might reflect the consensus of the international community on a particular issue, but does that resolution itself create a new legal obligation erga omnes? It's a bit nuanced.\n\nSimilarly, a decision by the ICJ might clarify the existence of an erga omnes obligation, but it doesn't create a new one.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the primary sources of obligations erga omnes are peremptory norms, treaties, and possibly unilateral acts, with customary international law also being a potential source.\n\nGiven that, option D appears to be the correct answer, as it recognizes that while peremptory norms set out obligations erga omnes, these obligations can also spring from other sources like treaties and unilateral acts.\n\nI think I've covered the main points, so I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
