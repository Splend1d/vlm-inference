                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which options correctly describe characteristics of realist theory in international relations. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The international system is anarchic.\" I know that in realist theory, the international system is often described as anarchic, meaning there's no central authority above states to enforce rules or settle disputes. States are essentially on their own, and they have to look out for their own interests. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"States assess one another in terms of their power and capabilities rather than their internal variations.\" Realism emphasizes power politics, so states are thought to evaluate each other based on their military strength, economic resources, and other capabilities that can be used to influence others. Internal variations, like different political systems or cultures, aren't as important in this calculus. So, that also sounds like a realist characteristic.\n\nOption C: \"States are unitary and rational actors; sovereign states will act in a way suited to achieving their goals.\" Realists assume that states are unitary, meaning they have one decision-making body that represents the state's interests, and they act rationally to maximize their interests. This is a key assumption in realist theory, as it simplifies the analysis of international relations by treating states as single actors pursuing their own goals in a competitive environment.\n\nOption D is \"All of these options.\" Given that options A, B, and C all seem to align with realist theory, it looks like D is the correct choice.\n\nBut let me double-check. Realist theory is primarily concerned with power and security in an anarchic international system. States are seen as the main actors, and they are assumed to be rational and unitary. They focus on their own survival and interest, often at the expense of others. So, all three options A, B, and C are indeed characteristics of realist theory.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. All of these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
