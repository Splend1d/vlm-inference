Then, if he adds the number 6 to the list, he wants to know what happens to the mean and median.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what mean and median are. The mean is the average of the numbers, and the median is the middle value when the numbers are ordered.\n\nSo, for the original list: 1, 3, 3.\n\nLet's find the mean first.\n\nMean = (sum of all numbers) / (number of numbers)\n\nSum = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7\n\nNumber of numbers = 3\n\nMean = 7 / 3 \u2248 2.333...\n\nNow, the median.\n\nSince there are 3 numbers, the median is the second one when ordered.\n\nOrdered list: 1, 3, 3\n\nMedian = 3\n\nNow, if we add 6 to the list, the new list is: 1, 3, 3, 6\n\nLet's find the new mean.\n\nSum = 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 13\n\nNumber of numbers = 4\n\nMean = 13 / 4 = 3.25\n\nSo, the mean increased from approximately 2.333 to 3.25. That means option A is correct: the mean would increase.\n\nNow, let's check the median.\n\nWith the new list: 1, 3, 3, 6\n\nSince there are 4 numbers, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd numbers.\n\nOrdered list: 1, 3, 3, 6\n\nMedian = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3\n\nSo, the median stayed the same at 3. That means neither the median increased nor decreased.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. the mean would increase. \u2192 Correct, as we saw it went from 2.333 to 3.25.\n\nB. the mean would decrease. \u2192 Incorrect.\n\nC. the median would increase. \u2192 Incorrect, median stayed the same.\n\nD. the median would decrease. \u2192 Incorrect, median stayed the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. the mean would increase.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"then\" followed by options, but it seems like it's asking which of the options are true after adding 6. Since adding 6 increases the mean and doesn't change the median, only option A is correct.\n\nI think the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
