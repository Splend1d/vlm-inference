                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about two spaceships approaching Earth from opposite directions with equal speeds, as measured by an observer on Earth. There's a meterstick on one spaceship that an occupant of the other spaceship measures to be 60 cm long. I need to find the speed of each spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth. The options are 0.4c, 0.5c, 0.6c, or 0.7c.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some concepts from special relativity because speeds are involved, and lengths are contracting. The key idea here is length contraction. In special relativity, an object in motion is measured to be shorter in the direction of motion from a stationary frame. The formula for length contraction is:\n\n\\[ L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L \\) is the observed length,\n- \\( L_0 \\) is the proper length (the length in the object's rest frame),\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of the object relative to the observer,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, a meterstick on one spaceship is measured to be 60 cm long by an occupant of the other spaceship. So, the observed length \\( L \\) is 60 cm, and the proper length \\( L_0 \\) is 100 cm (since it's a meterstick).\n\nPlugging these values into the length contraction formula:\n\n\\[ 60 = 100 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nI can solve for \\( v \\):\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 100:\n\n\\[ 0.6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nThen, square both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.36 = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{0.64} = 0.8 \\]\n\nThis suggests that the relative speed between the two spaceships is 0.8c. However, the question asks for the speed of each spaceship as measured by an observer on Earth, and it states that both spaceships have equal speeds relative to Earth but are coming from opposite directions.\n\nLet's denote the speed of each spaceship relative to Earth as \\( u \\). Since they are moving towards Earth from opposite directions, their relative speed to each other is \\( u + u = 2u \\) (since their velocities add up because they are moving in opposite directions).\n\nSo, the relative speed between the two spaceships is \\( 2u \\), and we've found that this relative speed is 0.8c. Therefore:\n\n\\[ 2u = 0.8c \\]\n\n\\[ u = 0.4c \\]\n\nWait a minute, but 0.4c is one of the options (option A). But let me double-check if this makes sense.\n\nIn special relativity, velocities don't simply add up as in classical mechanics. There is a relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{u + u'}{1 + \\frac{u u'}{c^2}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( u \\) and \\( u' \\) are the velocities of two objects relative to a stationary frame, and \\( v \\) is their relative velocity.\n\nIn this case, both spaceships have speed \\( u \\) relative to Earth, but in opposite directions. So, \\( u' = -u \\), but since speed is magnitude, it's positive. Plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{u + u}{1 + \\frac{u \\cdot u}{c^2}} } = \\frac{2u}{1 + \\frac{u^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nWe found earlier that \\( v = 0.8c \\). So:\n\n\\[ 0.8c = \\frac{2u}{1 + \\frac{u^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( u \\):\n\nMultiply both sides by the denominator:\n\n\\[ 0.8c \\left(1 + \\frac{u^2}{c^2}\\right) = 2u \\]\n\n\\[ 0.8c + 0.8 \\frac{u^2}{c} = 2u \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( c \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[ 0.8c^2 + 0.8 u^2 = 2u c \\]\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[ 0.8 u^2 - 2u c + 0.8 c^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( u \\). Let's rearrange it:\n\n\\[ 0.8 u^2 - 2 c u + 0.8 c^2 = 0 \\]\n\nTo make it easier, divide the entire equation by 0.8:\n\n\\[ u^2 - 2.5 c u + c^2 = 0 \\]\n\nNow, use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( u \\):\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{2.5 c \\pm \\sqrt{(2.5 c)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c^2}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{2.5 c \\pm \\sqrt{6.25 c^2 - 4 c^2}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{2.5 c \\pm \\sqrt{2.25 c^2}}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{2.5 c \\pm 1.5 c}{2} \\]\n\nThis gives two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( u = \\frac{2.5 c + 1.5 c}{2} = \\frac{4 c}{2} = 2 c \\) (which is impossible since no object can travel faster than light)\n\n2. \\( u = \\frac{2.5 c - 1.5 c}{2} = \\frac{c}{2} = 0.5 c \\)\n\nSo, the correct speed of each spaceship relative to Earth is 0.5c.\n\nWait, but earlier I got 0.4c using a different approach. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me see where I went wrong in the first approach.\n\nIn the first approach, I assumed that the relative speed between the two spaceships is simply 2u, which is not correct in special relativity. Velocities don't add up linearly; they add up according to the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct relative speed between the two spaceships is given by:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{2u}{1 + \\frac{u^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nAnd we found that \\( v = 0.8c \\), which led to \\( u = 0.5c \\) after solving the quadratic equation.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 0.5c, which is option B.\n\nBut let me verify this again.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{2u}{1 + \\frac{u^2}{c^2}} = 0.8c \\]\n\nPlugging \\( u = 0.5c \\):\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{2 \\times 0.5c}{1 + \\frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}} = \\frac{c}{1 + 0.25} = \\frac{c}{1.25} = 0.8c \\]\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the speed of each spaceship relative to Earth is 0.5c.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.5c} \\]\n\n"
