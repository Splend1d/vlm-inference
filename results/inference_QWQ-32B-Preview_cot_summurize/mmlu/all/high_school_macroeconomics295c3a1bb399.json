                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option is an example of expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. First, I should remember what expansionary monetary policy is. It's when the Fed tries to increase the money supply in the economy to stimulate growth, lower unemployment, or fight deflation.\n\nSo, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Increasing the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate the Fed charges on loans to banks. If the Fed increases this rate, it makes borrowing from the Fed more expensive for banks. This might encourage banks to borrow less from the Fed and instead look for other sources of funds, like selling securities or reducing their lending. This could decrease the money supply, which is contractionary, not expansionary.\n\nB. Increasing the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is the amount of funds banks are required to hold in reserve and not lend out. If the Fed increases this ratio, banks have to hold more money and can lend less. This reduces the money multiplier effect and decreases the money supply. Again, this is contractionary.\n\nC. Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks. When the Fed buys Treasury securities, it pays for them by crediting the banks' reserve accounts. This increases the banks' reserves, allowing them to make more loans, which increases the money supply. This sounds like expansionary monetary policy.\n\nD. Lowering income taxes. Hmm, this seems different. Lowering income taxes is a fiscal policy action, not a monetary policy one. Fiscal policy is handled by the government, not the Fed. So, this isn't an example of monetary policy at all.\n\nBased on this, it looks like option C is the correct answer. The Fed buying Treasury securities from commercial banks is an example of expansionary monetary policy because it increases the money supply.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me double-check. Expansionary monetary policy aims to increase the money supply, which can lower interest rates and encourage borrowing and spending. Options A and B both tend to decrease the money supply, which is the opposite of what we want. Option D isn't even monetary policy. So, yes, option C is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
