The researcher observes a new variant of ferns with a distinct phenotype that can't breed with the original population but can reproduce among themselves. Let's think about what kind of speciation this represents.\n\nFirst, let's recall the different types of speciation mentioned in the options:\n\nA. Allopatric speciation occurs when a population is divided by a geographical barrier, leading to reproductive isolation and the development of separate species over time.\n\nB. Sympatric speciation happens when a new species evolves from a single ancestral species while living in the same geographic area, without any physical barriers.\n\nC. Isolated speciation isn't a standard term in evolutionary biology, so perhaps this option is meant to refer to some form of reproductive isolation, but it's not a recognized type of speciation.\n\nD. Polyploidy involves changes in the number of chromosome sets in an organism, often leading to reproductive isolation from the parent species.\n\nIn this scenario, the researcher is working in a laboratory, so geographical separation doesn't seem to be a factor. The new variant arises in the same location as the original population, suggesting that it might be a case of sympatric speciation.\n\nHowever, polyploidy is also a common mechanism in plants, including ferns, leading to instantaneous speciation events. Polyploidy can occur when there are errors in cell division, resulting in offspring with more than two sets of chromosomes. These polyploid individuals often can't breed with diploid parents but can reproduce among themselves.\n\nGiven that the new variant can't breed with the original population but can produce offspring among themselves, this could be indicative of polyploidy. In polyploid speciation, the chromosomal difference leads to reproductive isolation, which matches the observation here.\n\nAllopatric speciation requires geographical separation, which isn't mentioned in the scenario. Sympatric speciation can occur without geographical separation, but it's a broader term that includes various mechanisms, such as polyploidy.\n\nOption C, \"isolated speciation,\" isn't a standard term in evolutionary biology, so it's likely not the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the most precise answer is D. Polyploidy, as it directly relates to the chromosomal changes that can lead to reproductive isolation within the same geographic area, which matches the researcher's observations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
