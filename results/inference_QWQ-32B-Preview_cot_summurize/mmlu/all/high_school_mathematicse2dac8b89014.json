                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: I need to find out how many numbers are in the list that goes like -36, -29, -22, and so on, up to 41 and 48. The options are 12, 10, 13, or 11. Alright, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if this is an arithmetic sequence or something similar because the numbers seem to be increasing by a constant amount. Let's check the difference between consecutive terms.\n\nStarting from -36 to -29, that's an increase of 7, right? Because -29 minus -36 is -29 + 36, which is 7. Then from -29 to -22, that's again an increase of 7: -22 minus -29 is -22 + 29, which is 7. Okay, so it looks like an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 7.\n\nSo, the general form of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where:\n\n- a_n is the nth term,\n\n- a_1 is the first term,\n\n- d is the common difference,\n\n- n is the number of terms.\n\nIn this case, a_1 is -36, d is 7, and the last term a_n is 48. I need to find n.\n\nSo, plugging into the formula:\n\n48 = -36 + (n-1)*7\n\nAlright, let's solve for n.\n\nFirst, add 36 to both sides:\n\n48 + 36 = (n-1)*7\n\n84 = (n-1)*7\n\nNow, divide both sides by 7:\n\n84 / 7 = n - 1\n\n12 = n - 1\n\nSo, n = 13.\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. The options are 12, 10, 13, or 11. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations.\n\nStarting with:\n\n48 = -36 + (n-1)*7\n\nAdding 36 to both sides:\n\n48 + 36 = -36 + 36 + (n-1)*7\n\n84 = (n-1)*7\n\nDividing both sides by 7:\n\n84 / 7 = n - 1\n\n12 = n - 1\n\nSo, n = 13.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Maybe I need to check if 48 is indeed the last term.\n\nLet me see the sequence: -36, -29, -22, -15, -8, -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, 34, 41, 48.\n\nLet's count them:\n\n1. -36\n\n2. -29\n\n3. -22\n\n4. -15\n\n5. -8\n\n6. -1\n\n7. 6\n\n8. 13\n\n9. 20\n\n10. 27\n\n11. 34\n\n12. 41\n\n13. 48\n\nYes, that's 13 terms. So, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut the options include 13, so maybe I'm overthinking it. Perhaps the answer is C. 13.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"up to 41, 48\", does that mean 41 and 48 are both included in the list? From the sequence, it looks like they are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the options provided.\n\nBut based on my calculations and counting the terms, it's clearly 13 terms.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. 13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13} \\]"
