The stockbroker decided to end his life by jumping off a bridge. He walked to the middle of the bridge, climbed over the railing, stood on the tiny ledge on the edge of the bridge, and prepared to jump. A taxi driver who happened to be crossing the bridge at that moment saw what the stockbroker was doing. The taxi driver slammed on his brakes, jumped out of his taxi, started running toward the stockbroker, and yelled, \"Don't do it!\" Pleased to hear that someone cared about him, the stockbroker changed his mind about committing suicide and decided that he wanted to live. At that moment, however, the stockbroker started to lose his balance, and his feet began to slip off the small, grimy ledge of the bridge. Just as the stockbroker started to fall, the taxi driver reached him and grabbed the back of his jacket. The taxi driver hung on tightly to the jacket and nearly was pulled over the side of the bridge, but he managed to hang on. Using every bit of strength he could muster, the taxi driver pulled the stockbroker back up and onto the bridge. The stockbroker was relieved to have been saved from falling. Unfortunately, the taxi driver suffered a severe injury to his back from the strain of hanging on to the stockbroker and pulling him back up onto the bridge. A statute in the jurisdiction makes attempted suicide a crime. If the taxi driver asserts a claim against the stockbroker to recover damages for his injuries, will he prevail?\n\nA. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\nB. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction.\nC.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this problem. It seems like a law school hypothetical, testing knowledge of torts, specifically about liability for one's own suicide attempt and whether someone who intervenes to prevent it can sue the person they're trying to save for injuries sustained during the rescue attempt.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. There's a stockbroker who's despondent because of the economy and his clients' losses. He decides to jump off a bridge to commit suicide. A taxi driver sees him and tries to stop him, which changes the stockbroker's mind. But then the stockbroker starts to fall, and the taxi driver grabs him and pulls him back up, injuring his back in the process.\n\nNow, the question is whether the taxi driver can sue the stockbroker for his injuries. There are four options:\n\nA. No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\n\nB. No, because attempted suicide was a criminal offense in the jurisdiction.\n\nC. Yes, because the stockbroker put himself in a position of peril.\n\nD. Yes, because he succeeded in saving the stockbroker's life.\n\nI need to think about the legal principles involved here. In tort law, generally, people can be liable for their negligent actions that cause harm to others. But here, the stockbroker was intending to harm himself, not the taxi driver.\n\nOption A says no liability because the stockbroker didn't intend to harm anyone other than himself. That seems relevant. In tort law, intent matters, especially in intentional torts. But suicide is usually considered an act against oneself, not against others.\n\nOption B mentions that attempted suicide is a crime, so maybe that affects liability. In some jurisdictions, committing a crime can lead to civil liability if someone is harmed as a result. But here, the taxi driver is not claiming that the stockbroker's criminal act directly harmed him; rather, the harm came from trying to rescue the stockbroker.\n\nOption C says yes, because the stockbroker put himself in peril. Hmm, that seems a bit vague. Just because someone puts themselves in danger doesn't automatically make them liable for any injuries that rescuers might suffer in trying to help.\n\nOption D says yes, because the taxi driver succeeded in saving the stockbroker's life. That seems like a generous gesture, but I don't think that alone creates liability.\n\nLet me consider some legal principles. There's a concept called the \"Good Samaritan\" rule, which sometimes protects rescuers from liability when they help someone in danger. But here, it's the rescuer who is seeking to be compensated for his injuries.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there's a principle that if someone creates a risk and a rescuer steps in to mitigate that risk and gets hurt in the process, the person who created the risk can be liable for the rescuer's injuries.\n\nBut in this case, the stockbroker is the one in danger, not creating a danger to others. He's not actively harming anyone else; he's trying to harm himself.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the stockbroker is negligent for creating a situation where others might come to his rescue and get hurt. But that seems pretty removed.\n\nAlso, since attempted suicide is a crime, maybe there's some legal disability or exception that applies here.\n\nWait, I recall that in some places, attempting suicide is considered evidence of insanity, which could affect liability.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Suppose someone is about to jump off a bridge, and a rescuer tries to stop them and gets hurt in the process. Is the person who was about to jump liable for the rescuer's injuries?\n\nIn general, no, because the rescuer chose to intervene. It's a voluntary assumption of risk.\n\nBut perhaps if the person in danger should have foreseen that someone would try to rescue them and take steps to prevent harm to the rescuer.\n\nThat seems like a heavy burden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a duty to not create a situation that endangers rescuers.\n\nBut I think generally, the law doesn't impose a duty to control the actions of third parties, unless there's a special relationship.\n\nHere, there's no pre-existing relationship between the stockbroker and the taxi driver before this incident.\n\nSo, option A seems plausible: no liability because the stockbroker didn't intend to harm anyone but himself.\n\nBut option B also mentions that attempted suicide is a crime, which might have some bearing.\n\nPerhaps committing a crime can lead to civil liability for harms that occur as a result.\n\nBut in this case, the taxi driver's injuries weren't a direct result of the suicide attempt; they were a result of trying to prevent it.\n\nIt's a bit nuanced.\n\nOption C, about putting himself in peril, doesn't seem to directly impose liability on the stockbroker for the taxi driver's injuries.\n\nOption D, about saving the stockbroker's life, might suggest that there's some gratitude or obligation on the stockbroker's part, but that doesn't translate to legal liability for the taxi driver's injuries.\n\nI think the key here is the lack of intent to harm the taxi driver. The stockbroker was trying to harm himself, not anyone else.\n\nAdditionally, the taxi driver voluntarily chose to intervene and try to save the stockbroker.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the stockbroker would be liable for the taxi driver's injuries.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any exceptions or special rules that might apply here.\n\nFor example, if the stockbroker had specifically encouraged or solicited someone to come and try to stop him, that might be different.\n\nBut in this scenario, it was spontaneous; the taxi driver just happened to be passing by and saw what was happening.\n\nAnother consideration: perhaps the stockbroker had a duty to not create a situation that could foreseeably lead to harm to rescuers.\n\nBut that seems like a stretch.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the correct answer is A: No, because the stockbroker did not intend to harm anyone other than himself.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
