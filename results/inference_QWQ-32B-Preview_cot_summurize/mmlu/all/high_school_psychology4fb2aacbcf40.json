                    "text": "I've come across this question about contemporary intelligence researchers and their views on education. It mentions Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg, who are both well-known for their theories on intelligence. The question is: \"Some contemporary intelligence researchers like Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg complain that schools focus too much on...\" and then it lists four options.\n\nLet me think about this. I remember that Howard Gardner is famous for his theory of multiple intelligences, which suggests that there are different types of intelligence beyond the traditional notion of IQ. He proposes things like musical, spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligences. So, his perspective is that intelligence is diverse and that education should acknowledge and nurture these different types of intelligences.\n\nOn the other hand, Robert Sternberg is known for his triarchic theory of intelligence, which includes analytical, creative, and practical aspects of intelligence. He argues that traditional IQ tests don't capture the full range of human intelligence, particularly the creative and practical aspects.\n\nGiven their theories, it's likely that both Gardner and Sternberg would criticize educational systems that overemphasize certain types of intelligence while neglecting others. So, looking at the options:\n\nA. Nonessential subjects like art and music.\n\nB. Encouraging creative thought.\n\nC. The environmental factors that influence the expression of intelligence.\n\nD. Traditional subjects and methods.\n\nOption A suggests that schools focus too much on nonessential subjects like art and music. But, considering Gardner's emphasis on multiple intelligences, including musical and spatial intelligences, which are often associated with art and music, it's unlikely that he would complain about too much focus on these subjects. In fact, he would probably argue for more attention to them.\n\nOption B says encouraging creative thought. Again, both Gardner and Sternberg value creativity in their theories. Sternberg, in particular, includes creative intelligence as one of the three aspects of his triarchic theory. So, it's unlikely they would complain about encouraging creative thought.\n\nOption C mentions environmental factors that influence the expression of intelligence. I'm not sure what this means in the context of education. Perhaps it refers to considering the impact of the learning environment on students' intelligence expression. But this doesn't seem directly related to their main complaints about education.\n\nOption D is traditional subjects and methods. This seems plausible. Both Gardner and Sternberg have critiqued traditional educational approaches that focus heavily on subjects like math and language arts, and methods that emphasize rote memorization and standardized testing. They argue that these approaches may not adequately address the diverse intelligences and the practical, creative aspects of intelligence.\n\nSo, based on their theories, it makes sense that they would complain about schools focusing too much on traditional subjects and methods, which might not fully nurture the range of intelligences they propose.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think again. In option A, it mentions nonessential subjects like art and music. Maybe the complaint is that schools focus too much on these nonessential subjects instead of traditional academics. But that seems contrary to Gardner's views, as he would likely consider art and music essential for developing certain intelligences.\n\nOption B is about encouraging creative thought, which again, both researchers support. So, complaining about encouraging creative thought doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is a bit vague, but it doesn't align with their main criticisms.\n\nOption D seems the most logical, as both Gardner and Sternberg have argued for educational reforms that go beyond traditional subjects and methods to include a broader range of intelligences and thinking skills.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Traditional subjects and methods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
