                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which modern psychological perspective aligns closest with structuralism. The options are psychoanalysts, behaviorists, cognitivists, and humanists. I don't remember a lot about structuralism, but I think it was one of the earliest schools of psychology. Maybe I should look that up first.\n\nStructuralism, as I recall, was founded by Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener. They focused on breaking down mental processes into their most basic components, kind of like how chemists break down matter into elements. So, they used introspection to analyze feelings, sensations, and thoughts.\n\nNow, comparing that to the options:\n\nA. Psychoanalysts - I think of Sigmund Freud and his focus on the unconscious mind, dreams, and childhood experiences. That seems different from structuralism, which was more about conscious experiences and breaking them down into basic parts.\n\nB. Behaviorists - They focus on observable behaviors and external stimuli and responses. John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner are key figures here. Structuralism, on the other hand, was more about internal mental processes, which behaviorists actually rejected.\n\nC. Cognitivists - This perspective emerged later and focuses on mental processes like memory, perception, and problem-solving. It's more about how we process information internally. That sounds a bit like structuralism, which also looked at internal mental processes, but in a more elemental way.\n\nD. Humanists - They emphasize things like free will, self-actualization, and personal growth. Think Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers. This seems quite different from structuralism, which was more about analyzing the structure of the mind.\n\nSo, between these options, cognitivists seem the closest to structuralists because both look at internal mental processes, even though cognitivism is more about how we process information in a broader sense.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that structuralism was about breaking down mental processes into basic elements, while cognitivism looks at how these elements are processed and organized. So, there is a similarity in focusing on the inner workings of the mind, but cognitivism is more about the functions and processes, not just the basic elements.\n\nPerhaps behaviorists are the opposite of structuralists because behaviorists reject the study of internal mental processes altogether, focusing only on observable behaviors.\n\nHumanists seem to focus more on self-awareness and personal growth, which isn't directly related to structuralism's aim of analyzing mental components.\n\nPsychoanalysts do look into internal mental processes, but their focus is more on the unconscious and its influence on behavior, which is different from structuralism's emphasis on conscious experiences.\n\nSo, after considering all this, I still think cognitivists are the closest match to structuralists in terms of focusing on internal mental processes, even if their approaches differ in specifics.\n\nMaybe I should look up a comparison between structuralism and cognitivism to confirm.\n\nUpon looking it up, structuralism was indeed one of the earliest schools of psychology, focusing on the structure of the mind and its basic components through introspection. Cognitivism, which emerged much later, also deals with mental processes but uses more scientific and experimental methods. So, while both focus on internal mental events, cognitivism has a broader and more functional approach.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there isn't a perfect match among the options, but cognitivism is the closest in terms of interest in mental processes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe structuralism aligns more with psychoanalysis because both look into internal mental processes, but as I thought earlier, psychoanalysis has a different focus on the unconscious, which isn't the main concern of structuralism.\n\nPerhaps behaviorists are the least aligned with structuralism, given their rejection of internal mental processes.\n\nHumanists, again, focus on self-actualization and personal growth, which doesn't directly relate to structuralism's aim.\n\nSo, despite differences, I think cognitivists are the best match among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
