                    "text": "So, I've got this question here about the money market. It says, \"If the money supply increases, what happens in the money market (assuming money demand is downward sloping)?\"\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how the money market works. I remember that in the money market, there's a supply of money and a demand for money, and these interact to determine the interest rate, specifically the nominal interest rate.\n\nSo, the money supply is provided by the central bank, right? And the money demand comes from people and businesses who want to hold money for transactions, precautionary reasons, and speculative purposes.\n\nNow, the question says that money demand is downward sloping. That means that as the interest rate increases, the quantity of money demanded decreases, and vice versa. That makes sense because higher interest rates make holding money less attractive since you could earn more by putting your money in interest-bearing assets.\n\nSo, if the money supply increases, that means there's more money available in the economy. Assuming that the money demand curve remains the same, an increase in money supply should shift the supply curve to the right.\n\nIn a standard supply and demand graph, when supply increases and demand remains constant, the equilibrium price decreases. In this case, the \"price\" is the interest rate.\n\nTherefore, if the money supply increases, the equilibrium interest rate should fall.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. The nominal interest rate rises.\n\nB. The nominal interest rate falls.\n\nC. The nominal interest rate does not change.\n\nD. Transaction demand for money falls.\n\nSo, based on my reasoning, option B seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check. An increase in money supply leads to a lower demand for holding money, which should put downward pressure on interest rates. Yes, that sounds right.\n\nWait a minute, option D says \"Transaction demand for money falls.\" Is that necessarily true?\n\nWell, an increase in money supply might lead to a higher quantity of money demanded at the new lower interest rate, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the transaction demand falls. In fact, more money in circulation might even increase transaction demand.\n\nSo, I think option D isn't the right answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: The nominal interest rate falls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n"
