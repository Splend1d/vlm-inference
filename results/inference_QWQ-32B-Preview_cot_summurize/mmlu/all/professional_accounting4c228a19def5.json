                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, a company issues additional capital stock for cash. That means it's selling more shares to investors and getting cash in return. Okay, first, I need to understand how this affects the balance sheet because both ratios involve balance sheet items.\n\nStarting with the total debt to total assets ratio. This ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total assets. So, if the company issues capital stock for cash, that increases its cash, which is an asset. But, since it's issuing stock, that's under shareholders' equity, not debt. So, debt remains the same, but assets increase. Therefore, the ratio should decrease because the numerator stays the same and the denominator increases.\n\nNow, working capital is current assets minus current liabilities. Issuing stock for cash increases cash, which is a current asset, and doesn't affect current liabilities. So, working capital should increase.\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure about that. When a company issues stock, it records the cash received and increases shareholders' equity by the same amount. So, assets go up by the cash received, and equity goes up by the same amount. Liabilities are unaffected in this transaction.\n\nSo, for the total debt to total assets ratio:\n\nTotal debt remains the same, total assets increase, so the ratio decreases.\n\nFor working capital:\n\nCurrent assets increase (cash increases), current liabilities remain the same, so working capital increases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Decrease Increase.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Does issuing stock affect any other accounts that could impact these ratios?\n\nWell, issuing stock could potentially affect other equity accounts, like retained earnings if it's a stock dividend, but in this case, it's issuing additional capital stock for cash, which typically goes to common stock or paid-in capital. So, no, that shouldn't affect liabilities or other assets beyond cash.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it right. The total debt to total assets ratio decreases, and working capital increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
