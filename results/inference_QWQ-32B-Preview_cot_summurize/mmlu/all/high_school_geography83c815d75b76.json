I know that the Rio Grande is a river that runs along the southern border of the United States and forms part of the border with Mexico.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. A water divider - I'm not super familiar with this term, but I think a water divider might refer to something like a watershed, which separates different drainage basins. But in this case, the Rio Grande is a river, not a divider between drainage areas. So maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. A watercourse - This sounds promising. A watercourse is another term for a river or a stream, so since the Rio Grande is a river, it could be considered a watercourse. But I need to see if there's a better option.\n\nC. An artificial boundary - This would be a boundary that's man-made, like a wall or a fence. The Rio Grande is a natural feature, not something created by humans, so this probably doesn't fit.\n\nD. A natural boundary - This makes sense because the Rio Grande is a natural geographic feature used as a border between two countries.\n\nSo between B and D, I need to decide which one is more appropriate. While the Rio Grande is indeed a watercourse, the question is asking about it being a boundary between countries. In that context, it's being used as a natural boundary.\n\nI think the best answer is D. a natural boundary, because it's a naturally occurring geographic feature that's being used to delineate the border between the US and Mexico.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. A watercourse is a general term for a flowing body of water, like a river. While the Rio Grande is a watercourse, the question is specifically about it being a boundary. Natural boundaries are often geographical features like rivers, mountains, etc., that are used to define political borders.\n\nSo, in the context of boundaries between countries, it's more accurate to refer to the Rio Grande as a natural boundary in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. a natural boundary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
