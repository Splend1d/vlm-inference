All sides of a rhombus are of equal length, and opposite sides are parallel. So, the correct answer is A. 4.\n\nTo provide more detail, let's briefly discuss what a rhombus is and how it relates to other quadrilaterals.\n\nA rhombus is a special type of parallelogram where all four sides are of equal length. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal, making it a more specific type of parallelogram.\n\nHere are some key properties of a rhombus:\n\n1. All sides are congruent (equal in length).\n\n2. Opposite angles are equal.\n\n3. The diagonals bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees).\n\n4. The diagonals bisect the vertex angles.\n\nIt's important to note that a square is a special type of rhombus where all angles are right angles (90 degrees). So, every square is a rhombus, but not every rhombus is a square.\n\nIn contrast, other quadrilaterals like rectangles and squares also have four sides, but with different properties. For example, a rectangle has all right angles but only opposite sides of equal length, while a square has both equal sides and right angles.\n\nSo, to summarize, a rhombus has four sides, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
