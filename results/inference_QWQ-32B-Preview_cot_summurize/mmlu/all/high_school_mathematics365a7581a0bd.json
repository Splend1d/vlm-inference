(3, 2)\n\nB. (3, \u20132)\n\nC. (\u20133, 2)\n\nD. (\u20133, \u20132)\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what g(x) = f(\u2013x) means. This seems like a transformation of the function f. Specifically, it looks like a reflection across the y-axis. So, for every x, g(x) is equal to f of the opposite x.\n\nGiven that (3, 2) is a point on the graph of g, that means g(3) = 2.\n\nSince g(x) = f(\u2013x), then g(3) = f(\u20133) = 2.\n\nSo, f(\u20133) = 2.\n\nTherefore, the point (\u20133, 2) must be on the graph of f.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nIf g(x) = f(\u2013x), and g(3) = 2, then f(\u20133) = 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. (\u20133, 2).\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this?\n\nSuppose I consider what happens to other points.\n\nFor example, if x = 3, then g(3) = f(\u20133) = 2.\n\nSo, f at \u20133 is 2.\n\nSimilarly, if x = \u20133, then g(\u20133) = f(3).\n\nBut I don't have g(\u20133) given in the problem.\n\nSo, I can't make any conclusions about f(3) from the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the only point I can definitively say is on the graph of f is (\u20133, 2).\n\nAlright, I think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
