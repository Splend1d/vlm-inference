                    "text": "Let's tackle this division problem: 7,285 divided by 4. I need to find out which option is correct among A. 1,801, B. 1,801 remainder 1, C. 1,821, and D. 1,821 remainder 1.\n\nFirst, I'll do the division step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nStarting with the dividend 7,285 and the divisor 4.\n\n1. Divide 7 by 4:\n   - 4 goes into 7 one time because 4 x 1 = 4.\n   - Subtract 4 from 7 to get a remainder of 3.\n   - Bring down the next digit, which is 2, making it 32.\n\n2. Divide 32 by 4:\n   - 4 goes into 32 eight times because 4 x 8 = 32.\n   - Subtract 32 from 32 to get a remainder of 0.\n   - Bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 08.\n\n3. Divide 8 by 4:\n   - 4 goes into 8 two times because 4 x 2 = 8.\n   - Subtract 8 from 8 to get a remainder of 0.\n   - Bring down the last digit, which is 5, making it 05.\n\n4. Divide 5 by 4:\n   - 4 goes into 5 one time because 4 x 1 = 4.\n   - Subtract 4 from 5 to get a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, the quotient is 1,821 and the remainder is 1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 1,801 - This is not matching my quotient.\n\nB. 1,801 remainder 1 - The quotient is different from what I got.\n\nC. 1,821 - This matches my quotient, but it doesn't account for the remainder.\n\nD. 1,821 remainder 1 - This matches both my quotient and remainder.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 1,821 remainder 1.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my division to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again:\n\n7 \u00f7 4 = 1, remainder 3.\n\n32 \u00f7 4 = 8, remainder 0.\n\n8 \u00f7 4 = 2, remainder 0.\n\n5 \u00f7 4 = 1, remainder 1.\n\nYes, that's correct. Quotient is 1,821 and remainder is 1.\n\nAlternatively, I can verify by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and adding the remainder to see if I get back to the dividend.\n\nSo, 1,821 x 4 + 1 = ?\n\nFirst, 1,821 x 4:\n\n1,821 x 4 = 7,284.\n\nThen, 7,284 + 1 = 7,285.\n\nYes, that matches the original dividend. So, my division is correct.\n\nTherefore, the right answer is D. 1,821 remainder 1.\n\nI think option C might be a mistake where someone forgot to account for the remainder.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they rounded or did something differently, but according to standard division, D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
