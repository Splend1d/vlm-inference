According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, time passes differently for objects moving at different speeds, especially when approaching the speed of light.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Time Dilation**: This is a difference in the elapsed time measured by two observers due to a relative velocity between them. In simpler terms, time moves slower for an object in motion compared to one at rest, when observed from the rest frame.\n\n2. **Scenario**: You're traveling at high speed compared to your friends who stay at home.\n\n3. **Question**: Compared to your friends, are you older, younger, neither, or longer?\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider whose perspective we're looking at: yours or your friends'.\n\n- **From Your Perspective (the traveler)**: Time for your friends back home appears to be moving faster. So, from your viewpoint, your friends are aging faster than you are. But this is a reciprocal effect; your friends would see you aging slower.\n\n- **From Your Friends' Perspective**: They see you moving at high speed, so they observe your clock running slower. Therefore, they would consider you younger than they are.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking from the perspective of who is older or younger when you compare after the journey.\n\nThis is where it gets a bit tricky because it involves the twin paradox, a thought experiment in special relativity involving two twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find the other twin has aged more.\n\nIn the twin paradox:\n\n- The traveling twin (you) experiences time dilation and ages less than the stay-at-home twin.\n\n- When you return, you would be younger than your friends who stayed behind.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that you are younger compared to your friends who stayed at home.\n\nBut let's consider the options:\n\nA. older.\n\nB. younger.\n\nC. neither younger nor older.\n\nD. longer.\n\nGiven the context of time dilation and the twin paradox, the answer should be B. younger.\n\nHowever, the question says \"compared with your friends who \u2018stay at home,\u2019 you are\" and lists options including \"longer.\" \"Longer\" might be referring to length contraction, another aspect of special relativity where objects in motion are observed to be shorter in the direction of motion.\n\nBut the question seems to be specifically about age, so \"longer\" might not be the appropriate choice here.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer is B. younger.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
