The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I wanted to pass the test so I wrote the answers on my hand.\"\n\nOkay, so this sounds like cheating on a test. In most educational settings in the US, cheating is considered morally wrong because it's unfair to other students who are studying and taking the test honestly. It also undermines the purpose of the test, which is usually to assess one's knowledge or skills. So, according to ordinary moral standards, cheating would be considered wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I helped my friend get out of the house after he was put under house arrest.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more complex. House arrest is a legal punishment or restriction imposed by the court. Helping someone escape house arrest would be assisting them in breaking the law. Legally, that's wrong, and morally, it's also questionable because it interferes with the legal system's enforcement of penalties.\n\nHowever, there might be some context to consider. For example, if the house arrest was unjust or if the friend was in danger and needed to leave for safety reasons, then maybe helping them could be seen as morally justifiable. But based on the information given, it seems like the friend was lawfully under house arrest, so helping them escape would generally be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any argument to be made that one of these scenarios isn't morally wrong?\n\nFor Scenario 1, cheating is almost universally condemned in educational settings, so it's hard to see how that wouldn't be considered wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, while there might be exceptional cases where helping someone escape house arrest could be seen as morally justifiable, based on the information provided, it seems like the friend was under house arrest legitimately, so helping them escape would be wrong.\n\nTherefore, both actions are morally wrong, and the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
