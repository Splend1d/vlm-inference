The lithosphere must be one of these layers or a part of them.\n\nOption A says the softer rocky material of the mantle. Hmm, I think the mantle is below the crust and it's made of hot rock, but I'm not sure if it's soft or molten. I think it's more like solid but hot and can flow over time.\n\nOption B says the lava that comes out of volcanoes. Lava is molten rock that comes to the surface during volcanic eruptions. But the lithosphere is a layer of the planet, not just the molten rock that comes out occasionally. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C says material between the crust and the mantle. Wait, isn't the crust on top and the mantle below it? So, between them would be the crust itself or something in between. I'm a bit confused here.\n\nOption D says the rigid rocky material of the crust and uppermost portion of the mantle. That sounds familiar. I think the lithosphere includes both the crust and the top part of the mantle, and it's rigid.\n\nLet me think about it. The lithosphere should be the rigid outer layer of the planet, right? That includes the crust, which is solid, and maybe a part of the mantle that's also relatively cool and rigid.\n\nSo, comparing the options, Option D seems the most accurate. It mentions the rigid rocky material of the crust and the uppermost portion of the mantle.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
