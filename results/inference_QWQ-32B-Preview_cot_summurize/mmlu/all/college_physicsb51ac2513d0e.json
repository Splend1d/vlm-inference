                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about sound waves diffracting out of a speaker enclosure. The sound moves at 350 meters per second, and the opening is a long rectangular slit that's 0.14 meters across. I need to find out at what frequency the sound will first disappear at an angle of 45 degrees from the normal to the speaker face. The options are 500 Hz, 1,750 Hz, 2,750 Hz, and 3,500 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Diffraction is when waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through an opening. In this case, sound waves are passing through a slit and diffracting. The problem is asking for the frequency at which the sound first disappears at a specific angle, which suggests we're dealing with the diffraction pattern and perhaps the first minimum.\n\nI recall that for single-slit diffraction, the condition for the first minimum is given by:\n\n\\[ a \\sin{\\theta} = \\lambda \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the width of the slit,\n\n- \\( \\theta \\) is the angle from the normal,\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the sound wave.\n\nGiven that, I can solve for the wavelength:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = a \\sin{\\theta} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = (0.14 \\, \\text{m}) \\times \\sin{45^\\circ} \\]\n\nI know that \\( \\sin{45^\\circ} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.7071 \\), so:\n\n\\[ \\lambda = 0.14 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 0.099 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nNow, I need to relate wavelength to frequency. The relationship between wavelength, frequency, and the speed of sound is:\n\n\\[ v = f \\lambda \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the speed of sound (350 m/s),\n\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency,\n\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength.\n\nRearranging for frequency:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{350}{0.099} \\approx 3535.35 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nLooking at the options, 3,500 Hz is closest to this value.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions a \"long rectangular slit,\" which might imply that it's a narrow slit, and perhaps we should consider diffraction patterns for slits. But in the context of sound waves and the given information, the approach seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different formula I should be using for the diffraction pattern of a rectangular slit. I recall that for rectangular apertures, the diffraction pattern can be more complex, involving both horizontal and vertical diffraction, but since the slit is described as \"long rectangular slit,\" perhaps the diffraction is primarily in one direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the diffraction angle in terms of the sound wave's behavior.\n\nLet me think differently. The angle is given from the normal to the speaker face at 45 degrees. So, perhaps I need to consider the path difference for sound waves emanating from different points across the slit.\n\nIn diffraction gratings, the condition for minima is given by:\n\n\\[ d \\sin{\\theta} = m \\lambda \\]\n\nWhere \\( d \\) is the slit spacing, and \\( m \\) is the order of the minimum. But in this case, it's a single slit, not a grating.\n\nWait, maybe I should use the formula for the first minimum in single-slit diffraction:\n\n\\[ a \\sin{\\theta} = m \\lambda \\]\n\nFor the first minimum, \\( m = 1 \\), so:\n\n\\[ a \\sin{\\theta} = \\lambda \\]\n\nThat's the same formula I used earlier.\n\nSo, perhaps my calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 3,500 Hz.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculation to be sure.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ a = 0.14 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta = 45^\\circ \\]\n\n\\[ v = 350 \\, \\text{m/s} \\]\n\nFirst, find \\( \\lambda \\):\n\n\\[ \\lambda = a \\sin{\\theta} = 0.14 \\times \\sin{45^\\circ} = 0.14 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 0.099 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThen, find \\( f \\):\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} = \\frac{350}{0.099} \\approx 3535.35 \\, \\text{Hz} \\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the closest option is 3,500 Hz.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider higher-order minima, but the question specifies \"first disappear,\" which likely corresponds to the first minimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a factor I'm missing related to the dimensions of the slit or the properties of sound waves.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that the opening is a \"long rectangular slit,\" which suggests that one dimension is much longer than the other. In diffraction patterns, slits with different aspect ratios can have different diffraction patterns.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the diffraction pattern for a rectangular aperture, which is the product of the diffraction patterns in the two directions.\n\nHowever, since the slit is described as \"long rectangular,\" perhaps the diffraction in the longer direction is negligible, and only the diffraction in the narrower direction needs to be considered.\n\nIn that case, my original approach should be valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider multiple slits, but the problem mentions a single slit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"long rectangular slit\" refers to a slit that's long in one direction and narrow in the other, and I need to consider diffraction in both directions.\n\nBut given the information provided, I think my original approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately 3,500 Hz, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n**Concepts Used**\n\n1. **Diffraction of Sound Waves:** Understanding how sound waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through an opening.\n2. **Single-Slit Diffraction Formula:** The condition for the first minimum in the diffraction pattern is given by \\( a \\sin{\\theta} = \\lambda \\), where \\( a \\) is the slit width, \\( \\theta \\) is the angle from the normal, and \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength.\n3. **Relationship Between Wavelength, Frequency, and Speed:** The formula \\( v = f \\lambda \\) relates the speed of sound (\\( v \\)), frequency (\\( f \\)), and wavelength (\\( \\lambda \\)).\n\n**Key Steps**\n\n1. **Identify the Diffraction Condition:** Use the single-slit diffraction formula to find the wavelength corresponding to the first minimum at the given angle.\n2. **Calculate the Wavelength:** Plug in the slit width and the sine of the angle to find the wavelength.\n3. **Determine the Frequency:** Use the wave speed formula to find the frequency corresponding to the calculated wavelength.\n\n**Solution Code**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the frequency at which sound first disappears at a specific angle due to diffraction through a rectangular slit.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Diffraction Condition:** For the first minimum in single-slit diffraction, the condition is given by:\n   \\[\n   a \\sin{\\theta} = \\lambda\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( a \\) is the width of the slit,\n   - \\( \\theta \\) is the angle from the normal,\n   - \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the sound wave.\n\n2. **Wavelength Calculation:** Rearrange the formula to solve for \\( \\lambda \\):\n   \\[\n   \\lambda = a \\sin{\\theta}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Frequency Calculation:** Use the relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength:\n   \\[\n   f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( v \\) is the speed of sound,\n   - \\( f \\) is the frequency.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given values\na = 0.14  # slit width in meters\ntheta_deg = 45  # angle in degrees\nv = 350  # speed of sound in m/s\n\n# Convert angle to radians\ntheta_rad = math.radians(theta_deg)\n\n# Calculate wavelength\nlambda_ = a * math.sin(theta_rad)\n\n# Calculate frequency\nf = v / lambda_\n\nprint(f\"The frequency at which the sound first disappears is approximately {f:.0f} Hz.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Calculate Wavelength:** Using the diffraction formula \\( \\lambda = a \\sin{\\theta} \\), we find the wavelength corresponding to the first minimum at 45 degrees.\n2. **Calculate Frequency:** Using the wave speed formula \\( f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda} \\), we determine the frequency that corresponds to this wavelength.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the frequency at which the sound first disappears at the specified angle due to diffraction."
