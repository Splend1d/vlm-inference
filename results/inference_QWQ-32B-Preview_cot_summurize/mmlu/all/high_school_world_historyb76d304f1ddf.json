Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.\n\"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.\n\"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.\"\n\u2014Excerpted and adapted from the Shu Jing, 6th century BCE, China\nWhat does the phrase below tell us about the ruler?\n\nA. He had the Mandate of Heaven.\nB. He was an absolute monarch.\nC. He had lost the blessing of the gods.\nD. He was killed as a result of natural disasters.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. The phrase in question is: \"Our ruler, who possessed of its favor.\" This seems to be referring to the ruler having the favor of Heaven. In the context of ancient Chinese philosophy, particularly the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, this would suggest that the ruler has the approval or support of Heaven to govern.\n\nOption A says, \"He had the Mandate of Heaven.\" That sounds plausible because possessing the favor of Heaven is essentially what the Mandate of Heaven is about. It was a principle used to justify the rule of the king or emperor, stating that they ruled with the approval of Heaven.\n\nOption B says, \"He was an absolute monarch.\" While the Mandate of Heaven could be used to support the idea of absolute monarchy, the phrase here specifically mentions having the favor of Heaven, which directly relates to the Mandate of Heaven. So, while he might have been an absolute monarch, the phrase itself doesn't directly tell us about his political power or style of governance.\n\nOption C says, \"He had lost the blessing of the gods.\" But the phrase says he \"possessed of its favor,\" which indicates he had the blessing, not that he had lost it.\n\nOption D says, \"He was killed as a result of natural disasters.\" There's no mention of the ruler being killed in the excerpt. The text talks about Heaven sending down calamities, but in the context of punishing the descendant of Xia for not following the example of their ancestors.\n\nSo, based on the phrase \"our ruler, who possessed of its favor,\" it seems most directly related to the Mandate of Heaven, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
