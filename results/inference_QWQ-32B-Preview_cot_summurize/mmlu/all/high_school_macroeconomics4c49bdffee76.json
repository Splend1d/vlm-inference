                    "text": "So I've got this question here about banking and reserves. Let's see what it's asking. The reserve ratio is 0.1, which I think means that banks have to keep 10% of their deposits as reserves. So, if a bank gets $200 in deposits, I need to figure out the maximum amount it can lend out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the reserve ratio is. If it's 0.1, that means for every dollar deposited, the bank has to hold back $0.10 as reserves and can lend out the rest. So, for $200 deposits, the bank needs to keep $200 * 0.1 = $20 as reserves.\n\nNow, the bank can lend out the rest of the deposits, which would be $200 - $20 = $180. So, is the answer B. $180?\n\nBut wait, I remember that in banking, when one bank lends money, that money can be deposited into another bank, which then also has to keep reserves and can lend out the rest, and this process continues. So, maybe the maximum amount that can be lent out is more than just $180.\n\nLet me think about this. If the first bank lends out $180, and that $180 is deposited into another bank, that second bank now has $180 in deposits. It needs to keep 10% of that as reserves, which is $18, and can lend out $180 - $18 = $162.\n\nThen, that $162 is deposited into another bank, which keeps $16.20 in reserves and lends out $145.80, and so on. This seems like a geometric series where each term is 90% of the previous term.\n\nSo, the total amount lent out would be the sum of this infinite series: $180 + $162 + $145.80 + ...\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Here, a = $180 and r = 0.9.\n\nSo, S = $180 / (1 - 0.9) = $180 / 0.1 = $1,800.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the bank only has $200 in deposits initially. How can the total loans exceed the initial deposits?\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let me look up the money multiplier formula. I think it's related to the reserve ratio.\n\nYes, the money multiplier is 1 / reserve ratio. So, with a reserve ratio of 0.1, the money multiplier is 1 / 0.1 = 10.\n\nSo, the maximum potential increase in the money supply is the initial deposit multiplied by the money multiplier: $200 * 10 = $2,000.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum amount the bank can lend, not the total money supply. So, is the answer C. $2,000?\n\nWait, but that includes the reserves, right? No, the money multiplier calculates the total money supply created from the initial deposit.\n\nActually, the total money supply would be the initial deposit plus all the subsequent loans that become deposits in other banks.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the maximum amount one bank can lend, given the initial deposit of $200 and a reserve ratio of 0.1.\n\nSo, going back, perhaps it's just the amount the first bank can lend, which is $180.\n\nBut the options include \"greater than $200 but less than $500,\" which is option D.\n\nHmm, maybe the bank can lend more than $180 because of the multiplier effect.\n\nLet me think differently. If the reserve ratio is 0.1, then for every dollar of reserves, the bank can have $10 in deposits.\n\nSo, with $200 in deposits, the required reserves are $20, as I calculated earlier.\n\nThe bank can lend out $180, which will be deposited in other banks, who will then lend out $162, and so on.\n\nBut the question is about one bank's lending, not the entire banking system's lending.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is just $180, which is option B.\n\nBut option D says \"greater than $200 but less than $500,\" which doesn't include $180.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the bank can lend out not just the initial $180, but also the subsequent deposits it receives from other banks.\n\nFor example, when the $180 is lent out and deposited in other banks, those banks will keep $18 in reserves and lend out $162.\n\nSome of that $162 might be deposited back into the original bank.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the question is getting at.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking about the total lending possible in the entire banking system, given the initial deposit of $200 and a reserve ratio of 0.1.\n\nIn that case, the money multiplier is 1 / 0.1 = 10, so the total increase in the money supply would be $200 * 10 = $2,000.\n\nBut again, that's the total money supply, not necessarily the lending.\n\nWait, the money supply increases because banks lend out money, which becomes deposits in other banks, which lend out more, and so on.\n\nSo, the total lending in the system could be up to $2,000 - $200 = $1,800, assuming the initial deposit is $200.\n\nBut that seems too high, and it's not one bank's lending.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look at the question again: \"If a bank gets $200 in deposits, what is the maximum amount it can lend?\"\n\nI think it's asking about a single bank's lending, not the entire system.\n\nSo, with a reserve ratio of 0.1, the bank needs to keep $20 in reserves and can lend $180.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. $180.\n\nBut why is there an option C. $2,000, which seems to correspond to the money multiplier effect across the entire banking system?\n\nMaybe the question is trying to trick me by including options that relate to the money supply, not just one bank's lending.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bank can lend more than $180 if it gets additional deposits from other banks.\n\nBut again, that seems to relate to the entire system, not just one bank.\n\nI think I need to stick with the initial calculation: reserves of $20, lending of $180.\n\nSo, the answer is B. $180.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
