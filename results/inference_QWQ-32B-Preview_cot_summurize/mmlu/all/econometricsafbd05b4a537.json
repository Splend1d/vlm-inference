                    "text": "So I've got this question here about estimation techniques for over-identified systems of simultaneous equations. The options are OLS, ILS, 2SLS, and IV, and I need to figure out which of these can be used for over-identified systems.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what an over-identified system is. In the context of simultaneous equations models, over-identification occurs when there are more instruments available than the number of endogenous variables in the system. This is important because it allows for testing the validity of the instruments.\n\nNow, let's look at each of the estimation techniques:\n\n1. **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**: This is a standard estimation method for linear regression models. However, in the context of simultaneous equations, where there might be endogeneity issues, OLS can produce biased and inconsistent estimates. So, I'm guessing OLS isn't suitable for over-identified systems.\n\n2. **ILS (Indirect Least Squares)**: This is another estimation method for simultaneous equations models. It involves estimating the reduced form equations and then solving for the structural parameters. I think ILS can handle over-identified systems, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\n3. **2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares)**: This is a widely used method for estimating models with endogenous explanatory variables. It's particularly suited for over-identified systems because it can handle multiple instruments for each endogenous variable. So, I believe 2SLS is appropriate here.\n\n4. **IV (Instrumental Variables)**: Instrumental variables estimation is a general approach to deal with endogeneity. 2SLS is actually a specific case of IV estimation. So, IV estimation can certainly be used for over-identified systems.\n\nGiven this, options (iii) and (iv) seem correct. But the question is whether (ii) ILS is also applicable.\n\nLet me think about ILS again. Indirect Least Squares involves estimating the reduced form equations and then inverting them to solve for the structural parameters. In an over-identified system, there are more instruments than endogenous variables, which might complicate the inversion process. I recall that ILS is consistent only under certain conditions, and it might not be directly applicable to over-identified systems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ILS can still be used, but I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps I should look into it more.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in over-identified systems, there are more moment conditions than parameters, which requires a different estimation approach. Maybe ILS doesn't accommodate this.\n\nOn the other hand, I know that 2SLS and IV estimation can handle over-identification by using all available instruments efficiently.\n\nSo, perhaps only 2SLS and IV are appropriate for over-identified systems, making option B the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if ILS can indeed be used in over-identified systems.\n\nLet me recall: in exactly identified systems, where the number of instruments equals the number of endogenous variables, ILS can be used. However, in over-identified systems, there are more instruments than endogenous variables, which might make ILS less straightforward.\n\nPerhaps ILS is not suitable for over-identified systems, in which case option B would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ILS can still be applied, but it wouldn't be efficient or consistent. I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering, and ILS can handle over-identification somehow. Perhaps by selecting a subset of instruments or using some other method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ILS is equivalent to 2SLS in the over-identified case, but I don't think that's accurate.\n\nWait, I think I need to refer back to some econometrics notes or a textbook to confirm this.\n\nFlipping through my econometrics textbook, I find that ILS involves estimating the reduced form equations and then using the estimated coefficients to solve for the structural parameters. In the case of over-identification, there are multiple reduced form equations, which might lead to inconsistent estimates if not handled properly.\n\nIn contrast, 2SLS is specifically designed to handle over-identification by using all available instruments in the first stage.\n\nTherefore, it seems that ILS might not be directly applicable or consistent in over-identified systems, whereas 2SLS and IV estimation are appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, OLS is not suitable for simultaneous equations models due to endogeneity issues, whether the system is exactly identified or over-identified.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- OLS: Not suitable for simultaneous equations models.\n\n- ILS: May not be suitable for over-identified systems.\n\n- 2SLS: Suitable for over-identified systems.\n\n- IV: Suitable for over-identified systems.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option B: (iii) and (iv) only.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any way ILS can be adapted for over-identified systems or if there are specific conditions under which ILS can be used.\n\nUpon further reflection, I recall that in over-identified systems, there are multiple sets of reduced form equations, and choosing one set might lead to biased estimates. Therefore, ILS is not recommended for over-identified systems.\n\nHence, I'm confident that the correct answer is option B: (iii) and (iv) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
