The options are about different social psychology concepts: the bystander effect, groupthink, social loafing, and the mere exposure effect. I need to decide which one the president is trying to avoid.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means.\n\nThe bystander effect is when people are less likely to help someone in need when there are other people around. Maybe that's not directly related here, since it's about helping behavior in emergencies.\n\nGroupthink is when a group prioritizes harmony and consensus over critical evaluation of alternatives, leading to poor decision-making. This seems plausible because bringing in an outside consultant to disagree might be a way to introduce different perspectives and prevent everyone from just going along with the president's idea without questioning it.\n\nSocial loafing is when individuals exert less effort when working in a group than when working alone. That might be an issue in a team setting, but it doesn't directly relate to decision-making processes or disagreement in meetings.\n\nThe mere exposure effect is when people develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. I don't see how bringing in an outside consultant to disagree would relate to this concept.\n\nSo, between these options, groupthink seems the most relevant. The president might be aware that his top executives could fall into groupthink, where they just agree with him to maintain harmony, without critically evaluating the decision. By bringing in an outside consultant who is willing to disagree, he's introducing dissenting opinions, which can help the group consider alternative viewpoints and make a better-informed decision.\n\nMoreover, groupthink is a well-known phenomenon in organizational behavior, and many leaders try to prevent it by encouraging diversity of thought and opinions. So, this seems like a strategic move by the president to improve the decision-making process.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nThe bystander effect is more about individual responsibility in the presence of others, which doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nSocial loafing is about effort in group settings, not about decision-making or disagreement.\n\nThe mere exposure effect is about preferences based on familiarity, which isn't directly related to the scenario described.\n\nTherefore, the most logical answer is that the president is trying to avoid groupthink by bringing in an outside consultant to disagree with him.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
