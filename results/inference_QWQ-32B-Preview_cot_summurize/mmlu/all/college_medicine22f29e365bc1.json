                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about mutations in DNA. So, mutations are changes or errors in the DNA sequence, right? And the question is asking about the nature of these mutations. Let's look at each option carefully.\n\nOption A says, \"are always harmful.\" Hmm, I don't think that's accurate. I've heard that some mutations can be neutral, meaning they don't have any effect, and others can even be beneficial, especially in the context of evolution. So, mutations aren't always harmful.\n\nOption B says, \"only occur in the presence of carcinogens.\" Carcinogens are substances that can cause cancer by causing mutations in DNA. But I know that mutations can also occur naturally without any exposure to carcinogens. For example, mistakes can happen during DNA replication when cells divide. So, mutations can occur spontaneously.\n\nOption C says, \"increase tumor growth.\" While it's true that some mutations can lead to cancer and thus increase tumor growth, not all mutations have this effect. As I thought earlier, some mutations are harmless, and others can even be beneficial. So, this can't be the correct answer because it's too narrow.\n\nOption D says, \"occur spontaneously at a low rate.\" This sounds plausible. I recall that DNA replication isn't perfect, and sometimes errors occur. These errors can lead to mutations. Also, cells have mechanisms to repair these mistakes, but sometimes they miss some. So, mutations do occur spontaneously at a low rate.\n\nLet me think again. If mutations were always harmful, that would be a problem, but life has evolved with mechanisms to manage mutations. So, option A doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B is too restrictive because mutations can happen without carcinogens.\n\nOption C is too specific to tumor growth, which is just one possible consequence of mutations.\n\nOption D seems the most balanced and accurate, acknowledging that mutations happen naturally but at a low rate.\n\nI think the answer is D. Mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
