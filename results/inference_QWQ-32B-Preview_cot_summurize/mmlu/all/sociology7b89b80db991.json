Let me see what each one is saying.\n\nOption A says: \"we internalise and take on social roles from a pre-existing framework.\" Hmm, that sounds like maybe structural functionalism or something similar, where there are set roles that society has defined, and we just fit into them. But I think role-learning theory is more about how we learn roles through interaction.\n\nOption B says: \"we create and negotiate our roles through interaction with others.\" That sounds familiar. I think this is more aligned with symbolic interactionism, where roles are created and modified through our interactions. Maybe this is closer to what role-learning theory is about.\n\nOption C says: \"social roles are not fixed or stable but fluid and pluralistic.\" This also sounds like it's emphasizing the flexibility of roles, which seems consistent with the idea that roles can change and that we might have multiple roles at once. But I'm not sure if this directly captures the learning aspect.\n\nOption D says: \"roles have to be learned to suppress unconscious motivations.\" This one seems a bit different. It brings in psychoanalytic elements, maybe, with unconscious motivations. But I don't recall role-learning theory being about suppressing unconscious motivations.\n\nLet me try to recall what role-learning theory actually is. I think it's related to how individuals learn the roles they are expected to play in society through observation, imitation, and feedback from others. So, it's about the process of learning roles, not just adopting pre-existing ones or suppressing internal drives.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B seems the most fitting because it emphasizes creation and negotiation through interaction, which aligns with the idea of learning roles through social interaction.\n\nBut wait, option A mentions internalizing from a pre-existing framework, which might suggest that roles are already defined, and we just adopt them. That doesn't sound like learning so much as accepting assigned roles.\n\nOption C talks about roles being fluid and pluralistic, which is about the nature of roles rather than the process of learning them.\n\nOption D brings in unconscious motivations, which doesn't seem directly related to role-learning theory as I understand it.\n\nSo, I think option B is the best answer here because it highlights the interactive and dynamic nature of role-learning, where roles are not just accepted but created and negotiated through interactions with others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
