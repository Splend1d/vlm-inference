The options are:\n\nA. becomes slightly radioactive\n\nB. doesn\u2019t become radioactive\n\nC. will spoil faster\n\nD. should be avoided\n\nI know that gamma radiation is used for sterilizing food, but I'm not sure about the exact effects. Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, gamma radiation is a type of ionizing radiation. It's powerful enough to kill bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause food to spoil or make people sick. So, in theory, it should help preserve food by reducing the microbial load.\n\nOption A says that the food becomes slightly radioactive. I've heard that radiation can make things radioactive, but I'm not sure if that applies to gamma radiation used in food processing. Maybe in some cases, but I think the food is treated and then packaged, so it shouldn't retain radioactivity.\n\nOption B says that the food doesn\u2019t become radioactive. That seems plausible because the gamma radiation is passed through the food to kill microbes, but the food itself doesn't become a source of radiation.\n\nOption C says that the food will spoil faster. But isn't the whole point of irradiation to make food last longer by killing off bacteria and other pathogens? So this seems contradictory.\n\nOption D says that the food should be avoided. Well, if irradiation is safe and effective, there's no reason to avoid such food. In fact, many countries approve food irradiation as a safe practice.\n\nLet me check what scientific consensus says about food irradiation. I recall that organizations like the World Health Organization and the FDA consider food irradiation a safe and effective way to reduce foodborne illnesses.\n\nSo, if it's safe and doesn't make food radioactive, then option B seems correct: the food doesn\u2019t become radioactive.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option A again. Is there any scenario where food could become radioactive from gamma irradiation? I think gamma radiation is high-energy electromagnetic radiation, similar to X-rays, but more powerful. When it passes through food, it breaks molecular bonds, which kills microorganisms. However, it doesn't leave residual radioactivity behind. So, the food shouldn't become radioactive.\n\nOption C suggests that irradiated food spoils faster, which contradicts the purpose of irradiation. Irradiation is meant to extend shelf life by reducing the number of microbes that can cause spoilage.\n\nOption D advises to avoid such food, but if it's proven safe by regulatory agencies, there's no reason to avoid it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B: doesn\u2019t become radioactive.\n\nI'm confident with this choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
