                    "text": "So I've got this question about receptors in the retina and the cochlea, and it's asking about how they functionally differ, specifically in one of these aspects: resting potential magnitude, ions involved in action potentials, types of energy they transduce, or the number of axons each cell has. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what receptors in the retina and cochlea do. The retina is in the eye, and it's responsible for detecting light and converting it into neural signals that the brain can interpret as vision. The cochlea is in the ear, and it's involved in hearing, detecting sound waves and turning them into neural signals for the brain to process.\n\nSo, both are sensory receptors that convert different types of energy into neural signals, but they're detecting different kinds of stimuli: light versus sound.\n\nOption A is about the magnitude of the resting potentials of their membranes. Resting potential is the membrane potential when the cell is not actively signaling. I don't recall off the top of my head if there's a significant difference in resting potentials between retinal and cochlear receptors. Maybe they're similar since both are neurons or sensory cells.\n\nOption B mentions the ions involved in their action potentials. Action potentials are generated by the movement of ions across the cell membrane, typically sodium and potassium. Again, I think both types of receptors use similar ions for generating action potentials. So, perhaps this isn't the key difference.\n\nOption C is about the types of energy they transduce. Transduction is the process of converting one form of energy into another, in this case, from environmental stimuli into electrical signals. The retina transduces light energy, which is electromagnetic, while the cochlea transduces mechanical energy from sound waves. So, here we have a clear difference in the type of energy being converted.\n\nOption D talks about the number of axons each cell possesses. I know that most neurons have one axon, but some have none or multiple. I'm not sure about the standard configuration for retinal and cochlear receptors. Maybe they both typically have one axon each.\n\nComparing these options, the most obvious difference is in the types of energy they transduce: light versus sound. So, I think the correct answer is C. But let me double-check.\n\nRetinal receptors, like rods and cones, have photopigments that absorb light and initiate a cascade of events leading to a change in membrane potential and eventually an action potential. Cochlear hair cells, on the other hand, have stereocilia that bend in response to mechanical vibrations from sound waves, which opens ion channels and changes the membrane potential, leading to neural signaling.\n\nSo, not only are they transducing different types of energy, but the mechanisms by which they do so are also different. Retinal receptors are responding to light, while cochlear receptors respond to mechanical stimulation.\n\nTherefore, the functional difference that stands out the most is the type of energy they transduce.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
