The options are judicial review, the national census, rules of impeachment, and the State of the Union address.\n\nFirst, I know that the Constitution sets up the structure of our government and outlines the powers of each branch. So, things like the national census and impeachment procedures should be in there.\n\nThe national census is mentioned because it's used to determine the number of representatives each state has in Congress. I think that's in Article I, Section 2.\n\nRules of impeachment should also be in there because impeachment is a process to remove federal officials from office. I believe that's outlined in Article II, Section 4.\n\nThe State of the Union address is probably in there too. I think it's mentioned in the duties of the President, maybe in Article II.\n\nNow, judicial review isn't something that's explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. I think it's a principle that was established by the Supreme Court, specifically in Marbury v. Madison, where the Court said that it has the power to review and invalidate laws that are unconstitutional. But I don't recall seeing the term \"judicial review\" anywhere in the Constitution.\n\nSo, based on that, I would say that judicial review is the one that's not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe it is mentioned somewhere and I just don't remember.\n\nLooking back, the Constitution describes the powers of the judicial branch in Article III, and it says that the judicial power extends to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties. But it doesn't specifically say that the courts have the power of judicial review.\n\nIn fact, the concept of judicial review isn't explicitly stated; it's inferred from the language and the structure of the Constitution.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that judicial review is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
