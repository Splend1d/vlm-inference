                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I rode my skateboard down the sidewalk.\"\n\nIs riding a skateboard down the sidewalk morally wrong? Well, in many places, it's legal to ride a skateboard on the sidewalk, especially if there are no signs prohibiting it. It's a common way for people to get around, especially in areas where skateboarding is popular. As long as the person is being careful and not bothering anyone, it seems like a harmless activity. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I fed my kitten wet cat food 3 times a day.\"\n\nFeeding a kitten wet cat food three times a day\u2014Is that morally wrong? Well, kittens need proper nutrition to grow healthy, and wet cat food can be part of a balanced diet for them. Feeding them three times a day might be more frequent than some recommendations, but it depends on the kitten's age and specific needs. As long as the kitten is not overfed and remains healthy, this seems like a responsible act of caring for a pet. So, again, according to ordinary moral standards, this doesn't seem wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoing. So, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about possible reasons why someone might consider these actions wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe some people think that skateboarding on the sidewalk is dangerous or could disturb pedestrians. While it's possible that skateboarding could pose a risk if not done carefully, in general, it's not considered morally wrong. It's more of a safety concern, which is different from a moral issue.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps overfeeding could be a problem, leading to health issues for the kitten. But feeding wet cat food three times a day doesn't necessarily mean overfeeding; it depends on the amount per meal. Assuming the portions are appropriate, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
