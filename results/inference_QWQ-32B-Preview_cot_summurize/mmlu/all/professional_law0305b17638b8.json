Although it is not the only lake in the county, it is the largest and most scenic, and it attracts visitors from miles around. One of its biggest assets is the excellent fishing and boating, which is available to the public at large. Three years ago, in order to enhance the recreational aspects of the lake, the county leased a sizable portion of the lake and surrounding parkland to a company owned by the most prominent family in the county. The lease required the company to construct and operate a first-rate yacht house and club, complete with bar, restaurant, and private marina, and to pay the county 10% of its net profits as rent. The company set up bylaws, which were reviewed and approved by the county at the time the lease was negotiated. According to the bylaws, the yacht club, complete with its restaurant and bar, would be open to members only, and the membership committee was empowered to set up strict membership \"standards,\" as well as the cost of membership fees and dues. Upon completion of the facilities, the state granted the company a license to sell alcoholic beverages in its restaurant and bar. The membership committee announced that the membership fee was $5,000 and the monthly dues $75. Furthermore, the membership committee had a policy of approving only membership applications from men, while disapproving and denying all applications from women. There were other similar facilities within the county available to women. A woman resident of the county brings suit against the company, claiming that her membership application was denied only because she is a woman, and that its policy of excluding women as a group denies her equal protection rights. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?\n\nA. The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\nB. The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some \"compelling interest,\" since such discrimination is \"suspect\" and requires the strictest equal protection test.\nC. The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.\nD. The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n"

                    "text": "I've got this legal scenario to analyze. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a county with a lake that's developed for recreation. The county leased part of this lake to a company owned by a prominent local family. This company set up a yacht club with a bar, restaurant, and marina, and they have to pay the county 10% of their net profits as rent.\n\nNow, the yacht club has bylaws that were approved by the county, and these bylaws set up strict membership standards, including a $5,000 membership fee and $75 monthly dues. Crucially, the membership committee has a policy of approving only men as members and denying all women applicants.\n\nThere are other similar facilities in the county that are open to women.\n\nA woman who lives in the county sues the company, claiming that her membership application was denied solely because she is a woman, and that this policy violates her equal protection rights.\n\nWe need to determine which statement is most accurate regarding her lawsuit.\n\nOption A says: \"The plaintiff will lose, because classifications based on sex have not yet been held to violate the equal protection clause.\"\n\nI need to recall when sex-based classifications started being considered under equal protection analysis. I think that in the United States, sex-based discrimination started being subject to heightened scrutiny around the 1970s, with cases like Reed v. Reed in 1971 and then Craig v. Boren in 1976, which established the intermediate scrutiny standard for sex classifications.\n\nGiven that the scenario doesn't specify a time, but mentions that the lease was set up three years ago, perhaps we're in a timeframe where sex discrimination is already considered under equal protection. So, option A might not be accurate.\n\nOption B: \"The plaintiff will prevail unless denial of membership to women can be justified by some 'compelling interest,' since such discrimination is 'suspect' and requires the strictest equal protection test.\"\n\nI remember that racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, but sex-based classifications typically receive intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny. So, this option might be overstepping by applying the strictest test to sex discrimination.\n\nOption C: \"The plaintiff will lose, because other similar facilities are available to women.\"\n\nThis seems to suggest that since there are alternative options for women, denying them membership in this particular club doesn't violate their rights. This sounds similar to the \"separate but equal\" doctrine, which was debunked in racial segregation cases. However, I'm not sure if this directly applies to sex discrimination.\n\nOption D: \"The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\"\n\nThis sounds closer to the intermediate scrutiny standard, where the burden is on the defendant to show an important governmental objective, and that the classification is substantially related to achieving that objective.\n\nWait, but this is a private club, not a government entity. Does equal protection apply to private entities?\n\nEqual protection is a clause in the 14th Amendment that applies to state action. However, in some cases, private entities can be considered state actors if they are heavily entangled with the state or if they are performing a public function.\n\nIn this scenario, the county leased the lake portion to the company, and the bylaws were reviewed and approved by the county. Also, the state granted the license to sell alcoholic beverages. This level of involvement might be enough to consider the company a state actor, thus bringing equal protection principles into play.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a state statute or other law that prohibits sex discrimination in places of public accommodation. If so, the woman could have a claim under that law.\n\nBut the question seems focused on equal protection rights under the Constitution.\n\nGiven that, I need to consider whether the yacht club's policy violates equal protection, assuming it's a state actor.\n\nIf it is a state actor, then sex-based classifications are subject to intermediate scrutiny, as per Craig v. Boren.\n\nIntermediate scrutiny requires that the classification serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to achieving those objectives.\n\nBut in this case, the yacht club is a private entity, even if it's leasing county property and has some relationship with the state.\n\nI need to think about the level of state involvement. The county leased the property to the company, reviewed and approved the bylaws, and receives a percentage of net profits. Additionally, the state granted a license to sell alcohol.\n\nThis seems like significant entanglement between the state and the private company. Therefore, it's possible that the yacht club could be considered a state actor for constitutional purposes.\n\nIf that's the case, then sex-based discrimination would be subject to intermediate scrutiny.\n\nHowever, if the club is considered a private club, there might be limitations on applying equal protection principles.\n\nI recall that private clubs generally have the right to set their own membership criteria, but if they are engaged in public accommodations or have substantial state involvement, that private right might be diminished.\n\nGiven the facts, it seems plausible that the yacht club could be considered a state actor due to the lease agreement and state licensing.\n\nTherefore, the woman's equal protection claim could proceed.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA is likely incorrect because sex-based classifications do violate equal protection, subject to intermediate scrutiny.\n\nB is incorrect because sex discrimination typically triggers intermediate scrutiny, not strict scrutiny.\n\nC might be tempting, but the \"separate but equal\" logic has been discredited, especially in the context of racial segregation. However, I'm not sure if the same principles fully apply to sex discrimination in this context.\n\nD seems plausible, as it aligns with the intermediate scrutiny standard, where the burden is on the defendant to show an important basis for the classification.\n\nBut wait, under intermediate scrutiny, it's the plaintiff who must show that the classification does not serve an important governmental objective or is not substantially related to achieving it.\n\nActually, in practice, once the plaintiff establishes that a classification based on sex has been made, the defendant must justify it by showing that it serves important governmental objectives and is substantially related to those objectives.\n\nWait, no. Under intermediate scrutiny, the government (or in this case, the state actor) must show that the classification serves important governmental objectives and is substantially related to achieving those objectives.\n\nBut in reality, the burden is on the government to justify the classification, not on the plaintiff to disprove it.\n\nHowever, in this multiple-choice context, option D seems to capture that the plaintiff will prevail unless the company can show an important basis for the exclusion.\n\nTherefore, D seems like the most accurate statement.\n\nOption C is weaker because, even if there are other facilities available to women, denying them access to this particular club could still be a violation of equal protection, especially since the club is on leased public property and has state licensing.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the correct answer is D: The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) The plaintiff will prevail unless the company can prove some important basis for the exclusion of women."
