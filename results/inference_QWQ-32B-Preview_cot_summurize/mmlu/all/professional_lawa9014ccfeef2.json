His testimony is that he detected traces of succinic acid and choline, the components of succinylcholine, in the victim's brain tissues. Over defense objections, he testified further that, in his opinion, the victim's cause of death was succinylcholine poisoning. On cross-examination, the toxicologist admitted that up until his findings, it had been universally accepted in the medical community that succinylcholine would be undetectable in the brain within a few minutes of its injection. He also admitted that his methods of detecting succinylcholine were experimental and that his results were not presently publishable because they were not complete enough. The defense attorney then makes a motion to strike the toxicologist's testimony regarding the cause of death. The court will most likely\n\nA. grant the motion, because the toxicologist's opinion could not be substantiated.\nB. grant the motion, because the toxicologist was not properly qualified as an expert.\nC. deny the motion, because the toxicologist was qualified as an expert in medical matters.\nD. deny the motion, because he was qualified to give an opinion on the ultimate issue of the case.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. A toxicologist testified in a murder trial about an autopsy he performed on the victim. He found traces of succinic acid and choline in the victim's brain tissues, which are components of succinylcholine. Based on this, he opined that the cause of death was succinylcholine poisoning.\n\nNow, there are a few key points here:\n\n1. The toxicologist is an expert employed at the state crime laboratory, so he presumably has the credentials and experience in his field.\n\n2. His testimony includes both factual findings (detecting certain chemicals) and an opinion (cause of death).\n\n3. On cross-examination, he admitted that it was universally accepted in the medical community that succinylcholine would be undetectable in the brain within a few minutes of injection.\n\n4. He also admitted that his methods were experimental and that his results were not yet complete enough for publication.\n\nThe defense then moves to strike the toxicologist's testimony regarding the cause of death. The question is asking what the court will most likely do: grant or deny the motion, and why.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Grant the motion because the toxicologist's opinion could not be substantiated.\n\nB. Grant the motion because the toxicologist was not properly qualified as an expert.\n\nC. Deny the motion because the toxicologist was qualified as an expert in medical matters.\n\nD. Deny the motion because he was qualified to give an opinion on the ultimate issue of the case.\n\nFirst, we need to consider the admissibility of expert testimony. In the United States, this is often governed by either the Frye or Daubert standards, depending on the jurisdiction. These standards aim to ensure that expert testimony is reliable and relevant.\n\nIn this case, the toxicologist is an employee of the state crime laboratory, which suggests that he is qualified in his field. However, he admitted that his methods were experimental and that his results were not yet publishable because they were incomplete. This could call into question the reliability of his methods and findings.\n\nAdditionally, he acknowledged that his findings contradicted the universal acceptance in the medical community regarding the detectability of succinylcholine in the brain shortly after injection. This discrepancy might further undermine the reliability of his opinion.\n\nGiven these factors, the defense is arguing that his testimony regarding the cause of death should be excluded.\n\nOption A suggests granting the motion because the opinion couldn't be substantiated. This seems plausible, given the experimental nature of his methods and the contradiction with established medical knowledge.\n\nOption B suggests granting the motion because the toxicologist wasn't properly qualified. However, since he works at a state crime laboratory, it's likely that he is qualified as an expert in toxicology. The issue seems more about the reliability of his methods and findings rather than his general qualifications.\n\nOption C suggests denying the motion because he was qualified as an expert in medical matters. While he may be qualified, the question is whether his specific methods and conclusions in this case are reliable enough to be admitted.\n\nOption D suggests denying the motion because he was qualified to give an opinion on the ultimate issue of the case. While experts can offer opinions on the ultimate issue, their testimony still needs to be reliable and based on acceptable methods.\n\nConsidering the points above, it seems that the court would be concerned about the reliability of the toxicologist's methods and findings, especially since they contradict established medical knowledge and are based on experimental methods not yet accepted or published.\n\nTherefore, the most likely action is to grant the motion to strike the toxicologist's testimony regarding the cause of death because his opinion could not be substantiated due to the experimental nature of his methods and the contradiction with accepted medical knowledge.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
