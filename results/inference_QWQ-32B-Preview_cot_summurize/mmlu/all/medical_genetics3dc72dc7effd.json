Let me think this through.\n\nFirst off, DiGeorge syndrome is also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome because it's often caused by a small deletion on chromosome 22. But wait, the question mentions Shprintzen syndrome too. Is that the same as DiGeorge syndrome?\n\nI recall that Shprintzen syndrome is another name for DiGeorge syndrome, so they're referring to the same condition. So, if it's called 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, that must mean the deletion is on chromosome 22.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A is chromosome 4. I don't think there's a common syndrome associated with a deletion on chromosome 4 that's related to DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nOption B is chromosome 7. Wait, isn't Williams syndrome associated with chromosome 7? But that's a different condition. So, probably not.\n\nOption C is chromosome 15. Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are related to chromosome 15, but again, not related to DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nSo, that leaves option D, chromosome 22, which aligns with what I initially thought.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should recall some features of DiGeorge syndrome to confirm. It's often characterized by heart defects, immune system problems, and facial anomalies, among other things. The deletion on chromosome 22 affects a specific region that includes genes important for the development of these systems.\n\nAlso, I remember that the q11.2 refers to the specific band on the long arm of chromosome 22 where the deletion occurs. So, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the more precise name for DiGeorge syndrome.\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the correct answer is D, chromosome 22.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
