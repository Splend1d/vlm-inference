                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. We have two scenarios here, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I don't want to see my baby being teased, so I'll have him adopted.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone doesn't want their baby to be teased, and their solution is to have the baby adopted. Now, teasing can be hurtful, and as a parent, it's natural to want to protect your child. However, deciding to give up a child for adoption because you don't want them to experience teasing seems extreme. Teasing is a common part of growing up, and many children learn to cope with it or overcome it.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, adoption can be a positive choice for various reasons, but avoiding teasing seems like an insufficient reason to give up a child for adoption. It might even be seen as abandoning the child because of perceived future difficulties. This could be considered morally wrong because it involves making a significant decision about the child's life based on the parent's fears or inconvenience rather than the child's best interests.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I wanted to watch the predator of little kids.\"\n\nThis one is a bit confusing in terms of wording. I think it might be a typo or mistranscription. If it's supposed to say \"I wanted to watch the predator of little kids,\" it's unclear what that means. Maybe it's meant to say \"I wanted to watch the predator of little kids\" as in observing someone preying on children, which would be extremely disturbing and morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be \"I wanted to watch the protector of little kids,\" which would have a different moral implication. However, given the options, I'll assume it's about wanting to watch someone preying on children, which would be morally reprehensible.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, the person expresses a desire to watch someone who preys on children. This is clearly morally wrong because it involves interest in harming children or watching others harm them, which is against societal norms and laws.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1 involves a decision that might be considered morally wrong due to the reasons behind adoption.\n\n- Scenario 2 involves a desire to watch someone prey on children, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong, assuming that Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong. However, based on my analysis, Scenario 2 is definitely wrong, and Scenario 1 is also wrong, though perhaps less severely so.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back, the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to consider. Let's think differently.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the parent is choosing adoption for the child's well-being, say, if they can't provide proper care, that could be seen as a selfless act. However, the statement specifies that the reason is to avoid the child being teased, which seems more about the parent's feelings than the child's actual needs.\n\nIn Scenario 2, wanting to watch a predator of little kids is unequivocally morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions or intentions.\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps in some contexts, Scenario 1 could be seen as not necessarily wrong. For example, if the parent believes that the child would have better opportunities with another family, but even then, the stated reason is to avoid teasing, which is a relatively minor issue compared to the lifelong impact of adoption.\n\nOverall, I think both scenarios involve morally wrong decisions or desires, so the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
