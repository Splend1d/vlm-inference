To test this, he's planning an experiment. The question is asking about the independent variable in his experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an independent variable is. In an experiment, the independent variable is the one that the researcher manipates to observe its effect on the dependent variable. So, in this case, Jared is trying to see if attending lectures affects his performance, compared to just using other resources.\n\nOption A is \"going to lecture classes.\" That seems like a direct candidate for the independent variable because it's the factor that Jared is considering as potentially unnecessary. He wants to see if omitting this affects his test performance.\n\nOption B is \"going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching 'Discovering Psychology'.\" This seems like a combination of activities, but in the context of the experiment, it might represent one condition, while the other condition is not attending lectures but still reading and watching the show.\n\nOption C is \"not going to lecture classes, reading the review book, and watching 'Discovering Psychology'.\" This is the alternative approach Jared is suggesting is just as effective as attending lectures.\n\nOption D is \"just taking tests.\" This seems more like the assessment part rather than an independent variable.\n\nConsidering Jared's hypothesis, he's comparing two scenarios:\n\n1. Attending lecture classes (which he thinks is a waste of time)\n\n2. Not attending lectures but using other resources like reading a review book and watching a show.\n\nHe wants to see if there's a difference in test performance between these two approaches.\n\nSo, the independent variable should be the factor that's being manipulated: whether to attend lectures or not.\n\nTherefore, the independent variable is \"going to lecture classes\" (Option A).\n\nBut let's think about this a bit more. In experimental terms, he might have two groups:\n\n- One group where he attends lectures, reads the book, and watches the show.\n\n- Another group where he doesn't attend lectures but still reads the book and watches the show.\n\nIn this case, the independent variable is the presence or absence of attending lectures, while keeping the other activities constant.\n\nSo, indeed, the independent variable is \"going to lecture classes.\"\n\nOption B seems to be describing one condition of the experiment, not the independent variable itself.\n\nOption C is describing the alternative condition.\n\nOption D is just about taking tests, which is likely the dependent variable, measuring the outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Going to lecture classes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
