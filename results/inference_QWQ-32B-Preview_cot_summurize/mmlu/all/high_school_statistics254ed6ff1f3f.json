The LSAT scores are normally distributed with a mean of 650 and a standard deviation of 45.\n\nFirst, we need to standardize the scores to find the corresponding z-scores. The z-score is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\n\nwhere \\( X \\) is the score, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n\nLet's find the z-scores for 700 and 740.\n\nFor \\( X = 700 \\):\n\n\\[ z_{700} = \\frac{700 - 650}{45} = \\frac{50}{45} \\approx 1.11 \\]\n\nFor \\( X = 740 \\):\n\n\\[ z_{740} = \\frac{740 - 650}{45} = \\frac{90}{45} = 2.00 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the area under the standard normal curve between \\( z = 1.11 \\) and \\( z = 2.00 \\), and then find the percentage of applicants below 740 among those above 700.\n\nFirst, find the cumulative probabilities for \\( z = 1.11 \\) and \\( z = 2.00 \\) using a standard normal table or a calculator.\n\n\\[ P(Z < 1.11) \\approx 0.8665 \\]\n\n\\[ P(Z < 2.00) \\approx 0.9772 \\]\n\nThe probability of scores between 700 and 740 is:\n\n\\[ P(700 < X < 740) = P(1.11 < Z < 2.00) = P(Z < 2.00) - P(Z < 1.11) = 0.9772 - 0.8665 = 0.1107 \\]\n\nThe probability of scores above 700 is:\n\n\\[ P(X > 700) = P(Z > 1.11) = 1 - P(Z < 1.11) = 1 - 0.8665 = 0.1335 \\]\n\nNow, the percentage of applicants considered (those above 700) who have scores below 740 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{P(700 < X < 740)}{P(X > 700)} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{0.1107}{0.1335} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 82.9\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 82.9%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 82.9\\%} \\]"
