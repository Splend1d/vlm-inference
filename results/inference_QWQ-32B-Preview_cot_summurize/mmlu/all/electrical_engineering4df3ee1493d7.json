                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about a single-phase, one-pulse controlled circuit with a resistance R and a counter EMF load. The source voltage is given as 400 sin(314 t), and the load counter EMF is 200 V. I need to find the range of the firing angle control from the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a single-phase, one-pulse controlled circuit is. I believe it's a type of AC voltage controller or thyristor circuit where the thyristor is triggered once per cycle. The firing angle determines when the thyristor is turned on during the AC cycle.\n\nThe source voltage is given as vs = 400 sin(314 t). The angular frequency \u03c9 is 314 rad/s, which corresponds to a frequency of f = \u03c9 / (2\u03c0) = 314 / (2 * 3.1416) \u2248 50 Hz.\n\nThe load has a counter EMF of 200 V. Counter EMF likely means that there is a voltage source in the load that opposes the source voltage.\n\nIn a controlled rectifier circuit, the output voltage and current depend on the firing angle \u03b1. For a resistive load, the average output voltage is proportional to the firing angle.\n\nHowever, in this case, there is a counter EMF, which complicates things. I think I need to consider the voltage across the thyristor and ensure that it doesn't become forward-biased beyond a certain angle.\n\nLet me recall the voltage equations for a controlled rectifier with a resistive load and a counter EMF.\n\nThe load voltage equation would be something like:\n\nvL = vs - e\n\nwhere e is the counter EMF.\n\nGiven vs = 400 sin(314 t) and e = 200 V (assuming it's DC or has a different frequency, but since it's counter EMF, it might be in phase or out of phase with vs).\n\nWait, 200 V is the magnitude of the counter EMF. I need to know its phase relationship with the source voltage.\n\nAssuming e = 200 sin(314 t - \u03c6), but without loss of generality, if it's in phase or out of phase, it might not change the range significantly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps e is a constant voltage, but the problem states it's a counter EMF load, so it's likely AC.\n\nLet me consider that e = 200 sin(314 t).\n\nThen, vL = vs - e = 400 sin(314 t) - 200 sin(314 t) = 200 sin(314 t).\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counter EMF is in the opposite direction, so e = -200 sin(314 t).\n\nThen, vL = vs - e = 400 sin(314 t) - (-200 sin(314 t)) = 600 sin(314 t).\n\nThat seems odd.\n\nI think I need to consider the circuit configuration. Is it a thyristor in series or parallel with the load?\n\nAssuming it's a thyristor in series with the load, like in a phase-controlled rectifier.\n\nIn that case, the thyristor is turned on at the firing angle \u03b1, and the load current flows through it.\n\nThe load has a resistance R and a counter EMF of 200 V.\n\nI need to find the range of \u03b1 for which the circuit can be controlled.\n\nI recall that in a controlled rectifier, the firing angle range is typically from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, but with a counter EMF, it might be limited.\n\nPerhaps the counter EMF affects the phase angle where the thyristor can be triggered.\n\nLet me consider the voltage across the thyristor.\n\nWhen the thyristor is off, the voltage across it is the source voltage minus the counter EMF.\n\nvt = vs - e\n\nIf vt becomes positive, the thyristor can turn on if triggered.\n\nWait, thyristors are turned on when the anode-cathode voltage is positive and a gate pulse is applied.\n\nSo, for a thyristor to be able to conduct, the voltage across it must be positive during the period when it can be triggered.\n\nGiven that vs = 400 sin(314 t) and e = 200 sin(314 t), then vt = 400 sin(314 t) - 200 sin(314 t) = 200 sin(314 t).\n\nSo, vt = 200 sin(314 t).\n\nThis means that vt is always positive during the positive half-cycle and negative during the negative half-cycle.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor can be triggered anywhere in the positive half-cycle, from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut the options suggest a different range.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the counter EMF.\n\nPerhaps e is not in phase with vs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe e is a constant voltage.\n\nLet me consider e as a constant 200 V DC.\n\nThen, vt = vs - e = 400 sin(314 t) - 200 V.\n\nNow, vt = 400 sin(314 t) - 200.\n\nI need to find when vt > 0, because the thyristor can be triggered only when vt > 0.\n\nSo, 400 sin(314 t) - 200 > 0\n\n=> sin(314 t) > 0.5\n\nThe sine function is greater than 0.5 from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 in the first cycle.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor can be triggered between 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0.\n\nWait, but in terms of the firing angle \u03b1, the range would be from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nBut option A is 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0, and option B is 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counter EMF is in the opposite direction.\n\nLet me try e = -200 V.\n\nThen, vt = 400 sin(314 t) - (-200) = 400 sin(314 t) + 200.\n\nNow, vt = 400 sin(314 t) + 200.\n\nThis would be greater than zero for a larger range.\n\nsin(314 t) > -0.5.\n\nWhich is from -30\u00b0 to 210\u00b0, but since it's a positive cycle, from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, vt is always positive.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor can be triggered from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the counter EMF is not a DC voltage but an AC voltage with the same frequency as vs but different amplitude.\n\nLet me assume e = 200 sin(314 t + \u03c6), where \u03c6 is the phase angle.\n\nIf \u03c6 = 0\u00b0, then vt = 400 sin(314 t) - 200 sin(314 t) = 200 sin(314 t), as before.\n\nIf \u03c6 = 180\u00b0, then e = -200 sin(314 t), and vt = 400 sin(314 t) - (-200 sin(314 t)) = 600 sin(314 t).\n\nAgain, vt is always positive during the positive half-cycle.\n\nBut the problem states \"counter EMF\", which likely means it's opposing the source voltage, so probably \u03c6 = 180\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, e = -200 sin(314 t), and vt = 600 sin(314 t).\n\nThus, vt is always positive during the positive half-cycle, and the thyristor can be triggered from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut the options suggest a different range.\n\nMaybe there's a different consideration here.\n\nPerhaps I need to look at the load current or the condition for continuous current.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the circuit is a buck converter or something similar.\n\nWait, the problem mentions a \"single-phase one-pulse controlled circuit\", which sounds like a phase-controlled rectifier with a single thyristor.\n\nIn such circuits, the firing angle determines the time at which the thyristor is triggered.\n\nGiven that the load has a counter EMF, it affects the voltage across the thyristor and hence the range of \u03b1 over which the circuit can operate.\n\nFrom my earlier calculation, if e = -200 V, then vt = 600 sin(314 t), which is always positive in the positive half-cycle.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor can be triggered at any angle between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0.\n\nBut option A is 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0, which suggests that there might be some minimum and maximum firing angles due to the counter EMF.\n\nPerhaps there is a condition where the voltage across the thyristor must be positive for a certain period to ensure proper commutation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the load current must be positive for the thyristor to conduct.\n\nLet me consider the load current.\n\nThe load consists of resistance R and counter EMF e.\n\nThe current through the load is given by i = (vs - e)/R.\n\nGiven vs = 400 sin(314 t) and e = -200 sin(314 t), then i = (400 sin(314 t) - (-200 sin(314 t)))/R = (600 sin(314 t))/R.\n\nSo, i is proportional to sin(314 t), and is positive in the positive half-cycle and negative in the negative half-cycle.\n\nHowever, in a thyristor circuit, the thyristor can only conduct in one direction, so it would only conduct during the positive half-cycle.\n\nWait, actually, thyristors are unidirectional devices, so they can only conduct current in one direction.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor would only conduct when vs is positive and vt is positive, which is from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut perhaps there is a point where the counter EMF becomes too strong, and the thyristor can't be triggered beyond a certain angle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a minimum firing angle due to the presence of the counter EMF.\n\nLet me consider the voltage across the thyristor again.\n\nvt = vs - e = 400 sin(314 t) - (-200 sin(314 t)) = 600 sin(314 t).\n\nThis is always positive in the positive half-cycle, so the thyristor can be triggered at any angle between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0.\n\nBut perhaps there is a point where the load current becomes zero, and the thyristor stops conducting.\n\nWait, if the load current is i = (vs - e)/R = (600 sin(314 t))/R, it's always positive in the positive half-cycle, so as long as the thyristor is triggered before it naturally turns off, it should conduct for the entire positive half-cycle.\n\nBut in a phase-controlled rectifier, the thyristor conducts from the firing angle \u03b1 to \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0).\n\nTherefore, the range of \u03b1 should be from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut option B is 30\u00b0 to 180\u00b0, and option A is 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nI'm starting to think that perhaps there is a misinterpretation of the counter EMF.\n\nMaybe the counter EMF is not -200 sin(314 t), but a constant 200 V DC.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf e = 200 V DC, then vt = vs - e = 400 sin(314 t) - 200.\n\nNow, vt = 400 sin(314 t) - 200.\n\nTo find when vt > 0, which is the condition for the thyristor to be able to conduct:\n\n400 sin(314 t) - 200 > 0\n\n=> sin(314 t) > 0.5\n\nThe sine function is greater than 0.5 from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 in the first cycle.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor can be triggered between 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0.\n\nBeyond 150\u00b0, vt becomes negative, and the thyristor cannot be triggered.\n\nTherefore, the range of the firing angle \u03b1 is from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier assumption where e was -200 V DC, vt was always positive in the positive half-cycle, allowing \u03b1 from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut the problem states \"counter EMF\", which likely means it's opposing the source voltage, so e should be negative with respect to vs.\n\nTherefore, e = -200 V would make vt = 400 sin(314 t) - (-200) = 400 sin(314 t) + 200.\n\nIn this case, vt = 400 sin(314 t) + 200.\n\nThis is always positive in the positive half-cycle, as sin(314 t) ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nTherefore, vt > 0 from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nHence, the thyristor can be triggered from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the counter EMF is not a DC voltage but an AC voltage with the same frequency as vs, but out of phase.\n\nLet me assume e = 200 sin(314 t + \u03c6).\n\nIf \u03c6 = 180\u00b0, then e = -200 sin(314 t), and vt = 400 sin(314 t) - (-200 sin(314 t)) = 600 sin(314 t), which is always positive in the positive half-cycle.\n\nIf \u03c6 = 0\u00b0, then e = 200 sin(314 t), and vt = 400 sin(314 t) - 200 sin(314 t) = 200 sin(314 t), which is positive from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nWait, but in both cases, vt is positive in the positive half-cycle, allowing \u03b1 from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0.\n\nHowever, the options suggest a different range, starting from 30\u00b0.\n\nMaybe there is a minimum firing angle due to the presence of the counter EMF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average output voltage has to be positive, which imposes a limit on \u03b1.\n\nLet me consider the average output voltage.\n\nIn a phase-controlled rectifier, the average output voltage is given by:\n\nVav = (2 * Vm * cos \u03b1)/\u03c0\n\nwhere Vm is the amplitude of the source voltage.\n\nIn this case, vs = 400 sin(314 t), so Vm = 400 V.\n\nTherefore, Vav = (2 * 400 * cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 = (800 cos \u03b1)/\u03c0.\n\nHowever, with a counter EMF, the average output voltage would be different.\n\nI need to account for the counter EMF in the average voltage equation.\n\nPerhaps Vav = (2 * (Vm - E) * cos \u03b1)/\u03c0\n\nwhere E is the amplitude of the counter EMF.\n\nGiven E = 200 V, assuming it's AC with the same frequency.\n\nTherefore, Vav = (2 * (400 - 200) * cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 = (2 * 200 * cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 = (400 cos \u03b1)/\u03c0.\n\nFor Vav to be positive, cos \u03b1 must be positive, which is from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\n\nBut this suggests that \u03b1 can only range from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the earlier analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the average output voltage is Vav = (2 * Vm * cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 - E.\n\nIn this case, Vav = (800 cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 - 200.\n\nTo have Vav positive:\n\n(800 cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 - 200 > 0\n\n=> (800 cos \u03b1)/\u03c0 > 200\n\n=> cos \u03b1 > (200 * \u03c0)/800 = (\u03c0)/4 \u2248 0.7854\n\nTherefore, \u03b1 < cos\u207b\u00b9(0.7854) \u2248 38.2\u00b0.\n\nThis suggests that \u03b1 must be less than approximately 38.2\u00b0 for Vav to be positive.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counter EMF affects the firing angle differently.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nIn a controlled rectifier with a resistive load and a counter EMF, the thyristor must be triggered when the net voltage across it is positive.\n\nIf vs = 400 sin(314 t) and e = 200 V (assuming it's DC), then vt = 400 sin(314 t) - 200.\n\nTo have vt > 0:\n\n400 sin(314 t) - 200 > 0\n\n=> sin(314 t) > 0.5\n\nWhich, as previously determined, occurs from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the thyristor can be triggered between 30\u00b0 and 150\u00b0.\n\nBeyond 150\u00b0, vt becomes negative, and the thyristor cannot be triggered.\n\nHence, the range of the firing angle \u03b1 is from 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nPerhaps the counter EMF is considered as a DC voltage of 200 V opposing the source voltage.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A: 30\u00b0 to 150\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
