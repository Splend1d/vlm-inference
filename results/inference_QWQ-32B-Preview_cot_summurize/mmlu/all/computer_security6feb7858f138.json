                    "text": "I'm trying to understand how Kerberos works, especially regarding ticket lifetimes. So, MIT's Kerberos KDC server sets a maximum ticket lifetime of 24 hours for most user principals. That means that after 24 hours, the ticket expires and shouldn't be usable anymore. But what exactly ensures that an expired ticket can't be used? Let's look at the options provided.\n\nOption A says that the Kerberos server, or KDC, refuses to establish new connections between clients and servers for expired tickets. Hmm, I think the KDC is responsible for issuing and renewing tickets, but once a ticket is issued, it's up to the client and the server to use it for authentication. So, does the KDC actively monitor or control every connection between clients and servers? I don't think so. The KDC's main role is to authenticate users and services, not to manage ongoing connections. So, maybe this isn't the correct answer.\n\nOption B suggests that when a client connects to a server, the server sets a 24-hour timer to terminate the connection, ensuring the client can't stay connected past the ticket's maximum lifetime. This seems a bit simplistic. While it's true that tickets have a finite lifetime, relying solely on a server-side timer to terminate connections might not be sufficient or efficient. What if the client tries to use an expired ticket to establish a new connection? Would the server check the ticket's validity before accepting the connection? This option doesn't seem to fully address how ticket expiration is enforced.\n\nOption C states that when a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket\u2019s expiration time to its own current clock and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket's expiration time is in the past. This sounds more plausible. In Kerberos, tickets contain a timestamp indicating when they expire. Servers are supposed to check this timestamp against their own clock to ensure the ticket is still valid. This makes sense because it delegates the validation process to the server, which can independently verify the ticket's validity without needing to contact the KDC for every authentication attempt.\n\nOption D says that when a client connects to a server, the server sends a query to the KDC to check if the ticket is still valid according to the KDC\u2019s clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the KDC reports the ticket is expired. This seems similar to option A, where the KDC is involved in every authentication attempt. While it's possible that servers could contact the KDC to verify ticket validity, this would add significant overhead, especially in environments with many authentication attempts. Kerberos is designed to minimize the load on the KDC by allowing tickets to be used multiple times within their validity period without needing to check back with the KDC each time.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most accurate. The server checks the ticket's expiration time against its own clock and refuses authentication if the ticket has expired. This approach balances security and efficiency, as it doesn't require constant communication with the KDC and ensures that expired tickets cannot be used to authenticate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
