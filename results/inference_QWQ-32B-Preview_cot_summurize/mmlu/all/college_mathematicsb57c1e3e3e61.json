                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We need to determine which of the given intervals are valid intervals of convergence for a power series. The options are:\n\n(I) [\u22121, 3)\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0]\n\n(III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3]\n\n(IV) (\u2212\u221e, \u221e)\n\nAnd we have to choose among:\n\nA. Only (II)\n\nB. Only (IV)\n\nC. (I) and (IV)\n\nD. (II) and (III)\n\nFirst, I recall that the interval of convergence for a power series centered at \\( x = c \\) is typically of the form \\( (c - R, c + R) \\), where \\( R \\) is the radius of convergence. The interval may or may not include the endpoints, depending on the series.\n\nLet me consider each option one by one.\n\nOption (I): [\u22121, 3)\n\nThis interval is closed on the left and open on the right. To see if this is possible, I need to find a power series whose interval of convergence is [\u22121, 3). Let's assume the series is centered at \\( c = 1 \\), which is the midpoint of \u22121 and 3.\n\nSo, \\( c = \\frac{\u22121 + 3}{2} = 1 \\), and the radius \\( R = 2 \\).\n\nThe interval of convergence would then be \\( 1 - 2 < x < 1 + 2 \\), which is (\u22121, 3). But in this case, the interval is [\u22121, 3), meaning it includes \u22121 and excludes 3.\n\nI need to check if a power series can include one endpoint and exclude the other.\n\nYes, it's possible. For example, consider the series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (x - 1)^n \\). This is a geometric series with ratio \\( (x - 1) \\), which converges when \\( |x - 1| < 1 \\), i.e., \\( 0 < x < 2 \\).\n\nBut this doesn't match our interval [\u22121, 3). Maybe I need a different example.\n\nLet's consider \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x - 1)^n}{2^n} \\). This series converges when \\( |x - 1| < 2 \\), so the interval is (\u22121, 3).\n\nNow, to check the endpoints:\n\nAt \\( x = -1 \\), the series becomes \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-2)^n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^n \\), which is the alternating harmonic series and converges.\n\nAt \\( x = 3 \\), the series becomes \\( \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^n}{2^n} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 1 \\), which diverges.\n\nTherefore, the interval of convergence is [\u22121, 3), which matches option (I). So (I) is valid.\n\nOption (II): (\u2212\u221e, 0]\n\nThis interval is from negative infinity to 0, including 0.\n\nFor a power series, the interval of convergence is typically centered around the center \\( c \\). However, (\u2212\u221e, 0] is not symmetric around any finite center.\n\nWait, actually, power series can have an interval of convergence that is the entire real line (\u2212\u221e, \u221e), or a finite interval centered at \\( c \\).\n\nBut (\u2212\u221e, 0] is not symmetric around any finite center. Let's see if such an interval can be the interval of convergence for some power series.\n\nSuppose the series is centered at \\( c = 0 \\). Then the interval would be (\u2212R, R), or possibly including endpoints.\n\nBut (\u2212\u221e, 0] is not of this form. It goes from negative infinity to 0.\n\nI don't think a power series can have an interval of convergence like (\u2212\u221e, 0]. Power series usually have a finite radius of convergence or infinite.\n\nSo, I think (II) is not a valid interval of convergence for a power series.\n\nOption (III): [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3]\n\nThis looks like the set {2, 3}.\n\nSo, the interval of convergence is just the points x = 2 and x = 3.\n\nIs this possible for a power series?\n\nPower series typically converge on an interval, which may consist of a single point, but usually, if they converge at two separate points, they should converge on the interval between them as well, due to the properties of power series.\n\nWait, actually, the interval of convergence is an interval, possibly including endpoints. So, having convergence only at discrete points like {2, 3} is not typical for power series.\n\nPerhaps in some pathological cases, but generally, power series converge on a single interval.\n\nTherefore, (III) is not a valid interval of convergence.\n\nOption (IV): (\u2212\u221e, \u221e)\n\nThis is the entire real line.\n\nYes, this is possible for power series. If the radius of convergence \\( R = \\infty \\), then the series converges for all real numbers.\n\nFor example, the exponential function \\( e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!} \\) has an interval of convergence (\u2212\u221e, \u221e).\n\nSo, (IV) is valid.\n\nNow, looking back at the choices:\n\nA. Only (II)\n\nB. Only (IV)\n\nC. (I) and (IV)\n\nD. (II) and (III)\n\nFrom our analysis:\n\n- (I) is valid\n\n- (II) is not valid\n\n- (III) is not valid\n\n- (IV) is valid\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C. (I) and (IV)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
