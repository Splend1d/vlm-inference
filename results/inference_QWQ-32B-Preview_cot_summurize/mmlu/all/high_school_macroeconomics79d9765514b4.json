                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about a private closed economy, and I need to figure out which of these statements is true. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, what's a private closed economy? I think it's an economy that only consists of households and firms, with no government and no foreign sector. So, it's just households consuming goods and services, and firms producing them. And in this setup, there's no government intervention or international trade.\n\nOkay, now let's look at option A: \"Household saving can never be negative.\" Hmm, can household saving be negative? Well, saving is defined as income minus consumption. So, if households consume more than their income, they would have negative saving, right? That means they're dissaving. Is that possible in this economy?\n\nI think it is possible for households to spend more than they earn, maybe by borrowing or using savings. So, household saving can be negative. Therefore, statement A seems false.\n\nNext, option B: \"Investment is always greater than savings.\" In the context of a private closed economy, investment should equal savings, right? Because in equilibrium, the amount that firms invest should be financed by the savings of households. So, I think investment equals savings, not greater than savings.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the national income identities. In a closed economy without government, we have Y = C + I, where Y is income, C is consumption, and I is investment. Also, savings S is Y - C. So, S = I. So, savings equal investment. Therefore, statement B is false because investment is equal to savings, not greater than.\n\nNow, option C: \"The economy is in equilibrium when consumption equals saving.\" Hmm, from the previous identity, S = I, and Y = C + I, which can be rewritten as Y = C + S, meaning C + S = C + I, so S = I.\n\nSo, equilibrium is when planned saving equals planned investment. It's not when consumption equals saving. In fact, if consumption equals saving, then C = S, and from Y = C + S, that would mean Y = 2S, which doesn't necessarily represent equilibrium.\n\nSo, statement C seems false.\n\nLastly, option D: \"Saving is equal to zero when consumption equals disposable income.\" Let's see, saving is defined as disposable income minus consumption. So, S = Yd - C, where Yd is disposable income.\n\nIf consumption equals disposable income, then S = Yd - Yd = 0. So, yes, saving would be zero in that case.\n\nTherefore, statement D is true.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any scenario in a private closed economy where consumption could exceed disposable income, leading to negative saving? Well, if households borrow or use savings to consume more than their current income, then yes, C > Yd, and S would be negative.\n\nBut according to statement D, when C = Yd, S = 0. That seems correct.\n\nSo, among the options, only D is true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
