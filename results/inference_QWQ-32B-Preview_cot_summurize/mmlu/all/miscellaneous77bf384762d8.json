I need to figure out which one of these bones is found in the wrist.\n\nFirst, I should recall some basic anatomy. The wrist is the part of the body where the hand connects to the forearm. It's a complex joint made up of several small bones. I think the bones in the wrist are called carpals. Yeah, I remember that from biology class. So, option C. Carpals might be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is Patella. I know that the patella is the kneecap. It's located in the knee, not in the wrist. So, that can't be the answer.\n\nOption B is Humerus. The humerus is the bone in the upper arm, between the shoulder and the elbow. So, that's not in the wrist either.\n\nOption D is Coccyx. The coccyx is the tailbone, at the very end of the spine. Definitely not in the wrist.\n\nSo, again, that leaves me with option C, the Carpals. I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe I should remember how many carpals there are or something like that to confirm.\n\nI recall that there are eight carpals in the wrist, arranged in two rows. The proximal row consists of the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform, and the distal row has the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate. That's a bit detailed, but it reinforces that carpals are indeed the bones in the wrist.\n\nMaybe I should also think about the other bones in the area to make sure I'm not confusing anything.\n\nBelow the carpals, in the hand, there are the metacarpals, which connect to the fingers. And in the fingers, there are the phalanges. But the question specifically asks for the wrist, so I think carpals are the correct answer.\n\nI don't think any of the other options even come close. Patella is for the knee, humerus is for the upper arm, coccyx is for the tailbone, and carpals are for the wrist.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is C. Carpals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
