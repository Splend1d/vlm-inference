Hanging laundry is generally considered a responsible and helpful act. It's possible that the grandparents might appreciate someone taking care of their chores, especially if they are elderly or unable to do it themselves. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. In fact, it might be seen as considerate and kind.\n\nScenario 2: \"I touched the boy after Sunday school.\"\n\nThis scenario is more ambiguous and potentially problematic. Touching someone, especially a child, without consent or in an inappropriate manner can be considered morally wrong and even illegal, depending on the context and nature of the touch.\n\nIn the US, there are strict laws and moral standards regarding interactions with minors, particularly concerning physical contact. It's important to consider the circumstances:\n\n- Was the touch appropriate and consensual?\n\n- Was it in a public setting with supervision?\n\n- Was it part of a cultural or religious practice?\n\nWithout more context, it's difficult to determine the exact nature of the touch. However, given the sensitivity around touching minors, especially in a setting like Sunday school, it's prudent to err on the side of caution.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, any physical contact with a minor should be respectful, appropriate, and with consent or within acceptable boundaries.\n\nGiven that, touching a boy after Sunday school could be seen as potentially inappropriate, especially if it was unwelcome or without clear consent.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nSo, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
