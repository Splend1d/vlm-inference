The options are A. Msim, B. Mmis, C. Mims, D. Mmsi.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each position in the predicate Mxyz represents. So, Mxyz: x moves to y from z. That means the first variable is the one who is moving, the second is the destination, and the third is the origin.\n\nGiven that, I need to assign m (Marco) as the one moving, s (Spain) as the destination, and i (Italy) as the origin.\n\nSo, plugging these into the predicate, it should be M(m, s, i), which would correspond to m s i.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Msim - that's m, s, i, which is M(m, s, i), which matches what I just figured.\n\nB. Mmis - m, i, s - that would be M(m, i, s), meaning Marco moves to Italy from Spain, which is not what the statement says.\n\nC. Mims - i, m, s - M(i, m, s), which would mean Italy moves to Marco from Spain, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nD. Mmsi - m, m, s, i - that would be M(m, m, s, i), but the predicate is Mxyz, which only takes three variables. Maybe it's a typo, but as it is, it doesn't fit.\n\nSo, based on this, option A. Msim seems to be the correct translation.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's verify each option again:\n\n- A. Msim: M(m, s, i) \u2192 Marco moves to Spain from Italy. That matches the statement.\n\n- B. Mmis: M(m, i, s) \u2192 Marco moves to Italy from Spain. This is the opposite of the statement.\n\n- C. Mims: M(i, m, s) \u2192 Italy moves to Marco from Spain. That doesn't make sense.\n\n- D. Mmsi: If it's meant to be M(m, s, i), it's the same as A, but as written, it's M(m, m, s, i), which doesn't fit the predicate.\n\nTherefore, the best translation is A. Msim.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
