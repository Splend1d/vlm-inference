The debtor then wrote a letter to the creditor saying he would pay $10,000 from the proceeds of selling his house to settle the discharged debt. A week later, the buyer backed out, and the debtor refused to pay anything. Now, the creditor is suing for breach of contract. The question is, what should the creditor be entitled to recover?\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the concept of discharged debt in bankruptcy. When a debt is discharged in bankruptcy, it generally means that the debtor is no longer legally obligated to pay that debt. So, in this case, the $15,000 debt was discharged, and theoretically, the debtor doesn't have to pay it.\n\nHowever, the debtor wrote a letter offering to pay $10,000 from the proceeds of selling his house. This seems like a new promise to pay part of the discharged debt. Now, whether this letter constitutes a valid contract is key here.\n\nFor a contract to be enforceable, there usually needs to be an offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound. In this scenario:\n\n- Offer: The debtor's letter can be seen as an offer to pay $10,000.\n\n- Acceptance: There's no mention of the creditor accepting this offer explicitly. Depending on jurisdiction, sometimes actions can imply acceptance, but it's not clear here.\n\n- Consideration: This is something of value exchanged between parties. Since the debt is discharged, the creditor doesn't have to accept less than the full amount. The debtor is offering $10,000, which is less than the discharged debt, so is there consideration from the creditor's side? Maybe the creditor is getting something they didn't have before, which is a promise to pay $10,000.\n\n- Mutual intent: Both parties need to intend to be bound by the agreement. The debtor seems to intend to pay $10,000 if the house sells, but the creditor's intent isn't specified.\n\nAdditionally, there might be issues related to the discharge in bankruptcy affecting the enforceability of this new promise.\n\nNow, the debtor learned that the buyer reneged on the deal, so the house didn't sell, and thus, no proceeds. The debtor then refused to pay anything. The creditor is now suing for breach of contract.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Nothing.\n\nB. $10,000.00\n\nC. $10,000, only if the debtor is successful in suing the person who had contracted to buy his house.\n\nD. $15,000.00\n\nOption A: Nothing.\n\nThis could be the case if the letter doesn't constitute a binding contract. Since the debt is discharged, and the creditor isn't obligated to accept less, perhaps the debtor's offer isn't enforceable.\n\nOption B: $10,000.00\n\nThis would be the case if the letter is considered a valid contract to pay $10,000, and the debtor breached that contract by not paying.\n\nOption C: $10,000, only if the debtor is successful in suing the person who reneged on the house deal.\n\nThis introduces a condition dependent on another legal action, which complicates things. It suggests that the debtor's obligation to pay is contingent on successfully recovering from the buyer who backed out.\n\nOption D: $15,000.00\n\nThis would be the original discharged debt, but since it's discharged, it's unlikely the creditor can enforce the full amount.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the most plausible answer is A. Nothing.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. The debt was discharged in bankruptcy, meaning the debtor is no longer legally obligated to pay it.\n\n2. The debtor's letter offering to pay $10,000 might not constitute a binding contract because:\n\n   a. There may not have been acceptance by the creditor.\n\n   b. There may not be valid consideration since the debt is discharged.\n\n   c. The offer was conditional on selling the house, which didn't happen.\n\n3. Since the house sale didn't go through, the condition precedent to the debtor's promise didn't occur, so the promise might not be enforceable.\n\n4. The debtor can't be forced to pay something they never became obligated to pay, especially since the underlying debt is discharged.\n\nOption C is interesting because it ties the debtor's obligation to the success of another lawsuit, but legally, that might not be how it works. The debtor's promise was conditional on the house sale proceeds being available, not on recovering from the buyer who reneged.\n\nTherefore, the creditor should likely be entitled to recover nothing, making option A the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
