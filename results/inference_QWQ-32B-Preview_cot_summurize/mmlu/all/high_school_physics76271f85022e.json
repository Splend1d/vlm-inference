The options are that the amplitude increases, decreases, stays the same, or it depends on where the first block was in its oscillation when the second block fell.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening physically. We have a horizontal spring-block system oscillating, and suddenly another block of the same mass falls on top of it and sticks. So, it's like a completely inelastic collision where the two blocks move together after the second block falls on the first one.\n\nI recall that in such systems, energy and momentum are important concepts to consider. Maybe I should think about conservation of momentum during the collision.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( m \\) as the mass of each block.\n\n- \\( k \\) as the spring constant.\n\n- \\( A \\) as the initial amplitude.\n\n- \\( v \\) as the velocity of the first block just before the second block falls on it.\n\nWhen the second block falls on the first one, the two blocks stick together, so it's a perfectly inelastic collision. In such a collision, momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not.\n\nLet's consider the moment just before and just after the second block falls on the first one.\n\nJust before:\n\n- The first block is moving with velocity \\( v \\).\n\n- The second block is at rest (assuming it falls from rest).\n\nJust after:\n\n- The two blocks move together with a common velocity \\( v' \\).\n\nBy conservation of momentum:\n\n\\( m \\cdot v + m \\cdot 0 = (m + m) \\cdot v' \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( m v = 2 m v' \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( v' = \\frac{v}{2} \\)\n\nNow, after the collision, the two blocks oscillate together as a single system with combined mass \\( 2m \\).\n\nI need to find out how the amplitude changes.\n\nI know that for a spring-mass system, the amplitude is related to the total mechanical energy.\n\nThe total mechanical energy \\( E \\) of a spring-mass system is:\n\n\\( E = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 \\)\n\nAlternatively, at any point in the motion, it can also be expressed as:\n\n\\( E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nBut in this case, immediately after the collision, the two blocks are sticking together and starting to oscillate with the new combined mass.\n\nI need to find the new amplitude \\( A' \\).\n\nI think I can use the conservation of energy after the collision.\n\nAt the equilibrium position, all the energy is kinetic.\n\nSo, the total energy after the collision is:\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) (v')^2 \\)\n\nBut from above, \\( v' = \\frac{v}{2} \\), so:\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) \\left( \\frac{v}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m \\cdot \\frac{v^2}{4} = \\frac{m v^2}{4} \\)\n\nNow, compared to the initial total energy:\n\n\\( E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} E \\)\n\nThat means the total energy after the collision is half of what it was before.\n\nBut I also know that for a spring-mass system, \\( E = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 \\)\n\nSo, initially:\n\n\\( E = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 \\)\n\nAfter the collision:\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} k (A')^2 \\)\n\nBut we've established that \\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} E \\), so:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} k (A')^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( k (A')^2 = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 \\)\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\( (A')^2 = \\frac{1}{2} A^2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( A' = A / \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nWhich means the amplitude decreases by a factor of \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. It will decrease the amplitude.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nI assumed that all the kinetic energy after the collision is converted into the new oscillation energy.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the potential energy as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's consider the momentum and energy conservation more carefully.\n\nBefore the collision:\n\n- The first block is oscillating with amplitude \\( A \\), so its maximum kinetic energy is \\( \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\text{max}}^2 \\), where \\( v_{\\text{max}} = A \\omega \\), and \\( \\omega = \\sqrt{k/m} \\).\n\n- Therefore, maximum kinetic energy is \\( \\frac{1}{2} m (A \\sqrt{k/m})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m A^2 k / m = \\frac{1}{2} k A^2 \\), which matches the total energy.\n\nAt the instant the second block falls on the first one, let's assume it falls when the first block is at its maximum velocity, which is at the equilibrium position.\n\nBut actually, the problem doesn't specify where the first block is in its cycle when the second block falls, so maybe it does matter.\n\nWait, option D says it depends on where the original block was in its cycle.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider different points in the cycle.\n\nLet's consider two extreme cases:\n\n1. The first block is at maximum displacement (amplitude \\( A \\)), at rest (velocity \\( v = 0 \\)) when the second block falls.\n\n2. The first block is at equilibrium position, with maximum velocity \\( v_{\\text{max}} = A \\sqrt{k/m} \\), when the second block falls.\n\nCase 1: Block at maximum displacement, velocity zero.\n\nWhen the second block falls on it, they stick together.\n\nSince the first block is at rest, the second block also presumably falls with zero velocity.\n\nSo, after collision, the two blocks are at rest at maximum displacement.\n\nTherefore, the new amplitude would be the same as the original amplitude, because they start from rest at \\( x = A \\).\n\nCase 2: Block at equilibrium position, maximum velocity.\n\nFrom earlier reasoning, the velocity after collision is halved, so \\( v' = v_{\\text{max}} / 2 \\).\n\nThe new amplitude can be found from the energy:\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) (v')^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) \\left( \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2m \\cdot \\frac{v_{\\text{max}}^2}{4} = \\frac{m v_{\\text{max}}^2}{4} \\)\n\nBut \\( v_{\\text{max}} = A \\sqrt{k/m} \\), so:\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{m}{4} \\left( A \\sqrt{k/m} \\right)^2 = \\frac{m}{4} \\cdot A^2 \\cdot \\frac{k}{m} = \\frac{k A^2}{4} \\)\n\nFor the new system with mass \\( 2m \\), the total energy is \\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} k (A')^2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{2} k (A')^2 = \\frac{k A^2}{4} \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( (A')^2 = \\frac{A^2}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\( A' = A / \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\nSo, in this case, the amplitude decreases to \\( A / \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nComparing the two cases:\n\n- If the second block falls when the first block is at maximum displacement (zero velocity), the amplitude remains the same.\n\n- If the second block falls when the first block is at equilibrium position (maximum velocity), the amplitude decreases to \\( A / \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the effect on the amplitude depends on where the original block was in its cycle when the second block fell.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D. It would depend on where the original block was in its cycle when the second block fell.\n\nI think I arrived at the correct conclusion, but let me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the general case where the first block is at some position \\( x \\) with velocity \\( v \\) when the second block falls.\n\nThen, after the collision, the two blocks move together with a new velocity \\( v' = \\frac{m v + m \\cdot 0}{2m} = \\frac{v}{2} \\)\n\nThe new total energy is \\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) (v')^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( v' = v / 2 \\):\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{1}{2} (2m) \\left( \\frac{v}{2} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 / 2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \\frac{m v^2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nBut before the collision, the total energy was \\( E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( E' = \\frac{m v^2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nComparing \\( E' \\) and \\( E \\):\n\n\\( E' = \\frac{m v^2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\n\\( E = \\frac{m v^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\)\n\nThe ratio \\( E' / E = \\left( \\frac{m v^2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\right) / \\left( \\frac{m v^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\right) \\)\n\nThis ratio depends on the values of \\( v \\) and \\( x \\), which in turn depend on the phase of the oscillation when the second block falls.\n\nTherefore, the new amplitude will depend on where the first block was in its cycle when the second block fell, because the energy after the collision depends on both the kinetic and potential energies at that instant.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
