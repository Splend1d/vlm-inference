Let's see what each of these theories generally stands for.\n\nFirst, realism. Realists focus on power and national interest. They believe that states are the main actors in international relations and that the international system is anarchic. Because of this, states must look out for their own security and survival. Realists are often skeptical of interventionism because they think it can be costly and may not serve a state's own interests. They might argue that using force abroad to promote human rights or democracy is immoral because it interferes with other states' sovereignty and could lead to unintended consequences, like destabilizing regions or getting entangled in endless conflicts.\n\nNext, idealism. Idealists, sometimes associated with liberal internationalism, believe that moral principles should guide foreign policy. They think that states can work together for collective goods and that international institutions can help achieve peace and cooperation. Idealists might support using force for humanitarian reasons or to promote democracy, seeing it as a moral obligation. So, it seems unlikely that idealism would consider such actions immoral.\n\nThen, liberalism. Liberal theories in international relations emphasize the role of institutions, interdependence, and cooperation among states. Liberals might support intervention in certain cases, especially when it comes to protecting human rights or preventing genocide, but they also value the rule of law and international norms. They might be more cautious about using force and would likely\u4e3b\u5f20 that interventions should be sanctioned by international bodies like the United Nations.\n\nGiven these general orientations, realism seems to be the theory that is most likely to consider it immoral to use force abroad for promoting human rights or democracy, due to their emphasis on sovereignty and national interest. Idealism, on the other hand, might see such interventions as moral imperatives, and liberalism would perhaps take a more nuanced approach, considering the circumstances and the legitimacy of the intervention.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Realism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
