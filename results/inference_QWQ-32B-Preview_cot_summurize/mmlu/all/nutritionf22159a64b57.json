                    "text": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterized by eosinophil-predominant inflammation in the esophagus. Let's evaluate each option in the context of EoE.\n\n**Option A: Leads to oesophageal diverticula**\n\nOesophageal diverticula are outpouchings of the esophageal wall, which can be caused by increased intraluminal pressure or weakness in the wall. While EoE can cause structural changes in the esophagus, such as strictures and rings, it is not primarily associated with the development of diverticula. Diverticula are more commonly associated with conditions like eosinophilic gastroenteritis or other disorders causing increased esophageal pressure. Therefore, this option is less accurate.\n\n**Option B: May cause oesophageal obstruction**\n\nEoE can indeed lead to oesophageal obstruction. One of the complications of EoE is the formation of rings and strictures in the esophagus due to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. These rings and strictures can narrow the esophageal lumen, leading to dysphagia and, in severe cases, obstruction. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\n**Option C: Is not due to allergy**\n\nEoE is considered an allergic/inflammatory disorder, with food and aeroallergens being major triggers. Allergens can induce an immune response that leads to eosinophil infiltration in the esophageal mucosa. Therefore, stating that EoE is not due to allergy is incorrect.\n\n**Option D: Benefits from antacid therapy**\n\nAntacid therapy is primarily used for conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where acid reflux is the main pathogenic factor. In EoE, while acid reflux may be present, the disease is driven by eosinophilic inflammation rather than acid exposure. Therefore, antacid therapy may not be sufficiently effective in managing EoE. Instead, treatments like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), topical corticosteroids, and dietary modifications are more appropriate. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct statement is:\n\n**B. May cause oesophageal obstruction**\n\nThis option accurately reflects a known complication of eosinophilic esophagitis."
