                    "text": "So I've got this question here about President George H.W. Bush and his idea of a \"new world order.\" He mentioned it in a speech to Congress in 1990, right around the time of the Gulf War. The question is asking which of these options\u2014The Monroe Doctrine, Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick,\" Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, or the Containment policy toward the Soviet Union\u2014most directly resembles Bush's \"new world order.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Bush meant by a \"new world order.\" From the quote, it seems like he's talking about a period after the Cold War where nations can cooperate more effectively, especially through the United Nations, to maintain peace and security. He mentions that dictators can no longer rely on East-West tensions to block UN action against aggression, suggesting a new era of international cooperation.\n\nLet me look at each option to see which one aligns best with this idea.\n\nA. The Monroe Doctrine: This was established by President James Monroe in 1823 and essentially said that the Americas should be free from future European colonization and interference. It was about keeping European powers out of the Western Hemisphere. That doesn't seem directly related to Bush's idea of global cooperation through the UN.\n\nB. Theodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\": This is associated with Roosevelt's foreign policy principle of \"Speak softly and carry a big stick,\" meaning to have a strong military ready for use if diplomacy fails. While Bush did authorize military action in the Gulf War, his \"new world order\" seems more about cooperation and less about unilateral military strength.\n\nC. Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points: Wilson presented these points in 1918 as a blueprint for peace after World War I. They included ideas like open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, disarmament, and the creation of a general association of nations (which became the League of Nations). This seems similar to Bush's vision of a new era of international cooperation and collective security.\n\nD. Containment policy toward the Soviet Union: This was the U.S. policy during the Cold War to prevent the spread of communism and Soviet influence. With the Cold War ending around the time of Bush's speech, his \"new world order\" seems to be looking beyond containment to a post-Cold War international order.\n\nComparing these, Wilson's Fourteen Points appear to be the most directly similar to Bush's \"new world order,\" as both emphasize international cooperation and collective security through global institutions.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Wilson's Fourteen Points were about preventing future wars and establishing a league of nations to handle international disputes. Bush was also talking about preventing aggression and strengthening the United Nations' role in maintaining peace.\n\nAdditionally, both visions were presented after significant conflicts: Wilson after World War I and Bush after the Gulf War. Both saw a need for a new approach to international relations in the wake of those conflicts.\n\nMoreover, Bush specifically mentions that the United Nations can now act more effectively without being stymied by East-West confrontation, which suggests a new era similar to what Wilson envisioned after the end of World War I.\n\nOn the other hand, the Monroe Doctrine and Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" are more about U.S. regional influence and unilateral power, which doesn't align as closely with Bush's cooperative vision.\n\nThe containment policy was about opposing Soviet expansion, which is not directly related to the idea of a new world order based on international cooperation beyond the Cold War.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be C, Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if there might be a better match. Let's think about this differently. Maybe the \"new world order\" has elements that aren't exactly like Wilson's Fourteen Points.\n\nFor example, Bush was speaking in the context of the Cold War ending, which opened up new possibilities for international cooperation that Wilson didn't have to consider. The UN was already established by Bush's time, whereas Wilson's idea was to create the League of Nations.\n\nHowever, the core idea of a rules-based international order, where nations work together to maintain peace and security, is similar in both cases.\n\nPerhaps the key difference is that Wilson's Fourteen Points were more idealistic and didn't fully account for the realities of power politics, as evidenced by the U.S. not joining the League of Nations.\n\nIn contrast, Bush's \"new world order\" might have been more grounded in the practical realities of the post-Cold War world, with the UN as an existing institution that could be strengthened.\n\nBut despite these differences, the overall vision of greater international cooperation for peace and security connects both ideas.\n\nLet me consider if any of the other options could be a better fit.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine was about U.S. hegemony in the Western Hemisphere, which is quite different from Bush's global vision.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" diplomacy used military power as a tool for achieving foreign policy goals, which again differs from Bush's emphasis on cooperation through international organizations.\n\nThe containment policy was specifically aimed at countering Soviet communism, which is not directly related to the concept of a new world order beyond the Cold War.\n\nTherefore, despite some differences, Wilson's Fourteen Points remain the most directly similar to Bush's \"new world order\" in terms of promoting international cooperation and collective security.\n\nIt's also worth noting that both visions were ambitious and faced challenges in implementation. Wilson's League of Nations failed to prevent World War II, and Bush's \"new world order\" has also faced obstacles in the decades since his speech.\n\nNevertheless, the similarity in vision makes option C the best choice among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
