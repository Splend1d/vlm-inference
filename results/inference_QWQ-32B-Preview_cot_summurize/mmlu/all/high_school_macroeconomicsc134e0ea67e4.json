                    "text": "So I have this question here about contractionary fiscal policy, and I need to identify which option isn't an example of it. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what contractionary fiscal policy is. I think it's when the government tries to reduce inflation by decreasing the money supply or reducing spending. Maybe increasing taxes is part of it too. Basically, it's policies that are meant to cool down the economy when it's overheating.\n\nOption A says \"Decreasing money spent on social programs.\" That sounds like the government is cutting back on spending, which should be contractionary, right? So that seems like it fits.\n\nOption B is \"Increasing income taxes.\" Hmm, increasing taxes means people have less disposable income, so they might spend less, which could help reduce inflation. So that seems like contractionary fiscal policy as well.\n\nOption C is \"Canceling the annual cost of living adjustments to the salaries of government employees.\" Okay, so if the government doesn't adjust salaries for inflation, that might mean government employees don't get raises they otherwise would have. Is that similar to cutting spending or something? Maybe it's like not increasing spending, which could be considered contractionary.\n\nOption D says \"Increasing money spent to pay for government projects.\" Now, this sounds like the government is spending more money. Wouldn't that be expansionary fiscal policy, aimed at stimulating the economy? So, if the government is increasing spending, that should be the opposite of contractionary policy.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to choose which one is NOT an example of contractionary fiscal policy. So, if A, B, and C are all contractionary, and D is expansionary, then D would be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Contractionary fiscal policy involves reducing the money supply or reducing government spending to decrease inflation. So, increasing spending on government projects would be adding more money into the economy, which is expansionary.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct choice because it's not contractionary; it's expansionary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
