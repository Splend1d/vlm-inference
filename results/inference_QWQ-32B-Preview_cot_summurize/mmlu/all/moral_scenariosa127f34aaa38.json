It can make the person being followed feel unsafe or scared. In many places, it's even against the law to stalk or follow someone without a valid reason. So, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action would likely be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character says, \"When I paid the bill, I put a 42-cent stamp on it to make sure it arrived.\" This seems like an attempt to ensure that the bill is properly mailed. Using an extra stamp might be unnecessary, but it's not inherently harmful or wrong. In fact, it could be seen as cautious or thorough. There's nothing in this action that would typically be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering these analyses, the correct answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
