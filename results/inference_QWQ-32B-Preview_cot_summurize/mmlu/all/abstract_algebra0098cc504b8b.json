                    "text": "So I have this problem here: find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q. The options are 0, 2, 1, and 3. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what a field extension is. I know that if you have two fields, say E and F, and F is a subset of E, then E is an extension of F. In this case, we have Q(sqrt(2)) which is an extension of Q, the rational numbers.\n\nNow, the degree of the extension E over F is the dimension of E when you consider it as a vector space over F. So, Q(sqrt(2)) is a vector space over Q, and its dimension is the degree of the extension.\n\nAlright, so I need to find the dimension of Q(sqrt(2)) as a vector space over Q.\n\nLet me think about what Q(sqrt(2)) consists of. It's all the numbers of the form a + b*sqrt(2), where a and b are rational numbers. So, any element in Q(sqrt(2)) can be written as a linear combination of 1 and sqrt(2), with coefficients in Q.\n\nThat means that {1, sqrt(2)} spans Q(sqrt(2)) over Q.\n\nNow, I need to check if this set is linearly independent over Q. Suppose that a*1 + b*sqrt(2) = 0, where a and b are rational numbers. If a and b are both zero, that's obvious. But if one of them is non-zero, does that equation hold?\n\nWell, if a + b*sqrt(2) = 0, and a and b are rational, then if b is not zero, sqrt(2) would have to be rational, which it's not. So, b must be zero, and then a must be zero as well. Therefore, {1, sqrt(2)} is linearly independent over Q.\n\nSince {1, sqrt(2)} spans Q(sqrt(2)) and is linearly independent, it forms a basis for Q(sqrt(2)) over Q. Therefore, the dimension is 2.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's a smaller set that spans it, or maybe a larger one.\n\nIs there a way to express sqrt(2) in terms of 1, or vice versa? No, because sqrt(2) is irrational. So, we definitely need both 1 and sqrt(2) to generate all elements of Q(sqrt(2)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a polynomial relation between sqrt(2) and 1, but sqrt(2) satisfies the polynomial x^2 - 2 = 0 over Q, which is a degree 2 polynomial.\n\nWait, that might be relevant. The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2, which is degree 2. I think the degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2))/Q is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q.\n\nThat makes sense, because the basis {1, sqrt(2)} has two elements, matching the degree of the minimal polynomial.\n\nSo, the degree of the extension is 2.\n\nLooking back at the options, 2 is one of them.\n\nBut let's make sure that 0, 1, and 3 are not possible.\n\nDegree 0 doesn't make sense for a field extension; it's usually at least 1.\n\nDegree 1 would mean that Q(sqrt(2)) is equal to Q, but that's not true because sqrt(2) is not in Q.\n\nDegree 3 would suggest that the minimal polynomial has degree 3, but sqrt(2) satisfies a degree 2 polynomial, so it can't be 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
