                    "text": "So I have this sentence: \"Dylan likes neither math nor science.\" And I need to pick the best symbolization from these options:\n\nA. M \u2228 S\n\nB. ~(M \u2022 S)\n\nC. ~(M \u2228 S)\n\nD. ~M \u2228 ~S\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. \"Neither math nor science\" means Dylan doesn't like math and he doesn't like science. So both are not liked by Dylan.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- M probably stands for \"Dylan likes math.\"\n\n- S probably stands for \"Dylan likes science.\"\n\nSo, \"neither math nor science\" means not M and not S.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. M \u2228 S - This means M or S, which is \"Dylan likes math or Dylan likes science.\" That's not what the sentence is saying.\n\nB. ~(M \u2022 S) - This is \"not (M and S),\" which means Dylan doesn't like both math and science. But the original sentence says he likes neither, which is different.\n\nC. ~(M \u2228 S) - This is \"not (M or S),\" which means neither M nor S, so Dylan likes neither math nor science. That seems to match.\n\nD. ~M \u2228 ~S - This is \"not M or not S,\" which means either Dylan doesn't like math or he doesn't like science or both. That's a bit different from liking neither.\n\nWait, let me think about option D. \"Not M or not S\" could mean that at least one of them he doesn't like, but it could also include the possibility that he doesn't like one but likes the other. But the original sentence says he likes neither, meaning he doesn't like both.\n\nSo, option C seems to capture that better because it's saying he doesn't like math and he doesn't like science.\n\nLet me double-check with logical equivalence.\n\nOption C: ~(M \u2228 S) is equivalent to ~M \u2022 ~S by De Morgan's law.\n\nSo, ~(M \u2228 S) means ~M and ~S, which is \"Dylan doesn't like math and Dylan doesn't like science.\"\n\nThat matches the original sentence perfectly.\n\nOption D: ~M \u2228 ~S means \"Dylan doesn't like math or Dylan doesn't like science,\" which could be true even if he likes one of them, as long as he doesn't like at least one.\n\nBut the original sentence says he likes neither, meaning he doesn't like both.\n\nSo, C seems to be the best choice.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nOption B: ~(M \u2022 S) means \"it is not the case that Dylan likes both math and science.\" This could be true if he likes only one of them or neither. But the original sentence specifies that he likes neither.\n\nSo, C is more specific and matches the original sentence better.\n\nOption A is clearly incorrect because it says he likes math or science, which is the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the best symbolization is C. ~(M \u2228 S).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
