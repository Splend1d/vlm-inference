                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Dash Co.'s utility bills, and I need to figure out what amount they should report as a liability on their June 30 balance sheet. Let's see what information is given:\n\n- For the period April 16 to May 15, the amount is $5000, and it was paid on June 1.\n\n- For May 16 to June 15, it's $6000, paid on July 1.\n\n- For June 16 to July 15, it's $8000, and the payment date isn't specified, but it's probably for August 1, since the next period follows that pattern.\n\nI need to determine the liability as of June 30. So, liabilities are obligations that the company has at that date, which means any utility bills that have been incurred but not yet paid by June 30.\n\nLet me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, look at the period April 16 to May 15: $5000, paid on June 1. So, this bill was paid on June 1, which is before June 30. Therefore, by June 30, this bill has already been paid, so it shouldn't be reported as a liability.\n\nNext, May 16 to June 15: $6000, paid on July 1. This bill covers services from May 16 to June 15, and it's paid in July. So, as of June 30, this bill has been incurred but not yet paid. Therefore, this $6000 should be reported as a liability.\n\nNow, June 16 to July 15: $8000, paid on August 1. This bill covers services from June 16 to July 15, and it's paid in August. So, as of June 30, only part of this period has passed (from June 16 to June 30), but the entire bill hasn't been incurred yet. However, since the bill is for the full period and hasn't been paid yet, and some of the services have been received by June 30, I need to see if any part of this should be accrued.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to accrue the portion of the bill that corresponds to the period up to June 30. The period is from June 16 to July 15, which is 30 days. The period from June 16 to June 30 is 15 days. So, half of the bill could be considered incurred by June 30.\n\nSo, $8000 for 30 days, so $400 per day. From June 16 to June 30 is 15 days, so $400 x 15 = $6000.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because 15 days of $400 would be $6000, but the total bill is $8000 for 30 days. So, daily rate is $8000 / 30 = $266.67 per day. So, 15 days would be $266.67 x 15 = $4000.\n\nWait, let me recalculate that.\n\nTotal bill: $8000 for 30 days.\n\nDaily utility cost: $8000 / 30 = $266.67 per day.\n\nPeriod from June 16 to June 30: 15 days.\n\nSo, accrued utility expense as of June 30: $266.67 x 15 = $4000.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the $6000 for May 16 to June 15, there's an additional $4000 accrued for June 16 to June 30.\n\nTotal liability: $6000 + $4000 = $10,000.\n\nWait, but let's check the options:\n\nA. $6,000\n\nB. $7,000\n\nC. $10,000\n\nD. $14,000\n\nSo, $10,000 is one of the options, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut let me double-check if I'm missing something.\n\nIs there any other bill that hasn't been paid by June 30?\n\nThe April 16 to May 15 bill was paid on June 1, so it's already paid.\n\nThe May 16 to June 15 bill is paid on July 1, so it's a liability as of June 30.\n\nThe June 16 to July 15 bill is paid on August 1, but only half of the period has passed by June 30, so only half of the bill should be accrued, which is $4000.\n\nTherefore, total liability is $6000 + $4000 = $10,000.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc. $10,000"
