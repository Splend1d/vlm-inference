                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about schools of jurisprudence. It says that certain philosophers believe law is a set of rules developed, communicated, and enforced by the ruling party, and it's not about morality, history, logic, or sociology. I need to choose the right school from the options: Command, Law and Economics, Natural Law, or Critical Legal Studies.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each school is about.\n\nStarting with Natural Law. I think this is the idea that there are moral laws that are inherent in nature and that law should reflect these moral principles. So, if law is based on morality, that doesn't match the description in the question, which says law isn't a reflection of society's morality.\n\nNext, Law and Economics. This seems to be about analyzing law through economic principles, like cost-benefit analysis. It's more about the efficiency and economic impact of laws rather than their origin from the ruling party.\n\nCritical Legal Studies sounds like it critiques the law and perhaps looks at how law reinforces social inequalities. It might focus on the power dynamics in society, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nThen there's the Command school. I think this relates to the idea that law is simply commands from the sovereign enforced by sanctions. This sounds a lot like the description in the question: rules developed, communicated, and enforced by the ruling party, without reference to morality, history, logic, or sociology.\n\nLet me double-check. The Command theory of law, often associated with legal positivism, holds that law is the command of the sovereign backed by threats. It doesn't concern itself with the moral validity of the law.\n\nSo, comparing this to the other options:\n\n- Natural Law ties law to morality, which contradicts the question.\n\n- Law and Economics ties law to economic analysis, which isn't about who makes the law.\n\n- Critical Legal Studies seems more about critiquing law and its social effects, not about law being commands from the ruling party.\n\n- Command theory directly aligns with law being commands from the ruling party, enforced through sanctions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Command.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should make sure that none of the other options fit better.\n\nLet's look back at the question: \"the law is a set of rules developed, communicated, and enforced by the ruling party rather than a reflection of the society's morality, history, logic, or sociology.\"\n\nNatural Law opposes this by linking law to morality.\n\nLaw and Economics focuses on economic efficiency, not on who makes the law.\n\nCritical Legal Studies might look at how law is used by those in power, but it's more about critiquing the law and its effects on society, particularly regarding inequality.\n\nCommand theory, however, directly states that law is about commands from the ruling authority enforced by sanctions, without considering morality or other factors.\n\nSo, yes, A. Command seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
