The options are:\n\nA. 18x + 15\n\nB. 18x + 3\n\nC. 7x + 8\n\nD. 2x + 8\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the given expression. It looks like there's distribution and combining like terms involved here.\n\nSo, starting with 5(4x + 3) - 2x.\n\nI should distribute the 5 across the terms inside the parentheses.\n\nThat means 5 times 4x and 5 times 3.\n\n5 times 4x is 20x, and 5 times 3 is 15.\n\nSo, after distribution, the expression becomes 20x + 15 - 2x.\n\nNow, I need to combine like terms. The like terms here are 20x and -2x.\n\n20x minus 2x is 18x.\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to 18x + 15.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 18x + 15.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me go through it again.\n\nStarting with 5(4x + 3) - 2x.\n\nDistribute the 5: 5 * 4x = 20x, and 5 * 3 = 15.\n\nSo, 20x + 15 - 2x.\n\nCombine like terms: 20x - 2x = 18x, and the +15 stays the same.\n\nSo, 18x + 15.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 18x + 15\n\nB. 18x + 3\n\nC. 7x + 8\n\nD. 2x + 8\n\nOption A matches the expression I arrived at.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if any of the other options could possibly be correct.\n\nMaybe there's a different way to simplify it, or perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there are any other operations I need to perform.\n\nIs there any possibility of factoring or anything like that?\n\nNo, the question is to simplify the expression, and I've done that by distributing and combining like terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plug in a value for x and see which option matches the result.\n\nLet's try x = 1.\n\nOriginal expression: 5(4*1 + 3) - 2*1 = 5(4 + 3) - 2 = 5*7 - 2 = 35 - 2 = 33.\n\nNow, option A: 18*1 + 15 = 18 + 15 = 33.\n\nOption B: 18*1 + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21.\n\nOption C: 7*1 + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.\n\nOption D: 2*1 + 8 = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nSo, only option A gives the same result as the original expression when x = 1.\n\nThis further confirms that A is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be extra sure, let's try another value for x, say x = 0.\n\nOriginal expression: 5(4*0 + 3) - 2*0 = 5(0 + 3) - 0 = 5*3 - 0 = 15.\n\nOption A: 18*0 + 15 = 0 + 15 = 15.\n\nOption B: 18*0 + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3.\n\nOption C: 7*0 + 8 = 0 + 8 = 8.\n\nOption D: 2*0 + 8 = 0 + 8 = 8.\n\nAgain, only option A matches the original expression.\n\nLooks like A is definitely the correct answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed it sufficiently.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
