This is important because liquid water is considered essential for life as we know it. The boundaries of this zone depend on various factors, including the star's luminosity and temperature.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the habitable zone doesn't necessarily mean that humans can survive there. Even if a planet is in the habitable zone, it may not have the necessary atmospheric conditions, gravity, or other factors required for human life.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that the habitable zone is related to the amount of radiation a planet receives, but it's not solely about ultraviolet radiation not destroying organisms. It's more broadly about the balance of energy received from the star allowing for liquid water.\n\nOption D is too broad because the habitable zone is a region where life could potentially exist, but it doesn't guarantee that life is present there. It's a zone of potential habitability, not actual habitation.\n\nSo, the most accurate definition is option A: the region around a star where liquid water can potentially exist on planetary surfaces."
