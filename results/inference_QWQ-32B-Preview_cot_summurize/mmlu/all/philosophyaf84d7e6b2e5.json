                    "text": "I'm trying to understand what \"meaning in life\" means. There are four options here: external meaning, God's plan, internal meaning, and meaning in an afterlife. I need to figure out which one is being referred to.\n\nFirst, let's consider \"external meaning.\" This might refer to meaning that comes from outside ourselves, perhaps from society, culture, or other people. It could be about fulfilling roles or meeting expectations set by others. But is that what we usually mean by \"meaning in life\"?\n\nNext, \"God's plan\" suggests that the meaning in life is predetermined by a higher power. For people who believe in a divine being, their life's purpose might be aligned with God's will or plan for them. This could be a source of meaning for them.\n\nThen there's \"internal meaning.\" This seems to suggest that meaning comes from within oneself, perhaps from personal values, goals, or aspirations. It's more about self-determination and finding purpose from one's own perspective.\n\nLastly, \"meaning in an afterlife\" implies that the significance of life is found beyond this earthly existence, in some form of afterlife or spiritual realm.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to think about what \"meaning in life\" generally refers to. I think it's important to consider that different people may have different views on this. Some might find meaning through external sources, others through their relationship with a higher power, some from within themselves, and others in the context of an afterlife.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose one that is most commonly associated with the phrase \"meaning in life,\" I would lean towards \"internal meaning.\" This is because many philosophical and psychological perspectives emphasize that meaning is something individuals construct for themselves, based on their own values and experiences.\n\nFor example, humanistic psychologists like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers stress the importance of self-actualization and personal growth in finding meaning. Similarly, existential philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Viktor Frankl argue that individuals must create their own meaning in life, as there is no preordained purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, religious or spiritual individuals might see God's plan or meaning in the afterlife as central to their sense of purpose. But since the question seems to be seeking a general definition, I think \"internal meaning\" is the most inclusive and widely accepted notion.\n\nAdditionally, the other options seem more specific to certain belief systems. \"External meaning\" might be relevant in a societal or cultural context, but it doesn't capture the personal aspect that \"meaning in life\" often entails. \"God's plan\" is specific to theistic beliefs, and \"meaning in an afterlife\" assumes a belief in life after death, which not everyone holds.\n\nTherefore, I believe that \"meaning in life\" primarily refers to \"internal meaning,\" which is the sense of purpose and significance that individuals derive from their own experiences, values, and aspirations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. internal meaning}} \\]"
