So, there's a defendant who's been prosecuted for aggravated assault after he stabbed a man in the chest during a dispute over a gambling debt. The defendant says he acted in self-defense because the other guy drew a knife and made threatening moves. The defendant brought a witness to testify about his reputation for being a peaceful person. Now, on cross-examination, the prosecutor asks the witness if he's heard that the defendant often engaged in fights and brawls. The defendant's attorney objects, and the judge has to decide whether to allow the question or not.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. proper, because it tends to show the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation.\n\nB. proper, because it is relevant to prove the defendant's violent propensities.\n\nC. not proper, because it puts into evidence separate and unrelated offenses.\n\nD. not proper, because character cannot be proved by generalities.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The defendant is claiming self-defense, which means he's saying he only stabbed the other guy because he was in danger and had to protect himself. To support this, he's bringing in a witness to say that he has a reputation for being peaceful, which might suggest that he wouldn't normally be the aggressor in a situation.\n\nNow, on cross-examination, the prosecutor wants to ask the witness if he's heard that the defendant often engages in fights and brawls. This seems like the prosecutor is trying to impeach the witness's testimony about the defendant's peaceful reputation by suggesting that the witness might be unaware of the defendant's actual behavior.\n\nOption A says the question is proper because it shows the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation. Hmm, that makes sense in a way because if the witness is testifying about the defendant's reputation for being peaceful, it's relevant to see if the witness is aware of any contrary information that might contradict that reputation.\n\nOption B says it's proper because it's relevant to prove the defendant's violent propensities. In some cases, character evidence can be used to show propensity, but in criminal trials, character evidence is generally not allowed to prove that the defendant acted in accordance with a bad character on a specific occasion. There are exceptions, like when the defendant introduces character evidence first, but I need to think carefully about that.\n\nOption C says it's not proper because it puts separate and unrelated offenses into evidence. This seems similar to the general rule against introducing prior bad acts to show propensity, but again, since the defendant has introduced character evidence through the witness's testimony about his peaceful reputation, maybe the rules change.\n\nOption D says it's not proper because character cannot be proved by generalities. I think this might be related to the rules about how character evidence can be introduced, perhaps through specific instances or reputation testimony.\n\nLet me try to recall the rules about character evidence in criminal trials. Generally, in criminal cases, character evidence regarding the defendant is not admissible to prove that the defendant acted in accordance with a particular character trait on a specific occasion. This is to prevent the jury from convicting someone based on their past behavior rather than the evidence of the current charge.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. One exception is when the defendant introduces character evidence first, particularly in cases where character is directly at issue, like in self-defense cases. If the defendant claims self-defense, arguing that he acted out of necessity to protect himself, the prosecution might be allowed to introduce evidence to rebut that character testimony.\n\nIn this case, the defendant has introduced a witness to testify about his peaceful reputation, which is a part of his character. By doing so, he has opened the door to allow the prosecution to introduce evidence to rebut that characterization.\n\nSo, in cross-examining the witness, the prosecutor is trying to show that the witness might be unaware of the defendant's violent tendencies, which contradicts the testimony about his peaceful reputation.\n\nGiven that, option A seems plausible because it's about the witness's knowledge. If the witness is testifying about the defendant's reputation for being peaceful, it's relevant to see if he's aware of information that contradicts that reputation.\n\nOption B mentions proving violent propensities, but as I recall, introducing character evidence to prove propensity is generally not allowed, except in certain situations. Since the defendant has introduced character evidence, the prosecution might be allowed to introduce rebuttal evidence regarding character.\n\nOption C says it's not proper because it introduces separate and unrelated offenses. While that might be true in general, again, since the defendant has opened the door by introducing character evidence, the prosecution might be allowed to introduce such evidence for rebuttal purposes.\n\nOption D says character cannot be proved by generalities, but actually, character evidence is often introduced through reputation testimony, which is a general statement about how a person is regarded in the community.\n\nLooking back at the question, the prosecutor is asking the witness if he has heard that the defendant often engaged in fights and brawls. This seems like an attempt to impeach the witness's testimony about the defendant's peaceful reputation by suggesting that there are contrary rumors or information out there.\n\nIn trial practice, when a witness testifies about a person's character or reputation, cross-examination can probe the witness's knowledge of contrary behavior or reputation. This is to assess the witness's basis for their opinion and the completeness of their knowledge.\n\nTherefore, asking the witness if he has heard that the defendant engaged in fights and brawls seems like a legitimate line of questioning to challenge the witness's knowledge and the accuracy of his testimony about the defendant's peaceful reputation.\n\nSo, option A seems correct: the question is proper because it tends to show the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation.\n\nOption B might also seem attractive because it suggests relevance to the defendant's violent propensities, but given the general rules against character evidence to prove propensity, and the specific context of the question being part of cross-examination of a witness who testified about reputation, option A is more directly on point.\n\nOption C is perhaps incorrect because, in this specific context where character has been put in issue by the defendant, evidence of separate acts might be allowed for rebuttal purposes.\n\nOption D doesn't seem applicable here because the question isn't about proving character by generalities; it's about probing the witness's knowledge of contrary information.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should rule the question proper, because it tends to show the witness's knowledge of the defendant's reputation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
