REBT, and D. token economies. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what counterconditioning is. From what I remember, counterconditioning is a psychological technique used to treat phobias and other anxiety disorders. It involves replacing a negative emotional response with a positive one. So, if someone has a phobia of dogs, for example, counterconditioning would aim to change their fear response to dogs into a more positive or neutral one.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Flooding: I think flooding is a type of exposure therapy where the person is exposed to the full intensity of the feared stimulus right away. It's like throwing someone who's afraid of water into deep water to get over the fear. But I'm not sure if counterconditioning is the main aspect of flooding. Maybe not this one.\n\nB. Systematic desensitization: This sounds familiar. Isn't that another type of exposure therapy where the person is gradually exposed to the feared stimulus in a step-by-step manner? So, maybe starting with thinking about the feared object, then looking at pictures, then being near the object, and so on. And during each step, they're taught relaxation techniques to counter the anxiety. Hmm, that sounds a lot like counterconditioning\u2014replacing the anxiety with relaxation.\n\nC. REBT: That's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. It's more about changing irrational beliefs and thoughts rather than directly changing emotional responses through exposure. So, probably not the best fit for counterconditioning.\n\nD. Token economies: This seems more related to behavior modification, where tokens or points are given as rewards for desired behaviors. It's used in settings like schools or mental institutions to encourage good behavior. Doesn't seem directly related to counterconditioning.\n\nSo, between A and B, systematic desensitization seems more aligned with counterconditioning because it involves gradual exposure combined with relaxation techniques to replace the negative emotional response.\n\nLet me double-check. Flooding is about immediate and intense exposure without any gradual buildup, which might not involve as much counterconditioning as systematic desensitization does.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. systematic desensitization.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
