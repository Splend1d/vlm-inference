                    "text": "So Shannon forgot her pillow while camping and had to sleep with her head flat on the ground, which she didn't like at all. The question is about what her failure to fold up her jeans and sweater to use as a pillow-substitute best illustrates. The options are:\n\nA. the availability heuristic\n\nB. functional fixedness\n\nC. confirmation bias\n\nD. the representativeness heuristic\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with A, the availability heuristic, that's when people make judgments based on how easily examples come to mind. So, if someone thinks airplane crashes are more common because they hear about them in the news, even if statistically they're rare, that's availability heuristic at work.\n\nOption B is functional fixedness. This is a cognitive bias where someone can only think of an object serving one particular purpose, its usual or standard function. For example, seeing a hammer only as a tool for driving nails, not realizing it could be used as a paperweight or a tool to stop a wobbly table.\n\nOption C, confirmation bias, is when people favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, ignoring evidence to the contrary.\n\nAnd option D, the representativeness heuristic, is when people make judgments about the probability of things based on how much they resemble certain prototypes or stereotypes, often ignoring base rates and other statistical information.\n\nNow, applying these to Shannon's situation. She forgot her pillow and didn't think to use her jeans and sweater as a substitute. So, it seems like she was unable to think beyond the usual function of these items.\n\nLooking back at functional fixedness, which is about being unable to see alternative uses for objects beyond their typical functions, this seems quite relevant. Shannon might have seen her jeans and sweater only as clothing, not as potential pillows.\n\nAvailability heuristic doesn't seem to fit here because it's about how easily examples come to mind, not about using objects in different ways.\n\nConfirmation bias isn't really applicable because there's no indication that Shannon was favoring information that confirms her preexisting beliefs.\n\nSimilarly, the representativeness heuristic doesn't seem to fit because it's about judging probabilities based on similarity to prototypes, which isn't directly related to Shannon's problem.\n\nTherefore, functional fixedness seems to be the best answer here. Shannon couldn't think of using her jeans and sweater as a pillow-substitute because she was fixed on their standard functions as clothing.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe Shannon was so tired or stressed about forgetting her pillow that she couldn't think clearly, but the question is specifically about her failure to come up with an alternative use for her jeans and sweater.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she did consider using them but decided against it for some reason, but the statement says she complained about having to sleep with her head flat on the ground, implying that she didn't consider or couldn't think of using her clothing as a pillow.\n\nSo, overall, functional fixedness appears to be the most appropriate concept to explain Shannon's behavior in this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
