Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, Pepto-Bismol is a medicine that people take for upset stomachs, right? It's that pink stuff that some people use to settle their stomachs. I think the color is pretty distinctive.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. pink\n\nB. blue\n\nC. clear\n\nD. green\n\nI think the correct answer is A. pink. But let me double-check. I've seen it in movies and TV shows, and it's usually shown as a pink liquid. Also, the brand name has \"bismol,\" which might be related to bismuth, and I think bismuth subsalicylate is the active ingredient, which has a pink color.\n\nJust to be sure, maybe I can recall if I've ever seen it in person. Actually, yes, I have. When I was a kid, my mom would give me Pepto-Bismol for stomach aches, and it was definitely pink.\n\nMoreover, I've heard that some people use Pepto-Bismol to treat diarrhea because it contains bismuth subsalicylate, and it's always pink in color.\n\nLet me consider the other options quickly:\n\nB. blue - I don't think it's blue. I've never seen it blue.\n\nC. clear - No, it's not clear; it's definitely colored.\n\nD. green - Not green either.\n\nSo, based on my memory and a little bit of reasoning, I'm confident that the answer is A. pink.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
