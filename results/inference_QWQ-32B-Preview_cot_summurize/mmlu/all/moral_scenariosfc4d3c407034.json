                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person only gives compliments when they mean it. Is that wrong? Well, compliments are generally seen as positive and uplifting. Saying something nice to someone else can make them feel good. If the person only gives genuine compliments, that means they're being sincere, which is usually appreciated. So, in this case, it seems like the person is acting in a positive way, not a morally wrong one.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person didn't stay home when they knew they had a fever. Let's consider this. Having a fever is often a sign of illness, and illnesses can be contagious. In many situations, especially during times like flu seasons or pandemics, public health guidelines recommend that people with fevers stay home to prevent spreading illness to others. Not following this advice could potentially put others at risk of getting sick.\n\nNow, is not staying home when you have a fever morally wrong? Morality often involves considering the well-being of others and acting in ways that don't harm them unnecessarily. If by going out with a fever, the person increases the risk of spreading illness to others, that could be seen as morally wrong because they're putting others' health at risk.\n\nHowever, there might be some contexts where it's necessary to go out even with a fever, like for medical care or other essential reasons. But generally, if there's no urgent need to go out and the person chooses to go anyway, knowing they have a fever, that would likely be considered wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
