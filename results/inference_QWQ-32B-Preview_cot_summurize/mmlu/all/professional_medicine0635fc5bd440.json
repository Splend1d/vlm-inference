His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. His mother says that she was careful to apply his sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. His only medication is a topical corticosteroid for several dry, scaly patches of the skin. He appears weak and lethargic. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight; he has had no change in his weight since his last examination 9 months ago. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 28/min. Examination of the skin shows a purple-red discoloration over the cheeks and eyelids, periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, and flat-topped red papules over all knuckles. There is generalized weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n\nA. Dermatomyositis\nB. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy\nC. Eczema\nD. Lyme disease\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. There's this 9-year-old boy who's been getting weaker and has some purple-red spots on his cheeks and eyelids. This started after a camping trip, and now he's having trouble doing lots of things like climbing stairs and dressing himself. His mom says she put sunscreen on him and doesn't think he was bitten by any ticks or touched any poisonous plants. He's been using a topical steroid for some dry, scaly patches on his skin.\n\nSo, first, I need to consider what could be causing his weakness and the skin changes. The skin symptoms are pretty specific: purple-red discoloration on the cheeks and eyelids, which is called a heliotrope rash, and there's also periorbital edema, which is swelling around the eyes. There are erythematous plaques and scales on his elbows and knees, and flat-topped red bumps on his knuckles. Plus, he's generally weak, especially in his proximal muscles, which are the ones closer to the trunk.\n\nOption A is dermatomyositis. I've heard of that. It's an inflammatory muscle disease that often comes with characteristic skin rashes. The heliotrope rash and the Gottron's papules on the knuckles are classic for dermatomyositis. Also, the muscle weakness, especially in the proximal muscles, matches what's described.\n\nOption B is Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. That's a genetic muscle disorder that usually shows up in early childhood, around ages 3 to 5, and progresses over time. It's more common in boys because it's an X-linked recessive disorder. But typically, Duchenne's doesn't come with skin rashes. So, the skin symptoms make this less likely.\n\nOption C is eczema. That's a common skin condition with dry, scaly patches, which matches some of his symptoms. But eczema doesn't usually cause muscle weakness. So, probably not the main issue here.\n\nOption D is Lyme disease. That's something you can get from a tick bite, and it can cause various symptoms, including muscle aches and skin rashes like erythema migrans. But the heliotrope rash and the specific muscle weakness pattern don't really fit with Lyme disease. Also, the mom didn't recall any tick bites.\n\nGiven all this, it seems like dermatomyositis is the most likely diagnosis. The combination of the characteristic skin rash and the progressive muscle weakness points strongly in that direction. The camping trip might have been coincidental, or perhaps there's an environmental trigger, but without a clear tick bite or other exposure, Lyme disease seems less probable.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Dermatomyositis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
