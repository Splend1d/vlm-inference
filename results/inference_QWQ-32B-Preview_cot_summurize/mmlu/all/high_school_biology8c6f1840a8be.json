                    "text": "Let's see. I need to identify which of these options is not a mode of asexual reproduction. So, first, I should recall what asexual reproduction is. Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction that doesn't involve the combination of gametes from two parents. It's basically when an organism can create offspring on its own without any genetic contribution from another organism.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Sporulation: I think this is when certain organisms, like fungi or bacteria, produce spores that can develop into new individuals. I believe this is a form of asexual reproduction because these spores are produced without the fusion of gametes.\n\nB. Fission: This sounds like cell division, where one cell splits into two. I know that in organisms like bacteria, this is how they reproduce asexually. So, fission should be a mode of asexual reproduction.\n\nC. Budding: I recall that budding is when a new organism grows out of the parent organism, like in yeast or some plants. Again, this seems to be asexual because it doesn't involve mating or gamete fusion.\n\nD. Meiosis: Now, meiosis is a type of cell division that produces gametes, like sperm and eggs in animals, or gametes in plants. This is typically associated with sexual reproduction because it involves the formation of sex cells that can combine to form a zygote.\n\nWait a minute, meiosis is actually a key part of sexual reproduction, not asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, there's no meiosis because there's no need to produce gametes; the offspring are genetically identical to the parent.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, sporulation, fission, and budding are all methods of asexual reproduction, while meiosis is part of the sexual reproduction process.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. meiosis.\n\nBut just to double-check, I should make sure that none of the other options involve sexual reproduction. Sporulation is definitely asexual; fission is asexual; budding is asexual. Meiosis is definitely related to sexual reproduction.\n\nSo, yeah, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
