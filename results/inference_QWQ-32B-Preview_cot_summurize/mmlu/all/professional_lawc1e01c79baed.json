Two months later, the woman was entertaining a friend at her home. As they talked, they noticed that the dishwasher was operating strangely, repeatedly stopping and starting. They saw sparks start flying out from underneath the dishwasher. The friend said, \"It must have a short circuit or something. Don't touch it or you might get electrocuted. \" The woman asked if she should go down to the fuse box in her basement to cut off the electricity. The friend decided that he would take a look inside the dishwasher first. When he touched the metal handle on the dishwasher's door, he received a violent electric shock. The dishwasher had an internal wiring defect that caused it to malfunction. The contractor who installed the dishwasher failed to adequately ground the machine; if he had done so, the electric current would have been led harmlessly away. The machine carried instructions for proper grounding, but the contractor did not follow them.

                    "text": "So here's this scenario: A woman gets her kitchen renovated, and the contractor installs a new dishwasher. Everything seems fine for two months, but then, during a party, the dishwasher starts acting up\u2014stopping and starting, and then sparks start flying. The friend suggests there might be a short circuit and warns not to touch it to avoid electrocution. The woman considers going to the basement to cut off the electricity, but the friend decides to check inside the dishwasher himself. When he touches the metal handle, he gets a big electric shock.\n\nNow, it turns out that there's an internal wiring defect in the dishwasher, and the contractor who installed it didn't ground the machine properly. There were instructions for proper grounding, but the contractor ignored them. The jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence and assumption of risk rules.\n\nThe question is: If the friend brings a strict tort liability claim against the manufacturer of the dishwasher for his injuries, what's the probable result?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Recover, because the dishwasher was defectively made.\n\nB. Recover, because the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the improper installation.\n\nC. Not recover, because the friend assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher.\n\nD. Not recover, because the friend was not the purchaser of the dishwasher.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, strict tort liability in products liability cases generally means that a manufacturer can be held liable for defects in their product that cause harm, regardless of negligence. So, if the dishwasher had a defect that caused the friend to get shocked, the manufacturer could be liable.\n\nOption A says the friend will recover because the dishwasher was defectively made. That seems plausible.\n\nBut then option B says the friend will recover because the manufacturer is vicariously liable for the improper installation. Vicarious liability usually means being liable for the actions of someone else, like an employee or contractor. But in this case, the contractor installed the dishwasher improperly, but the manufacturer isn't typically responsible for how their product is installed, unless perhaps they provided inadequate installation instructions.\n\nOption C says the friend won't recover because he assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher. Assumption of risk is a defense where the defendant argues that the plaintiff knew about the danger and chose to take the risk anyway. In this case, the friend knew there might be a short circuit and that touching the dishwasher could be dangerous, but he still decided to open it. In a jurisdiction that follows traditional assumption of risk rules, this could bar recovery.\n\nOption D says the friend won't recover because he wasn't the purchaser of the dishwasher. But in products liability, it's common for any user or consumer of the product to be able to bring a claim, not just the purchaser. So this might not necessarily bar recovery.\n\nNow, considering that the jurisdiction follows traditional contributory negligence rules, which is different from comparative negligence. In contributory negligence, if the plaintiff is at all negligent in contributing to their own harm, they can be barred from recovering any damages.\n\nIn this case, the friend knew there was a potential electrical hazard and still decided to touch the dishwasher, which led to the shock. So, under contributory negligence rules, his actions could be seen as contributing to his own injury, thus barring recovery.\n\nAlso, considering assumption of risk, which is mentioned, if the friend voluntarily exposed himself to a known risk, that could also bar recovery.\n\nBut against that, if the dishwasher had a defect that caused the shock, and the manufacturer is strictly liable for that defect, then perhaps the friend should be able to recover despite his own actions.\n\nHowever, in traditional contributory negligence jurisdictions, the plaintiff's own negligence can be a complete bar to recovery, even if the defendant was also negligent.\n\nSimilarly, assumption of risk can be a complete defense.\n\nSo, in this scenario, even if the dishwasher was defectively made, the friend's decision to touch it knowing the risks might prevent him from recovering damages.\n\nTherefore, option C seems plausible: not recover, because the friend assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher.\n\nOption D, about not being the purchaser, might not be relevant, as mentioned earlier, because bystanders and users can often bring products liability claims.\n\nOption B, about vicarious liability for improper installation, seems less likely, because the manufacturer isn't responsible for the installer's mistakes, unless there's something specific about the installation instructions or requirements.\n\nOption A, while it acknowledges the defect, doesn't consider the friend's own actions and the application of contributory negligence and assumption of risk.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the probable result is that the friend will not recover because he assumed the risk by trying to open the dishwasher.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
