And now he was going to deprive the poor soldier, who had undergone so many hardships, and suffered from innumerable wounds, of this small remuneration, and not even allow him a pretty Indian female for a companion&\u2026\n[Later], when Cort\u00e9s learnt that there were still a great many bars of gold among the men, and heavy gambling in consequence, (for, according to the old saying, gold and love cannot lie long concealed,) he made known, under threats of severe punishment, that everyone should produce the gold he had obtained on the night of our retreat, of which one third was to be returned to him; but that anyone who refused to pay this, should have the whole taken from him. Many of our men refused downright to comply with this; yet Cort\u00e9s managed to extort a good deal of it under the pretence of a loan&\u2026\"\nThe Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, 1568\nThe events described in the passage most likely occurred in which modern-day country?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see what this passage is about. It seems to be from the memoirs of a conquistador named Bernal Diaz del Castillo, written in 1568. The text mentions slaves being marked with the letter \"G,\" the emperor's fifths, Cort\u00e9s, gold, and a retreat from a city. There's also mention of soldiers not getting their fair share of women and gold.\n\nFirst, I need to identify where these events took place. The options are Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, and Peru. Given that Cort\u00e9s is mentioned, and he was a Spanish conquistador famous for conquering the Aztec Empire, which is in modern-day Mexico, I think the answer is likely Mexico.\n\nLet me double-check. Cort\u00e9s led the expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec Empire in the 16th century. The Aztec capital was Tenochtitlan, which is now present-day Mexico City. So, if they retreated from the city, that would make sense in the context of the Mexican campaign.\n\nAlso, the emperor's fifths probably refer to the royal fifth, which was a tax imposed by the Spanish crown on all treasures obtained by conquistadors. So, that aligns with the Spanish colonial period in the Americas.\n\nArgentina and South Africa don't fit because Cort\u00e9s was active in Mesoamerica, not in South America or Africa. Peru was conquered by another conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, who conquered the Inca Empire. So, that rules out Peru.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is Mexico.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
