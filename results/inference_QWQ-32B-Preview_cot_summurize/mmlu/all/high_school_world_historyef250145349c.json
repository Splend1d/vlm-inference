                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Treaty of Tordesillas. So, the treaty was signed in 1494 between Spain and Portugal to divide the newly discovered lands in the New World. The Spanish wanted control over the territory west of the demarcation line, and we need to figure out why from the given options.\n\nOption A says that the Spanish desired to convert the Barbary states to Catholicism. Hmm, the Barbary states are in North Africa, which is east of the demarcation line, so that doesn't make sense. The treaty was about dividing lands in the New World, not North Africa. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B suggests that the Spanish believed Portugal didn't know about their discovery of the New World. But, by 1494, both Spain and Portugal were well aware of each other's explorations. Columbus had already made his voyages, and Portugal was also exploring the Atlantic. So, it's unlikely that the Spanish thought Portugal was unaware of their discoveries.\n\nOption C talks about preserving the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. That sounds interesting, but was that really the Spanish motivation? From what I know, the Spanish were more interested in claiming lands for themselves, exploiting resources, and spreading Christianity. Protecting Native states seems unlikely.\n\nOption D says that the Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. Wait, India? The Spanish were trying to reach India by sailing west, but they ended up in the New World. Portugal, on the other hand, was exploring the eastern route around Africa. Maybe the Spanish thought that controlling the west would give them easier access to riches without having to deal with the challenges of conquering India.\n\nBut let's think carefully. The treaty was about dividing the newly discovered lands, not about future conquests in Asia. The Spanish had already discovered the New World, and they wanted to secure their claims there. So, perhaps option D isn't the best fit.\n\nLooking back at option C, maybe the Spanish wanted to ensure that the lands west of the line remained free from Portuguese influence, not necessarily to preserve Native independence, but to expand their own empire. Maybe I misread that option.\n\nWait, option C says \"preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.\" That seems more like a defensive measure to keep the Portuguese from moving into certain areas by leaving Native states independent. But I don't recall that being a primary concern for the Spanish at that time. They were more interested in colonization and extraction of resources.\n\nPerhaps none of these options perfectly fit, but I need to choose the best one. Let's consider the context again. The Spanish had just discovered the New World, and they wanted to secure their claims against Portugal, which was also expanding overseas. The treaty was a way to avoid conflicts by dividing the newly discovered lands.\n\nOption B seems unlikely because both parties were well-informed about each other's discoveries by 1494. Option A doesn't make sense because the Barbary states were not in the New World. Option D might have some merit if the Spanish thought that focusing on the New World would be easier than trying to reach Asia, but I'm not sure.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the Spanish wanted to prevent Portugal from expanding into the New World, hence insisting on controlling the western territory. But none of the options directly state that.\n\nWait, perhaps option C can be interpreted differently. Maybe the Spanish wanted to keep the Native states independent to use them as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. But again, that doesn't align with their colonial practices, which were more about subjugation and control.\n\nOption B is tempting because it suggests that the Spanish thought Portugal was unaware of their discoveries, but that seems improbable given the state of communications and diplomacy at the time.\n\nMaybe the answer is none of the above, but since I have to choose, I'll go with option D: The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World. At least it relates to their motivations for exploring westward in the first place.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
