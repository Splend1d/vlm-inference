The truck is moving at 5 m/s, and the cannon's muzzle velocity is 50 m/s.\n\nFirst, let's consider the motion of the ball relative to the ground. The ball has both horizontal and vertical components of velocity due to the cannon's firing, and the horizontal component is also affected by the truck's motion.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( v_t = 5 \\) m/s (truck's speed)\n- \\( v_c = 50 \\) m/s (cannon's muzzle velocity)\n- \\( \\theta \\) = angle of the cannon from the horizontal\n\nThe initial velocity of the ball relative to the ground has both horizontal and vertical components:\n- Horizontal component: \\( v_x = v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta \\)\n- Vertical component: \\( v_y = v_c \\sin \\theta \\)\n\nThe ball's trajectory is determined by these velocity components and the acceleration due to gravity, \\( g = 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2, acting downward.\n\nTo find the range (horizontal distance) the ball travels before hitting the ground, we need to determine the time of flight and then use the horizontal velocity to find the distance.\n\nThe time of flight can be found by considering the vertical motion. The ball will reach its maximum height and then fall back to the same level. The total time of flight \\( t \\) can be found from the equation:\n\n\\[ v_y t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ t (v_y - \\frac{1}{2} g t) = 0 \\]\n\nSo, \\( t = 0 \\) (launch time) or \\( t = \\frac{2 v_y}{g} \\) (landing time)\n\nTherefore, the total time of flight is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 v_c \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\nThe horizontal distance \\( d \\) traveled by the ball is:\n\n\\[ d = v_x t = (v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_c \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ d = (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 \\times 50 \\sin \\theta}{9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ d = (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{100 \\sin \\theta}{9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{100}{9.8} (5 + 50 \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{100}{9.8} [5 \\sin \\theta + 50 \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta] \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{100}{9.8} [5 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin 2\\theta] \\]\n\n(Note: using the identity \\( \\sin 2\\theta = 2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta \\))\n\nTo maximize \\( d \\), we need to find the angle \\( \\theta \\) that maximizes the expression \\( 5 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin 2\\theta \\).\n\nLet's denote \\( f(\\theta) = 5 \\sin \\theta + 25 \\sin 2\\theta \\)\n\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative of \\( f(\\theta) \\) with respect to \\( \\theta \\) and set it to zero:\n\n\\[ f'(\\theta) = 5 \\cos \\theta + 25 \\cdot 2 \\cos 2\\theta \\]\n\n\\[ f'(\\theta) = 5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta \\]\n\nSet \\( f'(\\theta) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 5 \\cos \\theta + 50 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 10 \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity \\( \\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1 \\):\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 10 (2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta + 20 \\cos^2 \\theta - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nLet \\( u = \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ 20 u^2 + u - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in \\( u \\):\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 800}}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{801}}{40} \\]\n\nSince \\( u = \\cos \\theta \\) must be between -1 and 1, we take the positive root:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{801}}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ u \\approx \\frac{-1 + 28.3}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ u \\approx \\frac{27.3}{40} \\]\n\n\\[ u \\approx 0.6825 \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta \\approx 0.6825 \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx \\cos^{-1}(0.6825) \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx 47.02^\\circ \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems to have an error because the correct approach should consider the effect of the truck's motion on the horizontal velocity. Let's try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the velocity of the ball relative to the ground. The horizontal component of the velocity is \\( v_x = v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta \\), and the vertical component is \\( v_y = v_c \\sin \\theta \\).\n\nThe time of flight is determined by the vertical motion:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 v_y}{g} = \\frac{2 v_c \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\nThe horizontal distance is:\n\n\\[ d = v_x t = (v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_c \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{2 v_c (v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\nTo maximize \\( d \\), we can take the derivative of \\( d \\) with respect to \\( \\theta \\) and set it to zero.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{2 v_c}{g} (v_t \\sin \\theta + v_c \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta) \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{2 v_c}{g} \\left( v_t \\sin \\theta + \\frac{v_c}{2} \\sin 2\\theta \\right) \\]\n\nNow, take the derivative with respect to \\( \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dd}{d\\theta} = \\frac{2 v_c}{g} \\left( v_t \\cos \\theta + v_c \\cos 2\\theta \\right) \\]\n\nSet the derivative equal to zero for maximum range:\n\n\\[ v_t \\cos \\theta + v_c \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity \\( \\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1 \\):\n\n\\[ v_t \\cos \\theta + v_c (2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2 v_c \\cos^2 \\theta + v_t \\cos \\theta - v_c = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ 2 v_c u^2 + v_t u - v_c = 0 \\]\n\nWhere \\( u = \\cos \\theta \\)\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-v_t \\pm \\sqrt{v_t^2 + 8 v_c^2}}{4 v_c} \\]\n\nSubstitute the known values \\( v_t = 5 \\) m/s and \\( v_c = 50 \\) m/s:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 8 \\times 2500}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 20000}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{20025}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm 141.51}{200} \\]\n\nTaking the positive root (since cosine cannot be greater than 1 or less than -1):\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 + 141.51}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{136.51}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u \\approx 0.68255 \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta \\approx 0.68255 \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx \\cos^{-1}(0.68255) \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx 47.02^\\circ \\]\n\nHowever, this angle does not match any of the given options. Let's check the calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the standard formula for the range of a projectile launched from a moving platform. The standard range formula when the launch and landing are at the same height is:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{v^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\]\n\nBut in this case, the initial horizontal velocity is increased by the truck's speed. So the effective initial velocity in the horizontal direction is \\( v_x = v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta \\), and the vertical component is \\( v_y = v_c \\sin \\theta \\).\n\nThe time of flight is still \\( t = \\frac{2 v_y}{g} = \\frac{2 v_c \\sin \\theta}{g} \\), and the range is:\n\n\\[ d = v_x t = (v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_c \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{2 v_c (v_t + v_c \\cos \\theta) \\sin \\theta}{g} \\]\n\nTo maximize \\( d \\), we can use calculus as before, but perhaps there is a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, we can express \\( d \\) in terms of \\( \\sin \\) and \\( \\cos \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{2 v_c}{g} \\left( v_t \\sin \\theta + v_c \\cos \\theta \\sin \\theta \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{2 v_c}{g} \\left( v_t \\sin \\theta + \\frac{v_c}{2} \\sin 2\\theta \\right) \\]\n\nTo maximize \\( d \\), we can set the derivative with respect to \\( \\theta \\) to zero:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dd}{d\\theta} = \\frac{2 v_c}{g} \\left( v_t \\cos \\theta + v_c \\cos 2\\theta \\right) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ v_t \\cos \\theta + v_c \\cos 2\\theta = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the double-angle identity \\( \\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1 \\):\n\n\\[ v_t \\cos \\theta + v_c (2 \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2 v_c \\cos^2 \\theta + v_t \\cos \\theta - v_c = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic in \\( \\cos \\theta \\):\n\n\\[ 2 v_c u^2 + v_t u - v_c = 0 \\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-v_t \\pm \\sqrt{v_t^2 + 8 v_c^2}}{4 v_c} \\]\n\nPlugging in \\( v_t = 5 \\) m/s and \\( v_c = 50 \\) m/s:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 20000}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{20025}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm 141.51}{200} \\]\n\nTaking the positive root:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{136.51}{200} \\approx 0.68255 \\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[ \\cos \\theta \\approx 0.68255 \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx 47.02^\\circ \\]\n\nBut this angle is not among the options provided. Let's check if there's another approach or if there's an error in the calculations.\n\nPerhaps we can consider that the optimal angle is no longer 45 degrees due to the truck's motion. In the absence of truck motion, the optimal angle is 45 degrees. However, with the truck moving forward, the optimal angle might be different.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the horizontal velocity is increased by the truck's speed, so perhaps the optimal angle is less than 45 degrees to maximize the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming the time of flight is only dependent on the vertical component. Maybe the horizontal component affects the time of flight as well.\n\nWait, actually, the time of flight is only dependent on the vertical motion, so the earlier approach should be correct. Maybe the angle is approximately 47 degrees, but since that's not an option, perhaps we need to select the closest option, which is 49 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are approximations, and 47 degrees is closest to 45 degrees, but 45 degrees is given as an option, and it's not the correct answer based on the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-calculate the quadratic formula step.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-v_t \\pm \\sqrt{v_t^2 + 8 v_c^2}}{4 v_c} \\]\n\nPlugging in values:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 8 \\times 2500}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 20000}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{20025}}{200} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{20025} = 141.51 \\]\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-5 + 141.51}{200} = \\frac{136.51}{200} = 0.68255 \\]\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\cos^{-1}(0.68255) \\approx 47.02^\\circ \\]\n\nThis angle is not listed in the options. The closest option is 49 degrees, but perhaps there is a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the optimal angle in the presence of an initial horizontal velocity.\n\nIn some references, the optimal angle \\( \\theta_{opt} \\) when there is an initial horizontal velocity component is given by:\n\n\\[ \\theta_{opt} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} - \\frac{v_t}{v_c} \\]\n\nBut this is an approximation and may not be accurate for this scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering energy conservation or other principles could lead to a different approach, but time constraints suggest that the earlier calculation is correct, and the answer is approximately 47 degrees, which is closest to 45 degrees among the options, but 45 degrees gives a lower range in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operator should point the cannon at an angle that accounts for the truck's motion, but based on the calculation, 47 degrees is the optimal angle.\n\nGiven that 47 degrees is not an option, and the closest option is 45 degrees, but according to the calculation, 45 degrees would give a slightly lower range than 47 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operator should point the cannon at an angle that compensates for the truck's motion, but based on the calculation, 47 degrees is the optimal angle.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 5\u00b0\n\nB. 41\u00b0\n\nC. 45\u00b0\n\nD. 49\u00b0\n\nThe closest to our calculated 47 degrees is 49 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 49\u00b0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{49^\\circ} \\]"
