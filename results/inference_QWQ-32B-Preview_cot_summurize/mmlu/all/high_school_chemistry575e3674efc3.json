High volume is equivalent to low pressure (since \\( PV = nRT \\)), so it's essentially similar to option B.\n\nHowever, in multiple-choice questions, it's essential to select the most appropriate answer. Both B and C are correct in their own ways, but option B directly refers to pressure and temperature, which are more fundamental parameters in the ideal gas law.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n**B. High temperature and low pressure**\n\nThis condition minimizes the effects of intermolecular forces and molecular volume, making real gases behave most like ideal gases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
