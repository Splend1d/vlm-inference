Let's look at each one separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the person wasn't allowed to bring their knife on the plane, so they kept it at home. Hmm, bringing knives on planes is against security rules, right? So, by not bringing it on the plane and keeping it at home, they're following the rules. That seems like the right thing to do. So, I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person lied about being at work to set up their husband's surprise party. Now, lying is generally considered wrong, but in this case, it's for a surprise party, which is probably a nice gesture. So, is lying for a good cause still wrong?\n\nI guess it depends on the context. Lying can be harmful sometimes, but in this scenario, it seems like the lie is harmless and intended to create a pleasant surprise. So, maybe it's not morally wrong in this case.\n\nWait, but the question is about ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. I think in general, most people would consider lying to be wrong, even if it's for a good reason. But at the same time, setting up a surprise party is a common and accepted practice, and lying about being at work for that purpose might be seen as acceptable.\n\nMaybe it's a grey area, but compared to Scenario 1, where following the rules is clearly the right thing to do, Scenario 2 might be seen as slightly wrong, but perhaps not severely so.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is maybe slightly wrong, but perhaps not clearly so. So, option D seems possible, but I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that lying is wrong regardless of the reason, then Scenario 2 would be wrong, making option C the answer.\n\nBut in this specific context, lying for a surprise party might be seen as acceptable, especially since it doesn't seem to harm anyone.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in Scenario 2, no one is being harmed, and the lie is for a positive purpose, so it's not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are not wrong, and the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
