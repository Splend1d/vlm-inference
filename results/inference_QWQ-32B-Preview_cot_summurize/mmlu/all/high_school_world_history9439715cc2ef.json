It shows a big jump in literacy, especially from the late 19th century through the Soviet period. I need to pick the historical context that best explains this data from the options given.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A is \"Educational reform in the modern era.\" That sounds pretty broad. Educational reform has happened in many countries at different times. While it might be relevant, I need to see if there's a more specific context for Russia and the Soviet Union.\n\nOption B is \"Centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization.\" Hmm, that seems promising. The Soviet Union was known for its centralized planning and efforts to modernize the country, especially under Stalin in the 1930s. Literacy campaigns were a big part of that, aiming to turn a largely agrarian and illiterate population into a literate workforce for industrialization.\n\nOption C is \"Experimentation with syndicalist forms of socio-economic organization.\" Syndicalism is about organizing along trade union lines, but I don't recall it being a major factor in the Soviet Union. The Soviet system was more about state control and planning, not syndicalist experiments. So this seems less likely.\n\nOption D is \"Second-stage industrialization in the non-Western world.\" While the Soviet Union did industrialize, and it was a non-Western country, I'm not sure if \"second-stage industrialization\" is the best fit here. The term \"second-stage\" might refer to industrialization that occurs after the initial wave in Western countries, but I need to confirm if that's the case.\n\nLooking back at the chart, the literacy rates jump significantly after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. In 1897, it's 24%, and by 1917, it's 45%. Then, under the Soviets, it keeps rising to 56% in 1926, 75% in 1937, 81.10% in 1939, and nearly 100% by 1955. This suggests that the Soviet regime placed a high priority on education and literacy.\n\nGiven that, option B seems the most accurate. The Soviets undertook massive, state-directed campaigns to modernize the country, and part of that was educating the population and increasing literacy. The centralized nature of the Soviet system allowed for such large-scale initiatives.\n\nOption A is too broad, C doesn't seem relevant, and D doesn't capture the specific nature of Soviet efforts. So, I think B is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
