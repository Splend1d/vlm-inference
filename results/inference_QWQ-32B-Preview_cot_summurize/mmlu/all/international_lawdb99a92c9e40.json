                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about piracy and international law. The question is: \"Is piracy under international (jure gentium) law subject to universal jurisdiction?\" And then it gives options A through D.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"jure gentium\" means. I think it refers to \"law of nations,\" which is another term for international law. So, piracy under international law.\n\nNow, piracy is a crime that's recognized by all nations, right? It's illegal activity conducted on the high seas or in international waters. So, I guess that's why it's covered by international law.\n\nThe question is about jurisdiction. Jurisdiction means the authority to make legal decisions and judgments. So, who has the authority to prosecute pirates under international law?\n\nOption A says piracy jure gentium is subject to flag State jurisdiction. The flag State is the country whose flag a ship is flying. So, the country that the ship belongs to has jurisdiction over piracy cases.\n\nOption B says it's subject to universal jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction is a principle that allows any state to prosecute certain crimes, even if they didn't occur on the state's territory or involve its citizens. These are usually very serious crimes like piracy, slavery, war crimes, etc.\n\nOption C mentions port State jurisdiction. That would be the country where the ship docks. So, when a ship comes into a port, the port State can exercise jurisdiction over certain matters.\n\nOption D is nationality-based jurisdiction, meaning the country where the pirate is a citizen could prosecute them.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one is correct regarding piracy under international law.\n\nI recall that piracy is considered an international crime, and any country can prosecute pirates, regardless of where the crime took place or the nationality of the pirates or the victims. That sounds like universal jurisdiction.\n\nBut maybe flag State jurisdiction also applies because the ship is registered in a particular country, and that country has authority over the ship and its crew.\n\nPort State jurisdiction might also have some role, especially if the ship docks in a port and the authorities there can inspect the ship and prosecute crimes that occurred aboard.\n\nNationality-based jurisdiction makes sense too; a pirate's home country could prosecute its own citizens for piracy.\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking about piracy jure gentium and whether it's subject to universal jurisdiction.\n\nI think the core idea is that piracy is a crime that affects all nations, and therefore, it's within the interest of the international community to combat it. Hence, universal jurisdiction is applicable.\n\nBut maybe there are specific international conventions or treaties that govern this.\n\nI remember there's the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which defines piracy and the jurisdiction over it.\n\nAccording to UNCLOS, piracy is defined as illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or aircraft against another ship or aircraft.\n\nAnd, importantly, UNCLOS allows for universal jurisdiction over acts of piracy.\n\nSo, that would support option B, that piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction.\n\nBut perhaps there are limitations or other jurisdictions that apply as well.\n\nFor example, the flag State probably has primary jurisdiction over its own ships and crew.\n\nAnd port States may have jurisdiction when the ship enters their ports.\n\nNationality-based jurisdiction is also a principle of international law.\n\nBut in the case of piracy, because it's such a serious international crime, universal jurisdiction is recognized.\n\nSo, even if a crime of piracy is committed on the high seas by a ship of one country against another, any country can seize the pirate ship and prosecute the pirates.\n\nI think that's why it's called jure gentium, meaning \"law of nations,\" because it's a shared responsibility among all nations.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B: Piracy jure gentium is subject to universal jurisdiction.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are not incorrect per se, but they don't capture the full extent of jurisdiction over piracy as universally as option B does.\n\nSo, my final answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
