The next customer thinks the clerk is generally an impatient person instead of considering that she might just be having a bad day. We need to figure out which psychological concept this scenario best illustrates.\n\nOption A is stereotyping. Stereotyping is when someone makes a generalization about a group of people, attributing certain characteristics to them based on their group membership, like gender, race, or occupation. In this case, the customer might be stereotyping all clerks as impatient, but it's specifically about this one clerk, not necessarily all clerks. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption B is the fundamental attribution error. I think this might be the answer. The fundamental attribution error is when people overemphasize internal characteristics (like personality traits) to explain someone's behavior, while underestimating the role of external circumstances. Here, the customer is attributing the clerk's impatience to her personality rather than considering that she might have been dealing with difficult customers earlier, which could have caused her to be impatient temporarily. That sounds like fundamental attribution error.\n\nOption C is the mere exposure effect. That's when people develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar with them. I don't see how that applies here. The customer isn't preferring the clerk or liking her more because of exposure; instead, they're forming an impression about her personality.\n\nOption D is the reciprocity norm. That's the social expectation that people will respond to each other in kind\u2014positive actions are reciprocated with positive actions, and negative with negative. In this scenario, the clerk was kind to rude customers, and then was impatient with the next one. The customer is judging the clerk's impatience, but it's not directly about reciprocating kindness or rudeness; it's about how the customer interprets the clerk's behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the best answer is B, the fundamental attribution error. The customer is attributing the clerk's impatience to her personal trait rather than considering the external circumstances that might have led to her being impatient that day.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
