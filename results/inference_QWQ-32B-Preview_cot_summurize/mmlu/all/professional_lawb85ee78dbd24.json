                    "text": "A gambler learned that a friend of his was planning a vacation to visit some casinos. The gambler, who was an avid college football fan, approached his friend. The gambler explained that he wanted to place a bet with a sports-betting agency that his beloved team would win the college football championship the next year. The gambler further explained that he had read that the odds of his team winning the football championship next year were listed as 100-1, and he wanted to place a $1,000 bet on his team. The gambler told his friend that he would pay him for his efforts. After further discussion, the gambler wrote up the following agreement:\"I hereby promise to pay my friend $100 if he will place a $1,000 bet for me that my favorite team will win the college football championship next year. The bet is to be placed at my lucky casino sports book. I further promise to pay my friend an additional $100 within 30 days after the bet is placed. \"Since the gambler knew his wife would be angry if she found out about the bet, the gambler included a clause that the friend promised not to tell anyone about the bet. After both the gambler and his friend signed the agreement, the gambler gave him $1,100, representing $1,000 to place the bet and $100 as the initial payment for the friend's efforts. The friend then went on vacation. Shortly after arrival, the friend attempted to place the bet for the gambler. However, the friend discovered that the gambler's lucky casino had recently closed its sports book. The friend then entered another casino next door and discovered that they had a sports book, also offering 100-1 odds on the gambler's favorite team winning the college football championship the next year. The friend placed the bet with the other casino's sports book. After returning from his vacation, the friend gave the betting slip to the gambler. Nothing more was said until 30 days later, when the friend asked the gambler when he was going to receive the final $100. The gambler then refused to pay anything more to the friend. In a breach of contract action by the friend to collect the $100, which of the following, if true, is the gambler's best defense?\n\nA. The contract was void ab initio, because the contract could not be performed in its entirety within the span of one year.\nB. The friend's placing the $1,000 bet at the other casino instead of at the gambler's lucky casino constituted a material breach of contract, thereby relieving the gambler of any further contractual obligations under the terms of their agreement.\nC. While on vacation, the friend told his girlfriend about the $1,000 that he bet on the gambler's behalf.\nD. Since the gambler's lucky casino no longer had a sports book at which to place the bet, all contractual obligations would be suspended under the doctrine of frustration of purpose.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a gambler who wants to place a bet on his favorite team winning the college football championship next year. The odds are 100-1, and he wants to bet $1,000. He approaches his friend and offers him $100 upfront to place the bet and another $100 within 30 days after placing the bet. There's also a clause that the friend promises not to tell anyone about the bet, especially the gambler's wife.\n\nThe friend agrees, they sign the agreement, and the gambler gives him $1,100: $1,000 for the bet and $100 as initial payment. The friend goes on vacation and tries to place the bet at the gambler's lucky casino, but finds out that the sports book is closed. So, he goes to another casino next door, places the bet there with the same odds, and brings back the betting slip to the gambler.\n\nThirty days later, the friend asks for the final $100, but the gambler refuses to pay any more, saying he doesn't owe anything further. Now, the friend is suing for breach of contract to get that $100.\n\nWe need to figure out which of the options is the gambler's best defense. Let's look at each one:\n\n**Option A: The contract was void ab initio because it couldn't be performed in its entirety within one year.**\n\n\"Ab initio\" means \"from the beginning.\" A contract is void ab initio if it's invalid from the start due to some legal defect. One common reason is if the performance cannot be completed within a year, and there's no specific provision allowing for longer-term contracts.\n\nHowever, in this case, the bet is being placed now for an event next year, but the obligations under the contract\u2014placing the bet and paying the amounts\u2014are all to be completed within a short timeframe, like 30 days. The bet's outcome is in the future, but the contract's performance is immediate. So, this doesn't seem to be a valid defense.\n\n**Option B: The friend's placing the bet at another casino instead of the gambler's lucky casino constitutes a material breach, relieving the gambler of further obligations.**\n\nThis seems promising. The agreement specified that the bet should be placed at the gambler's lucky casino. But the friend placed it at another casino because the original one's sports book was closed.\n\nIf the gambler specified the casino for a particular reason, and the friend didn't follow that instruction, that could be considered a material breach. However, the friend did place the bet with the same odds, which might argue that the essence of the bet was fulfilled.\n\nBut according to the agreement, the bet was supposed to be placed at a specific location, and the friend deviated from that. Depending on the law, this could be seen as a material breach, especially if the choice of casino was important to the gambler for some reason.\n\n**Option C: The friend told his girlfriend about the $1,000 bet.**\n\nThe agreement included a clause that the friend promised not to tell anyone about the bet, particularly the gambler's wife. If the friend breached this confidentiality clause by telling his girlfriend, that could be a breach of contract.\n\nHowever, this might not necessarily relieve the gambler from paying the remaining $100, especially since the breach is related to confidentiality, not to the performance of placing the bet itself. It's possible that the gambler could argue that this breach allows him to withhold payment, but it might not be the strongest defense.\n\n**Option D: The doctrine of frustration of purpose applies because the original casino's sports book was closed.**\n\nThe doctrine of frustration of purpose applies when an event occurs after the contract is formed that destroys the fundamental purpose of the contract, through no fault of either party.\n\nIn this case, the closure of the original casino's sports book might have frustrated the gambler's purpose of placing the bet at that specific casino. However, the friend did place the bet at another casino with the same odds, which might argue that the purpose was still achieved.\n\nBut if the choice of casino was crucial for some reason, and the closure of the sports book prevented that, then frustration of purpose might apply.\n\nComparing options B and D, B seems more directly applicable because it focuses on the friend's failure to follow the specific instruction in the contract. Option D is more about external events making the contract's purpose impossible to achieve as intended.\n\nGiven that, option B appears to be the gambler's best defense: the friend's placing the bet at another casino instead of the specified one constitutes a material breach, relieving the gambler of further contractual obligations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
