The husband is an alcoholic and has been physically abusive, especially when he's drunk. One night, after he beats up the wife, she decides she can't take it anymore and wants to kill him. She's knowledgeable about guns and plans to shoot him while he's sleeping. Before doing anything, she buys a $1 million life insurance policy, naming herself as the beneficiary.\n\nBut then, something changes. They have a nice anniversary celebration, go out to dinner, and have a great time. After that, the wife has a change of heart. She realizes she still loves her husband and doesn't want to go through with the murder. She confesses everything to her husband, asking for forgiveness. Instead of forgiving her, the husband is furious. He files for divorce and reports her plan to the police.\n\nNow, the question is: if the wife is charged with attempted murder, should she be found guilty or not guilty, and why?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Guilty, because she purchased the life insurance policy.\n\nB. Guilty, because she intended to kill her husband.\n\nC. Not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.\n\nD. Not guilty, because she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, attempted murder generally requires two elements: intent to kill and a substantial step towards committing the murder.\n\nIn this case, the wife definitely had the intent to kill her husband. She planned to shoot him while he was sleeping and even bought a life insurance policy, which could be seen as preparing for the murder.\n\nBut then, she had a change of heart before carrying out the plan. She confessed to her husband and didn't go through with the murder.\n\nSo, did she take a substantial step towards committing the murder? Buying the life insurance policy might be considered a preparatory act, but not necessarily a substantial step. Substantial steps are actions that are closer to the actual commission of the crime, like buying a gun, lying in wait, or actually attempting to carry out the act.\n\nIn this scenario, the wife planned to shoot her husband but didn't actually do it. She confessed instead.\n\nNow, regarding withdrawal: in some jurisdictions, if a person renounces their criminal intent and takes steps to prevent the crime from occurring, they may be able to avoid liability for the attempted crime.\n\nHowever, withdrawal is often not a defense to attempted murder because the attempt itself is a completed act. But in this case, the wife didn't actually attempt the murder; she confessed and withdrew from the plan.\n\nThis is a bit tricky because attempted murder typically requires an act that goes beyond mere preparation, and in this case, the wife didn't take any substantial step beyond planning and buying the insurance.\n\nSo, option A says she's guilty because she purchased the life insurance policy. But purchasing insurance alone isn't usually enough to constitute an attempt; it's more of a preparatory act.\n\nOption B says she's guilty because she intended to kill her husband. While intent is a necessary element, without a substantial step, it might not be enough for an attempt.\n\nOption C says she's not guilty because she didn't perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder. This seems plausible because her planning and buying insurance might not be considered substantial steps.\n\nOption D says she's not guilty because she effectively withdrew from the criminal endeavor. This also seems relevant since she confessed and didn't go through with the plan.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is a stronger argument because without a substantial step, there can't be an attempt. Withdrawal might be a separate issue, but if there was no attempt in the first place, then withdrawal isn't necessary.\n\nHowever, some might argue that buying the insurance is a substantial step, making option B more applicable.\n\nBut considering that she didn't actually take any direct action towards committing the murder\u2014like obtaining a gun or being present to carry out the shooting\u2014it's arguable that she didn't take a substantial step.\n\nMoreover, her confession and withdrawal indicate that she abandoned her plan voluntarily.\n\nTherefore, I lean towards option C: not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.\n\nOption D is also tempting, but since there was no attempt to begin with, withdrawal might not be necessary. Nonetheless, her withdrawal reinforces that she didn't go through with the crime.\n\nIn conclusion, the most appropriate answer seems to be C: not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
