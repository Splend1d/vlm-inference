                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which type of selection is described when brightly colored peacocks mate more frequently than drab ones. The options are artificial selection, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and sexual selection. I think I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, artificial selection is when humans breed animals or plants for specific traits. Like breeding dogs to have certain characteristics. But in this case, it's peacocks mating on their own, not because humans are choosing them, so I don't think that's it.\n\nDirectional selection is when a trait becomes more common because it gives an advantage in survival. For example, if faster rabbits can escape predators better, they're more likely to survive and pass on their genes for speed. But in this scenario, it's about mating frequency, not necessarily survival.\n\nStabilizing selection is when the average trait is favored, and extreme variations are selected against. Like babies with average birth weight having better survival rates. Again, this seems more about maintaining a status quo rather than favoring a particular trait like bright coloration for mating.\n\nSexual selection is when certain traits increase an individual's chances of reproducing. This can be through attracting mates or competing with other males. Peacocks are known for their elaborate plumage, which they use to attract peahens. So, if brighter peacocks mate more frequently, that sounds like sexual selection to me.\n\nLet me double-check. Peacocks with brighter feathers might be healthier or have better genes, so peahens might prefer them because their offspring would have a better chance of survival. This would be an example of sexual selection, where the trait affects mating success rather than direct survival.\n\nI don't think artificial selection applies here because there's no mention of human intervention. Directional selection usually refers to traits that affect survival, not necessarily mating success. Stabilizing selection is about favoring the average, which doesn't seem relevant here. So, sexual selection seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
