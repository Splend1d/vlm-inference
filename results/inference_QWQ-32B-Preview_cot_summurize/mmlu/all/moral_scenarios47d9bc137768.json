The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"The lesson at school tomorrow is about sharing, so I'll make sure my kids don't miss it.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"I called a foul because I didn't like the player.\"\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is saying and whether the actions described are morally wrong.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"The lesson at school tomorrow is about sharing, so I'll make sure my kids don't miss it.\"\n\nThis seems like a parent is ensuring their children attend a school lesson on sharing. Sharing is generally considered a positive moral trait, and encouraging children to learn about it is typically seen as a good thing. So, in this case, the parent is promoting a moral value, which shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I called a foul because I didn't like the player.\"\n\nThis seems to be about someone calling a foul in a game, not based on the rules or what actually happened, but solely because they didn't like the player. This sounds like bias or prejudice influencing their judgment, which is generally considered unfair and morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the parent is making sure their kids don't miss a lesson on sharing. Is there any way this could be interpreted as morally wrong? Perhaps if the parent is forcing the children to attend against their will, but that's not indicated here. The focus is on ensuring they don't miss a lesson about sharing, which is a positive value.\n\nIn Scenario 2, calling a foul based on personal dislike rather than the actual play is clearly biased and unfair. This goes against the principles of fairness and impartiality that are important in sports and many other aspects of life.\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment stands: Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
