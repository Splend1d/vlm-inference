A. liver B. kidney C. stomach D. gallbladder.\" Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that some organs in the body come in pairs, while others are single organs. So, I need to recall which of these specific organs are present in two copies in the body.\n\nStarting with option A, the liver. I think the liver is a single organ located in the upper right portion of the abdomen. It's large and plays many crucial roles in the body, like filtering blood and producing bile. So, I don't think the liver comes in a pair.\n\nOption B is the kidney. Now, I'm pretty sure that there are two kidneys in the body, one on each side of the spine, just below the ribcage. Kidneys are important for filtering waste products from the blood and regulating electrolyte balance, among other functions. So, kidneys definitely come in a pair.\n\nOption C is the stomach. As far as I know, there's only one stomach in the human body. It's a muscular organ that aids in digestion by churning food and mixing it with gastric juices. So, not a pair.\n\nOption D is the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small organ that stores bile produced by the liver. Again, there's only one gallbladder, located near the liver. So, not a pair.\n\nComparing all these, it seems clear that the kidney is the organ that comes in a pair among the options given.\n\nWait a minute, just to make sure, let me think about another organ that comes in a pair. For example, lungs come in a pair\u2014left and right lung. But that's not in the options here. Similarly, there are two ovaries or two testes in reproductive systems, but those aren't listed here either.\n\nSo, based on the options provided, kidney is the only organ that typically comes in a pair.\n\nI think the answer is B. kidney.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
