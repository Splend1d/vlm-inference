                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about W.D. Ross's ethical theory. So, Ross was a British philosopher who developed a theory known as \"intuitionism\" in ethics. The key idea here is that moral truths are self-evident and can be known through intuition.\n\nNow, the question is about how we learn our prima facie duties according to Ross. Prima facie duties are those that appear to be binding at first glance, before considering other duties that might take precedence in a particular situation.\n\nOption A says: \"by seeing the prima facie rightness of particular acts, and then apprehending general principles.\" This suggests that we first recognize that certain specific actions are morally right, and from there, we generalize to broader principles.\n\nOption B is: \"by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.\" This is the opposite approach, where we start with general moral principles and then apply them to specific situations to determine the rightness of particular acts.\n\nOption C states: \"by proving them philosophically.\" This implies that moral duties are established through philosophical argumentation and reasoning.\n\nOption D says: \"from the explicit moral instruction we receive as children.\" This suggests that our moral duties are learned through direct teaching from parents, teachers, and other authority figures during our early years.\n\nSo, to determine which of these options best aligns with Ross's view, we need to understand his intuitionist ethics more deeply.\n\nRoss believed that certain moral principles are self-evident and can be known through intuition. He identified several prima facie duties, such as fidelity (keeping promises), reparation (making amends for wrongs), gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement, and non-maleficence (not harming others).\n\nAccording to Ross, these duties are self-evident in the sense that when we reflect on them, they appear to be morally binding without needing further justification. He argued that moral knowledge is similar to mathematical knowledge in that both are known through intuition.\n\nGiven this background, let's evaluate the options:\n\nOption A suggests that we first see the rightness of particular acts and then generalize to principles. While this might be one way people come to understand moral principles, Ross's view is that the principles themselves are self-evident. So, it's not necessarily about observing particular acts and then deriving principles from them.\n\nOption B proposes that we apprehend general principles first and then infer the rightness of particular acts from those principles. This aligns more closely with Ross's intuitionism because he believed that the general moral principles are self-evident and that we can apply them to specific situations to determine the rightness of particular acts.\n\nOption C suggests proving moral duties philosophically. While Ross engaged in philosophical reflection and argumentation, his intuitionism holds that moral principles are self-evident and not ultimately proven through argument. So, this option doesn't quite capture his view.\n\nOption D attributes the learning of moral duties to explicit moral instruction in childhood. While such instruction may influence our moral development, Ross's intuitionism suggests that moral knowledge is innate and can be accessed through reflection, rather than being solely derived from external teaching.\n\nTherefore, the option that best matches Ross's view is Option B: \"by apprehending general principles, and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts.\" This captures the idea that moral principles are self-evident and that we apply these principles to determine the rightness of specific actions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Ross also acknowledged that in some cases, multiple prima facie duties may conflict, and in such situations, we need to use moral judgment to determine which duty overrides the others in that particular context. But the fundamental understanding of prima facie duties comes from apprehending general moral principles through intuition.\n\nSo, to sum it up, Ross believed that we learn of our prima facie duties by apprehending general moral principles that are self-evident and then inferring the prima facie rightness of particular acts based on these principles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
