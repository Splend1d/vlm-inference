There are four options here, and I need to pick the one that best explains this difficulty. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Long-term memory often discards older and unused memories.\" Hmm, that sounds plausible. Maybe as we get older, our brain decides that some old memories aren't useful anymore and gets rid of them. But I've read somewhere that actually, long-term memories can stay with us for a lifetime, even if they're not used frequently. So, maybe this isn't the best answer.\n\nOption B: \"There are many more memories to search through to find the one that is sought.\" This makes sense to me. As we age, we accumulate a lot more memories. It's like having a huge library with thousands of books. Finding a specific book might take longer because there are just so many to choose from. Maybe our brains have to search through a larger database as we get older.\n\nOption C: \"Older adults quit searching because they have more important things to do.\" I don't think this is accurate. Just because someone is older doesn't mean they have more important things to do. Plus, it's disrespectful to assume that older people don't try hard enough to remember things. I think this option is probably incorrect.\n\nOption D: \"Memory is less well organized as we grow older and finding a memory can be quite difficult.\" This seems possible. Maybe as we age, our memory organization breaks down, making it harder to retrieve specific memories. But I've also read that older adults often have very well-organized memories, especially for events from their past.\n\nBetween options B and D, I'm leaning towards B because it makes sense that with more memories comes a longer search time. Also, I recall something about the \"telescoping effect,\" where older adults might misremember the timing of past events, perhaps because they have so many memories compressed together.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any research that supports the idea that older adults have trouble retrieving memories because they have more memories to sort through? I think I remember something about cognitive load increasing with age due to accumulated knowledge.\n\nWait a minute, maybe option D is also a factor. If memory organization declines with age, that could certainly make it harder to find specific memories. I've heard of something called \"neuroplasticity,\" which decreases as we age, possibly affecting how well our memories are organized.\n\nPerhaps both B and D are partially correct, but since I have to choose one, I'll go with B because it seems more directly related to the sheer volume of memories an older adult has accumulated over their lifetime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
