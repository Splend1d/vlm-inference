                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, we've got a state statute that says you can't sell guns or ammo to anyone under 17. If someone violates this, it's a felony with a fine and possible jail time. The state courts have said this is a public welfare offense and it's strict liability, meaning you don't need to prove intent or any mental state; just doing the act is enough to be guilty.\n\nNow, in this scenario, we have a 15-year-old who goes into a store to buy a shotgun for her dad. She takes it off the shelf, goes to the cashier, doesn't see anyone, leaves the money on the counter, and leaves. So, she's trying to buy a shotgun while being under 17, which is against the statute.\n\nThe question is, if she's prosecuted for violating this statute, should she be found guilty or not, and why?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Guilty, because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age.\n\nB. Guilty, because the statute imposes absolute criminal liability.\n\nC. Not guilty, provided she was unaware that the statute prohibited the sale of weapons to someone in her age group.\n\nD. Not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.\n\nFirst, option A says she's guilty because she purchased the shotgun while under age. Well, that seems straightforward. She's 15, under 17, and she tried to buy a shotgun. But hold on, did she actually purchase it? She left the money on the counter, but maybe the sale wasn't complete because the cashier wasn't there to accept the payment. So, was there actually a sale?\n\nOption B says she's guilty because it's absolute criminal liability. Strict liability crimes don't require intent; you just did the prohibited act. So, if the statute prohibits selling to anyone under 17, and she's under 17 and tried to buy a shotgun, then she's in violation, right?\n\nOption C says not guilty if she didn't know about the statute. But in strict liability offenses, usually, intent or knowledge isn't a factor. You can be guilty even if you didn't know it was illegal.\n\nOption D says not guilty if the legislature didn't intend to make purchasing shotguns a crime. But the statute says prohibiting the sale to under 17, not purchasing by under 17. So, is purchasing the same as selling in this context?\n\nWait a minute, the statute says \"prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17.\" So, it's about selling to minors. But in this case, the minor is trying to buy. Is the minor violating this statute?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Who is the one committing the crime here? Is it the seller for selling to a minor, or is it the buyer for trying to purchase?\n\nLooking back at the statute, it says \"prohibiting the sale of guns and ammunition to any person under the age of 17.\" So, it's prohibiting the sale to minors. That means the seller is the one who can't sell to someone under 17. It's not directly prohibiting a minor from buying a gun.\n\nSo, in this case, the defendant is the one trying to buy the gun, but the statute is about selling to minors. So, is the defendant violating the statute by attempting to purchase?\n\nI think maybe the statute is aimed at the seller, not the buyer. So, perhaps the defendant isn't directly violating the statute.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another angle. Maybe there's a separate law that makes it illegal for minors to purchase guns, but in this case, the statute only mentions prohibiting sales to minors.\n\nLet me consider the options again.\n\nOption A: Guilty because she purchased the shotgun while under the statutory age. But did she actually purchase it? She left the money on the counter, but without the cashier accepting it, maybe the sale isn't complete.\n\nOption B: Guilty because of absolute criminal liability. But again, is the defendant the one who is supposed to adhere to this statute? The statute seems to be targeting the seller, not the buyer.\n\nOption C: Not guilty if she didn't know about the statute. But in strict liability offenses, knowledge isn't typically required. So, even if she didn't know, she could still be guilty.\n\nOption D: Not guilty if the legislative intent was not to make purchasing shotguns a criminal offense. Well, if the statute is about selling to minors, maybe the legislative intent wasn't to criminalize minors trying to buy guns, but rather to regulate sellers from selling to minors.\n\nThis makes me lean towards option D. The statute seems to be aimed at sellers, not buyers. So, if the legislative intent was to regulate sellers, then the defendant shouldn't be found guilty.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe there's a separate law that makes it illegal for minors to purchase guns, and this statute is in conjunction with that. But based on the information given, the statute only mentions prohibiting sales to minors.\n\nAlso, considering she's under 17, and she's trying to purchase a shotgun, which might have its own regulations.\n\nWait, shotguns have specific regulations. Maybe there are age restrictions on purchasing them.\n\nBut according to the statute provided, it's about selling to minors, not about minors purchasing.\n\nMoreover, she left the money on the counter, but without the seller accepting it, is there a completed sale?\n\nMaybe it's a moot point because the statute is about selling to minors, not about minors attempting to purchase.\n\nSo, perhaps the defendant isn't violating this particular statute.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be D: not guilty, provided that the legislative intent was not to make the purchase of shotguns a criminal offense.\n\nBut let's consider option C: not guilty if she was unaware of the statute. But in strict liability offenses, ignorance of the law is no excuse. So, even if she didn't know, she could still be guilty.\n\nBut if the statute doesn't apply to her in the first place, because it's about selling to minors, not about minors purchasing, then her knowledge or ignorance doesn't matter.\n\nSo, I think option D is the better choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
