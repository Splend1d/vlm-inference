                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following types of electromagnetic radiation has the longest wavelength? A. Gamma rays B. Ultraviolet C. Blue light D. Orange light.\" I need to figure out which one has the longest wavelength among these options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what electromagnetic radiation is. I know that electromagnetic radiation consists of waves of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. These waves have different wavelengths and frequencies, which correspond to different types of radiation.\n\nI remember that the electromagnetic spectrum includes a wide range of radiation types, ordered by their wavelength or frequency. From longest to shortest wavelength, it's usually radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. So, in terms of wavelength, radio waves have the longest wavelengths, and gamma rays have the shortest.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Gamma rays - These are known for having very short wavelengths, on the order of 10^-12 meters.\n\nB. Ultraviolet - This is shorter than visible light, so its wavelengths are shorter than those of visible light.\n\nC. Blue light - This is a part of visible light, and within visible light, blue has shorter wavelengths compared to other colors like red or orange.\n\nD. Orange light - Also part of visible light, but with longer wavelengths than blue light.\n\nSo, comparing these options:\n\n- Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths.\n\n- Ultraviolet has shorter wavelengths than visible light.\n\n- Blue light has shorter wavelengths than orange light in the visible spectrum.\n\n- Orange light has longer wavelengths than blue light.\n\nTherefore, among the options given, orange light should have the longest wavelength.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about the visible light spectrum. Remembering that wavelengths increase from violet to red, with violet having the shortest wavelengths and red having the longest in the visible spectrum. Blue is towards the violet end, and orange is towards the red end. So, orange has a longer wavelength than blue.\n\nUltraviolet is shorter than visible light, and gamma rays are much shorter than ultraviolet. So, indeed, orange light has the longest wavelength among the options provided.\n\nI think the answer is D. Orange light.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
