                    "text": "Let's see which statement about lipids isn't correct. I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Lipids consist of fatty acids and glycerol.\" Hmm, I know that many lipids are made up of fatty acids and glycerol, like triglycerides, which are fats. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"Steroids are examples of lipids.\" Yeah, steroids like cholesterol are indeed lipids, but they're different from triglycerides because they have a ring structure. So, that's correct too.\n\nOption C: \"The molecules of a saturated fatty acid are packed so close together that they form a solid at room temperature.\" Saturated fats do tend to be solids at room temperature, like butter, because their straight chains can pack tightly together. Unsaturated fats, with their bent chains, don't pack as tightly and are usually liquids, like olive oil. So, this statement seems accurate.\n\nOption D: \"The head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic, and the tails are hydrophilic.\" Wait a minute, I think I remember that phospholipids have a hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails. That's why they form bilayers in cell membranes, with the heads facing outward towards water and the tails tucked inside, away from water. So, this statement seems to have it backwards.\n\nLet me double-check. Phospholipids have a polar, hydrophilic head and nonpolar, hydrophobic fatty acid tails. So, yes, the head is hydrophilic and the tails are hydrophobic.\n\nTherefore, option D is not correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
