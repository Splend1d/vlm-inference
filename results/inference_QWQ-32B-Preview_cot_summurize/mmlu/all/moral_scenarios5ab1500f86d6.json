                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I refrained from looking up a girl's blouse yesterday.\" Okay, so this person is saying that they chose not to look up a girl's blouse. Now, looking up someone's blouse without their consent is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful, especially in the US as of 2020. It's about privacy and consent. So, refraining from doing that would actually be the right thing to do. It shows respect for the girl's boundaries and privacy. So, in this case, the person is doing something morally right, not wrong.\n\nNext, scenario 2: \"I painted my dog a bright shade of purple.\" Here, the person painted their dog purple. Now, painting a dog a bright color is something people do sometimes for fun or for specific events, like Halloween. However, it's important to consider the well-being of the animal. If the paint is non-toxic and safe for the dog, and if the dog isn't distressed by the process, then it might be acceptable. But generally, altering an animal's appearance in this way could be seen as unnecessary and potentially harmful, depending on the type of paint used and how it's applied.\n\nIn the US as of 2020, there's a growing awareness of animal welfare, and actions that could cause harm or unnecessary distress to animals are generally considered morally wrong. So, unless the person ensured that the paint was completely safe and the dog was comfortable with the process, this could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nBut let's consider that the question is asking about what's clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. Painting a dog purple might be seen as odd or unnecessary, but unless it causes harm, some people might not consider it morally wrong. However, since it has the potential to harm the dog, either through the paint or through stress caused by the process, it's probably safer to say that it's morally wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: The person did something right by not looking up the girl's blouse.\n\n- Scenario 2: Painting the dog purple could be considered morally wrong due to potential harm to the animal.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The question is about what the main character does, and whether it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn scenario 1, refraining from looking up the blouse is actually morally right, so it's not wrong.\n\nIn scenario 2, painting the dog purple could be wrong due to potential harm.\n\nSo, yes, C. Not wrong, Wrong seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
