                    "text": "Let's see what Gwen's number pattern is all about. She wrote down: 1, 5, 9, 13. Hmm, I need to find the next two terms in this sequence.\n\nFirst, I should try to figure out the pattern or the rule that's being used here. Let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers.\n\nStarting with 1 to 5: that's an increase of 4 (because 5 - 1 = 4).\n\nFrom 5 to 9: again, an increase of 4 (9 - 5 = 4).\n\nAnd from 9 to 13: once more, an increase of 4 (13 - 9 = 4).\n\nSo, it seems like the pattern is adding 4 to each preceding number to get the next number.\n\nIf that's the case, then to find the next two terms, I just need to continue adding 4.\n\nSo, the next number after 13 would be 13 + 4 = 17.\n\nThen, the number after 17 would be 17 + 4 = 21.\n\nTherefore, the next two terms should be 17 and 21.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 15, 17\n\nB. 15, 19\n\nC. 17, 19\n\nD. 17, 21\n\nOption D matches what I've calculated.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting again: 1, 5, 9, 13.\n\nDifference between each: 4, 4, 4.\n\nYes, consistent addition of 4.\n\nSo, 13 + 4 = 17, and 17 + 4 = 21.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the pattern in terms of an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by adding a common difference to the previous term.\n\nIn this case, the common difference appears to be 4.\n\nSo, the general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- d is the common difference\n\n- n is the term number\n\nGiven a_1 = 1 and d = 4, let's verify the first few terms.\n\nFor n = 1: a_1 = 1 + (1 - 1)*4 = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nFor n = 2: a_2 = 1 + (2 - 1)*4 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nFor n = 3: a_3 = 1 + (3 - 1)*4 = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nFor n = 4: a_4 = 1 + (4 - 1)*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\n\nYes, matches the given sequence.\n\nNow, for n = 5: a_5 = 1 + (5 - 1)*4 = 1 + 16 = 17\n\nAnd for n = 6: a_6 = 1 + (6 - 1)*4 = 1 + 20 = 21\n\nAgain, confirms that the next two terms are 17 and 21.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 17, 21.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there could be another pattern at play here.\n\nFor example, maybe the pattern isn't adding 4 each time, but something else, like multiplying by a certain number, or some other operation.\n\nLooking at the sequence: 1, 5, 9, 13.\n\nIf it were multiplying, the ratios between consecutive terms would be constant or follow some other rule.\n\nBut 5 \u00f7 1 = 5, 9 \u00f7 5 = 1.8, 13 \u00f7 9 \u2248 1.44, which aren't consistent, so it's unlikely to be a multiplication-based pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the differences of the differences, like a quadratic sequence.\n\nIn a quadratic sequence, the second difference is constant.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFirst differences: 4, 4, 4\n\nSecond differences: 0, 0\n\nWell, the second differences are zero, which actually indicates that it's a linear sequence, not quadratic.\n\nIn other words, a constant first difference indicates a linear sequence, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4.\n\nTherefore, there's no need to look for more complex patterns; the arithmetic sequence approach is sufficient and accurate.\n\nSo, the next two terms are indeed 17 and 21, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
