                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following is an example of a duty-based moral theory? A. consequentialism B. natural law theory C. Kantian moral theories D. none of the above.\" I need to pick the one that fits the description of a duty-based moral theory. Let's see what each of these options means.\n\nFirst up, consequentialism. I think I've heard that this is about the outcomes or consequences of actions determining their moral value. So, if something good comes out of an action, it's morally right, regardless of the intent behind it. That sounds more like a results-focused approach rather than focusing on duties or obligations. So, maybe consequentialism isn't the duty-based one.\n\nNext, natural law theory. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think it's about moral principles being based on human nature and what's natural. Like, certain actions are morally right because they align with our natural purposes or tendencies. It doesn't sound directly about duties, but maybe it implies certain duties based on what's natural. I need to think more about this.\n\nThen, Kantian moral theories. I know that Immanuel Kant was a philosopher who talked a lot about duties and obligations. He's famous for the categorical imperative, which is a principle that commands unconditionally that certain actions are morally required, regardless of personal desires or consequences. That sounds a lot like a duty-based approach, where the focus is on doing one's duty rather than looking at the outcomes.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which would mean that none of the listed theories are duty-based. But based on what I recall about Kant, that seems unlikely because his theories are pretty much the epitome of duty-based ethics.\n\nLet me try to recall more about each of these to make sure.\n\nConsequentialism: As I thought, it's an ethical theory that judges the morality of actions based on their outcomes. So, if an action leads to good consequences, it's morally right, even if the action itself might be considered problematic in other contexts. This is opposite to a duty-based approach, which focuses on whether an action aligns with moral duties or rules, regardless of the consequences.\n\nNatural law theory: This is based on the idea that there are inherent laws in nature that govern human behavior and that these laws can be discerned through reason. It suggests that moral principles are derived from what is natural and good for humans. While it does prescribe certain behaviors as morally required, it's not specifically about duties in the same way that Kantian ethics is.\n\nKantian moral theories: Kant developed a deontological ethics, which is a duty-based approach. In his view, moral duties are derived from rationality and universal moral laws. The categorical imperative is a central concept, which includes formulations like \"act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\" This is clearly about duties and obligations.\n\nGiven this, it seems that Kantian moral theories are the clear example of a duty-based moral theory among the options provided.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if natural law theory could also be considered duty-based. After all, it does prescribe certain duties based on what is natural for humans. However, it seems more focused on aligning with nature and human purposes, whereas Kantian ethics is explicitly about duties derived from moral laws and principles.\n\nConsequentialism, on the other hand, is fundamentally opposed to duty-based approaches because it focuses solely on outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be C. Kantian moral theories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
