                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about an experiment with an ideal gas. The independent variable is temperature in Kelvin, and the dependent variable is volume in cubic meters. So, temperature is what I control, and volume is what I measure based on the temperature I set.\n\nI need to figure out what's true about the slope and y-intercept of the graph when I plot volume against temperature. The options talk about the slope being proportional or inversely proportional to the pressure, and whether the y-intercept is zero or not.\n\nFirst, I should recall the ideal gas law, which is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn this experiment, temperature is the independent variable and volume is dependent. So, if I plot volume (V) on the y-axis and temperature (T) on the x-axis, the relationship between V and T should be linear, assuming pressure and the amount of gas are constant.\n\nLet me rearrange the ideal gas law to see the relationship between V and T:\n\nV = (nR/P) T\n\nThis looks like the equation of a straight line, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nComparing V = (nR/P) T to y = mx + b, I can see that:\n\n- The slope m is equal to (nR/P)\n\n- The y-intercept b is 0\n\nSo, the graph of volume versus temperature should pass through the origin, meaning when temperature is zero, volume is zero. That makes sense for an ideal gas.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The slope will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3.\n\nB. The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will be 0 m^3.\n\nC. The slope will be linearly proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will not be 0 m^3.\n\nD. The slope will be inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the intercept will not be 0 m^3.\n\nFrom V = (nR/P) T, the slope is (nR/P). So, slope is inversely proportional to pressure because as P increases, the slope decreases, and vice versa.\n\nAlso, the y-intercept is 0, as we saw.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be that the slope is inversely proportional to the pressure, and the intercept is 0 m^3.\n\nLooking back at the options, that's option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is Charles's law, which states that volume is directly proportional to temperature when pressure is constant for a given mass of gas.\n\nSo, V \u221d T at constant P and n.\n\nThat's consistent with V = (nR/P) T, where (nR/P) is a constant.\n\nSo, in this case, since P is constant in the experiment, the slope should be a constant, and indeed it is (nR/P).\n\nAnd since it's an ideal gas, at T=0, V=0, so the y-intercept is zero.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the slope is inversely proportional to the pressure, and the intercept is zero.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if pressure could change or if there's any scenario where the intercept isn't zero.\n\nThe problem states that the experiment is performed on an ideal gas, and pressure is presumably held constant, as we're only changing temperature and observing volume.\n\nIf pressure were to change, then the slope would change accordingly, but in this experiment, pressure is likely held constant, so the slope is fixed.\n\nAlso, for an ideal gas, there's no volume at zero temperature, hence the intercept is zero.\n\nSo, I think option B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
