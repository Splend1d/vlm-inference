I remember that Raggedy Ann has a brother, and they are both dolls created by Johnny Gruelle. I think Andy might be the correct answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up or think about the stories involving them.\n\nLet me think about the stories. In the Raggedy Ann books, there are adventures involving Raggedy Ann and her brother. I believe his name is Andy. I think in some versions, he's called Raggedy Andy. So, that would make sense. But maybe I'm misremembering.\n\nAlternatively, I've heard of a character named Red in some children's stories, but I'm not sure if that's related to Raggedy Ann. Freckles sounds like a nickname or a descriptive name, but I don't recall it being the name of Raggedy Ann's brother. Randy doesn't ring a bell either.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider that Raggedy Ann's brother is also a rag doll, similar to her. If that's the case, perhaps his name is Raggedy Andy, making Andy the correct choice.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should consider the source material. Raggedy Ann was created by Johnny Gruelle and first appeared in a book called \"Raggedy Ann\" in 1918. Later, there was \"Raggedy Andy Stories\" in 1920, which suggests that Raggedy Andy is indeed her brother.\n\nSo, based on that, I think the correct answer is Andy. But to be thorough, perhaps I should check online or recall if there are any other characters with those names associated with Raggedy Ann.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a doll named Red who is her brother. I seem to recall that in some toy lines, Raggedy Ann has a brother named Red. Maybe it varies between different adaptations or merchandise.\n\nFreckles could be a possibility if her brother has freckles, but I don't think that's his name.\n\nRandy doesn't sound familiar in this context.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should go with my initial instinct that it's Andy, as there is a \"Raggedy Andy\" book.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some versions, his name is different. Maybe the question is referring to a specific adaptation or version of Raggedy Ann.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, I'll choose Andy as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
