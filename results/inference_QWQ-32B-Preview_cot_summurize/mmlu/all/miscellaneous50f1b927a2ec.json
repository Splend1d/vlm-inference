When a business files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it is seeking protection from its creditors while it develops a plan to become financially stable again. This process often involves restructuring debt, modifying contracts, and potentially selling off assets. The goal is to allow the company to continue its operations and eventually emerge from bankruptcy as a financially viable entity.\n\nOption B, selling stock, is not directly related to Chapter 11 filings. While a company might sell stock as part of a broader financial restructuring, filing for Chapter 11 is not synonymous with selling stock.\n\nOption C, buying a smaller company, is also unrelated to Chapter 11. Chapter 11 is about dealing with debt and financial distress, not about acquiring other businesses.\n\nOption D, suing the government, is entirely unrelated to Chapter 11 filings. Suing the government would be a legal action, whereas Chapter 11 is a financial restructuring process under bankruptcy law.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. declaring bankruptcy, specifically filing for Chapter 11 protection."
