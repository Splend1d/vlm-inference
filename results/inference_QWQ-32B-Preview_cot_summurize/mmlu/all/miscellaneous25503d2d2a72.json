                    "text": "I think I know this one. John Glenn was an astronaut, right? He was one of the first ones in the NASA space program. But before that, he was a pilot in the military. Let me see... was he in the Army, Air Force, Marines, or Navy?\n\nHmm, I remember something about him being in the Navy. Yeah, I think he was a Navy pilot. Let me double-check that.\n\nJohn Glenn was selected as one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959. Before that, he had a career as a pilot in the United States Navy. He served during World War II and the Korean War, flying various military aircraft.\n\nSo, if I look at the options:\n\nA. Army - I don't think he was in the Army.\n\nB. Air Force - Now, this might be tricky because sometimes people get confused between the Air Force and the Navy, especially regarding pilots.\n\nC. Marines - I don't recall him being in the Marines.\n\nD. Navy - Yeah, I believe he was in the Navy.\n\nWait a minute, I recall that the Air Force is a separate branch from the Army, Navy, and Marines. Maybe he was in the Air Force at some point?\n\nActually, the United States Air Force was established as a separate branch in 1947, so it's possible he was in the Air Force too.\n\nBut from what I remember, John Glenn was primarily associated with the Navy.\n\nLet me try to recall more details. He was a test pilot, wasn't he? I think he was part of the Naval Air Test Center.\n\nAlso, I know that many early astronauts had military backgrounds, and a lot of them were from the Navy or the Air Force.\n\nAnother thing is that the Mercury Seven astronauts included pilots from different branches, but I think Glenn was from the Navy.\n\nLet me consider the other options again.\n\nArmy: I don't think there were many astronauts coming from the Army, at least not in the early days of the space program.\n\nMarines: Again, I don't recall Glenn being a Marine.\n\nAir Force: There were certainly astronauts from the Air Force, like Gus Grissom, but I think Glenn was from the Navy.\n\nWait, was Gus Grissom from the Air Force? Actually, no, Gus Grissom was in the Air Force, but I might be confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should look at his biography or some facts about his military career.\n\nOkay, according to my knowledge, John Herschel Glenn Jr. was born on July 18, 1921, and passed away on December 8, 2016. He was a distinguished pilot and astronaut.\n\nDuring World War II, he served in the Marine Corps, but I think that might be a mistake. Let me verify that.\n\nActually, no, John Glenn enlisted in the United States Navy in 1942, but then he was assigned to the Marine Corps for aviation training. So, he was a Marine Corps pilot during World War II.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Was he in the Navy or the Marines?\n\nWell, the United States Marine Corps is part of the Department of the Navy, so sometimes there's overlap.\n\nBut officially, the Marines are a separate branch.\n\nSo, if he was a Marine Corps pilot, that would make him a Marine, not a Navy pilot.\n\nBut earlier, I thought he was a Navy pilot.\n\nMaybe I need to clarify this.\n\nLet me see: the Marines have their own aviation component, and pilots are Marine Corps pilots.\n\nSimilarly, the Navy has Navy pilots.\n\nSo, if he was a Marine Corps pilot, that would be different from being a Navy pilot.\n\nBut in terms of the options given, both Navy and Marines are listed separately, so I need to choose carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps he was in the Marines.\n\nBut I have a feeling that he was in the Navy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he was in both.\n\nWas John Glenn in both the Marines and the Navy?\n\nLet me think about his timeline.\n\nHe was born in 1921 and enlisted in the Navy in 1942 during World War II.\n\nThen, after the war, he may have transferred to another branch.\n\nWait, no. During World War II, he served as a Marine Corps aviator.\n\nAfter the war, he continued his service, possibly in the Marines or switched to the Navy.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look up his exact military service.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that he was a Marine Corps pilot during World War II and possibly later served in the Navy.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps I can recall some famous astronauts and their military backgrounds.\n\nFor example, Neil Armstrong was in the Navy, Buzz Aldrin was in the Air Force.\n\nJohn Glenn, I think, was in the Marines.\n\nWait, no, I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to remember.\n\nI think the correct answer is that John Glenn served as a pilot in the Marine Corps.\n\nBut since the options provided are Army, Air Force, Marines, and Navy, and Marines is listed separately, I should go with Marines.\n\nHowever, I have doubts because I also recall him being associated with the Navy.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that he was in the Marines during World War II and then later in the Navy.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps he was in the Navy Reserve or something like that.\n\nI need to make a decision based on the options given.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is C. Marines.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's D. Navy.\n\nI think I'll go with Navy.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Navy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
