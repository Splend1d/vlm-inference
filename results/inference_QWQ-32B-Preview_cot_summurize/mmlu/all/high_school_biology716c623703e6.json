                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this question about a species that gives birth to only one offspring at a time and has a long life-span for its body size. I need to figure out which of the options is probably also true about this organism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the implications of the information given. The species gives birth to only one offspring at a time, which suggests that it doesn't have large litters like some animals do. Also, it has a relatively long life-span compared to what would be expected for its body size. That's interesting.\n\nMaybe I should think about how these traits relate to the environment and lifestyle of the organism. For example, species that have few offspring but provide a lot of care to each might invest more in ensuring the survival of those few offspring. On the other hand, species that have many offspring might not invest as much in each one, relying on numbers to ensure that some survive.\n\nOption A says it lives in a newly colonized habitat. I'm not sure about that. Newly colonized habitats might favor organisms that can reproduce quickly and in large numbers to take advantage of the available resources. But our species has only one offspring at a time and a long life-span, which doesn't seem to fit that scenario. Maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says it's an aquatic organism. Hmm, being aquatic doesn't necessarily correlate with the number of offspring or life-span. There are aquatic species that have many offspring and others that have few, so this seems too general. I don't think I can conclude that it's probably aquatic based on the information given.\n\nOption C says it requires relatively high parental care of offspring. That sounds plausible. If the species has only one offspring at a time and a long life-span, it might invest more in caring for that single offspring to ensure its survival. This seems like a reasonable inference.\n\nOption D says the age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young. But if the species has a long life-span and gives birth to only one offspring at a time, maybe the offspring take longer to mature and reach reproductive age. That might be the case, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nLet me think about this differently. In ecology and life history strategies, there's a concept called r-selection and K-selection. R-selected species are adapted to unstable environments and tend to produce many offspring with little parental care, while K-selected species are adapted to stable environments and tend to produce fewer offspring with more parental care.\n\nOur species sounds like it might be K-selected, given that it has only one offspring at a time and a long life-span. K-selected species usually invest more in fewer offspring and have higher parental care.\n\nSo, based on that, option C seems like the most likely correct answer.\n\nBut maybe I should consider each option again.\n\nOption A: lives in a newly colonized habitat. Newly colonized habitats are often unstable and variable, which might select for r-selected traits like producing many offspring quickly. Our species doesn't fit that profile, so probably not A.\n\nOption B: aquatic organism. Being aquatic doesn't necessarily correlate with these traits, so probably not B.\n\nOption C: requires relatively high parental care of offspring. As I thought earlier, this aligns with K-selected species, which match the description of the species.\n\nOption D: the age at which the offspring themselves can give birth is relatively young. If the species has a long life-span, maybe the offspring take longer to reach maturity, meaning they have a later age of reproduction. That would contradict option D.\n\nSo, overall, option C seems the most probable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
