The hyperfine coupling constant (a) is a measure of this interaction and is typically reported in units of Gauss (G) or millitesla (mT).\n\nFor deuterium nuclei (\u00b2H), which have a nuclear spin I = 1/2, the hyperfine coupling constant can be estimated using known values from similar systems. In the case of organic radicals, hyperfine couplings with deuterium are generally small compared to those with protons (\u00b9H, I = 1/2), due to the lower gyromagnetic ratio of deuterium.\n\nA commonly cited value for the hyperfine coupling constant of an electron with a deuterium nucleus in organic radicals is around 2-4 Gauss. However, for a more accurate prediction, we can look into specific literature values or use theoretical calculations.\n\nGiven that benzene is an aromatic ring, and considering that the radical anion likely locates the unpaired electron in the \u03c0* orbital, the hyperfine coupling with the deuterium nuclei in the ring can be estimated.\n\nFrom the options provided:\n\nA. 0.375 mT\n\nB. 3.75 G\n\nC. 2.35 mT\n\nD. 0.58 G\n\nWe need to consider the units. Note that 1 mT = 10 Gauss, since 1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss.\n\nTherefore:\n\nA. 0.375 mT = 3.75 G\n\nC. 2.35 mT = 23.5 G\n\nD. 0.58 G remains 0.58 G\n\nGiven that option B is 3.75 G and option A is equivalent to 3.75 G, we have two options that are numerically the same but in different units.\n\nConsidering that hyperfine coupling constants with deuterium are typically in the range of a few Gauss, option B (3.75 G) or equivalently option A (0.375 mT) seems plausible.\n\nOption C (2.35 mT = 23.5 G) is quite large for a deuterium hyperfine coupling, which are usually smaller than proton hyperfine couplings and typically in the range of a few Gauss.\n\nOption D (0.58 G) is also in the plausible range, but compared to the other options, 3.75 G aligns better with typical values.\n\nHowever, to make a more informed decision, let's consider that in some literature, the hyperfine coupling constants for deuterium in aromatic radicals can be around 3-4 G.\n\nFor example, in some reports on radical anions of aromatic compounds, hyperfine coupling constants with deuterium have been observed in this range.\n\nTherefore, option B (3.75 G) seems to be a reasonable prediction for the hyperfine value in the EPR spectrum of fully deuterated benzene radical anion.\n\nIt's also worth noting that option A (0.375 mT) is equivalent to 3.75 G, so it is essentially the same value just expressed in different units.\n\nGiven that the question might expect the answer in Gauss, as it is a common unit in EPR spectroscopy, option B (3.75 G) would be the appropriate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
