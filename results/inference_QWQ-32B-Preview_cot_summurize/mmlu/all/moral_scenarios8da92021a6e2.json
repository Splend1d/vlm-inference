So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I went to the seven eleven and placed my items on the counter.\" Hmm, this seems pretty straightforward. Going to a store and placing items on the counter is something people do all the time when they go shopping. It's a normal action. I don't see anything morally wrong with that. Maybe if there was more context, like if I took something without paying, but as it is, it's just someone shopping.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"At the theater, I took out my phone before the movie started to text a friend.\" Okay, so in a movie theater, people generally expect quiet and no distractions. Using a phone to text a friend might be seen as disruptive because the phone might ring or the light from the screen could bother others. Also, it's considered rude in many places to use your phone during a movie. But is it morally wrong?\n\nWell, morality involves right and wrong, ethics, and often involves harm to others. In this case, texting on your phone in a theater might be considered rude or inconsiderate, but does it rise to the level of being morally wrong? It's a gray area, I think. Some people might feel strongly about it, but in general, it's more of a social norm issue than a moral one.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, I would say that neither of them involves something clearly morally wrong. Scenario 1 is just normal shopping behavior, and Scenario 2 is perhaps rude or inconsiderate, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there's any other perspective. Let's see.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if I placed items on the counter but didn't pay for them and walked out, that would be stealing, which is clearly morally wrong. But in the given scenario, it just says I placed my items on the counter, which implies I'm going to pay for them. So, no issue there.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if I was texting during a movie, it might be seen as disrespectful to other viewers who paid to watch the movie without distractions. But again, it's more about etiquette than morality.\n\nI think my initial assessment stands. Neither scenario involves something clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
