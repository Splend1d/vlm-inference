We charge that the controlling influences dominating both these parties have permitted the existing dreadful conditions to develop without serious effort to prevent or restrain them. Neither do they now promise us any substantial reform. They have agreed together to ignore, in the coming campaign, every issue but one. They propose to drown the outcries of a plundered people with the uproar of a sham battle over the tariff, so that capitalists, corporations, national banks, rings, trusts, watered stock, the demonetization of silver and the oppressions of the usurers may all be lost sight of. They propose to sacrifice our homes, lives, and children on the altar of mammon; to destroy the multitude in order to secure corruption funds from the millionaires.\n\"Assembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chief who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of 'the plain people,' with which class it originated. We assert our purposes to be identical with the purposes of the National Constitution; to form a more perfect union and establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\"\nPopulist Party Platform, 1892\nThe sentiments expressed in the excerpt above about political parties are most similar to those expressed by\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question. So, we've got this excerpt from the Populist Party Platform in 1892, and it's pretty passionate, right? It's criticizing the two major political parties of the time, saying they've been fighting for power and plunder, ignoring the people's suffering, and now they're focusing on a sham battle over the tariff to distract from real issues like corruption and economic injustices.\n\nThe question is asking which of these historical figures expressed similar sentiments about political parties:\n\nA. George McGovern, Democratic Party, 1972\n\nB. Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912\n\nC. Andrew Jackson, Democratic Party, 1829\n\nD. H. Ross Perot, Reform Party, 1996\n\nSo, I need to think about what each of these people stood for and whether their criticisms of political parties align with what's expressed in the Populist Platform.\n\nLet's start with the Populists. They were active mainly in the late 19th century, around the 1880s to the early 1900s, representing farmers and workers who were discontent with the existing political system, particularly how it was serving their interests. They felt that the Democratic and Republican parties were both controlled by wealthy elites who weren't interested in addressing the issues important to average people, like economic inequality, banking practices, and monopolies.\n\nSo, their platform is essentially saying that both major parties are corrupt and not looking out for the common people, and they're going to try to create a new party to represent the \"plain people.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. George McGovern was a Democratic candidate in 1972. He was known for his opposition to the Vietnam War and his progressive stances on social issues. While he may have criticized certain aspects of the political system, I don't recall him specifically targeting both major parties for being tools of the wealthy elites in the same way the Populists did.\n\nB. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, left the party to form the Progressive Party in 1912. He was concerned about the power of trusts and corporations and advocated for reforms to make government more responsive to the people. His \"New Nationalism\" speech in 1910 criticized the influence of big business on politics, advocating for stronger regulation and protection of labor rights. This seems pretty similar to the Populist critique.\n\nC. Andrew Jackson was a Democrat and became president in 1829. He was known for his appeal to the common man and his war on the Second Bank of the United States, which he saw as benefiting the elite at the expense of the ordinary people. So, he did criticize what he saw as elitist institutions, but I'm not sure if his criticisms were directed at both major parties in the same way the Populists were.\n\nD. H. Ross Perot ran as an independent and later as the Reform Party candidate in 1996. He was known for his populist appeals, criticizing Washington politics and the influence of special interests. He advocated for fiscal responsibility and political reform. His message had some similarities to the Populists in terms of criticizing the established parties, but I'm not sure if it matches the intensity or the specific issues raised by the Populists.\n\nComparing these options, Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party seems to align most closely with the Populist Platform's critique of both major parties being controlled by wealthy elites and ignoring the needs of the common people. Roosevelt's Progressive Party was formed precisely to address these issues and promote reforms to make government more democratic and responsive.\n\nAndrew Jackson also criticized elite interests, but he was a leader within one of the major parties, not someone forming a new party to oppose both majors. George McGovern was a Democratic candidate, and while he had progressive views, his campaign didn't seem to focus on the dual critique of both major parties in the same way. Ross Perot was more of an independent figure, but again, his platform, while critical of Washington, might not have aligned as closely with the Populist agenda on specific issues like tariffs, banking, and labor rights.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Theodore Roosevelt, Progressive Party, 1912.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
