                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's asking about bonds and which one has the negative end written last. I think this has to do with electronegativity, where electrons are more attracted to one atom than the other in a bond.\n\nSo, in a polar bond, the more electronegative atom attracts electrons more, making that end negative. If the negative end is written last in the bond notation, that means the more electronegative atom is second in the pair.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. O\u2014S\n\nOxygen (O) is more electronegative than sulfur (S). So, in O\u2014S, the negative end would be O. But in this notation, O is first, not last.\n\nB. Br\u2014N\n\nBromine (Br) and nitrogen (N), which one is more electronegative? Nitrogen is more electronegative than bromine. So, the negative end would be N, which is last in the notation.\n\nC. N\u2014C\n\nNitrogen (N) and carbon (C), nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon. So, the negative end is N, which is first in the notation.\n\nD. P\u2014Cl\n\nPhosphorus (P) and chlorine (Cl), chlorine is more electronegative than phosphorus. So, the negative end is Cl, which is last in the notation.\n\nWait, both B and D have the negative end last. Maybe I need to check the electronegativity values more accurately.\n\nLet me recall some electronegativity values:\n\n- Oxygen: around 3.44\n\n- Sulfur: around 2.58\n\n- Bromine: around 2.96\n\n- Nitrogen: around 3.04\n\n- Carbon: around 2.55\n\n- Phosphorus: around 2.19\n\n- Chlorine: around 3.16\n\nSo, in option B, Br\u2014N, nitrogen is more electronegative (3.04 vs. 2.96 for bromine), so N is the negative end, and it's last.\n\nIn option D, P\u2014Cl, chlorine is more electronegative (3.16 vs. 2.19 for phosphorus), so Cl is the negative end, and it's last.\n\nSo, both B and D have the negative end last. But the question seems to expect a single answer. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me double-check the electronegativity values.\n\n- Bromine: actually, it's around 2.96\n\n- Nitrogen: 3.04\n\n- Phosphorus: 2.19\n\n- Chlorine: 3.16\n\nYes, nitrogen is more electronegative than bromine, and chlorine is more electronegative than phosphorus.\n\nSo, in both B and D, the more electronegative atom is last.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting both B and D, but since it's a multiple-choice question with options A, B, C, D, perhaps it allows only one selection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a tiebreaker I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about how the bond is written in terms of conventional notation. Sometimes, bonds are written with the less electronegative atom first.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIn chemical formulas, it's common to write the less electronegative atom first, especially in binary compounds.\n\nFor example, HCl, where H is less electronegative than Cl.\n\nBut in some cases, like in Lewis structures, the more electronegative atom is often written last if it's the one holding more electrons.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. O\u2014S: O is more electronegative, so negative end is O, which is first.\n\nB. Br\u2014N: N is more electronegative, so negative end is N, which is last.\n\nC. N\u2014C: N is more electronegative, so negative end is N, which is first.\n\nD. P\u2014Cl: Cl is more electronegative, so negative end is Cl, which is last.\n\nSo, B and D both have the negative end last.\n\nBut if I have to choose only one, maybe the question is looking for the option where it's most clearly the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo or error in the question, and both B and D are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about dipole moments or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about how the bond dipole moment is directed.\n\nIn a polar bond, the dipole moment points from the positive end to the negative end.\n\nSo, if the negative end is written last, the dipole moment would be from the first atom to the second atom.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about assigning partial charges in the bond.\n\nIn any case, based on electronegativity differences, in options B and D, the negative end is last.\n\nBut since it's a single-choice question, perhaps I need to select the best or most obvious example.\n\nComparing B and D:\n\nIn B, Br\u2014N, the difference in electronegativity is 3.04 - 2.96 = 0.08\n\nIn D, P\u2014Cl, it's 3.16 - 2.19 = 0.97\n\nSo, the electronegativity difference is much larger in D, making it a more polar bond.\n\nPerhaps the question is looking for the option with the most significant polarity, where the negative end is last.\n\nIn that case, D would be the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simply about the notation, regardless of the magnitude of polarity.\n\nIn that case, both B and D are correct, but since it's a single-choice question, perhaps D is the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLooking back at the question: \"In which of the following is the negative end of the bond written last?\"\n\nBased on electronegativity, in B and D, the negative end is last.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects only one answer, and D is the correct choice due to the larger electronegativity difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the standard way bonds are written.\n\nIn chemistry, it's conventional to write the less electronegative atom first.\n\nFor example, HCl, not ClH; HF, not FH.\n\nSo, in option D, P\u2014Cl, phosphorus is less electronegative than chlorine, so it's written first, which aligns with the convention.\n\nSimilarly, in B, Br\u2014N, bromine is less electronegative than nitrogen, so it's written first, which also aligns with the convention.\n\nIn A, O\u2014S, oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, but it's written first, which might not follow the convention.\n\nIn C, N\u2014C, nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon, but it's written first.\n\nSo, perhaps the question is testing whether we know the conventional order of writing bonds.\n\nIn that case, options A and C might be incorrect because they have the more electronegative atom written first, which is not conventional.\n\nWhile B and D have the less electronegative atom written first, which is conventional.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the negative end being written last.\n\nGiven that, and considering the conventional notation, perhaps D is the best answer, as it follows convention and has a significant electronegativity difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B, but with a smaller electronegativity difference.\n\nGiven that, and considering the question's phrasing, I think D is the most appropriate answer.\n\nSo, the answer is D.
