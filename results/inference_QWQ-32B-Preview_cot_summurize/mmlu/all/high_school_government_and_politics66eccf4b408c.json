State legislatures\n\nAccording to the U.S. Constitution, the qualifications for voters are set by each state, and the states have the power to determine who can vote in their elections. This is based on Article I, Section 2, which states that \"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators.\"\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while states have primary authority over voter eligibility, the Constitution also provides some federal standards and protections. For example, the 15th Amendment prohibits denying the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude; the 19th Amendment prohibits denying the right to vote based on sex; and the 26th Amendment lowers the voting age to 18.\n\nAdditionally, Congress has the power to override state regulations through legislation, as mentioned in the Constitution. This has been exercised in laws such as the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which imposes federal oversight on certain states' voting practices to prevent discrimination.\n\nSo, while state legislatures have the primary authority to determine voter eligibility requirements, this authority is subject to federal constitutional amendments and congressional legislation that can set national standards and protections for voting rights."
