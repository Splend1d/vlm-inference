                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about the birds blown to an isolated island by a hurricane. So, a small group of birds ends up on an island and starts a new colony. The question is about the gene pool of this new population and which evolutionary concept it likely reflects. The options are directed mutation, genetic drift, adaptive radiation, and disruptive selection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nDirected mutation sounds like mutations that happen in a specific direction, maybe towards a beneficial trait, but I think mutations are random, so maybe that's not it.\n\nGenetic drift is when allele frequencies in a population change just by chance, especially in small populations. So, if a small group of birds is separated from the main population, their gene pool might differ just by chance from the original population.\n\nAdaptive radiation is when organisms rapidly evolve into diverse forms, each exploiting a different niche in the environment. This often happens when a species colonizes a new area with many available niches.\n\nDisruptive selection is a type of natural selection where extreme phenotypes are favored over intermediate ones. So, it leads to a split in the population into distinct forms.\n\nNow, in this scenario, a small population of birds is blown to an isolated island. This sounds like a founder event, where a new population is started by a small number of individuals from a larger population. In such cases, the gene pool of the new population might not represent the full diversity of the original population. This can lead to genetic drift, where random changes in allele frequencies become more pronounced because the population is small.\n\nAdaptive radiation could also be a possibility because the birds are in a new environment with different selective pressures and possibly many unoccupied niches. Over time, they might evolve into different forms to exploit these niches.\n\nDirected mutation doesn't sound right because mutations aren't directed; they happen randomly.\n\nDisruptive selection might occur later if there are different environments or resources that favor extreme traits, but it's not necessarily the immediate effect of founding a new colony.\n\nGiven that the question is about the gene pool of the newly established population, I think genetic drift is the most likely answer. This is because the small population size makes random fluctuations in allele frequencies more significant.\n\nAlso, adaptive radiation might happen over time as the birds evolve to fit different niches, but the initial gene pool would likely be affected by genetic drift due to the small number of founding individuals.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Genetic drift.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
