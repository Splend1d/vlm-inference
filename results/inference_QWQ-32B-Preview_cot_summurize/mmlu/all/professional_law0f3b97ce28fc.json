                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract problem between a homeowner and a house painter. So, they have a written contract where the painter agrees to paint the house with off-white latex paint and finish the job within 30 days. The homeowner promises to pay $10,000 within one week after the job is completed, provided he finds the job satisfactory.\n\nNow, I need to determine the most accurate statement about the homeowner's obligation to pay the $10,000. There are four options:\n\nA. Payment of $10,000 by the homeowner is an express condition precedent to the house painter's duty of performance.\n\nB. Payment of $10,000 by the homeowner is an express condition subsequent to the house painter's duty of performance.\n\nC. The house painter's performance under the contract is an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty to pay $10,000.\n\nD. The performances of the homeowner and the house painter are, in essence, concurrent conditions.\n\nLet me break this down. First, I need to understand what \"condition precedent\" and \"condition subsequent\" mean.\n\nA condition precedent is an event or action that must occur before a party's performance is required. It's something that must happen before obligations are triggered.\n\nA condition subsequent, on the other hand, is an event or action that, if it occurs, changes the parties' obligations, often discharging one from their duties.\n\nConcurrent conditions refer to situations where both parties are expected to perform their obligations at or around the same time.\n\nIn this contract, the painter agrees to paint the house and finish within 30 days. The homeowner agrees to pay $10,000 within one week after the job is completed, provided he finds it satisfactory.\n\nSo, the painter's performance comes first: painting the house and completing the job within 30 days. Then, after the job is completed, the homeowner has one week to pay $10,000 if satisfied.\n\nThis seems like the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's obligation to pay. The painter has to complete the job satisfactorily before the homeowner is required to pay.\n\nLet's look at option A: Payment by the homeowner is a condition precedent to the painter's duty of performance. That doesn't make sense because the painter is supposed to perform first, and then get paid.\n\nOption B: Payment by the homeowner is a condition subsequent to the painter's duty of performance. This might suggest that after the painter has performed, the payment is made, but \"condition subsequent\" typically refers to an event that, if it occurs, affects the obligations. It's not quite fitting here.\n\nOption C: The painter's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's duty to pay. This aligns with what I've understood: the painter has to perform first, and then the homeowner pays.\n\nOption D: The performances are concurrent conditions. This would mean both parties perform their obligations at the same time, but in this case, the painter is supposed to paint the house first, and then the homeowner pays later.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option C seems to be the most accurate.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The contract says, \"If the homeowner finds the completed job to be satisfactory, he will pay the house painter $10,000 within one week after the job is completed.\"\n\nThis indicates that the homeowner's payment is dependent on two things: the job being completed and the homeowner's satisfaction with the job.\n\nSo, the painter's completion of the job is a condition precedent to the homeowner's obligation to pay, but there's also a subjective element of satisfaction.\n\nHowever, the question is about the homeowner's contractual obligation to pay $10,000, and among the given options, C seems to capture the essential relationship: the painter's performance is a condition precedent to the homeowner's duty to pay.\n\nOption A is incorrect because payment isn't required before the painter starts working.\n\nOption B is not quite right because \"condition subsequent\" typically refers to an event that affects existing obligations, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the performances aren't concurrent; the painter performs first, and then the homeowner pays.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is option C: The house painter's performance under the contract would be an express condition precedent to the homeowner's duty of payment of the $10,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
