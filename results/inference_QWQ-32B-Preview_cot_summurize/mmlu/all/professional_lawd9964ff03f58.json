He admitted to killing her, but asserted that he lacked the intent to murder, due to his suffering from a personality disorder complicated by two days of drinking alcohol heavily. The trial judge instructed the jury that \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" The judge did not tell them that they had a choice or could infer another conclusion; they were told only that the law presumed it. The accused was convicted of depraved heart murder and sentenced to 100 years in prison.

The jury could have felt that they were being told that they had no other choice. The state supreme court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari. Will the Court likely reverse the conviction?\n\nA. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.\nB. Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did.\nC.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal question. It's about a guy who was charged with intentional murder but claimed he didn't have the intent to kill because of a personality disorder and heavy drinking over two days. He admitted to killing his former girlfriend, but said it wasn't intentional. The trial judge gave an instruction to the jury that \"the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts.\" And that's the key part here.\n\nSo, the judge told the jury that there's a presumption that the person intended the normal results of what they did voluntarily. But the judge didn't give them the option to consider otherwise or infer something different. It sounds like the judge was saying, \"Look, the law presumes that he intended the consequences of his actions.\" And the jury was essentially told that this is what the law says, without giving them the flexibility to decide otherwise.\n\nThe defendant was convicted of depraved heart murder and got 100 years in prison. On appeal, he argued that the court took away the jury's role in determining criminal intent by telling them they had to find intent. He's saying that the jury might have felt they had no choice but to find intent, even if they had doubts about it.\n\nThe state supreme court affirmed the conviction, but the US Supreme Court granted certiorari, which means they agreed to hear the case. Now, the question is whether the US Supreme Court is likely to reverse the conviction.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.\n\nB. Yes, because the wording in effect caused the defendant to be a witness against himself by having him intend everything that he did.\n\nC. No, because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference created by the jury instruction.\n\nD. No, because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury did not have to consider in its deliberations.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what a presumption like this means in law. A presumption shifts the burden of proof to some extent. In this case, the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts. So, if someone voluntarily does something, and there are ordinary consequences, the law presumes they intended those consequences.\n\nBut in this particular instruction, the judge didn't give the jury the option to consider otherwise. It was presented as a fact: the law presumes intent. The jury might have understood this as a mandatory direction that they had to find intent, without considering other factors like the defendant's mental state, his personality disorder, or his heavy drinking.\n\nOption A suggests that the wording could have been seen as mandatory, forcing the jury to find intent. That seems plausible. If the judge says \"the law presumes\" something, jurors might think they have to accept that presumption unless there's evidence to rebut it, but even then, it's not clear from the instruction whether they can reject it or not.\n\nOption B says yes, because it effectively made the defendant a witness against himself by having him intend everything he did. Hmm, that's an interesting point. In the US, there's the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which means you can't be forced to testify against yourself. But here, it's not about testimony; it's about the legal presumption applied to his actions.\n\nI'm not sure if this directly relates to self-incrimination, but perhaps the idea is that by presuming he intended the consequences of his acts, it's akin to forcing him to admit intent, which could incriminate him more severely.\n\nOption C says no, because the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference. But in the instruction given, it doesn't seem like the jury was told that they could consider rebuttal evidence or that the presumption could be overcome. It was just stated as a fact: the law presumes intent.\n\nSo, if the jury wasn't given the option to consider otherwise, how could the defendant rebut the presumption? It seems like the instruction might have been flawed because it didn't give the jury the full picture.\n\nOption D says no, because the instruction was only a presumption that the jury didn't have to consider. But again, the way it was presented, it seems like the jury was told that this is what the law presumes, without giving them the option to disregard it.\n\nIn criminal cases, especially in the US, the jury is supposed to be the fact-finder, and they have the discretion to evaluate all the evidence and make decisions about the defendant's guilt based on beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\n\nIf the judge instructs the jury in a way that appears to mandate a certain finding, that could interfere with the jury's role. In this case, by presuming intent, and not giving the jury the option to consider other factors, it might have taken away their ability to consider the defendant's mental state or other mitigating factors.\n\nI recall that in criminal law, intent is often a crucial element, and the jury needs to be properly instructed on how to evaluate it. If there are defenses based on mental disorder or intoxication, the jury should be informed about how these factors might affect the defendant's intent.\n\nIn this case, the defendant claimed to have a personality disorder and was heavily drinking for two days. These could potentially affect his capacity to form intent or understand the consequences of his actions.\n\nIf the jury was told that the law presumes intent, without being instructed on how to consider the defendant's mental state or intoxication, that could be problematic. It might have led the jury to convict based on the presumption alone, without fully considering all the evidence.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A seems most plausible. The wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as mandatory, leaving them with no choice but to find intent.\n\nOption B is interesting, but I'm not entirely sure how the presumption directly relates to self-incrimination. Maybe it's stretching it a bit.\n\nOption C says that the defendant could raise an argument to rebut the permissible inference, but if the jury wasn't informed that they could consider rebuttal evidence, that might not have been possible in practice.\n\nOption D says that the instruction was only a presumption that the jury didn't have to consider, but again, the way it was presented, it seems like the jury was expected to accept the presumption without being given the option to reject it.\n\nGiven all this, I think the US Supreme Court is likely to reverse the conviction because the jury instruction may have improperly taken away the jury's fact-finding role by mandating a finding of intent.\n\nSo, my answer would be A. Yes, because the wording of the instruction could have been viewed by jurors as a mandatory direction to find that there was intent to murder.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
