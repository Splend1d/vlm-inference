                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Strut Co. and its payable to its parent, Plane Co. The question is asking in which of the following balance sheets should this payable be reported separately: Strut's balance sheet, Plane's balance sheet, or the consolidated balance sheet of Plane Co.?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Strut Co. is a subsidiary of Plane Co., which means Plane Co. owns a significant portion of Strut Co., probably more than 50% based on the term \"parent.\"\n\nNow, when it comes to balance sheets, there are a few key concepts to remember:\n\n1. **Separate Financial Statements:** These are the financial statements of individual entities, showing their own assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses without considering their relationships with other companies.\n\n2. **Consolidated Financial Statements:** These are the financial statements that combine the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses of a parent company and its subsidiaries as if they are a single economic entity.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the payable from Strut Co. to Plane Co.\n\n- **In Strut's Balance Sheet:** Strut Co. owes money to Plane Co., so this payable should be reported as a liability in Strut's balance sheet.\n\n- **In Plane's Balance Sheet:** Plane Co. has a receivable from Strut Co., which is a subsidiary. So, in Plane's separate balance sheet, this receivable should be reported as an asset.\n\n- **In the Consolidated Balance Sheet:** When preparing consolidated financial statements, intercompany transactions and balances need to be eliminated because they are considered internal to the economic entity as a whole.\n\nSo, in the consolidated balance sheet, the payable from Strut to Plane and the corresponding receivable from Plane to Strut should be eliminated. This is because they represent a transaction between two parts of the same economic entity and do not affect the external financial position.\n\nTherefore, in the consolidated balance sheet, this payable should not be reported separately; it should be eliminated.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nOption B seems to fit: Yes for Strut's balance sheet (it should be reported there), and No for Plane's consolidated balance sheet (it should not be reported separately there).\n\nWait a second, the question mentions \"Plane's balance sheet\" and \"consolidated balance sheet.\" So, perhaps it's asking about Plane's separate balance sheet and the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- Strut's balance sheet: Yes, report the payable.\n\n- Plane's separate balance sheet: Yes, report the receivable.\n\n- Consolidated balance sheet: No, do not report separately; eliminate the intercompany transaction.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking about \"this payable.\" So, in Plane's balance sheet, it would be a receivable, not a payable. Maybe the question is only considering whether the payable should be reported in Strut's balance sheet and in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nGiven that, option B seems correct: Yes for Strut's balance sheet, No for the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nHowever, let's double-check.\n\nIn Strut's separate financial statements, it should report the payable to Plane Co. because it's a liability of Strut.\n\nIn Plane's separate financial statements, it should report the receivable from Strut Co. as an asset.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, both the payable and the receivable should be eliminated because they are intercompany transactions.\n\nTherefore, in the consolidated balance sheet, this payable should not be reported separately.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B: Yes for Strut's balance sheet, No for the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where the payable should not be reported in Strut's balance sheet. Well, no, because it's a liability of Strut Co.; it needs to report what it owes.\n\nSimilarly, in the consolidated statements, intercompany balances are always eliminated.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nb."
