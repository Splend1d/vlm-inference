                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand what it means for an estimator to be consistent. The question gives me four options, and I need to pick the one that best describes consistency. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"On average, the estimated coefficient values will equal the true values.\" Hmm, that sounds a lot like the definition of an unbiased estimator. Unbiasedness means that the expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter value. But consistency is something different, right? Consistency is about what happens as the sample size gets larger. So, I don't think this is the correct choice for consistency.\n\nOption B says: \"The OLS estimator is unbiased and no other unbiased estimator has a smaller variance.\" This sounds like the definition of an efficient estimator. Efficiency is when an estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. Again, this is related to unbiasedness and efficiency, but not directly to consistency.\n\nOption C says: \"The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases.\" Okay, this seems more aligned with what I recall about consistency. Consistency is a property that describes the behavior of an estimator as the sample size grows. Specifically, a consistent estimator is one that converges in probability to the true parameter value as the sample size approaches infinity. So, this sounds promising.\n\nOption D says: \"The coefficient estimates will be as close to their true values as possible for small and large samples.\" This seems a bit vague. It mentions both small and large samples, but consistency is specifically about the behavior in large samples. Also, it doesn't explicitly mention convergence to the true value.\n\nComparing these options, Option C seems to best capture the essence of consistency. It directly refers to the convergence of estimates to the true values as the sample size increases, which is the key characteristic of a consistent estimator.\n\nTo make sure, let me recall the formal definition of consistency. An estimator is consistent if, as the sample size n approaches infinity, the estimator converges in probability to the true parameter value. This means that for sufficiently large n, the estimator will be very close to the true value with high probability.\n\nOption A is more about unbiasedness, which is a different property. Unbiasedness requires that the expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter, regardless of the sample size.\n\nOption B is about efficiency, which combines unbiasedness with the smallest variance among unbiased estimators.\n\nOption D is too broad and doesn't specify the asymptotic behavior that is central to consistency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C: \"The estimates will converge upon the true values as the sample size increases.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
