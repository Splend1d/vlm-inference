                    "text": "This question is about understanding which substance, when discontinued, poses the greatest risk of withdrawal delirium. Delirium is a serious condition characterized by confusion, disorientation, and sometimes hallucinations or agitation. It can be particularly dangerous during withdrawal from certain substances.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Cocaine: Cocaine is a stimulant drug that affects the central nervous system. Withdrawal from cocaine can lead to symptoms like depression, fatigue, and strong cravings, but delirium is not typically a primary symptom.\n\nB. LSD: LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, is a potent hallucinogen. Withdrawal from LSD generally does not cause severe physical symptoms or delirium.\n\nC. Phenobarbital: Phenobarbital is a barbiturate, which is a type of sedative-hypnotic drug. Barbiturates have a high potential for physical dependence, and discontinuing them can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens, which is a life-threatening form of delirium.\n\nD. Heroin: Heroin is an opioid drug that affects the opioid receptors in the brain. Withdrawal from opioids can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, and cravings, but delirium is not a typical withdrawal symptom.\n\nBased on this information, the substance that poses the greatest risk of withdrawal delirium is phenobarbital, as barbiturates can cause severe withdrawal symptoms including delirium tremens.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
