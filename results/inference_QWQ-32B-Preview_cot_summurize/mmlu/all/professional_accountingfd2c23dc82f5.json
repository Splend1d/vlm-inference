                    "text": "So I've got this question here about auditing controls when there's no written documentation. It's asking what an auditor should do to get evidence about the control's effectiveness. The options are: mailing confirmations, inquiry and other procedures like observation, analytical procedures, or recalculating the balance in related accounts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The operating effectiveness of a control is how well the control is working in practice. Normally, auditors look for documentation to support that the control is working as intended. But in this case, there's no written documentation available. So, the auditor needs to find other ways to gather evidence about how well the control is performing.\n\nOption A is mailing confirmations. This usually involves sending requests to third parties to verify the accuracy of certain account balances or transactions. For example, confirming accounts receivable with customers. But I'm not sure if this directly relates to testing the effectiveness of a control that lacks documentation.\n\nOption B is inquiry and other procedures such as observation. Inquiry means asking people about the controls and how they're implemented. Observation involves watching the process in action. These seem like they could be useful when there's no documentation because the auditor can get firsthand information about how the control is operating.\n\nOption C is analytical procedures. These involve evaluating financial information by studying relationships between financial and non-financial data. While analytical procedures can provide some insight into the effectiveness of controls, especially for detecting anomalies or irregularities, they might not directly address the operating effectiveness of a specific control.\n\nOption D is recalculating the balance in related accounts. This seems more like substantive testing rather than testing the effectiveness of a control. Recalculating balances would help verify the accuracy of the amounts reported but doesn't necessarily speak to whether the controls over those balances are effective.\n\nGiven that, option B, inquiry and other procedures such as observation, seems most directly applicable. By asking questions and observing the process, the auditor can gain understanding and evidence about how the control is operating in the absence of written documentation.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Maybe combining different procedures would be more effective. For instance, performing inquiry along with observation and possibly inspection of some related documentation if available. But the question seems to be asking for what the auditor should do, and among the options provided, inquiry and observation stand out as the most relevant.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there are any auditing standards or guidelines that speak to this situation. I recall that auditing standards emphasize the need for auditors to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about the operating effectiveness of controls, especially when documentation is lacking. In such cases, auditors often rely more heavily on inquiry and observation to understand and test the controls.\n\nMoreover, inquiry alone is generally not sufficient to test the operating effectiveness of a control because it is a relatively low-assurance procedure. Therefore, auditors would need to combine inquiry with other procedures like observation, inspection of documents, or reperformance to gather more persuasive evidence.\n\nLooking back at the options, B mentions inquiry and other procedures such as observation, which aligns with this approach. It suggests that inquiry is complemented by other procedures to enhance the quality of the evidence obtained.\n\nOption A, mailing confirmations, doesn't seem directly relevant to testing controls. Confirmations are typically used for verifying the existence and accuracy of account balances, not for testing the effectiveness of controls.\n\nOption C, analytical procedures, can be used as a substantive procedure to identify unusual relationships or trends that might indicate problems, but they are not specifically designed to test controls.\n\nOption D, recalculating balances, is again more of a substantive procedure to verify the accuracy of financial data rather than to test controls.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be B: inquiry and other procedures such as observation.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any scenarios where other options could be relevant. For example, if a control relates to the accuracy of certain calculations, recalculating the balances might provide some evidence about the control's effectiveness. However, this still seems like it's more aligned with substantive testing rather than control testing.\n\nSimilarly, if a control involves the verification of information with external parties, perhaps confirmations could be relevant, but again, this seems indirect.\n\nAnalytical procedures might sometimes be used to assess the reasonableness of financial data in a way that could indirectly support the effectiveness of certain controls, but it's not a direct test of control effectiveness.\n\nThus, I believe that option B is the correct choice here. When there's no written documentation, auditors should rely on inquiry combined with other procedures like observation to obtain evidence about the operating effectiveness of controls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
