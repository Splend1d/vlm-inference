It processes only raw sensory data\n\nB. Its span is limited by the number and form of the items presented\n\nC. It is relatively unaffected by interference\n\nD. It is the initial level of processing of sensory information\n\nFirst, I need to recall what short-term memory is. I remember that it's a part of our memory system where we hold information temporarily, usually for a short period, like a few seconds. It's like a workspace where we manipulate and use information right away.\n\nOption A says it processes only raw sensory data. Hmm, raw sensory data sounds like the initial information we get from our senses, like seeing something or hearing a sound. But I think that's more related to sensory memory, which is the first stage where sensory information is stored briefly before being processed further. Short-term memory comes after that, and it deals with information that has already been processed to some extent. So, maybe A isn't the best choice.\n\nOption B mentions that its span is limited by the number and form of the items presented. I know that short-term memory has a limited capacity, often referred to as the \"magic number 7 plus or minus 2,\" which means we can hold around 7 items in our short-term memory at a time. Also, the form of the items can affect how much we can remember; for example, chunking information can help increase the amount we can hold. So, this seems relevant.\n\nOption C says it is relatively unaffected by interference. Interference is when new information affects the recall of old information, or vice versa. I think short-term memory is actually quite susceptible to interference, especially from new information coming in. That's why things can be easily forgotten if we're not paying attention or if there's a lot of new information coming in. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D states that it is the initial level of processing of sensory information. Again, I think that's more accurate for sensory memory, which is the first stage where sensory information is briefly held before being processed and potentially moved to short-term memory.\n\nComparing all these, option B seems to best characterize short-term memory, as it mentions the limited span and how it's affected by the number and form of items presented. So, I'll go with B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
