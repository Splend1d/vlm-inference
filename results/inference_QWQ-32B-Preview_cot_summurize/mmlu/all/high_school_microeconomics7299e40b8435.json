                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which options are associated with public goods. The options are I, II, III, and IV, and I have to choose between A, B, C, or D.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what public goods are. Public goods are those goods that are both nonrivalrous and nonexcludable. Nonrivalrous means that one person's consumption of the good doesn't reduce the amount available for others. Nonexcludable means that it's impossible or very costly to prevent people from using the good, even if they don't pay for it.\n\nSo, option III is nonrivalry in consumption, which is a characteristic of public goods. That seems right.\n\nOption IV is nonexcludability, which is also a defining feature of public goods. So, both III and IV are correct.\n\nNow, option I is \"free riders.\" I know that free riders are people who benefit from a good without paying for it. This is a problem often associated with public goods because since they are nonexcludable, people can enjoy them without contributing to their cost. So, free riders are related to public goods.\n\nOption II is \"adding demand curves vertically to find the demand curve for society.\" Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this. Usually, to find the market demand, we add individual demand curves horizontally, right? But here it says \"vertically.\" I think vertical addition of demand curves is related to public goods.\n\nLet me think about why that is. In public goods, since they are nonrivalrous, one unit of the good can be consumed by multiple people simultaneously. So, the total benefit to society is the sum of the individual benefits at each quantity. That means we should add the individual demand curves vertically to get the social demand curve.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, option II is also related to public goods.\n\nWait a minute, so all four options seem to be related to public goods. But let's double-check.\n\nOption I: Free riders \u2013 yes, associated with public goods.\n\nOption II: Adding demand curves vertically \u2013 yes, specific to public goods.\n\nOption III: Nonrivalry in consumption \u2013 yes, a defining characteristic.\n\nOption IV: Nonexcludability \u2013 yes, another defining characteristic.\n\nSo, it seems like all four options are associated with public goods. Therefore, the correct answer should be D. I, II, III, and IV.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe there's a trick here. Maybe one of these isn't always true for public goods. Let's consider each one again.\n\nOption I: Free riders. While free riders are a common issue with public goods, it's possible to have public goods with mechanisms to reduce free riding, like subsidies or taxes. But in general, free riding is associated with public goods. So, I'll keep it.\n\nOption II: Adding demand curves vertically. This is a standard approach in public good theory to find the social demand. So, this is definitely associated with public goods.\n\nOption III: Nonrivalry. This is a defining feature, so yes.\n\nOption IV: Nonexcludability. Also a defining feature.\n\nI don't see any reason to exclude any of these options. Therefore, the answer should be D. I, II, III, and IV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
