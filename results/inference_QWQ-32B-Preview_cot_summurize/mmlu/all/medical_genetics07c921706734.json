                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about when recombination happens in meiosis. I know meiosis has two divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II, and each has its own phases like prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Recombination, which is also called crossing over, is when chromosomes exchange parts, right? So, when does this actually occur?\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Metaphase I.\n\nB. Prophase I.\n\nC. Metaphase II.\n\nD. Prophase II.\n\nI think recombination happens before the chromosomes separate. Metaphase is when chromosomes line up in the middle, but maybe it's during prophase when the chromosomes are still moving around and pairing up.\n\nWait, in meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I, and that's when crossing over can occur. So, maybe it's prophase I.\n\nBut let's think about prophase II. In meiosis II, the chromosomes are already separated into sister chromatids, and they don't exchange genetic material because they are identical copies at that point.\n\nMetaphase I is when the paired homologous chromosomes line up, but I think the crossing over has already happened by then.\n\nMetaphase II is similar, but again, it's after crossing over has occurred.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is B. Prophase I.\n\nBut let me double-check. I remember that during prophase I, there's a stage called synapsis, where homologous chromosomes come together and form a structure called a tetrad. It's during this stage that crossing over can occur, where segments of non-sister chromatids are exchanged.\n\nThis exchange results in recombinant chromosomes, which have a mix of maternal and paternal genetic material.\n\nSo, if crossing over happens during prophase I, that means recombination occurs in prophase I.\n\nI don't think it happens in prophase II because, by that point, the homologous chromosomes have already separated in meiosis I, and the chromosomes are now sister chromatids.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Prophase I.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider metaphase I again. During metaphase I, the paired homologous chromosomes line up, but I don't think crossing over occurs at that stage. It's more about alignment for segregation.\n\nSimilarly, in metaphase II, it's about aligning the sister chromatids before they separate.\n\nSo, yeah, I think B. Prophase I is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I'll look up a quick reference.\n\n*Looks up a meiosis diagram*\n\nOkay, according to this diagram, prophase I is where synapsis and crossing over occur.\n\nMetaphase I is when the tetrads line up along the equatorial plate.\n\nAnaphase I is when the homologous chromosomes separate.\n\nTelophase I and cytokinesis lead to two daughter cells.\n\nThen meiosis II is similar to mitosis, where the sister chromatids separate.\n\nSo, definitely, recombination occurs in prophase I.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
