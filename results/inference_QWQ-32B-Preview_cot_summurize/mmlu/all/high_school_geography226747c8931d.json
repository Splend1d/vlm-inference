I have this question here: \"Regions share all of these characteristics EXCEPT\" and then there are four options: A. boundaries, B. common features, C. relative location, D. easily defined. I need to figure out which one of these is not a characteristic that regions necessarily have.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a region is. A region is basically an area of Earth's surface that has unifying characteristics, right? So, it's defined by certain features that make it distinct from other areas. For example, a cultural region might have similar languages or religions, or a physical region might have similar landforms or climate.\n\nOption A is boundaries. Regions do have boundaries, but sometimes these boundaries can be vague or transitional. For example, think about the transition from one climate zone to another; it's not always a sharp line. So, while regions generally have boundaries, they might not always be clearly defined.\n\nOption B is common features. Yeah, that makes sense. Regions are defined by their common characteristics, whether it's cultural, physical, economic, etc.\n\nOption C is relative location. Relative location refers to where a place is in relation to other places. While relative location is important for understanding a region's context and relationships with surrounding areas, it's not necessarily a characteristic that all regions must have in the same way that common features or boundaries are.\n\nOption D is easily defined. Hmm, this is interesting. Some regions are easily defined, like a country with its political boundaries, but others might be more diffuse and harder to define, such as a cultural region where cultures overlap and mix.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is D. easily defined. Not all regions are easily defined; some can be quite complex and have fuzzy boundaries.\n\nBut let me double-check. If I look at the other options:\n\nA. Boundaries: Most regions have boundaries, even if they're not always clear.\n\nB. Common features: Yes, by definition, regions have common features.\n\nC. Relative location: While relative location is important, it's more about the relationships between regions rather than a characteristic inherent to the region itself.\n\nD. Easily defined: This seems the least accurate because not all regions are easily defined.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
