It's possible for an outcome to be worse for a particular person than some alternative.\n\nB. It's possible for an outcome to be worse than some alternative.\n\nC. Both A and B.\n\nD. Neither A nor B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between A and B. Option A specifies \"for a particular person,\" meaning that for one specific individual, one outcome is worse than another. Option B is more general; it says an outcome can be worse than some alternative, but it doesn't specify for whom.\n\nProbably, Parfit is known for discussing issues related to personal identity and what matters in survival. I think he might be associated with the idea that personal identity over time isn't as important as the continuity of psychological characteristics.\n\nGiven that, I recall that Parfit argues that personal identity is not what matters in survival. Instead, what matters is psychological continuity and connectedness. So, when considering outcomes, it's not just about the identity of the person but about the psychological connections.\n\nGiven that background, let's look back at the options.\n\nOption A says it's possible for an outcome to be worse for a particular person than some alternative. This seems plausible. Different outcomes can affect different people in different ways. So, for a particular person, one outcome might be worse than another.\n\nOption B says it's possible for an outcome to be worse than some alternative. This seems even more general and also plausible. Outcomes can be compared, and some can be worse overall, considering all impacts.\n\nGiven that both A and B seem plausible, and Parfit is likely to support both ideas, the answer might be C: both A and B.\n\nBut I should consider if there's any reason to think Parfit would disagree with either A or B.\n\nParfit is known for his views on personal identity and what matters in survival, but I don't recall him denying that outcomes can be worse for particular people or in general.\n\nIn fact, in his book \"Reasons and Persons,\" he discusses various thought experiments, like the split-brain cases and teletransportation, to explore what matters in personal identity. In these discussions, he evaluates different possible outcomes and their moral significance.\n\nSo, it's likely that he would agree that outcomes can be worse for particular people and that some outcomes are worse than others in general.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible answer is C: both A and B.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider option D: neither A nor B. This would mean that Parfit claims that it's not possible for an outcome to be worse for a particular person or in general. That seems contrary to his overall approach, which involves evaluating and comparing different possible futures.\n\nHence, D is unlikely.\n\nSo, my conclusion is that the correct answer is C: both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
