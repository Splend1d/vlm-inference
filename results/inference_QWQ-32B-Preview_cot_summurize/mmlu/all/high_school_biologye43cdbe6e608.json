                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which type of selection is described in this scenario with the Swiss starlings and their egg production. So, most starlings produce four to five eggs per clutch, and those that produce fewer or more have reduced fitness. I need to choose the best term from the options: artificial selection, directional selection, stabilizing selection, or disruptive selection.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each type of selection means.\n\nArtificial selection is when humans breed organisms for specific traits. Since this is about starlings in nature, not bred by humans, I think artificial selection isn't the right answer here.\n\nDirectional selection is when there's a favoring of one extreme trait over others. For example, if having more eggs was better, then there would be directional selection for larger clutch sizes. But in this case, it's the opposite\u2014producing fewer or more than four to five eggs reduces fitness. So, directional selection doesn't seem to fit.\n\nStabilizing selection is when the average trait is favored, and extremes are selected against. That sounds a lot like what's happening here. Starlings that produce four to five eggs have higher fitness, while those with fewer or more have lower fitness. So, it's like nature is selecting for the stable, average number of eggs.\n\nDisruptive selection is when extremes are favored over the average. For example, if starlings that produce very few or very many eggs have higher fitness, that would be disruptive selection. But again, in this case, it's the opposite.\n\nSo, comparing these, stabilizing selection seems to be the best fit because it's favoring a stable, intermediate number of eggs per clutch.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about it differently. Is there any chance that artificial selection could be involved here indirectly? For example, if human activities are affecting the starlings' environment and thus their optimal clutch size, could that be considered artificial selection? But the question says \"most Swiss starlings produce four to five eggs in each clutch,\" and those with fewer or more have reduced fitness, which seems like a natural selection process based on environmental constraints, not human intervention.\n\nAlso, I should consider whether there's any trend towards changing the optimal clutch size over time. If the optimal number was shifting towards higher or lower numbers, that might suggest directional selection. But the statement indicates that four to five eggs are consistently the optimal number, with deviations leading to reduced fitness.\n\nMoreover, stabilizing selection is commonly observed in traits like birth weight in humans or, in this case, clutch size in birds, where there's an optimal range for survival and fitness.\n\nSo, overall, I believe stabilizing selection is the correct term to describe this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
