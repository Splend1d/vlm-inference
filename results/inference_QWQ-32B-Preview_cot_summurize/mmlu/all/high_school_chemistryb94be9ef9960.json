                    "text": "So I have this question about burning a copper penny, and I need to figure out which method is the easiest. Let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says to hold the copper penny with crucible tongs and heat it strongly in the flame of a Bunsen burner. I know that Bunsen burners get pretty hot, but I'm not sure if they're hot enough to make copper burn easily.\n\nOption B suggests using an oxyacetylene torch to reach a higher temperature. That sounds really hot\u2014like welding hot. Maybe that would make the copper burn, but is it the easiest way?\n\nOption C is about grinding the penny into dust and spraying it into a Bunsen burner flame. I think increasing the surface area might help the copper burn faster, but I'm not sure if it's easier than just heating the whole penny.\n\nOption D involves dissolving the penny in acid, precipitating the hydroxide, and then heating it in a Bunsen burner flame to make the oxide. That seems like a lot of steps. Is that really easier?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"burning\" a copper penny means. Copper doesn't burn in the same way as wood or paper; it reacts with oxygen to form copper oxide when heated. So, \"burning\" here probably means getting the copper to react with oxygen to form its oxide.\n\nLet me consider the reaction: 2 Cu + O2 -> 2 CuO.\n\nNow, to make this reaction happen easily, I need to provide enough energy to break the bonds and allow the reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate.\n\nOption A: Heating a whole penny with crucible tongs in a Bunsen burner flame. Bunsen burners can get pretty hot, up to around 1,100-1,400\u00b0C, depending on how you adjust the air intake. Copper's melting point is about 1,084\u00b0C, so it won't melt in a Bunsen burner, but it should get hot enough to react with oxygen in the air.\n\nI've seen copper turn black when heated, which is likely the formation of copper oxide. So, this seems possible.\n\nOption B: Using an oxyacetylene torch. These can get up to about 3,500\u00b0C, which is way hotter than a Bunsen burner. That should definitely make the copper react with oxygen, maybe even melt it and produce more copper oxide.\n\nBut is using an oxyacetylene torch easier than a Bunsen burner? Well, oxyacetylene setups are more complex and require handling flammable gases, which might not be as easy or safe as using a Bunsen burner in a lab setting.\n\nOption C: Grinding the penny into dust and spraying it into a Bunsen burner flame. Increasing the surface area should make the reaction faster because more copper is exposed to oxygen.\n\nI recall that in dust explosions, fine particles can burn very rapidly. Maybe the same principle applies here. Spraying copper dust into the flame could cause it to react quickly with oxygen.\n\nThis seems promising, but I'm not sure if it's the easiest method.\n\nOption D: Dissolving the penny in acid, precipitating the hydroxide, and then heating it to make the oxide. This involves several steps:\n\n1. Dissolving copper in acid, which might require heating and could be slow depending on the acid and its concentration.\n\n2. Precipitating the hydroxide by adding a base.\n\n3. Heating the hydroxide to form the oxide.\n\nThis seems like a lot of work compared to just heating the penny directly.\n\nNow, considering ease, I need to think about which method requires the least amount of effort, time, and resources.\n\nOption A seems straightforward: just heat the penny with tongs in the Bunsen burner flame. It's simple and requires minimal preparation.\n\nOption B requires setting up an oxyacetylene torch, which might be more time-consuming and requires more safety precautions.\n\nOption C involves grinding the penny into dust, which takes time and care to avoid inhaling the dust. Then spraying it into the flame could be messy and potentially hazardous if not done carefully.\n\nOption D has multiple steps, each with its own set of procedures and potential complications.\n\nComparing all these, Option A appears to be the easiest because it's the simplest and requires the least number of steps. You just need a Bunsen burner, crucible tongs, and the penny.\n\nBut wait, does copper actually burn easily in a Bunsen burner flame? I recall that copper turns black when heated, which is the formation of copper oxide. So, it does react with oxygen at the temperature of a Bunsen burner.\n\nOption C might be faster because of the increased surface area, but it's more complicated to prepare the copper dust and spray it safely.\n\nOption D is definitely more involved with dissolving and precipitating chemicals.\n\nTherefore, I think Option A is the easiest way to burn a copper penny.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
