And none of them derives his genealogy from his father but, on the contrary, from his maternal uncle. A man does not pass on inheritance except to the sons of his sister to the exclusion of his own sons. . . . They are Muslims keeping to the prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and learning the Qur'an by heart. With regard to their women, they are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers. He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.]. Likewise for the men, there are companions from amongst women outside the prohibited degrees. One of them would enter his house to find his wife with her companion and would not disapprove of that conduct.\n\u2014Adapted from an account by Ibn Battuta of his travels in Mali during the 1300s\nWhat was the likely cause of women not wearing the veil?\n\nA. They were probably rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam.\nB. It was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.\nC. As sexual objects, they were prevented from veiling themselves.\nD. The climate of Mali makes veiling women impractical.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Ibn Battuta's account of his travels in Mali during the 1300s. He mentions several interesting aspects of their society, particularly regarding their social norms and practices related to family and gender. One notable point is that the people he encountered were Muslims who prayed and studied Islamic jurisprudence, yet their practices regarding family structure and women's behavior differed significantly from what might have been expected based on his own cultural background.\n\nThe question is about why women in this society didn't wear the veil. So, I need to consider the options provided and think about which one is most likely given the context.\n\nOption A suggests that they were rebelling against the oppression of women in Islam. But from the passage, it seems that these people were practicing Muslims; they kept to their prayers, studied fiqh, and learned the Quran by heart. So, it's unlikely that they were rebelling against Islamic practices, at least not in a conscious or organized way.\n\nOption B proposes that not veiling was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern. This seems plausible because the passage indicates that there were unique customs regarding family lineage and marriage, such as tracing ancestry through the maternal uncle and inheritance going to the sons of sisters rather than their own sons. These practices suggest a matrilineal or at least matrilocal influence in their culture. It's possible that veiling was not a part of their pre-Islamic culture, and even after adopting Islam, they maintained their traditional practices in this regard.\n\nOption C states that women were sexual objects and were prevented from veiling themselves. This seems somewhat contradictory because if they were sexual objects, one might expect that veiling would be used to control their sexuality, not prevent them from veiling. Moreover, the passage mentions that women were not modest in the presence of men and had companions outside the prohibited degrees of marriage, but it doesn't necessarily imply that they were treated as sexual objects.\n\nOption D suggests that the climate of Mali makes veiling impractical. Mali is indeed a hot and often arid region, and veiling can be uncomfortable in such conditions. However, in many other hot and arid regions where Islam is practiced, veiling is still common, so climate may not be the sole determinant.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most reasonable. The lack of veiling was likely a continuation of preexisting cultural practices that persisted even after the adoption of Islam. The unique family structures and social norms described suggest a distinct cultural context that may have influenced their practices regarding women's attire and behavior.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
