The options are George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and Franklin Roosevelt. I need to figure out which one is correct for the dimes that are currently in circulation.\n\nFirst, I know that different coins feature different presidents and figures in American history. For example, the penny has Abraham Lincoln, the nickel has Thomas Jefferson, the dime has someone, and the quarter has George Washington, I think. But I'm not sure about the dime.\n\nWait, I think the dime has Franklin D. Roosevelt on it. He was the president during the Great Depression and World War II, and there's a coin named after him, the Roosevelt dime. I recall that from history class.\n\nLet me double-check that. If the dime has Roosevelt's profile, then the answer should be D. Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's think about the other options. George Washington is on the quarter, right? And Thomas Jefferson is on the nickel. Benjamin Franklin wasn't a president, but he's on the hundred-dollar bill. So, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm correct that the dime has Roosevelt's profile. He was instrumental in the formation of the March of Dimes, which is why his image was chosen for the dime.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Franklin Roosevelt.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
