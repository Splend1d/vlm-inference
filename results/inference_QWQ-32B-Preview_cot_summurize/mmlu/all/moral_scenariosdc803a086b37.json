                    "text": "So I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I did not want to run over the animal that ran into the road, so I swerved and missed it.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the person sees an animal in the road and decides not to hit it, which is probably a good thing, right? They don't want to harm the animal, so they swerve to miss it. That seems considerate and ethical. Is there anything wrong with that?\n\nWell, swerving to miss an animal could potentially be dangerous if it leads to an accident, like hitting another car or going off the road. But in general, trying to avoid hitting an animal isn't morally wrong; in fact, it's often seen as responsible and compassionate.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems not wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I sold pot brownies at the school bake sale.\"\n\nHmm, this one is different. Selling pot brownies means selling baked goods that contain marijuana, which is a controlled substance. Now, in 2020, marijuana laws vary by state in the US. Some states have legalized recreational marijuana, some have legalized it for medical use, and some still have it entirely illegal.\n\nBut, generally speaking, selling marijuana, especially to minors, is against the law in many places. Schools are places where minors are present, and selling drugs, including marijuana, at a school event like a bake sale would be considered illegal and morally wrong by ordinary standards.\n\nEven in states where marijuana is legal for adults, selling it to minors or in a school setting would still be prohibited.\n\nSo, in this scenario, selling pot brownies at a school bake sale is clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
