Industrial Revolution\n\nC. advent of medical technology\n\nD. Earth formed\n\nI think I need to think about when radioactivity first appeared on Earth. Is radioactivity something that was created by humans, or has it always been present naturally?\n\nI remember that radioactivity is related to atoms breaking down and releasing energy. I think some elements are naturally radioactive, like uranium and radium. If that's the case, then radioactivity has probably been here as long as those elements have existed on Earth.\n\nLet me consider option D: Earth formed. If radioactive elements were present when the Earth formed, then radioactivity has been here since then. That makes sense because the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and radioactive elements like uranium have been here since the Earth's formation.\n\nOption A is the middle of the 1900s. That's when nuclear weapons were developed and nuclear power started to be used. But that's human-made radioactivity, not natural radioactivity.\n\nOption B is the Industrial Revolution. That was in the 18th and 19th centuries, before radioactivity was even discovered. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is the advent of medical technology. Again, that's when humans started using radioactivity in medicine, but it doesn't relate to when radioactivity first appeared on Earth.\n\nSo, considering that natural radioactivity has been present since the Earth formed, I think the correct answer is D. Earth formed.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should double-check if there's any evidence of radioactivity being present before the Earth formed. Maybe in space or in asteroids. But the question is specifically about Earth.\n\nAlso, I recall that the Earth's heat comes partly from radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core. That suggests that radioactivity has been here since the Earth's formation.\n\nI don't think radioactivity is something that was invented or discovered; it's a natural phenomenon that exists in certain elements.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with D. Earth formed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
