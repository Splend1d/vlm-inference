                    "text": "So I have this chemistry problem here. It says to find the net ionic equation when solutions of NH4Br and AgNO3 are mixed together. There are four options provided, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a net ionic equation is. I remember that it's the equation that shows only the reacting species in their ion forms, excluding the spectator ions. So, I need to write the ionic equations for both compounds, identify the precipitate or reaction that occurs, and then simplify by removing the spectator ions.\n\nAlright, let's start by writing the molecular equation for the reaction between NH4Br and AgNO3. NH4Br is ammonium bromide, and AgNO3 is silver nitrate. When these two solutions are mixed, they will likely undergo a double displacement reaction, where the cations and anions switch partners.\n\nSo, the molecular equation would be:\n\nNH4Br(aq) + AgNO3(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + AgBr(s)\n\nWait, why is AgBr a solid? Oh, because silver bromide is insoluble in water; it precipitates out of the solution. That's important because in net ionic equations, we show precipitates or other products that are not in solution.\n\nNow, I need to write the complete ionic equation by breaking down the soluble ionic compounds into their ions.\n\nNH4+(aq) + Br-(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4+(aq) + NO3-(aq) + AgBr(s)\n\nOkay, now I need to identify the spectator ions. Spectator ions are those that appear on both sides of the equation without changing. Here, NH4+ and NO3- are present on both sides, so they are spectators.\n\nSo, removing the spectator ions, the net ionic equation should be:\n\nBr-(aq) + Ag+(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s)\n\nLooking back at the options, that matches option A.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another reaction possible.\n\nOption B suggests NH4+(aq) + Ag+(aq) \u2192 Ag(NH4)3+2(aq). I'm not sure about this. I know that ammonia can form complexes with silver ions, but is NH4+ directly reacting with Ag+? I think NH4+ might not directly react with Ag+ in this way.\n\nOption C has Br-(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NO3Br(aq). That doesn't make sense because bromide and nitrate ions don't typically react with each other in solution.\n\nOption D is NH4Br(aq) + NO3-(aq) \u2192 NH4NO3(aq) + Br-(aq). This seems like it's trying to show the formation of ammonium nitrate, but it's not balanced properly, and it includes Br- on both sides.\n\nSo, again, option A seems to be the correct net ionic equation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should confirm the solubility of the compounds involved. NH4Br is soluble in water, as are most ammonium salts. AgNO3 is also soluble. NH4NO3 is soluble, and AgBr is insoluble, which is why it precipitates.\n\nTherefore, the reaction primarily involves the formation of the insoluble AgBr, and the net ionic equation is indeed Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq) \u2192 AgBr(s).\n\nSo, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
