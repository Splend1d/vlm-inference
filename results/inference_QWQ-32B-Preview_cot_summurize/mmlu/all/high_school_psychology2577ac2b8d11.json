The options are cognitive, evolutionary, humanistic, or psychodynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what each of these psychological approaches focuses on.\n\nCognitive psychology is about how we think, remember, and solve problems. It's more about mental processes and brain functions.\n\nEvolutionary psychology looks at how our behaviors and mental processes have been shaped by evolution over time. It suggests that many of our behaviors are adaptive strategies to help us survive and reproduce.\n\nHumanistic psychology is all about personal growth, self-actualization, and positive human values. It focuses on the individual's potential and freedom to choose.\n\nPsychodynamic psychology, based on Freud's ideas, emphasizes the role of unconscious processes and early childhood experiences in shaping behavior and personality.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the type that says a key motivation is to spread genetic material, that sounds a lot like evolution and reproduction, which is central to evolutionary psychology.\n\nCognitive psychology doesn't really focus on genetic propagation; it's more about thinking and perception.\n\nHumanistic psychology is more about self-fulfillment and less about biological drives.\n\nPsychodynamic psychology does talk about instincts, but it's more about unconscious conflicts and drives like sex and aggression, not specifically about spreading genetic material.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be evolutionary psychology.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. Evolutionary psychology directly relates behavior to evolutionary advantages, including reproduction. So, the desire to spread genetic material would be a fundamental concept in this field.\n\nYes, I think B. evolutionary is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
