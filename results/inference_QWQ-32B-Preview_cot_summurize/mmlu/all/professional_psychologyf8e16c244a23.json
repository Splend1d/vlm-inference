                    "text": "So I've got this question about Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), and it's asking which step is incorrectly defined by a young, inexperienced therapist. The options are A, B, C, and D, each describing different aspects of SIT. I need to figure out which one is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what SIT is all about. SIT is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy developed by Donald Meichenbaum. It's designed to help people build resilience and cope better with stress by teaching them specific skills and changing their thought patterns.\n\nSIT typically involves three main phases:\n\n1. **Skills Acquisition**: This is where clients learn new coping skills, such as relaxation techniques, assertiveness, and cognitive restructuring.\n\n2. **Cognitive Preparation**: Here, clients are educated about stress and how their thoughts can influence their stress levels. They learn to identify and challenge negative thoughts.\n\n3. **Application and Practice**: Clients practice using these skills in real-life situations or through imagination, often starting with less stressful scenarios and gradually moving to more challenging ones.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. **PRACTICE** \u2192 applies learning to real or imagined situations done on a gradual basis.\n\nThis sounds right. It matches the application and practice phase where skills are applied gradually in real or imagined stressful situations.\n\nB. **SKILLS ACQUISITION** \u2192 learning relaxation, self-statements, escape routes not necessary with rehearsing them.\n\nThis seems off. In SIT, rehearsing the skills is actually a crucial part of skills acquisition. Meichenbaum emphasizes the importance of not only learning the skills but also practicing and rehearsing them to ensure they can be used effectively when needed. So, saying that escape routes are not necessary with rehearsing them doesn't align with the standard SIT approach.\n\nC. **COGNITION PREPARATION** \u2192 education on how faulty cognitions prevent adaptive coping.\n\nThis is similar to the cognitive preparation phase, where clients are educated about the role of cognitions in stress and coping. The term \"cognition preparation\" might not be standard, but the concept seems accurate.\n\nD. **SKILLS ACQUISITION** \u2192 learning and rehearsing new skills relaxation, self-statements, escape routes.\n\nThis is consistent with the skills acquisition phase in SIT. Learning and rehearsing skills like relaxation techniques, positive self-statements, and problem-solving strategies are central to this phase.\n\nSo, comparing these, option B seems to be incorrectly defined because it suggests that escape routes are not necessary with rehearsing them, which contradicts the emphasis in SIT on rehearsing skills to ensure they can be effectively applied.\n\nI think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
