                    "text": "Let's see. I need to pick the statement that best fits with a capitalist market economy. First, I should remember what capitalism is all about. Capitalism is an economic system where private individuals or businesses own and operate the means of production and distribution of goods and services, operating for profit, and where investments, distribution, income, prices and commodities are determined by markets and supply and demand.\n\nOption A says: \"Economic resources are allocated according to the decisions of the central bank.\" Hmm, in capitalism, the central bank does play a role, like controlling money supply and interest rates, but the allocation of economic resources is mainly driven by market forces\u2014supply and demand, not directly by the central bank. So, this doesn't seem like the best fit.\n\nOption B: \"Private property is fundamental to innovation, growth, and trade.\" This sounds right. In capitalism, private property rights are crucial because they encourage people to invest, innovate, and engage in trade knowing that they own the fruits of their labor and can profit from it.\n\nOption C: \"A central government plans the production and distribution of goods.\" Wait, that sounds more like socialism or a planned economy, not capitalism. In capitalism, production and distribution are primarily coordinated through the market, not through central planning.\n\nOption D: \"Most wages and prices are legally controlled.\" Again, this isn't typical of capitalism. In a capitalist system, wages and prices are usually determined by the market, through the interaction of supply and demand. Government may have some regulations, but in general, market forces set prices and wages.\n\nSo, comparing all these, option B seems to align best with the principles of capitalism. Private property is indeed fundamental in capitalism as it incentivizes economic activity and development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
