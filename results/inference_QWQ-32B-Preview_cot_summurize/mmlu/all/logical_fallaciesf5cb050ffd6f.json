Drawing a conclusion by applying irrelevant criteria to a subject.\n\nC. Substituting individual stories for a larger sample as support for a claim.\n\nD. Arguing that something must be good because it is new, or must be bad because it is old.\n\nHmm, I think \"_ad novitatem_\" has something to do with newness or novelty. Let me think about this.\n\nOption A sounds like a hasty generalization, where you assume that what's true for a few is true for all. That doesn't seem related to newness.\n\nOption B is about applying irrelevant criteria, which might be a different type of fallacy, maybe _ignoratio elenchi_ or something like that.\n\nOption C seems like an anecdotal fallacy, where you use specific instances instead of a broader, more representative sample.\n\nOption D mentions newness and oldness, which sounds promising. \"_Ad novitatem_\" seems to relate to novelty, so maybe it's about assuming something is good just because it's new, or bad because it's old.\n\nLet me look up \"_ad novitatem_\" to confirm.\n\nOkay, according to some logic and fallacies resources, \"_ad novitatem_\" is indeed a fallacy that involves assuming that something is better or more useful simply because it is new, or conversely, that something is worse or less useful because it is old.\n\nSo, it's about valuing newness over other qualities, or dismissing something based on its age alone, without considering its actual merits.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to match this description: \"arguing that something must be good because it is new, or must be bad because it is old.\"\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other terms or variations I should be aware of.\n\nI see that sometimes this fallacy is also referred to as the \"appeal to novelty\" or \"novelty bias.\" It's similar to other \"ad\" fallacies, like _ad antiquitatem_, which is the opposite, favoring something because it's old or traditional.\n\nSo, in summary, \"_ad novitatem_\" is about making judgments based on the newness or oldness of something, rather than its actual qualities or effectiveness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
