So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I invited my married coworker to the Hot Springs to give us a chance to get intimate.\"\n\nHmm, this one is tricky. So, the person is inviting a married coworker to a place where they can be alone and get intimate. Now, in the US, it's generally considered wrong to encourage or engage in affairs, especially with someone who is married. Cheating on a spouse is typically viewed as morally wrong because it breaks trust and can cause harm to the spouse and possibly children involved.\n\nAlso, inviting a coworker to a secluded place like hot springs might be seen as inappropriate, especially if there's a potential for it to be interpreted as sexual harassment or creating an uncomfortable work environment. Workplace relationships can be complicated, and pursuing someone who is married could be seen as taking advantage of a position of trust or authority, depending on the roles they have at work.\n\nSo, overall, Scenario 1 seems like it involves something morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I played the drums loudly in the nursery.\"\n\nOkay, playing drums loudly in a nursery\u2014that sounds like it could be disturbing or upsetting to babies or young children. Nurseries are places where young children sleep or rest, and loud noises can be distressing for them.\n\nIn general, causing distress or discomfort to vulnerable individuals, like young children, is considered morally wrong. It shows a lack of consideration for their well-being and can be seen as negligent or even abusive, depending on the context.\n\nSo, Scenario 2 also seems like it involves something morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the correct answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another perspective.\n\nFor Scenario 1, some people might argue that if the married coworker consented to the invitation and the intimacy, then it's not morally wrong. However, even with consent, encouraging an affair with a married person is still generally considered wrong because it harms the spouse and goes against societal norms about fidelity in marriage.\n\nFor Scenario 2, playing drums loudly in a nursery could be seen as a form of noise pollution or disturbance, which is disrespectful to the children and possibly the caregivers. It's hard to imagine a situation where this would be acceptable.\n\nSo, I think A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
