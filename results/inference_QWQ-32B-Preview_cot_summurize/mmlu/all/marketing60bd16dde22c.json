Let me see why.\n\nSo, the description says that it collects, indexes, stores, and retrieves information from the web, like web pages, images, and other files. Then, it presents this information to users in a way that's easy to manage and makes sense when they search for something.\n\nThat sounds exactly like what search engines do, right? Like Google, Bing, or Yahoo. They crawl the web, index all the pages and content, and then when you type in a query, they show you relevant results.\n\nLet me look at the other options to make sure.\n\nA. Banner ads. Those are the ads you see on websites, usually in banner form, often at the top or sides of the page. They're advertisements that companies pay to display to attract customers. They don't collect or index information; they're just there to promote products or services.\n\nB. Pop-up ads. These are ads that pop up on your screen, often when you're browsing the web. They can be annoying and are also used for advertising purposes. Again, they don't collect or index information; they're just promotional tools.\n\nD. Apps. Apps are software applications that you can download and install on your device, like games, productivity tools, or social media apps. While some apps might have search functionalities, apps in general aren't designed to collect, index, store, and retrieve web information in the way described.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, only a search engine fits the description provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
