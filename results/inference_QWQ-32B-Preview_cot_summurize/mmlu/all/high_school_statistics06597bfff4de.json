                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about technical writers' salaries in a metropolitan region. It says that the salaries are approximately normally distributed with a mean of $55,800, and the first quartile is $48,815. I need to find the standard deviation from this information. The options are A) $6,984, B) $10,356, C) $10,476, and D) $13,968.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what a quartile is in a normal distribution. The first quartile, or Q1, is the value below which 25% of the data falls. In other words, 25% of the salaries are below $48,815 in this case.\n\nSince the data is normally distributed, I can use the properties of the normal distribution to find the standard deviation. I know that in a standard normal distribution, the z-score corresponds to the number of standard deviations away from the mean.\n\nSo, I need to find the z-score that corresponds to the first quartile in a standard normal distribution. I can look this up in a z-table or use the invNorm function on a calculator if I have one.\n\nLet me think about this. The first quartile is at the 25th percentile, so I need the z-score for p = 0.25.\n\nLooking at a standard normal distribution table, I find that the z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately -0.674. This makes sense because the mean is at z = 0, and the first quartile is below the mean.\n\nNow, the formula to convert a raw score to a z-score is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\n\n- z is the z-score\n\n- X is the raw score (in this case, the first quartile, $48,815)\n\n- \u03bc is the mean ($55,800)\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation (which I'm trying to find)\n\nSo, plugging in the values I have:\n\n-0.674 = ($48,815 - $55,800) / \u03c3\n\nNow, I can solve for \u03c3.\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between the first quartile and the mean:\n\n$48,815 - $55,800 = -$6,985\n\nSo:\n\n-0.674 = -6,985 / \u03c3\n\nNow, multiply both sides by \u03c3 to get:\n\n-0.674 * \u03c3 = -6,985\n\nThen, divide both sides by -0.674 to solve for \u03c3:\n\n\u03c3 = -6,985 / -0.674\n\n\u03c3 \u2248 10,363.49\n\nHmm, that's close to option B) $10,356.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the difference between the first quartile and the mean:\n\n$48,815 - $55,800 = -$6,985\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, the z-score for the first quartile is -0.674.\n\nSo, z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\n-0.674 = -6,985 / \u03c3\n\nThen, \u03c3 = -6,985 / -0.674\n\nCalculating that again: 6,985 divided by 0.674.\n\nLet me do the division step by step.\n\n6,985 \u00f7 0.674\n\nFirst, I can multiply both numerator and denominator by 1,000 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n6,985,000 \u00f7 674\n\nNow, 674 goes into 6,985,000 how many times?\n\nLet's see:\n\n674 * 10,000 = 6,740,000\n\nSubtract that from 6,985,000: 6,985,000 - 6,740,000 = 245,000\n\nNow, 674 goes into 245,000 how many times?\n\n674 * 363 = 244,482\n\nSubtract that from 245,000: 245,000 - 244,482 = 518\n\nSo, 674 * 10,363 = 6,985,000 - 244,482 = 6,740,518\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Maybe I should use a calculator for this division.\n\nUsing a calculator: 6,985 \u00f7 0.674 \u2248 10,363.49\n\nYes, that's what I got earlier.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) $6,984\n\nB) $10,356\n\nC) $10,476\n\nD) $13,968\n\nMy calculation gives approximately $10,363, which is very close to option B) $10,356.\n\nMaybe there was a slight difference in the z-score I used. Maybe I should check the z-score for the first quartile more precisely.\n\nLooking back at the z-table, the exact z-score for the 25th percentile is -0.6744897501960817\n\nUsing this more precise value:\n\nz = -0.6744897501960817\n\nSo, \u03c3 = -6,985 / -0.6744897501960817 \u2248 10,356.00\n\nAh, now it matches option B) $10,356 exactly.\n\nI must have rounded the z-score too early, which caused the slight discrepancy.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B) $10,356.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
