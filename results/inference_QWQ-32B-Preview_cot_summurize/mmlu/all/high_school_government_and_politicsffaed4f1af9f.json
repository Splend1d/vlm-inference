Speaker of the House, C. Congressional Management Foundation Chair, and D. Minority Whip. I need to figure out which one among these is not a special position in Congress.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these positions entails and whether they are official roles within Congress or not.\n\nStarting with option A, the President pro tempore. I know that in the Senate, the President pro tempore is a significant position. It's usually held by the most senior senator in the majority party, and the position comes with a lot of responsibilities, including presiding over the Senate in the absence of the Vice President. So, that seems like a special position in Congress.\n\nOption B is the Speaker of the House. That's the leader of the House of Representatives. The Speaker is elected by the members of the House and plays a crucial role in setting the legislative agenda and managing the legislative process. Definitely a special position in Congress.\n\nOption C is the Congressional Management Foundation Chair. Hmm, I'm not as familiar with this one. The Congressional Management Foundation sounds like an organization that provides resources and training for congressional staff, but I don't recall if there's a specific chair position within Congress related to this foundation. Maybe this is not a position held by a member of Congress.\n\nOption D is the Minority Whip. In both the House and the Senate, there are whips for the majority and minority parties. The whip's role is to help party leaders count votes and ensure that party members vote as the party leadership desires. So, that's definitely a special position in Congress.\n\nGiven this, it seems like the Congressional Management Foundation Chair might not be a position held by a member of Congress. To confirm, I should look up what the Congressional Management Foundation is and see if it has any official connection to congressional positions.\n\nUpon a quick search, the Congressional Management Foundation appears to be an independent organization that works to improve the effectiveness of Congress by providing training and resources to congressional staff. It doesn't seem to have any official positions within Congress itself. Therefore, it's unlikely that there's a \"Chair\" position within Congress related to this foundation.\n\nSo, based on this information, I would say that option C, the Congressional Management Foundation Chair, is not a special position held by a member of Congress.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
