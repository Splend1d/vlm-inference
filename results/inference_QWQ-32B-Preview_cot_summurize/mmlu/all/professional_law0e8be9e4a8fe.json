                    "text": "Let's dive into this real estate conundrum. So, we've got a buyer and a man who've been negotiating for months to buy a tract of land. Finally, on August 18, 2009, they sign a real estate sales contract where the man agrees to convey \"good and marketable title\" to the buyer 60 days from the date of the contract, which would be around October 17, 2009. The purchase price is set at $175,000.\n\nFast forward to October 11, 2009, before the scheduled closing date. The buyer calls the man and mentions that his title search shows a third party is the owner of record for the property. The man assures the buyer that he's been in adverse possession of the property for 21 years, and the jurisdiction's statutory period for adverse possession is 20 years. The next day, the buyer confirms that indeed, the man has been in adverse possession for 21 years.\n\nCome closing day, the man tenders a deed as per the sales contract, but the buyer refuses to pay the purchase price or take possession, arguing that the man can't convey \"good and marketable title.\" Now, the man sues the buyer for specific performance. The question is: will the man prevail?\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what \"good and marketable title\" means. Generally, it means that the seller has the legal right to sell the property and that the title is free from significant defects that would deter a reasonable buyer from purchasing it. In this case, the buyer is contesting the title because the man is not the record owner, and he's relying on adverse possession to claim title.\n\nAdverse possession is a legal concept where a person can acquire title to land by occupying it openly, continuously, and exclusively for a statutory period, which in this jurisdiction is 20 years. The man has been in adverse possession for 21 years, which meets and exceeds the requirement.\n\nSo, option A says the man will prevail because he has obtained \"good and marketable title\" by adverse possession. Is this correct?\n\nWell, adverse possession can indeed ripen into full ownership after the statutory period. If the man has met all the elements of adverse possession\u2014open, notorious, exclusive, continuous, and hostile occupation for 20 years\u2014he should have good and marketable title. However, there might be some caveats, especially regarding any potential equities or liens that could attach to the title.\n\nOption B suggests that the man will prevail because his action for specific performance is an action in rem, and the third party isn't a necessary party. An action in rem is one that affects the rights of all persons, not just a specific individual. However, specific performance is typically an action in personam, meaning it's against a specific person (here, the buyer) to compel them to perform their contractual obligations. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C states that the man won't prevail because an adverse possessor takes title subject to an equitable lien from the dispossessed owner. Hmm, is there such a thing?\n\nIn some jurisdictions, when an adverse possessor takes title, they might be subject to an equitable lien for improvements made by the previous owner. However, in this scenario, the man has been in possession for 21 years, and the third party is the record owner. It's not specified if there are any improvements or equities that would create a lien. So, this might not directly apply here.\n\nOption D says the man won't prevail because the buyer cannot be required to buy a lawsuit, even if the probability is great that the buyer would prevail against the man. This seems to suggest that the buyer shouldn't be forced to purchase the property if doing so would entangle them in litigation with the third-party record owner.\n\nBut, in reality, if the man has valid title through adverse possession, there shouldn't be any pending lawsuit or litigation for the buyer to get entangled in. The adverse possession should have extinguished the record owner's rights.\n\nWait a minute, but the buyer is hesitant because the record shows someone else as the owner. The man is assuring the buyer that he has title via adverse possession, and the buyer has confirmed that the man has been in possession for 21 years.\n\nSo, in law, once the statutory period for adverse possession is met, the adverse possessor gains legal title to the property, supplanting the record owner's title. Therefore, the man should have good and marketable title.\n\nBut, perhaps there's a catch. Maybe the third party has some equitable interests that could make the title unmarketable. However, generally speaking, after adverse possession, the adverse possessor's title is superior.\n\nGiven that, option A seems plausible. The man should prevail because he has obtained good and marketable title through adverse possession.\n\nOption B is incorrect because specific performance is not an action in rem.\n\nOption C might not apply here since there's no mention of equities or liens from the dispossessed owner.\n\nOption D is also not convincing because, if the man's title is valid, the buyer isn't buying a lawsuit; they're buying property with clear title.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A: the man will prevail because he has obtained good and marketable title by adverse possession.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors that might affect this conclusion.\n\nPerhaps the buyer is concerned about the costs or risks associated with defending the adverse possession claim, even if the man's title is valid. But, in theory, once the statutory period is met, the adverse possessor has title, and any subsequent purchaser should be protected.\n\nAdditionally, the contract specifies that the man agrees to convey good and marketable title 60 days from the contract date. If, at the time of closing, the man has satisfied all legal requirements to have good and marketable title, then he should be able to fulfill his contractual obligation.\n\nTherefore, in an action for specific performance, the man should prevail because he has met the conditions to have good and marketable title through adverse possession.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
