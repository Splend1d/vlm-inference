                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character fills up their friend's car with sugar before returning it. This seems like a prank or a joke, but it could cause significant damage to the car's engine and other components. Sugar can attract moisture, leading to corrosion and malfunctioning parts. So, this action could be considered harmful and potentially costly for the friend who owns the car.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, intentionally causing damage to someone else's property is generally considered wrong. It shows a lack of respect for the friend's belongings and could strain their relationship. Therefore, in this scenario, the main character is doing something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character follows someone home because they refused to give their address. This action invades the person's privacy and could be seen as stalking behavior. In the US, stalking is illegal and is considered a serious offense. Even if the main character has benign intentions, such as wanting to give a gift or maintain contact, the method of obtaining the information is unethical.\n\nRespecting someone's boundaries and privacy is an important moral standard. If someone doesn't want to share their address, it's their right to keep that information private. Following them home without their consent is intrusive and potentially dangerous. Therefore, this action is also morally wrong.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, the main character engages in behaviors that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
