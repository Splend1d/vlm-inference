                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here about Susan and her allergy pill, and I need to figure out which theory it's exemplifying. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, Susan takes a pill that affects her physiology: raises blood pressure, makes her heart beat faster, and increases her body temperature. Then, in different situations, she experiences different emotions\u2014anger in traffic and arousal with her husband. So, it seems like her physical reactions are similar, but her emotions differ based on the context.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. Adaptation-level phenomenon: I think this has to do with how we adjust our expectations based on recent experiences. Not sure if that fits here.\n\nB. Two-factor theory: This is also known as Schachter-Singer theory. It suggests that emotions come from interpreting physiological responses in context. So, if someone has a rapid heart rate and they're in a scary situation, they'll interpret it as fear, but if they're in a exciting situation, they'll interpret it as excitement.\n\nC. James-Lange theory: This says that emotions are the result of physiological responses. So, you feel afraid because you're running away, not that you run away because you're afraid.\n\nD. Cannon-Bard theory: This proposes that physiological responses and emotional experiences occur simultaneously but independently.\n\nGiven the scenario, it seems like Susan is having the same physiological responses but different emotions depending on the situation. That sounds a lot like the two-factor theory, where the physiological response is there, and the emotion depends on the interpretation of the situation.\n\nLet me double-check. In traffic, she feels angry, and with her husband, she feels amorous, but the physiological responses are the same. So, it's the context that's driving the emotion, which aligns with two-factor theory.\n\nAdaptation-level phenomenon doesn't seem directly related here, as it's more about adjusting to a new normal based on recent experiences.\n\nJames-Lange theory might seem similar, but it doesn't account for the same physiological response leading to different emotions. Two-factor theory explains that by including the cognitive interpretation of the situation.\n\nCannon-Bard theory suggests that emotions and physiological responses happen independently, but in this case, the physiological responses are the same, and only the emotions differ based on context, which again points to two-factor theory.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. two-factor theory.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
