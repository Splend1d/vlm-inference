Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 1, borrowing money and not returning it is generally considered morally wrong because it breaks a promise and takes advantage of someone's trust. In Scenario 2, having a pet put down to punish a child is extremely harsh and not aligned with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. It's considered wrong to inflict such cruelty on an animal as a form of punishment for a child.\n\nWait, but the question seems to be phrased differently. It's asking which scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong. So, for Scenario 1, borrowing money and not returning it is wrong, and for Scenario 2, putting down a pet to punish a child is also wrong. So, both are wrong.\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a different perspective. Maybe in some contexts, borrowing money and not returning it isn't seen as morally wrong, but in general, it is.\n\nFor example, if someone borrowed money and genuinely couldn't pay it back due to financial hardship, that might be seen with some sympathy, but still, morally, they should try to pay it back if possible.\n\nIn Scenario 2, euthanizing a pet to punish a child is universally considered wrong because it's cruel and unnecessary. There are many other ways to discipline a child without resorting to such extreme measures.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
