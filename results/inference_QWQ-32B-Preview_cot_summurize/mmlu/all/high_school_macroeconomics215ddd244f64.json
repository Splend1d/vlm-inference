                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the aggregate supply curves in economics. So, we're trying to understand the key difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves, specifically focusing on how nominal wages respond to changes in the price level.\n\nFirst off, it's important to recall what aggregate supply represents. It's the total quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to produce at different price levels. Now, the behavior of firms and workers in the short run versus the long run differs, mainly due to how flexible prices and wages are in these time frames.\n\nIn the short run, some prices and wages may be sticky\u2014they don't adjust immediately to changes in the economy. This stickiness can cause the short-run aggregate supply curve to have a particular shape. On the other hand, in the long run, prices and wages are more flexible and adjust to changes in the economy, leading to a different shape for the long-run aggregate supply curve.\n\nOption A states that short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping because nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes. But wait, if wages adjust quickly to price levels, that sounds more like long-run behavior, where economy reaches its full potential output regardless of the price level. So, this might not be accurate.\n\nOption B says that long-run aggregate supply is upward sloping because nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes. Again, if wages adjust quickly, firms would adjust their production based on the real cost of labor, which should lead to a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve at the economy's potential output, not an upward sloping one.\n\nOption C claims that short-run aggregate supply is vertical because nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes. This seems contradictory because if wages are adjusting quickly, it should be characteristic of the long run, not the short run. In the short run, we expect some wage stickiness, which allows for an upward sloping short-run aggregate supply curve.\n\nOption D states that short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping because nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes. This aligns with what I recall from economics. In the short run, wages are sticky and don't adjust immediately to price level changes. As a result, when the price level rises, firms can sell their goods at higher prices without immediately facing higher labor costs, leading them to produce more. Hence, the upward slope.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about what happens in the long run. In the long run, wages and other input prices adjust fully to the price level changes. So, if the price level increases, wages also increase proportionally, leaving the real wage and thus the quantity of output unchanged. This is why the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical at the economy's potential output.\n\nTherefore, the key difference is indeed that in the short run, nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes, leading to an upward sloping short-run aggregate supply curve, whereas in the long run, wages do adjust, resulting in a vertical long-run aggregate supply curve.\n\nSo, the best answer is D: Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
