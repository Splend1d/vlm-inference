                    "text": "Let's see. So, the question is: if the volume of an object doubles, with no change in mass, what happens to its density? The options are A. halve, B. double, C. be the same, D. none of these.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for density. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. So, density equals mass divided by volume. That is, \\(\\rho = \\frac{m}{v}\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is density, \\(m\\) is mass, and \\(v\\) is volume.\n\nNow, in this scenario, the mass remains constant, but the volume doubles. So, if volume \\(v\\) becomes \\(2v\\), and mass \\(m\\) stays the same, then the new density \\(\\rho'\\) would be \\(\\rho' = \\frac{m}{2v}\\).\n\nComparing the new density to the original density:\n\n\\[\n\\rho' = \\frac{m}{2v} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{m}{v} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho\n\\]\n\nSo, the new density is half of the original density.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. halve.\n\nTo make sure, let me think about it another way. Density is mass per unit volume. If the volume increases while the mass stays the same, there's less mass per unit volume, so the density should decrease. Specifically, if volume doubles, the density should halve.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of units. If mass is in kilograms and volume is in cubic meters, then density is in kilograms per cubic meter. If volume doubles, the denominator in the density formula doubles, so the overall value halves.\n\nI don't think any other option makes sense in this context. Doubling the volume with constant mass shouldn't cause the density to double or stay the same. So, options B and C are incorrect. And since option A correctly describes the relationship, option D, \"none of these,\" isn't necessary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. halve.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
