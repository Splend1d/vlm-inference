                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the total number of shirts in a store. The store has 3 boxes, and each box contains 4 packages, with 7 shirts in each package. The expression given is 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7), which makes sense because first you find the total number of shirts in one box by multiplying the number of packages by the number of shirts per package, and then multiply that by the number of boxes.\n\nSo, 4 packages times 7 shirts per package equals 28 shirts per box, and then 3 boxes times 28 shirts per box equals 84 shirts in total.\n\nNow, the question is asking for another expression that can also be used to find the total number of shirts. The options are:\n\nA. 12 \u00d7 3\n\nB. 12 \u00d7 7\n\nC. 28 \u00d7 4\n\nD. 28 \u00d7 7\n\nLet me think about this. Maybe I can rearrange the way I multiply these numbers and still get the same total.\n\nFirst, let's look at the original expression: 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7). According to the associative property of multiplication, I can group the numbers differently without changing the product. So, another way to write this could be (3 \u00d7 4) \u00d7 7.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 equals 12, and then 12 \u00d7 7 equals 84. That's the same as before.\n\nSo, option B is 12 \u00d7 7, which matches this rearrangement. That seems like a valid alternative expression.\n\nLet me check option A: 12 \u00d7 3.\n\nIf I multiply 12 \u00d7 3, I get 36, which is not the total number of shirts. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption C is 28 \u00d7 4.\n\nWe already know that 4 \u00d7 7 is 28, and then multiplying by 3 gives 84. But if I take 28 \u00d7 4, that would be 112, which is more than the total number of shirts. So, that doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D is 28 \u00d7 7.\n\n28 \u00d7 7 is 196, which is even more than 112 and definitely not the total number of shirts.\n\nSo, the only option that makes sense and gives the correct total is option B, 12 \u00d7 7.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps I can think about the total number of packages first. There are 3 boxes, each with 4 packages, so total packages are 3 \u00d7 4 equals 12. Then, each package has 7 shirts, so total shirts are 12 \u00d7 7 equals 84. That's the same as option B.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the number of shirts per box, which is 4 \u00d7 7 equals 28, and then multiply by the number of boxes, which is 3, that's 28 \u00d7 3 equals 84. But 28 \u00d7 3 is not one of the options.\n\nSo, again, option B seems to be the correct choice.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose I consider the total number of packages, which is 12, and multiply that by the number of boxes, which is 3, that would be 12 \u00d7 3 equals 36, but that doesn't make sense because it's not the total number of shirts. So, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, if I take the number of shirts per package, which is 7, and multiply by the number of boxes, which is 3, that's 7 \u00d7 3 equals 21, and then multiply by the number of packages per box, which is 4, that's 21 \u00d7 4 equals 84. But that's not one of the options.\n\nHowever, this is similar to option B, because 12 \u00d7 7 is the same as 7 \u00d7 12, and 7 \u00d7 12 is the same as 7 \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 4), which is the same as (7 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 4 equals 21 \u00d7 4 equals 84.\n\nSo, regardless of the way I group them, it seems like option B is the correct alternative expression.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there a way that option C could make sense? 28 \u00d7 4 equals 112, which is not the total number of shirts, so no.\n\nOption D, 28 \u00d7 7 equals 196, which is also not the total.\n\nOption A, 12 \u00d7 3 equals 36, which is not the total.\n\nTherefore, the only correct choice is option B, 12 \u00d7 7.\n\nWait, but let's think about what 12 represents in this context. 12 is the total number of packages, since there are 3 boxes with 4 packages each, so 3 \u00d7 4 equals 12. Then, multiplying by 7, which is the number of shirts per package, gives the total number of shirts, which is 12 \u00d7 7 equals 84.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, to confirm, the original expression is 3 \u00d7 (4 \u00d7 7), which equals 3 \u00d7 28 equals 84.\n\nOption B is 12 \u00d7 7, which is the total number of packages times the number of shirts per package, also equaling 84.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 12 \u00d7 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
