So, we're looking at four options and need to figure out which one isn't an obvious benefit of adopting a critical approach. Let's examine each option carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"A more critical approach to military security studies will allow the inclusion or adoption of non-realist paradigms, such as social constructivism.\" Now, critical theories in security studies often challenge the traditional realist perspectives that focus on state power and international anarchy. By being critical, scholars can explore alternative paradigms like social constructivism, which looks at how identities and norms shape state behavior. So, this seems like a clear benefit of a critical approach.\n\nMoving on to Option B: \"Critical analysis of military security will draw attention back to traditional conceptions of the state-centric paradigm which have been neglected in recent years, with states favoring human security and other non-traditional approaches instead.\" Hmm, this one is interesting because it suggests that a critical approach would revisit traditional state-centric views. But, generally, critical theories aim to question and sometimes dismantle these traditional views, not necessarily to revive them. So, this seems a bit counterintuitive. Maybe this is the option that's not an obvious benefit?\n\nOption C states: \"By implementing a critical analysis, we can recognize that traditional conceptions of military security are no longer always salient and may need to be reconsidered.\" This aligns well with critical theories, which often argue that traditional notions may not be adequate in the face of new security challenges. So, this seems like a beneficial aspect of adopting a critical approach.\n\nLastly, Option D: \"A critical approach would recognize the changing ontology of security in the real world. Such changes are evident in the new ways in which war has been conducted in the 20th and 21st centuries.\" This makes sense because critical theories emphasize the need to understand security in its contemporary context, acknowledging that what constitutes a threat and how conflicts are waged have evolved over time.\n\nComparing all these options, Option B stands out as the one that doesn't seem to align with the typical benefits of a critical approach. While the other options talk about incorporating new paradigms, reconsidering traditional concepts, and recognizing changes in security, Option B suggests that a critical approach would bring back traditional state-centric views that have been somewhat neglected. This seems contrary to what critical theories usually aim to do, which is to question and go beyond those traditional perspectives.\n\nTherefore, I think Option B is the correct answer to this question, as it's not an obvious benefit of adopting a critical theoretical approach in military security studies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
