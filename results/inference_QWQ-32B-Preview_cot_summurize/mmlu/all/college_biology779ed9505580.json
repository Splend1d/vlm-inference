                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which characteristic makes angiosperms different from gymnosperms. I know both are types of seed plants, but they have some key differences.\n\nFirst, option A is \"perennial growth.\" I think both angiosperms and gymnosperms can be perennial, meaning they live for more than two years. So, I don't think this is the distinguishing feature.\n\nOption B is \"true roots.\" I believe both groups have true roots. Gymnosperms and angiosperms are both vascular plants, and they both develop true roots, stems, and leaves. So, this probably isn't the answer either.\n\nOption C is \"apical growth.\" I think apical growth refers to growth that occurs at the tips of shoots and roots. Again, both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibit apical growth, so this doesn't seem to be the distinguishing characteristic.\n\nOption D is \"seeds enclosed in ovaries.\" Now, this sounds familiar. Angiosperms are known for having their seeds enclosed within fruits, which develop from the ovaries of flowers. Gymnosperms, on the other hand, have naked seeds that are not enclosed in ovaries. For example, pine trees are gymnosperms, and their seeds are found in cones, but they're not enclosed in fruits.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like the key difference is that angiosperms have seeds enclosed in ovaries, while gymnosperms do not.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. I recall that angiosperms are characterized by having flowers, and those flowers contain ovaries that develop into fruits enclosing the seeds. Gymnosperms, like conifers, produce seeds directly on scales or in cones without a fruit covering.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer should be D: seeds enclosed in ovaries.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options could potentially be correct.\n\nPerennial growth: As I thought, both angiosperms and gymnosperms can be perennial. For example, oak trees are angiosperms and live for many years, while pine trees, gymnosperms, also live for many years.\n\nTrue roots: Again, both groups have true roots. Even ferns and some other vascular plants have true roots, but that's not relevant here.\n\nApical growth: Both angiosperms and gymnosperms exhibit apical growth, so that's not a distinguishing feature.\n\nTherefore, the only option that clearly distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms is D: seeds enclosed in ovaries.\n\nI think I've got it figured out.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
