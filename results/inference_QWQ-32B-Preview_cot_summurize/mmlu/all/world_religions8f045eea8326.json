                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which monk developed Pure Land Buddhism as we know it today. The options are Genshin, Dogen, Honen, and Shinran. I'm a bit confused because I remember that both Honen and Shinran were associated with Pure Land Buddhism, but I'm not sure who exactly developed it as we know it today.\n\nFirst, I recall that Pure Land Buddhism is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism that focuses on devotion to the Buddha Amitabha and the prospect of rebirth in his pure land, known as Sukhavati. It's popular in East Asian countries like China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Genshin - I think he was a Japanese Buddhist monk who lived around the 10th century. He's known for his work \"Oj\u014dy\u014dsh\u016b,\" which is a collection of teachings on the Pure Land. So, he seems to have contributed to Pure Land Buddhism, but was he the one who developed it as we know it today?\n\nB. Dogen - I believe Dogen is associated with Soto Zen Buddhism. He founded the Soto school of Zen in Japan and wrote the \"Shobogenzo,\" which is a major text in Zen Buddhism. So, he seems more related to Zen than Pure Land.\n\nC. Honen - Honen was a Japanese Buddhist priest who lived in the 12th century. He is considered the founder of the Jodo Shu (Pure Land) school of Buddhism. He emphasized the recitation of the nembutsu, which is the chanting of Amitabha Buddha's name, as the essential practice for rebirth in the pure land.\n\nD. Shinran - Shinran was a student of Honen and went on to found the Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land) school, which is another branch of Pure Land Buddhism. He further developed the ideas of Pure Land Buddhism, particularly the concept of tariki, or other-power, which refers to reliance on Amitabha Buddha's grace for salvation.\n\nGiven this information, it seems like both Honen and Shinran played significant roles in the development of Pure Land Buddhism. Honen founded the Jodo Shu school, emphasizing nembutsu recitation, while Shinran founded Jodo Shinshu, which places greater emphasis on faith and grace.\n\nBut the question is asking for the monk who developed Pure Land Buddhism as we know it today. I think this might be referring to the overall tradition as it exists now, which includes both Jodo Shu and Jodo Shinshu.\n\nHowever, since Honen was the founder of the original Pure Land school in Japan, and Shinran built upon his teachings to create a separate sect, perhaps Honen is the one who developed it as we know it today.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's Shinran, because Jodo Shinshu became more widespread and influential in Japan.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the global context. Pure Land Buddhism exists not only in Japan but also in China and Korea. In China, it's known as Jingtu Buddhism, and in Korea, it's known as Yeogak. So, maybe the development in Japan, particularly through Honen and Shinran, influenced the broader tradition.\n\nBut to pinpoint who developed it as we know it today, maybe it's Honen, since he was the founder of the school that directly focused on Pure Land practices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's Genshin, who wrote extensively about the Pure Land and its practices earlier on. But considering the timeline, Genshin lived before Honen and Shinran, so while he contributed to the development of Pure Land Buddhism, perhaps the form as we know it today was more solidified by Honen and Shinran.\n\nDogen, on the other hand, seems unrelated to Pure Land Buddhism, given his association with Zen.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is C. Honen, as he is the founder of the Jodo Shu school, which is one of the main Pure Land traditions in Japan and has influenced the broader Pure Land movement.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because Shinran's Jodo Shinshu also plays a significant role in Pure Land Buddhism today.\n\nMaybe I should look up more information about the development of Pure Land Buddhism to confirm.\n\nUpon researching, I find that Pure Land Buddhism has its roots in ancient Indian Buddhism, particularly in the Sukhavati-vyuha sutras, which describe Amitabha Buddha's pure land. However, the specific developments in East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, have shaped the tradition as we know it today.\n\nIn Japan, Honen is indeed credited with founding the Jodo Shu school, which focuses on nembutsu recitation as the means to rebirth in the pure land. Shinran, his follower, later founded Jodo Shinshu, which places greater emphasis on faith and the grace of Amitabha Buddha.\n\nConsidering that both schools are major branches of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan, and that Honen was the founder of the first Pure Land school, it seems reasonable to say that he developed Pure Land Buddhism as we know it today, at least in the Japanese context.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the broader East Asian context, perhaps there were other monks in China who played a more significant role in developing Pure Land Buddhism. For example, Tanluan and Shandao were important Chinese monks who promoted Pure Land practices.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"monk\" and lists Japanese names, it's likely referring to a Japanese monk.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Honen.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
