                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out when the cyber-security discourse really started gaining momentum. So, the question is, when did politicians, academics, and other influential people begin taking cyber-security seriously and talking about it a lot? The options are the 1970s, 1990s, 1960s, or 1980s.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what cyber-security entails. It's basically about protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. So, it\u2019s all about safeguarding the cyber world.\n\nNow, considering when computers and the internet became prevalent, that might give me a clue. Computers started becoming more common in the 1960s and 1970s, and the internet, as we know it, began to take shape in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nI recall that in the 1980s, there were some notable computer viruses and hacks that gained public attention. For example, the Morris worm in 1988, which was one of the first widespread malware incidents on the internet. That might have been a turning point where people started realizing the potential risks of interconnected systems.\n\nIn the 1990s, with the explosion of the World Wide Web and more people getting online, there was probably even more discussion about security issues. E-commerce was beginning to take off, and protecting financial transactions became crucial.\n\nLooking back to the 1970s, while there was certainly some concern about security in computing, it might not have been as widespread or prominent in public discourse.\n\nThe 1960s seem a bit early; computers were still quite primitive and not as integrated into society as they would become later.\n\nSo, between these options, I'm leaning towards the 1980s or 1990s. Maybe the 1980s, because that's when some significant cyber incidents occurred that grabbed public attention.\n\nBut let me think about political involvement. When did governments start taking cyber-security seriously? I think in the 1990s, there were already initiatives and policies being developed to address cyber-security at the national level.\n\nFor example, in the United States, the Clipper Chip debate in the 1990s was about balancing privacy and security in digital communications. That suggests that cyber-security was a topic of serious discussion among politicians and policymakers.\n\nAcademics have been studying computer security for decades, but when did it become a mainstream academic field? Probably in the 1980s and 1990s, as computers became more\u666e\u53ca and the need for security measures grew.\n\nAlso, in the 1990s, there were several high-profile hacker cases, like Kevin Mitnick, who was arrested in 1995 for various computer crimes. These cases brought cyber-security into the public eye and likely increased discourse on the topic.\n\nMoreover, the establishment of organizations focused on cyber-security, such as the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University, which was founded in 1988 in response to the Morris worm, indicates that by the late 1980s, there was a recognized need for such expertise.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the 1980s and 1990s were crucial decades for the emergence of cyber-security discourse. But to pick one of the options provided, I might choose the 1990s because that's when it really started to gain broad attention from politicians, academics, and the general public.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that the term \"cyber-security\" itself might have been coined or popularized in a specific decade. A quick search suggests that the term started being used in the 1990s, which aligns with my previous thought.\n\nAdditionally, international efforts to address cyber-security, such as the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, indicate that by the late 1990s, there was international recognition of the need for coordinated approaches to cyber-security.\n\nTherefore,\u7efc\u5408\u4ee5\u4e0a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e91990\u5e74\u4ee3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u95e8\u8ba8\u8bba\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5fc5\u987b\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u9009\u9879\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9D.1980\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u50cf\u83ab\u91cc\u65af\u8815\u866b\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u518d\u4ed4\u7ec6\u60f3\u60f3\uff0c1990\u5e74\u4ee3\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4f7f\u5f97\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u52a0\u7d27\u8feb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u653f\u754c\u3001\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u516c\u4f17\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6700\u597d\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\u662f\u9009\u62e9B.1990\u5e74\u4ee3\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f00\u59cb\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n**\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848**\n\n$$\\boxed{B}$$"
