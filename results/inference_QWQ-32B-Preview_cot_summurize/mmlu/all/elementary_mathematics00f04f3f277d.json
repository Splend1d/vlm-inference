He wants to know whether the home team or the visiting team is more popular among the attendees. The options are:\n\nA. Surveying the cheerleaders for the home team.\n\nB. Surveying people wearing hats for the visiting team.\n\nC. Surveying a group of people standing in line for tickets.\n\nD. Surveying people who do not live in the home team\u2019s city.\n\nI need to think about which group would give him the most accurate representation of the overall popularity of both teams at the game.\n\nLet's start with option A: surveying the cheerleaders for the home team. Cheerleaders are probably big fans of the home team, so their responses might be biased towards the home team. That might not give a fair picture of the overall popularity.\n\nOption B is surveying people wearing hats for the visiting team. These people are likely supporters of the visiting team, so their responses might be biased towards the visiting team. Again, that might not represent the entire audience.\n\nOption C is surveying a group of people standing in line for tickets. This could be a more random sample because people buying tickets might include fans of both teams, although in some cases, more home team fans might be present. But it could still be a decent cross-section of the audience.\n\nOption D is surveying people who do not live in the home team\u2019s city. This might include more visiting team fans, but it could also include home team fans who don't live in the city. It's a bit unclear.\n\nI think the best approach would be to choose a method that minimizes bias and gives a representative sample of all the attendees.\n\nSurveying people standing in line for tickets (option C) seems like the most neutral approach. It's likely to include a mix of home team and visiting team fans, assuming both teams have fans buying tickets.\n\nSurveying cheerleaders or people wearing specific team hats would likely give biased results in favor of one team.\n\nSurveying people who don't live in the home team's city might still include a mix of fans, but it's possible that more visiting team fans would be in that group.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option C, surveying a group of people standing in line for tickets, would give Emil the most accurate results in determining the most popular football team at the game.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
