It says, \"Ad hominem is another name for the fallacy of...\" and then gives four options: A. appeal to loyalty, B. reducing to an absurdity, C. ignorance of refutation, and D. argument against the person.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"ad hominem\" means. I remember that it's a type of logical fallacy where instead of addressing the argument or the evidence, someone attacks the person making the argument. So, it's like dismissing someone's point because of who they are, rather than dealing with the merits of what they're saying.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Appeal to loyalty: I think this might be when someone tries to get you to agree with them based on loyalty to a group or a cause, rather than on the strength of the argument itself. That sounds different from ad hominem.\n\nB. Reducing to an absurdity: This sounds like reductio ad absurdum, which is a valid logical technique where you take your opponent's argument to its logical extreme to show that it leads to an absurd or impossible conclusion. So, that's not a fallacy; it's a way to test the consistency of an argument.\n\nC. Ignorance of refutation: I'm not sure what this means exactly. It might be related to assuming something is true because it hasn't been proven false, which could be similar to the appeal to ignorance fallacy. But again, that doesn't sound like ad hominem.\n\nD. Argument against the person: This sounds a lot like ad hominem. If you're arguing against the person rather than their argument, that matches the definition I recall.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the best answer is D. Argument against the person.\n\nBut let me double-check. Ad hominem does mean \"to the person\" in Latin, so it makes sense that it would be synonymous with arguing against the person rather than their argument.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if any of the other options could also be considered types of fallacies related to ad hominem.\n\nOption A, appeal to loyalty, could be a fallacy, but it's more about appealing to emotions or group loyalty rather than attacking the person directly. So, it's probably not the same as ad hominem.\n\nOption B, reducing to an absurdity, is actually a valid argumentative technique, so it wouldn't be considered a fallacy in the same way.\n\nOption C, ignorance of refutation, doesn't sound like a standard fallacy name, at least not that I recall.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
