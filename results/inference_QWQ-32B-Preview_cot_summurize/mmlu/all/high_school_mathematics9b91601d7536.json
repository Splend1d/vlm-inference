                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. The inequality we're dealing with is |n| < |n - 3| < 9, and we need to find the sum of all integer solutions for n.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this inequality is saying. It's asking for all integers n where the absolute value of n is less than the absolute value of n - 3, which in turn is less than 9.\n\nSo, I can break this down into two parts:\n\n1. |n| < |n - 3|\n\n2. |n - 3| < 9\n\nI'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions.\n\nLet's start with the second inequality since it's simpler:\n\n|n - 3| < 9\n\nThis means that n is less than 9 units away from 3 on the number line. So, n can range from 3 - 9 to 3 + 9, which is -6 to 12.\n\nBut wait, since n has to be an integer, n can be -6, -5, -4, ..., up to 12. That's a range of integers from -6 to 12 inclusive.\n\nNow, the first inequality is |n| < |n - 3|.\n\nThis is a bit trickier. It's saying that the distance of n from 0 is less than its distance from 3.\n\nLet me think about when this would be true.\n\nIf n is between 0 and 3, then |n| = n and |n - 3| = 3 - n.\n\nSo, n < 3 - n \u21d2 2n < 3 \u21d2 n < 1.5.\n\nSince n is an integer, n can be 0 or 1 in this case.\n\nIf n > 3, then |n| = n and |n - 3| = n - 3.\n\nSo, n < n - 3 \u21d2 0 < -3, which is never true.\n\nTherefore, there are no solutions for n > 3 in this inequality.\n\nIf n < 0, then |n| = -n and |n - 3| = 3 - n.\n\nSo, -n < 3 - n \u21d2 0 < 3, which is always true.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right. If n < 0, then -n < 3 - n implies 0 < 3, which is always true. So, for all n < 0, the inequality |n| < |n - 3| holds.\n\nBut earlier, when n is between 0 and 3, only n = 0 and n = 1 satisfy the inequality.\n\nAnd for n > 3, there are no solutions.\n\nSo, combining this with the second inequality, which is -6 \u2264 n \u2264 12, we have:\n\nFor n < 0: all integers from -6 to -1 satisfy |n| < |n - 3|.\n\nFor n between 0 and 3: only n = 0 and n = 1 satisfy |n| < |n - 3|.\n\nn = 2 and n = 3 do not satisfy because at n = 2, |2| = 2 and |2 - 3| = 1, which does not satisfy 2 < 1.\n\nSimilarly, at n = 3, |3| = 3 and |3 - 3| = 0, which does not satisfy 3 < 0.\n\nSo, the integer solutions are n = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.\n\nNow, I need to sum these up.\n\nLet's list them: -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.\n\nSumming these:\n\n-6 + (-5) = -11\n\n-11 + (-4) = -15\n\n-15 + (-3) = -18\n\n-18 + (-2) = -20\n\n-20 + (-1) = -21\n\n-21 + 0 = -21\n\n-21 + 1 = -20\n\nSo, the sum is -20.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching any of the given options: A. -9 B. -14 C. 14 D. 9.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the solutions.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nFrom the first inequality |n| < |n - 3|, we have:\n\n- For n < 0: always true.\n\n- For 0 \u2264 n < 1.5: true only for n = 0 and n = 1.\n\n- For n \u2265 1.5: no solutions.\n\nBut wait, in the second inequality, |n - 3| < 9, which gives -6 \u2264 n \u2264 12.\n\nSo, combining both, n can be from -6 to 12.\n\nBut from the first inequality, only n < 0 and n = 0,1 satisfy.\n\nSo, n = -6 to n = 1 are the solutions.\n\nWait, but n = 2 and n = 3 do not satisfy, but they are within -6 to 12.\n\nWait, no, n = 2 and n = 3 are not included because they do not satisfy the first inequality.\n\nSo, n = -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 are the solutions.\n\nSumming them up: -6 + (-5) + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 = -20.\n\nBut this doesn't match any options. Maybe I miscounted?\n\nLet me add them again: -6 + (-5) = -11; -11 + (-4) = -15; -15 + (-3) = -18; -18 + (-2) = -20; -20 + (-1) = -21; -21 + 0 = -21; -21 + 1 = -20.\n\nWait, that's still -20.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that n has to satisfy both inequalities simultaneously.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the second inequality |n - 3| < 9 again.\n\nSo, |n - 3| < 9 implies -9 < n - 3 < 9, which simplifies to -6 < n < 12.\n\nWait, here I wrote -6 \u2264 n \u2264 12 earlier, but actually, it's -6 < n < 12.\n\nSo, n can be from -5 to 11, since n is integer.\n\nWait, but |n - 3| < 9 means n - 3 < 9 and n - 3 > -9, so n < 12 and n > -6.\n\nSo, n > -6 and n < 12.\n\nTherefore, n can be from -5 to 11 inclusive.\n\nSo, earlier, I thought n could be -6, but actually, n > -6.\n\nSo, n starts from -5.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are n = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.\n\nSumming these: -5 + (-4) = -9; -9 + (-3) = -12; -12 + (-2) = -14; -14 + (-1) = -15; -15 + 0 = -15; -15 + 1 = -14.\n\nWait, that's -14.\n\nBut earlier, I had -20, but that included n = -6, which is not allowed because |n - 3| < 9 requires n > -6.\n\nSo, n starts from -5.\n\nTherefore, the correct solutions are n = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1.\n\nSum is -14.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. -14.\n\nPerhaps I misread the second inequality earlier.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is B. -14.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-14} \\]"
