I need to figure out which one isn't usually considered a spice for cooking.\n\nFirst, I know that dill is definitely a spice. I've seen it in recipes, especially for pickling and in Scandinavian cuisine. It has those feathery leaves and a distinct flavor.\n\nThyme is another one I'm familiar with. It's a common herb used in a lot of dishes, like soups, stews, and roasted meats. So, that's definitely used as a spice.\n\nMarjoram is similar to oregano, and it's also widely used in cooking, particularly in Italian and Mediterranean cuisines. So, that's probably used as a spice too.\n\nNow, hemlock\u2014 that sounds familiar, but I think it's different. I recall from history class that hemlock is a poisonous plant. Socrates was made to drink hemlock as a form of execution, right? So, if it's poisonous, that probably means it's not used as a spice in cooking.\n\nComparing all the options, dill, thyme, and marjoram are all herbs used for seasoning food, while hemlock is a poisonous plant. Therefore, hemlock is typically not used as a spice.\n\nBut just to make sure, I should verify if hemlock is indeed poisonous and not used in cooking. From what I remember, hemlock contains toxic alkaloids that can cause paralysis and even death if ingested. So, it's definitely not something you'd want to use as a spice.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes people might confuse hemlock with parsley, since they can look similar, but parsley is safe to eat and is commonly used as a herb. Hemlock, however, is decidedly not.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that the answer is C. Hemlock.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
