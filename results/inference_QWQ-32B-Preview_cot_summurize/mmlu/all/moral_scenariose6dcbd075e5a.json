Roads are meant for people to drive and walk safely. If someone digs potholes in the road, it could be dangerous for others who use the road. They might have accidents or damage their vehicles. So, intentionally creating hazards on a public road seems like a bad thing to do.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"In order to receive a good grade, I worked hard to score high.\"\n\nThis seems like a positive action. Working hard to achieve a good grade is something that's encouraged in school. It shows dedication and a desire to learn and succeed. There doesn't appear to be anything morally wrong with putting effort into your studies to get a good grade.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, digging potholes in a road is likely to be considered wrong because it endangers others, while working hard to get a good grade is not wrong; it's a desirable behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
