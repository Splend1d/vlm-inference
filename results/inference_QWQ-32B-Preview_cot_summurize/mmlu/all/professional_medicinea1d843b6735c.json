                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a trial looking at Drug X and its relation to cancer deaths. There were 600 individuals in total, with 200 receiving Drug X and 400 not receiving it. Out of those who received Drug X, 100 died from a particular type of cancer, and out of those who didn't receive it, also 100 died from the same type of cancer. I need to find out the relative risk of death from this cancer for those who take Drug X compared to those who don't.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what relative risk is. Relative risk is a ratio of the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group to the probability of the event occurring in a non-exposed group. In this case, the event is death from cancer, and the exposure is taking Drug X.\n\nSo, the formula for relative risk (RR) is:\n\nRR = [Probability of event in exposed] / [Probability of event in non-exposed]\n\nWhich can also be expressed in terms of the number of events and the total number in each group:\n\nRR = (Number of events in exposed / Total exposed) / (Number of events in non-exposed / Total non-exposed)\n\nPlugging in the numbers from the problem:\n\nExposed (took Drug X):\n\n- Number of events (deaths from cancer): 100\n\n- Total exposed: 200\n\nNon-exposed (did not take Drug X):\n\n- Number of events (deaths from cancer): 100\n\n- Total non-exposed: 400\n\nSo, the probability of death from cancer in the exposed group is 100/200 = 0.5 or 50%.\n\nIn the non-exposed group, it's 100/400 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nTherefore, the relative risk is 0.5 / 0.25 = 2.\n\nThis means that individuals who take Drug X have twice the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to those who do not take Drug X.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Equal risk\n\nB. Four times the risk\n\nC. Three times the risk\n\nD. Two times the risk\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nExposed:\n\n- Events: 100\n\n- Total: 200\n\n- Probability: 100/200 = 0.5\n\nNon-exposed:\n\n- Events: 100\n\n- Total: 400\n\n- Probability: 100/400 = 0.25\n\nRelative risk: 0.5 / 0.25 = 2\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it in terms of proportions.\n\nIn the exposed group, half of the individuals died from cancer, while in the non-exposed group, a quarter died from cancer. So, the risk is indeed twice as high in the exposed group.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the expected number of deaths in the exposed group if the risk was the same as in the non-exposed group. If the non-exposed group has a 25% death rate, then for 200 exposed individuals, we would expect 200 * 0.25 = 50 deaths if the risk was the same. But actually, there were 100 deaths, which is double the expected amount, again indicating a relative risk of 2.\n\nI think this confirms that option D is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the data.\n\nSometimes, relative risk can be confused with attributable risk or other measures, but in this case, the question specifically asks for relative risk, so I think my approach is appropriate.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that the data is being interpreted correctly. The problem states that 100 individuals who received Drug X died of cancer, and 100 who did not receive it died of cancer. So, the number of events is the same in both groups, but the total number in each group is different, which affects the probability calculations.\n\nIf I were to calculate the odds ratio instead, that might give a different value, but since the question asks for relative risk, odds ratio isn't relevant here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the relative risk is 2, and the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
