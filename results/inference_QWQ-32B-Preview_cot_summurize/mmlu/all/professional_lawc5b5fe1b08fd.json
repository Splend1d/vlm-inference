                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a married couple, a real estate broker, and some promises about a rebate on a house purchase. It's getting a bit tangled, but I'll try to sort it out.\n\nFirst, the couple sued the broker for misrepresentation and breach of contract. They say the broker promised them a $15,000 rebate from the sellers if they bought the home immediately. But at closing, the sellers didn't pay up, claiming they didn't know about it. Now, the couple is taking the broker to court.\n\nDuring the trial, the couple subpoenaed one of the broker's agents. This agent testified that he was in a meeting with the buyers and heard the broker make that same promise about the rebate. The broker's objection is that this testimony is hearsay.\n\nSo, the question is: What will the court most likely decide regarding whether this testimony can be admitted?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The testimony is admissible because it is a party admission made through the party's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\n\nB. The testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal.\n\nC. The testimony is inadmissible because it is pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter that is in dispute.\n\nD. The testimony is admissible\u2014even though it is hearsay, the broker is available to be cross-examined.\n\nOkay, hearsay is a statement made outside of the courtroom that is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible because it's not made under oath and the person who made the original statement isn't present for cross-examination.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. One of them is for statements by a party's agent or employee, made within the scope of their employment, and admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\n\nIn this case, the agent is testifying about what he heard the broker say. The broker is a party to the lawsuit, and the agent was likely employed by the broker.\n\nOption A suggests that the testimony is admissible as a party admission through an authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment. That sounds plausible because the agent was present in the meeting and heard the broker make the promise. Since the agent was employed by the broker, his testimony about what the broker said could be considered an admission by the party-opponent.\n\nOption B says the testimony is inadmissible because the agent was not authorized to speak for his principal. But in this context, the agent isn't speaking for the broker; he's testifying about what he heard the broker say. So, authorization to speak for the principal might not be relevant here.\n\nOption C claims the testimony is inadmissible because it's pure hearsay offered to prove the truth of the matter in dispute. That's true; the agent is testifying about something he heard the broker say, and it's being offered to prove that the broker actually made that promise. However, as I thought earlier, there might be an exception that allows this testimony.\n\nOption D says the testimony is admissible despite being hearsay because the broker is available for cross-examination. But hearsay isn't automatically admissible just because the original speaker is available; that's more related to witness testimony.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option A is the most likely correct answer. The testimony is admissible as a party admission through the broker's authorized agent concerning a matter within the scope of his employment.\n\nThis makes sense because the agent was employed by the broker and was present in the meeting where the promise was made. His testimony about what he heard is directly related to the broker's conduct and statements, which are central to the couple's claims.\n\nAdditionally, since the agent is testifying about what he personally heard, it's not just hearsay but also falls under the category of firsthand knowledge. The broker can be cross-examined about it, which further supports the reliability of the testimony.\n\nSo, the court will most likely decide that the testimony is admissible under the party admission exception to the hearsay rule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
