                    "text": "So I need to evaluate \\(\\log_8 2\\). Let me see what this means. The logarithm \\(\\log_b a\\) is the exponent to which the base \\(b\\) must be raised to get \\(a\\). So, \\(\\log_8 2\\) is asking for the exponent \\(x\\) such that \\(8^x = 2\\).\n\nFirst, I know that 8 can be written as a power of 2, since \\(8 = 2^3\\). So, I can rewrite the equation \\(8^x = 2\\) as \\((2^3)^x = 2\\). Using the property of exponents that \\((b^m)^n = b^{mn}\\), this becomes \\(2^{3x} = 2^1\\).\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n\\[3x = 1\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\), I get:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\log_8 2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If I raise 8 to the power of \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), I should get 2. Indeed, \\(8^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) is the cube root of 8, which is 2. So, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to convert the logarithm to a different base. For example, I can use the change of base formula:\n\n\\[\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b}\\]\n\nIf I choose base 2, then:\n\n\\[\\log_8 2 = \\frac{\\log_2 2}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{1}{3}\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\log_2 2 = 1\\) and \\(\\log_2 8 = 3\\), since \\(2^1 = 2\\) and \\(2^3 = 8\\). So, again, I get \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nAlternatively, I could use base 10 or the natural logarithm, but using base 2 is straightforward in this case.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to confirm this. I know that \\(8 = 2^3\\), so perhaps I can write \\(\\log_8 2\\) in terms of \\(\\log_2 8\\).\n\nWait, actually, \\(\\log_8 2 = \\frac{1}{\\log_2 8}\\), because of the reciprocal property of logarithms. Since \\(\\log_2 8 = 3\\), then \\(\\log_8 2 = \\frac{1}{3}\\). That's another confirmation.\n\nI think I've approached this from a few different angles and consistently get \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) as the answer. Therefore, the correct choice is D. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider the other options:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\): This would imply that \\(8^{\\frac{1}{4}} = 2\\), but \\(8^{\\frac{1}{4}}\\) is the fourth root of 8, which is not 2, since \\(2^4 = 16\\), not 8.\n\nB. 4: This would mean \\(8^4 = 2\\), but \\(8^4 = 4096\\), which is much larger than 2.\n\nC. 3: This would mean \\(8^3 = 2\\), but \\(8^3 = 512\\), which again is not 2.\n\nSo, none of these other options make sense in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed D. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
