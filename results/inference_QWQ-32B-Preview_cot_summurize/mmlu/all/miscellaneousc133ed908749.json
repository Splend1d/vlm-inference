                    "text": "Let's see... I have this question here: \"Who was on the $500 bill?\" and there are four options: A. Calvin Coolidge, B. Andrew Jackson, C. Aaron Burr, D. William McKinley. Hmm, I don't remember seeing a $500 bill in circulation, but I think they used to exist. I need to figure out which one of these figures was on it.\n\nFirst, I know that Andrew Jackson is on the $20 bill, right? So, option B is probably not the answer because he's on a different bill. What about Calvin Coolidge? I don't think he's on any currency that I know of. Aaron Burr was the vice president under Thomas Jefferson, but I don't think he's on any bills. And William McKinley, I think he's on the $500 bill, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up which presidents are on which bills. I know that George Washington is on the $1 bill, Abraham Lincoln on the $5, Alexander Hamilton on the $10, Andrew Jackson on the $20, Ulysses S. Grant on the $50, Benjamin Franklin on the $100, and so on. But what about higher denominations like $500?\n\nI think $500 bills do exist, but they're not in circulation anymore. They were printed, but they're not used in everyday transactions. So, perhaps William McKinley was on the $500 bill. I seem to recall that he was on one of the higher denomination bills.\n\nLet me try to recall: I think William McKinley was on the $500 bill. Let's see, McKinley was the 25th president, and he was assassinated in 1901. He was an important figure, so it makes sense that he would be featured on currency.\n\nWhat about Calvin Coolidge? He was the 30th president, serving from 1923 to 1929. I don't think he's on any currency, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAaron Burr was the third vice president of the United States, serving under Thomas Jefferson. He's more known for his duel with Alexander Hamilton and his trial for treason. I don't think he's on any U.S. currency.\n\nSo, between these options, I think William McKinley is the one on the $500 bill. But to be sure, maybe I should cross-verify with another fact. I know that higher denomination bills, like $500, $1,000, and above, were used mostly by banks and large transactions before they were discontinued for general use.\n\nIn fact, I recall that the $500 bill featured William McKinley. I think there was a series of bills printed in the 1920s or 1930s that had him on them. So, option D seems to be correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's eliminate the other options. Andrew Jackson is on the $20 bill, as I mentioned earlier. Aaron Burr isn't on any U.S. currency that I know of. Calvin Coolidge isn't on any currency either, as far as I can remember. So, by process of elimination, it's William McKinley.\n\nAdditionally, I think there was a $500 bill with William McKinley's portrait, and it was part of the United States Currency Series of 1928 and later series. So, that reinforces my answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. William McKinley.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
