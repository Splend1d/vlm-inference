                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Stevenson's primary aim in his paper. Now, Stevenson is a philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly for his emotive theory of ethics. So, first things first, I need to recall what his main contributions were in this area.\n\nI remember that Stevenson was part of the Oxford school of moral philosophy, and he was influential in the development of non-cognitivist theories in ethics. Non-cognitivism is the idea that moral statements don't express beliefs or propositions that can be true or false; instead, they express emotions or prescriptions.\n\nSo, his most famous work is probably \"Ethics and Language,\" where he develops this emotive theory. In this theory, moral judgments are essentially expressions of attitude or emotion, and they also have an imperative function, trying to influence the actions of others.\n\nGiven that background, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Provide an account of what makes right actions right.\n\nThis seems related to defining what it is that makes an action morally right. If Stevenson's main aim was to explain the criteria for right actions, that would align with a theory of right action or consequentialism, perhaps.\n\nBut, considering his emotive theory, he might not be directly providing an account of what makes actions right in terms of objective properties. Instead, he might be more focused on how moral language functions in communication.\n\nB. Establish which things are good in themselves.\n\nThis option is about identifying intrinsic goods. In ethical theory, intrinsic goods are things that are good for their own sake, not just as a means to something else.\n\nStevenson's emotive theory might not directly address which things are good in themselves, as it focuses more on the expressive and persuasive functions of moral language rather than determining the nature of goodness.\n\nC. Develop a theory of good moral character.\n\nThis option is about virtue ethics, which focuses on the character traits that make a person morally good.\n\nStevenson's work seems more concerned with the meaning and function of moral language rather than developing a theory of moral character. So, this might not be his primary aim.\n\nD. Make ethical questions clear.\n\nThis is a bit broad, but it could encompass Stevenson's project of clarifying the nature of moral language and ethical discourse.\n\nGiven that his emotive theory is an attempt to understand how moral language works\u2014how it expresses attitudes and tries to influence others\u2014it could be said that his primary aim is to make ethical questions clearer by elucidating the functions of moral language.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nStevenson is known for his work on the meaning and function of moral language. He argues that moral statements serve to express the speaker's attitudes and to influence the attitudes of others.\n\nSo, his main focus is on the expressive and persuasive aspects of moral language, rather than on providing an account of what makes actions right or identifying intrinsic goods.\n\nTherefore, option D, \"make ethical questions clear,\" seems the most fitting, as his theory is aimed at clarifying the nature and functions of moral language, which in turn helps to make ethical questions clearer.\n\nOptions A, B, and C seem more substantive in terms of providing specific ethical theories or determinations, whereas Stevenson's contribution is more in the realm of meta-ethics, focusing on the meaning and use of moral language.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is D. Make ethical questions clear.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
