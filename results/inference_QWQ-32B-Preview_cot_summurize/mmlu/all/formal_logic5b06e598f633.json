I have to translate the sentence \"Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter\" into predicate logic using the given symbols: e for Earth, j for Jupiter, and Bxy for \"x is bigger than y.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. It's stating that Earth is not bigger than Jupiter. So, it's a negation of the idea that Earth is bigger than Jupiter.\n\nIn predicate logic, negation is represented by the tilde symbol (~). So, if I want to say \"it is not the case that Earth is bigger than Jupiter,\" I should use negation.\n\nNow, the predicate Bxy means \"x is bigger than y.\" So, if I want to say \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter,\" it would be Bej, where e is Earth and j is Jupiter.\n\nBut the sentence is saying that Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter, which is the negation of Bej. Therefore, it should be ~Bej.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. ~Bje\n\nB. Bej\n\nC. Bje~\n\nD. ~Bej\n\nOption A is ~Bje, which means \"it is not the case that Jupiter is bigger than Earth.\" That's different from what we want, because we want to say that Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter.\n\nOption B is Bej, which directly translates to \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter,\" but the original sentence is saying the opposite.\n\nOption C is Bje~, which doesn't make standard predicate logic syntax. Typically, the negation symbol comes before the predicate, not after.\n\nOption D is ~Bej, which matches what I thought: the negation of \"Earth is bigger than Jupiter.\"\n\nTherefore, the best translation is option D: ~Bej.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAnother way to say \"Earth isn't bigger than Jupiter\" could be \"Jupiter is bigger than or equal to Earth.\" But in predicate logic, with just the Bxy meaning \"x is bigger than y,\" I don't have a way to express \"equal to\" unless specified otherwise.\n\nGiven the options, though, ~Bej seems to be the direct translation of \"Earth is not bigger than Jupiter.\"\n\nI think I'm sticking with D: ~Bej.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
