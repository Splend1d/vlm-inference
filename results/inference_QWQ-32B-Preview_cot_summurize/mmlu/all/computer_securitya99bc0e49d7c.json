Hmm, first I need to understand what a buffer-overflow attack is.\n\nA buffer overflow occurs when a program tries to put more data into a buffer than it can hold, which can cause the extra data to overflow into adjacent memory spaces. This can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code or disrupt the program's operation.\n\nNow, the question mentions \"old operating systems like _______ and NT-based systems.\" So, it's referring to older OSs that share characteristics with NT-based systems, which are newer and more secure.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Windows 7 - This is an operating system, released in 2009. It's relatively old, but I'm not sure if it's considered ancient in this context.\n\nB. Chrome - This is a web browser, not an operating system. So, it doesn't fit the category.\n\nC. IOS12 - This is an operating system for Apple devices, released in 2018. Again, compared to NT-based systems, it's quite recent.\n\nD. UNIX - This is a family of operating systems that dates back to the 1970s. That's pretty old, and I know that older versions of UNIX have had their share of security issues, including buffer overflows.\n\nNT-based systems refer to those built on the Windows NT architecture, which started with Windows NT 3.1 in 1993 and includes later versions like Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.\n\nGiven that, the question is likely trying to contrast older systems (like UNIX) with NT-based systems in terms of vulnerability to buffer overflows.\n\nWindows 7 is an NT-based system (built on Windows NT kernel), so it's probably not what they're referring to as \"old\" in this context.\n\nChrome is a browser, so it's irrelevant here.\n\nIOS12 is relatively new compared to NT-based systems.\n\nUNIX, being older, is more likely to have had buffer-overflow vulnerabilities, especially in its older versions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. UNIX.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if any of the other options could also be vulnerable to buffer overflows.\n\nWindows 7, being an NT-based system, has better security features to prevent buffer overflows, but no system is completely immune. However, the question seems to suggest that NT-based systems are distinct from the old systems being referred to.\n\nChrome, as a browser, can have vulnerabilities, but again, it's not an operating system.\n\nIOS12, being a modern OS, also has security measures in place to mitigate buffer overflows.\n\nSo, overall, UNIX seems to be the most appropriate answer here, as it represents older operating systems that may have more susceptibility to buffer-overflow attacks.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
