                    "text": "So I've got this question here about self-verification theory. It says that a husband with low self-esteem, who's overweight and chronically depressed, will prefer his wife to do one of four things regarding his abilities, weight, and mood. The options are:\n\nA. Not comment on his abilities, weight, and mood.\n\nB. Make neutral comments about his abilities, weight, and mood.\n\nC. Confirm his negative self-evaluations.\n\nD. Contradict his negative self-evaluations.\n\nI need to figure out which one he would prefer according to self-verification theory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what self-verification theory is. From what I remember, self-verification theory suggests that people seek consistency and stability in their self-concept. They prefer that others see them as they see themselves, even if those views are negative. So, if someone has a negative self-view, they might prefer that others confirm that negative view rather than contradict it.\n\nIn this case, the husband has low self-esteem, is overweight, and chronically depressed. These are all negative aspects of his self-concept. According to self-verification theory, he would prefer that his wife confirm these negative self-evaluations.\n\nSo, option C says \"confirm his negative self-evaluations,\" which seems to align with what self-verification theory predicts.\n\nOption D is \"contradict his negative self-evaluations.\" This would be more in line with self-enhancement theory, where people seek positive views of themselves. But self-verification is different; it's about seeking accuracy and consistency, even if that means others see us negatively.\n\nOptions A and B are about not commenting or making neutral comments. But self-verification theory suggests that people prefer others to confirm their self-views, whether positive or negative, so not commenting or being neutral might not satisfy that need for verification.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Confirm his negative self-evaluations.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about it again. If someone has a negative self-image, and they seek verification from others, they would prefer that others see them as they see themselves, which is negatively in this case. So, having their wife confirm their negative self-evaluations would reinforce their self-concept and provide a sense of stability and consistency.\n\nOn the other hand, if their wife contradicts their negative self-evaluations, it might be uncomfortable because it doesn't match their own view of themselves. It could lead to confusion or even rejection of the positive feedback, as it doesn't align with their self-image.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
