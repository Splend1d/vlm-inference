                    "text": "So I've got this physics problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's an elevator that weighs 1,000 kg, and its suspension cable breaks. So, it starts falling down the shaft from rest, meaning it's initially not moving. It falls a distance of 100 meters before the emergency brakes kick in and stop it just before it reaches the bottom.\n\nThe question is asking for the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest. So, I need to find out how much energy is converted into heat by the brakes.\n\nFirst, I should recall that when an object falls, it gains kinetic energy due to its motion, and this comes from its potential energy. The potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it falls.\n\nThe formula for potential energy is PE = mgh, where:\n\n- m is the mass of the object\n\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2)\n\n- h is the height or distance fallen\n\nGiven that the elevator falls 100 meters from rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero because it's not moving. As it falls, it gains kinetic energy equal to the potential energy it loses.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy just before the brakes engage should be equal to the potential energy at the start:\n\nKE = PE = mgh\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nm = 1,000 kg\n\ng = 9.8 m/s\u00b2\n\nh = 100 m\n\nKE = 1,000 kg * 9.8 m/s\u00b2 * 100 m = 980,000 J\n\nWait, but the options don't have 980,000 J. Let me check if I can approximate g to 10 m/s\u00b2 to make calculations easier.\n\nUsing g = 10 m/s\u00b2:\n\nKE = 1,000 kg * 10 m/s\u00b2 * 100 m = 1,000,000 J\n\nOh, that's option C. But in reality, g is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, which would give 980,000 J, but perhaps they want us to use g = 10 for simplicity.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions \"the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest.\" So, the brakes have to convert all the kinetic energy of the falling elevator into heat to stop it.\n\nTherefore, the heat dissipated should be equal to the kinetic energy of the elevator just before braking.\n\nSo, using g = 10 m/s\u00b2, it's 1,000,000 J, which is option C.\n\nBut let's double-check. If g is 9.8 m/s\u00b2, it's 980,000 J, which isn't listed. Maybe they expect us to use g = 10 to get 1,000,000 J.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to look at it. Maybe considering the work done by the brakes.\n\nThe work done by the brakes is equal to the change in kinetic energy. Since the elevator is brought to rest, the final kinetic energy is zero. So, the work done by the brakes is -KE, meaning they dissipate an amount of energy equal to the initial kinetic energy.\n\nSo, again, that's mgh = 1,000 kg * 10 m/s\u00b2 * 100 m = 1,000,000 J.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some energy lost due to friction or other factors, but the problem seems to suggest that all the energy is dissipated as heat by the brakes.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 1,000,000 J, which is option C.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other energy consideration here. For example, is there any rotational energy or something else? No, it's a falling elevator, so primarily it's just translational kinetic energy.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"starting from rest,\" so no initial kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, the heat dissipated by the brakes should be equal to the potential energy lost, which is mgh.\n\nSo, I'm confident with option C, 1,000,000 J.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
