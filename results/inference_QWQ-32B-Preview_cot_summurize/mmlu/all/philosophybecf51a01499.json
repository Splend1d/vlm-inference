                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Hume's views on beauty. So, David Hume was a philosopher who wrote a lot about aesthetics and taste. I remember that he talked about beauty in relation to how people perceive things, rather than some inherent quality in the objects themselves.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. a quality in things themselves\n\nB. a matter of a priori knowledge\n\nC. judged by logical standards\n\nD. no quality in things themselves\n\nOkay, so option A suggests that beauty is inherent in things. But I think Hume would disagree with that because he emphasized that beauty is more about the observer's perception and feelings. He believed that beauty is not an objective property of things, but rather it's subjective and varies from person to person.\n\nOption B mentions a priori knowledge, which is knowledge independent of experience. I don't recall Hume linking beauty directly to a priori knowledge. He seemed more focused on how our experiences and sentiments influence our judgments of beauty.\n\nOption C says that beauty is judged by logical standards. Again, I don't think that aligns with Hume's views. Hume argued that taste and beauty are more about sentiment and feeling than about logical analysis. He famously said that \"beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them.\"\n\nOption D states that beauty is no quality in things themselves. This seems consistent with what I remember of Hume's position. He believed that beauty is not an objective feature of objects but is instead a feeling or reaction that arises in the observer.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is D. Beauty is no quality in things themselves.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about it a bit more. Hume did discuss that there can be standards of taste, and that some people have better judgment in discerning beauty than others. However, even in that, he wasn't suggesting that beauty is an objective quality of the object itself. Instead, he was saying that some people are more attuned to the subjective qualities that constitute beauty.\n\nAlso, he talked about the role of universal agreement in taste, suggesting that while beauty is subjective, there are general principles that most people can agree on. But again, this doesn't mean that beauty is an inherent quality of the object.\n\nSo, overall, I believe D is the correct choice. Beauty is not a quality in things themselves, according to Hume.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
