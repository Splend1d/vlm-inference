                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which statistical procedure combines data from multiple studies that all look at the same question using similar variables. Let's see what each option means.\n\nOption A is analysis of variance, or ANOVA. I know that ANOVA is used to compare means across different groups within a single study. For example, if you have three different treatments and you want to see if their means are significantly different, you'd use ANOVA. But that's all within one study, not combining data from multiple studies. So, probably not the answer.\n\nOption B is analysis of difference scores. I think this is about looking at the differences between two related measurements, like pre-test and post-test scores for the same subjects. This seems to be a method used within a single study to assess change over time or in response to an intervention. Again, not about combining data from different studies.\n\nOption C is multiple regression. This is a statistical technique used to examine the relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. It's used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. Like the others, this is a method applied within a single study, not for combining data across studies.\n\nOption D is meta-analysis. I've heard about meta-analysis, and it seems to fit the description. Meta-analysis is a statistical method that combines the results of multiple studies to increase the power of the findings and provide a more precise estimate of the effect size. It's used when there are several studies addressing the same question, and you want to synthesize their results to get a broader picture.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, meta-analysis is the one that involves systematically combining data from multiple studies that focus on the same question and use similar variables.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
