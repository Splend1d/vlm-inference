                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"If the total energy of a particle of mass m is equal to twice its rest energy, then the magnitude of the particle\u2019s relativistic momentum is...\" and there are options from A to D. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what rest energy and total energy mean in the context of special relativity. I remember that the rest energy of a particle is given by Einstein's famous equation, E\u2080 = mc\u00b2, where m is the rest mass of the particle and c is the speed of light.\n\nNow, the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = \u03b3mc\u00b2, where \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor, \u03b3, is defined as 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), with v being the speed of the particle.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total energy is twice the rest energy. So, E = 2E\u2080. Substituting the expressions, we have \u03b3mc\u00b2 = 2mc\u00b2. The mc\u00b2 terms cancel out, leaving \u03b3 = 2.\n\nOkay, so \u03b3 = 2. Now, I need to find the relativistic momentum, p. The formula for relativistic momentum is p = \u03b3mv, where v is the velocity of the particle.\n\nBut I don't know v yet. Maybe I can find v in terms of c using the Lorentz factor.\n\nWe have \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2.\n\nSo, 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2.\n\nLet me solve for v.\n\nFirst, square both sides: 1/(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 4.\n\nThen, 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, v = c\u221a(3/4) = (\u221a3)/2 c.\n\nNow, plug this back into the momentum formula:\n\np = \u03b3mv = 2 * m * ((\u221a3)/2 c) = m * \u221a3 c.\n\nSo, p = \u221a3 mc.\n\nLooking back at the options, that corresponds to D. (\u221a3)mc.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from \u03b3 = 2.\n\nThen, \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 2.\n\nSo, \u221a(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1/2.\n\nSquare both sides: 1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1/4.\n\nThus, v\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4.\n\nSo, v = (sqrt(3)/2) c.\n\nThen, p = \u03b3mv = 2 m (sqrt(3)/2 c) = m sqrt(3) c.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to verify this.\n\nI recall that there's a relationship between energy, mass, and momentum in special relativity given by E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nGiven that E = 2mc\u00b2, plug that in:\n\n(2mc\u00b2)\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2.\n\nSo, 4m\u00b2c\u2074 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074.\n\nSubtract m\u00b2c\u2074 from both sides:\n\n3m\u00b2c\u2074 = p\u00b2c\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by c\u00b2:\n\n3m\u00b2c\u00b2 = p\u00b2.\n\nTake square roots:\n\np = sqrt(3) mc.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the momentum is sqrt(3) mc.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. sqrt(3) mc.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any possibility that the momentum could be different based on some other interpretation of the problem?\n\nWell, the problem specifies that the total energy is twice the rest energy, and we've used the standard relativistic formulas for energy and momentum.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
