Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a lawsuit between a plaintiff and a defendant over the title to land on a riverbank. The changes in water levels over time are crucial for the plaintiff's case. A commercial fisherman has been keeping a daily log of water levels at his dock opposite the land in question for 15 years. The plaintiff hired a draftsman to create graphs from this data to use as a trial exhibit.\n\nAt trial, the fisherman testified about how carefully he made the measurements and recorded them, and these logs were available for the defendant to inspect. Then, the draftsman testified about how he prepared the graphs.\n\nThe question is whether these graphs are admissible as evidence.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because they are hearsay not within any exception.\n\nB. No, because they violate the \"best evidence\" rule.\n\nC. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nD. Yes, as the draftsman's expert opinion of the water levels.\n\nFirst, let's consider hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the fisherman's logs are out-of-court statements about water levels. However, the fisherman testified in court about how he made the measurements and recorded them, and the logs were available for inspection by the defendant. This might fall under an exception to the hearsay rule, such as a statement against interest or a business record exception.\n\nOption C mentions summaries of voluminous business records. If the fisherman's logs qualify as business records, and the graphs are summaries of those records, then they could be admissible under the rule allowing summaries of voluminous records.\n\nOption D suggests that the graphs are admissible as the draftsman's expert opinion. However, the draftsman testified about how he prepared the graphs, not about any expert analysis or opinion on the water levels themselves. So, this might not be the best characterization.\n\nOption B mentions the \"best evidence\" rule, which generally requires that to prove the content of a writing, the original writing must be produced. However, if the graphs are accurate summaries of the logs, and the logs themselves are available for inspection, this might not be a bar to admissibility.\n\nGiven that the fisherman testified about the logs and they were available for inspection, and the draftsman testified about how he created the graphs, it seems that the foundation for admitting the graphs as summaries of voluminous records is present.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Yes, as summaries of voluminous business records.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are less suitable.\n\nOption A: Hearsay exception. While the logs might be hearsay, the fisherman's testimony about them could provide a foundation for an exception, such as the business records exception. So, hearsay might not bar their admission.\n\nOption B: Best evidence rule. Since the logs are available for inspection, and the graphs are summaries, this rule might not apply strictly, as the original documents are accessible.\n\nOption D: Expert opinion. The draftsman is not offering an opinion on the water levels; he's just presenting a graphical representation of the data from the logs.\n\nTherefore, C seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
