                    "text": "Let's see. This is a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, there's this woman who owns a tract of land. On June 1, 2005, she sells an undivided one-half interest in the land to a husband and wife for $100,000. The deed specifies that they take title as tenants by the entirety, not as joint tenants or tenants in common.\n\nSo, at this point, the woman still owns the other half of the land, and the husband and wife together own the other half as tenants by the entirety.\n\nThen, on June 1, 2006, the woman sells her remaining interest in the land to the husband and his brother for $125,000. The husband pays $80,000 and the brother pays the balance. The deed here specifies that they take title as joint tenants, not as tenants in common.\n\nNow, the husband and brother are taking the remaining half interest as joint tenants.\n\nWait a minute, so initially, the husband and wife owned one-half as tenants by the entirety, and now the husband and brother are owning the other half as joint tenants.\n\nSo, overall, the land is divided into two halves: one half owned by the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety, and the other half owned by the husband and brother as joint tenants.\n\nThen, the husband conveys all his right, title, and interest under both deeds to his cousin.\n\nSo, the husband is transferring his interest in both the first and second deeds to his cousin.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nFirst, under the first deed, the husband and wife owned as tenants by the entirety. When one spouse transfers their interest, it typically doesn't sever the tenancy by the entirety, but in this case, since the husband is transferring his interest to a third party, not to the wife, I think this would sever the tenancy by the entirety.\n\nSo, the husband's interest in the first deed is one-half as tenants by the entirety, but when he transfers it to his cousin, it likely becomes a tenancy in common between the cousin and the wife for that half.\n\nSimilarly, in the second deed, the husband and brother owned the other half as joint tenants. When the husband transfers his interest in this deed to his cousin, the joint tenancy is severed, and it becomes a tenancy in common between the cousin and the brother for that half.\n\nSo, after the husband's conveyance, the ownership stands as follows:\n\n- For the first half (original deed to husband and wife as tenants by the entirety):\n\n- Wife: undivided one-half interest\n\n- Cousin: the husband's former interest, which was one-half of the tenants by the entirety, now becoming an undivided one-half interest as tenancy in common with the wife.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in a tenancy by the entirety, the husband and wife each own the entirety, but upon transfer to a third party, it usually severs the tenancy and creates a tenancy in common between the transferee and the remaining tenant.\n\nSo, in this case, when the husband transfers his interest to the cousin, the tenancy by the entirety is severed, and the cousin and the wife become tenants in common, each owning one-half of that original half.\n\nWait, no. Tenancy by the entirety is a special form of co-ownership for married couples. When one spouse transfers their interest to a third party, it severs the tenancy by the entirety, and the third party holds a tenancy in common with the remaining spouse for the interest transferred.\n\nSo, if the husband transfers his interest to the cousin, the cousin now holds a tenancy in common with the wife for the original one-half interest that was held as tenants by the entirety.\n\nSimilarly, in the second deed, where the husband and brother held the other half as joint tenants, when the husband transfers his interest to the cousin, the joint tenancy is severed, and the cousin and the brother hold that half as tenants in common.\n\nSo, after the husband's conveyance:\n\n- For the first half (original tenants by the entirety):\n\n- Wife: undivided one-half interest\n\n- Cousin: undivided one-half interest, held as tenancy in common with the wife.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when the tenancy by the entirety is severed by the husband's transfer, the wife retains her original one-half interest, and the cousin receives the husband's one-half interest, and they hold those as tenants in common.\n\nBut in reality, since it was a tenancy by the entirety, which is a complete unity of interests, when severed, the transferee (cousin) would hold a tenancy in common with the remaining tenant (wife) for the entire property, but only to the extent of the interest transferred.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider the interests step by step.\n\nInitially:\n\n- Woman owns the entire tract.\n\nOn June 1, 2005:\n\n- Woman sells one-half to husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- So, woman owns one-half, husband and wife own one-half as TBE.\n\nOn June 1, 2006:\n\n- Woman sells her remaining one-half to husband and brother as joint tenants.\n\n- So now, husband and brother own one-half as joint tenants, and husband and wife own one-half as tenants by the entirety.\n\nThen, husband conveys all his interest under both deeds to his cousin.\n\nSo, the husband has interests in both deeds:\n\n1. Under the first deed: his interest in the tenancy by the entirety with the wife.\n\n2. Under the second deed: his interest in the joint tenancy with the brother.\n\nLet's address each separately.\n\nFirst, the tenancy by the entirety:\n\nWhen the husband transfers his interest in the tenancy by the entirety to the cousin, the tenancy by the entirety is severed, and the cousin holds a tenancy in common with the wife for the husband's former interest.\n\nIn a tenancy by the entirety, the husband and wife each have an undivided one-half interest. So, the husband's interest is one-half of the one-half, which is one-quarter of the whole tract.\n\nWait, no. In a tenancy by the entirety, neither spouse can unilaterally transfer the property; both must agree. However, in some jurisdictions, if one spouse transfers their interest to a third party, it severs the tenancy by the entirety, and the third party holds a tenancy in common with the remaining spouse for the entire property.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting information here. Maybe I need to look it up, but since this is a hypothetical, I'll proceed with the assumption that when the husband transfers his interest in the tenancy by the entirety to the cousin, it severs the tenancy by the entirety, and the cousin and the wife hold the original one-half interest as tenants in common.\n\nSimilarly, under the second deed, where the husband and brother held the other half as joint tenants, when the husband transfers his interest to the cousin, the joint tenancy is severed, and the cousin and the brother hold that half as tenants in common.\n\nSo, after the husband's conveyance:\n\n- For the first half (original tenants by the entirety):\n\n- Wife: undivided one-half interest\n\n- Cousin: undivided one-half interest, held as tenancy in common with the wife.\n\n- For the second half (joint tenants):\n\n- Brother: undivided one-half interest\n\n- Cousin: undivided one-half interest, held as tenancy in common with the brother.\n\nWait, no. In the second deed, the husband and brother held one-half as joint tenants. When the husband transfers his interest to the cousin, the joint tenancy is severed, and the cousin and the brother hold that one-half as tenants in common.\n\nSo, the cousin now has a one-half interest in that one-half, and the brother has the other one-half of that half.\n\nWait, no. In a joint tenancy, when one joint tenant transfers their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the transferee holds as a tenant in common with the remaining joint tenant.\n\nSo, the cousin would hold a one-half interest in the second half (the half that was held as joint tenants), and the brother holds the other one-half of that half.\n\nSimilarly, in the first half (original tenants by the entirety), after severance, the cousin and the wife hold that one-half as tenants in common.\n\nSo, the cousin has:\n\n- One-half of the first half (from the tenancy by the entirety)\n\n- One-half of the second half (from the joint tenancy)\n\nSo, total, the cousin has 1/2 of 1/2 plus 1/2 of the other 1/2, which is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 of the whole tract.\n\nBut wait, that seems too simplistic.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nInitially, woman owns the whole tract.\n\nSells one-half to husband and wife as tenants by the entirety.\n\nSo, woman owns 1/2, husband and wife own 1/2 TBE.\n\nThen, woman sells her remaining 1/2 to husband and brother as joint tenants.\n\nSo now:\n\n- Husband and wife own 1/2 as TBE\n\n- Husband and brother own 1/2 as joint tenants.\n\nThen, husband conveys all his interest under both deeds to his cousin.\n\nSo, the husband's interest is:\n\n- His interest in the TBE (which is 1/2 of the 1/2, but in reality, TBE is a complete unity)\n\n- His interest in the joint tenancy (which is 1/2 of the other 1/2)\n\nBut in TBE, the husband's interest is not severable without the wife's consent, but assuming he transfers it, it severs the TBE, and the cousin holds a tenancy in common with the wife for the husband's former interest.\n\nSimilarly, in the joint tenancy, his interest is severable, and upon transfer, it becomes a tenancy in common with the brother.\n\nSo, after the conveyance:\n\n- For the first half (original TBE):\n\n- Wife: undivided 1/2\n\n- Cousin: undivided 1/2, held as TIC with the wife.\n\n- For the second half (original joint tenancy):\n\n- Brother: undivided 1/2\n\n- Cousin: undivided 1/2, held as TIC with the brother.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent because the cousin now has 1/2 interest in both halves.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of fractions of the whole tract.\n\nOriginal ownership:\n\n- Woman: 1/2\n\n- Husband and wife TBE: 1/2\n\nThen, woman sells her 1/2 to husband and brother as joint tenants.\n\nSo now:\n\n- Husband and wife TBE: 1/2\n\n- Husband and brother JT: 1/2\n\nHusband conveys his interest in both to cousin.\n\nSo, in the TBE half:\n\n- Husband's interest is 1/2 of the 1/2 TBE, which is 1/4 of the whole tract.\n\nBut upon severance, the cousin gets the husband's interest in the TBE, which is 1/2 of the TBE half, so 1/4 of the whole.\n\nSimilarly, in the joint tenancy half:\n\n- Husband owned 1/2 of the 1/2 JT, which is 1/4 of the whole tract.\n\nHe transfers that to the cousin.\n\nSo, the cousin now has:\n\n- 1/4 from the TBE half\n\n- 1/4 from the JT half\n\nTotaling 1/2 of the whole tract.\n\nBut the answer choices include options for one-third, one-quarter, one-half, and three-quarters.\n\nSo, according to this, the answer would be C. an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the deaths.\n\nThe husband dies, then the brother dies.\n\nBut the husband already conveyed his interests to the cousin, so his death shouldn't affect the ownership further.\n\nSimilarly, the brother dies after the husband's conveyance.\n\nBut perhaps there's something about the sequence of deaths that affects the ownership.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider how the interests pass upon death.\n\nFirst, the husband has already conveyed all his interests to the cousin, so his death shouldn't affect the land ownership, as he no longer owns any interest.\n\nThen, the brother dies.\n\nThe brother owned one-half of the second half (the joint tenancy half), but after the husband's conveyance, the joint tenancy was severed, and the cousin and the brother held that half as tenants in common.\n\nSo, when the brother dies, his interest passes according to his will or intestacy laws, but since no mention is made of that, we can assume it's irrelevant to the cousin's interest.\n\nTherefore, the cousin still holds his undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. an undivided one-half interest in the land.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
