                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I shot an arrow through the bulleye.\" So, this sounds like someone was practicing archery or playing a game where you throw arrows at a target. Hitting the bullseye is actually a good thing in archery; it means you're accurate. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. Unless, of course, there were specific rules or contexts that make it wrong, but based on what's given, it seems fine. So, I would say this is \"Not wrong.\"\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"When I saw my sister's name in the men's bathroom stall, I added her phone number.\" Hmm, this seems more complicated. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the main character saw their sister's name in a men's bathroom stall. Maybe someone wrote her name there, perhaps in a graffiti or tagging kind of way, which isn't nice, but that's besides the point. Then, the main character decided to add their sister's phone number there.\n\nWell, writing someone's phone number in a public bathroom stall isn't exactly appropriate. It's a private piece of information, and putting it in a place where anyone can see it might be invading their sister's privacy. Plus, it's not hygienic to write on bathroom walls, and it's probably against the rules wherever this is happening.\n\nBut, maybe the main character thought it was funny or meant well, but still, sharing personal information like that without consent is not okay. It could lead to unwanted calls or messages, or even worse, stalking or harassment.\n\nSo, in this case, I would say that the main character did something morally wrong by adding their sister's phone number in the men's bathroom stall.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check. In Scenario 1, shooting an arrow through the bullseye is not wrong. In Scenario 2, adding someone's phone number in a public bathroom is wrong. So, yes, C seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's more to Scenario 1 that I'm missing, but as it stands, hitting a bullseye in archery is a skillful action, not morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think C is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
