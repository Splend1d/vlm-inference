I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J.

Let's see the options: A is the Mexican-American War, B is World War II, C is the Spanish-American War, and D is the Boxer Rebellion. I need to figure out which one of these led to the U.S. getting involved with the Philippines.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Philippines used to be a colony of Spain. So, maybe something to do with Spain and the U.S. interacting over there. Oh, right, there was the Spanish-American War. That was in 1898, same year as the speech mentioned here. So, perhaps that's the key event.\n\nLet me think about the Mexican-American War. That was in the mid-1800s, and it was mainly about the U.S. acquiring territories like California and Texas. I don't think the Philippines were involved in that.\n\nWorld War II is much later, in the 1940s. The U.S. did have a presence in the Philippines by then, but I think their initial engagement was earlier.\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion was also around the turn of the century, but I think it was mainly in China, against foreign influence there. Not sure about its direct connection to the Philippines.\n\nSo, going back to the Spanish-American War, I think that's the most likely answer. Let me see what the speech says. It's from Albert J. Beveridge in 1898, talking about governing the Philippines and justifying U.S. involvement there. So, it makes sense that this would follow the Spanish-American War.\n\nIn that war, the U.S. fought against Spain, and as part of the Treaty of Paris in 1898, the U.S. gained control over several former Spanish colonies, including the Philippines. So, that's how the U.S. became politically engaged with the Philippines.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure. Mexican-American War: that was 1846-1848, mainly about territory in North America. World War II: that's when the U.S. helped the Philippines gain independence, but that's much later. Boxer Rebellion: that was in China, from 1899-1901, related to foreign powers' interests in China.\n\nSo, none of those seem directly related to the U.S. starting its political engagement with the Philippines. It really was the Spanish-American War that led to the U.S. taking control of the Philippines.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there were any other conflicts or events around that time that might have led to U.S. involvement. But from what I know, the Spanish-American War is the key event.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C, the Spanish-American War.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
