                    "text": "This question is about choosing the right law to apply in a negligence case that happened in one state but involves parties from different states. It's a federal diversity action, which means it's in federal court because the parties are from different states, and it's about a certain amount of money.\n\nSo, the truck driver is from State A, the bus driver is from State B, and the accident happened in State B. The truck driver is suing the bus driver for $100,000 in federal court in State B.\n\nNow, the question is, what law should the court use to decide about negligence? There are four options:\n\nA. Federal common law of negligence.\n\nB. The negligence law of State A, where the truck driver is from.\n\nC. Consider both State A and State B's negligence laws and choose whichever the court thinks is best.\n\nD. Figure out what a state court in State B would do and apply that law.\n\nFirst, let's think about federal courts and state laws. Federal courts follow federal laws, but in diversity cases like this, they have to deal with state laws too. There's something called \"choice of law\" that determines which state's laws to apply.\n\nOption A suggests using federal common law. But federal common law in negligence is pretty limited. Negligence is usually a state law issue. So, this might not be the best choice.\n\nOption B proposes using State A's law because that's where the truck driver is from. But the accident happened in State B, and the bus driver is from State B. So, it might not make sense to apply State A's law just because that's where the plaintiff is from.\n\nOption C suggests considering both State A and State B's laws and picking the one the court thinks is most appropriate. That seems a bit vague and not in line with how choice of law typically works.\n\nOption D is about determining what a state court in State B would do and applying that law. This sounds like the court should apply the choice of law rules that State B would use.\n\nIn federal diversity cases, federal courts generally apply the choice of law rules of the state where the court is located. This is known as the \"forum's choice of law rules.\" Here, the forum is State B, so the federal court in State B should apply State B's choice of law rules to decide which state's substantive law to apply.\n\nSo, in this case, the court should figure out which state's law a state court in State B would apply and then apply that law in this action.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Federal courts in diversity cases use the choice of law rules of the forum state.\n\n- Here, the forum is State B, so the court should apply State B's choice of law rules.\n\n- State B's choice of law rules would determine whether to apply State A's law, State B's law, or some other law.\n\n- The federal court then applies that determined law to the case.\n\nSo, option D is the most accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
