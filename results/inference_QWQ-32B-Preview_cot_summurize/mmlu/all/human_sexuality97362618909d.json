Common symptoms in males include pain or burning during urination, discharge from the penis, and swelling or redness at the opening of the urethra. While other options like genital herpes, AIDS, and syphilis can also cause genital symptoms, the specific symptoms described here are more characteristic of gonorrhea.\n\n- **Genital Herpes (Option A)** typically presents with painful blisters or ulcers in the genital area, not necessarily a discharge.\n\n- **AIDS (Option B)** is a condition caused by the HIV virus and affects the immune system. It doesn't typically present with acute urinary symptoms like those described.\n\n- **Syphilis (Option C)** can have various stages with different symptoms, but early symptoms might include painless sores or rashes, not necessarily painful urination or discharge.\n\nGiven the symptoms\u2014pain during urination and a yellowish discharge\u2014it's most likely gonorrhea. However, it's crucial to get tested and\u786e\u8bca by a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment."
