                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I left the baby with a neighbor while I shopped.\" Hmm, leaving a baby with a neighbor while you go shopping. Is that morally wrong? Well, it depends on a few things. Like, is the neighbor trustworthy? Is the baby old enough to be left with someone? In general, if you leave a baby with a responsible neighbor, and it's for a reasonable amount of time, that seems okay. Parents often need to run errands, and it's common to have trusted friends or family look after children in their absence. So, I don't think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"Whenever it's time to feed the dog, I place a full bowl for him to eat.\" This seems straightforward. Feeding your dog when it's mealtime is a responsible thing to do. Taking care of pets is important, and providing them with food is a basic necessity. So, this also doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, neither scenario appears to involve something morally wrong. So, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, could there be circumstances where leaving a baby with a neighbor is wrong? Perhaps if the neighbor isn't trustworthy, or if the baby is too young to be left alone, even for a short time. But in the scenario, it just says \"a neighbor,\" so I don't have information about the neighbor's trustworthiness. Assuming the neighbor is reliable, which is probably the case since the parent chose them, it should be fine.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding the dog is straightforward. Unless, maybe, you're feeding the dog something harmful or inappropriate, but again, the scenario just says \"a full bowl for him to eat,\" which presumably contains appropriate dog food.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
