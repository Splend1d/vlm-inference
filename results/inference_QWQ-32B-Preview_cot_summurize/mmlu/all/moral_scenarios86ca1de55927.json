The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I was constantly taking time off of work because I was hungover.\"\n\nOkay, so this person is missing work frequently because they're hungover. Now, in the US, showing up to work drunk or missing work regularly can be seen as irresponsible and potentially unethical, especially if it affects the company or their coworkers. Depending on the job, it could also be a violation of company policy.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Well, morality can be a bit subjective, but in general, being reliable and fulfilling your obligations is considered important. Consistently missing work because of hungover could be seen as not fulfilling your work responsibilities, which might be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the context. Maybe this person is going through personal issues or has an addiction they're struggling with. In such cases, there might be more empathy, and people might see it as a problem that needs help rather than a moral failing.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, I think it's safe to say that constantly taking time off work because of hungover is generally considered wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I told the bartender I was 24 although I was only 17.\"\n\nHere, the person is lying about their age to buy alcohol. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21, so by lying about their age to get alcohol, they're attempting to circumvent the law.\n\nLying is generally considered morally wrong, and breaking the law is also typically seen as morally wrong, especially when it comes to laws that are in place for good reasons, like preventing underage drinking.\n\nUnderage drinking is a serious issue because it can lead to health problems, accidents, and other negative consequences. So, lying to get alcohol underage is probably considered morally wrong by ordinary standards.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are morally wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, constant absenteeism due to hungover could be harmful to the workplace and to one's career. It might also indicate a problem with alcohol abuse, which could have broader implications for the person's health and relationships.\n\nIn Scenario 2, lying about age to get alcohol not only breaks the law but also disrespects the rules set in place to protect young people from the dangers of alcohol.\n\nTherefore, both actions seem to be morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
