                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says that a plant grows in the opposite direction of the gravitational force, and we need to identify what that's called from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what tropism is. Tropism is a biological phenomenon where organisms respond to external stimuli by growing or moving in a specific direction. There are different types of tropisms based on the type of stimulus, like light, gravity, touch, etc.\n\nIn this case, the stimulus is gravity, so we're dealing with gravitropism. Gravitropism is the growth response of a plant in response to gravity. Plants can grow towards gravity (positive gravitropism) or away from gravity (negative gravitropism).\n\nThe question mentions that the plant grows in the opposite direction of the gravitational force. That sounds like negative gravitropism to me. For example, shoots of a plant typically grow upwards against gravity, which is negative gravitropism.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. positive thigmotropism - Thigmotropism is growth in response to touch, not gravity. So, this doesn't fit.\n\nB. negative phototropism - Phototropism is growth in response to light. Negative phototropism would be growth away from light, which isn't related to gravity.\n\nC. positive phototropism - This is growth towards light, again not related to gravity.\n\nD. negative gravitropism - This matches our earlier conclusion. It's growth against gravity.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. negative gravitropism.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's double-check. Positive gravitropism is growth towards gravity, like roots growing downward. Negative gravitropism is growth away from gravity, like shoots growing upward. Yes, that matches the description in the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. negative gravitropism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
