The grower's title to the lemon grove was subject to an unrecorded 20-year mortgage given to the mortgagee, a bank, in 1990 to secure repayment of a loan for $100,000. Beginning in November 1993, the following events occurred:November 1993: The grower died, leaving all of her real property to her husband. The grower's will was admitted to probate. No mention was made of the mortgage given to the bank. December 1993: Having heard about the grower's death, the bank recorded its mortgage to the lemon grove. August 1994: The husband executed and delivered to his sister a mortgage deed on the orange grove, which the sister immediately recorded. The mortgage instrument contained the following recitations: \"This mortgage is secured by the orange grove and all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in. \" The husband defaulted on his mortgage obligation to the sister; the amount due on the debt was $100,000. February 2009: The bank brought suit against the husband to foreclose its mortgage on the lemon grove. The applicable recording statute provides in part:\"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, of any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"Judgment should be for\n\nA. the husband, if he was unaware of the existence of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nB. the husband, only if the lemon grove was not subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\nC. the bank, because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired title to the lemon grove.\nD. the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n"

It's a bit complicated with all the transactions and time frames, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, we have a citrus grower who owned two parcels of land: an orange grove and a lemon grove. She owned them in fee simple, which means she had full ownership of both properties. However, the title to the lemon grove was subject to an unrecorded 20-year mortgage from 1990, securing a $100,000 loan from a bank.\n\nThen, in November 1993, the grower died and left all her real property to her husband through her will. The will was admitted to probate, and there's no mention of the mortgage to the bank.\n\nNext, in December 1993, after hearing about the grower's death, the bank recorded its mortgage on the lemon grove.\n\nThen, in August 1994, the husband mortgaged the orange grove to his sister, and this mortgage was immediately recorded. The mortgage document says it's secured by the orange grove and \"all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in.\" So, it seems like it's a blanket mortgage covering any real estate the husband owns in the city.\n\nThe husband later defaulted on this mortgage to his sister, and the amount due was $100,000.\n\nFinally, in February 2009, the bank sued the husband to foreclose on its mortgage on the lemon grove.\n\nNow, we have to determine who should win the lawsuit based on the given recording statute.\n\nThe recording statute says: \"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, of any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments.\"\n\nSo, this is a race-notice statute, meaning that to have priority, a subsequent purchaser must record their interest first and also be without notice of any prior unrecorded instruments.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n1. The grower had a mortgage on the lemon grove in 1990, which was unrecorded.\n\n2. She died in November 1993, and her husband inherited both the orange and lemon groves through her will.\n\n3. The bank recorded the mortgage in December 1993.\n\n4. The husband mortgaged the orange grove to his sister in August 1994, and this mortgage was recorded.\n\nNow, the bank is trying to foreclose on the lemon grove in February 2009.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the status of the mortgage on the lemon grove when the husband inherited it.\n\nSince the grower had an unrecorded mortgage on the lemon grove, and she willed the property to her husband, we need to see if the husband took the property subject to the mortgage.\n\nIn general, a devisee (someone who receives property through a will) takes the property subject to existing mortgages, even if they are unrecorded, if they had notice of them.\n\nBut in this case, there's no mention of whether the husband had notice of the mortgage. However, the problem states that \"no mention was made of the mortgage given to the bank\" in the will. So, perhaps the husband was unaware of the mortgage.\n\nBut under the recording statute, if a devisee takes property without knowledge of an unrecorded instrument, that unrecorded instrument doesn't affect the devisee's title.\n\nHowever, in this case, the bank recorded the mortgage in December 1993, after the grower's death but before the husband mortgaged the orange grove in August 1994.\n\nSo, the bank recorded its mortgage to the lemon grove before the husband mortgaged the orange grove.\n\nNow, the husband mortgaged the orange grove to his sister in August 1994, and the mortgage document covers \"all other real estate that I may own in the city or have an interest in.\"\n\nThis seems like a blanket mortgage covering all the husband's real estate in the city, including the lemon grove.\n\nBut the bank is only trying to foreclose on the lemon grove, so we need to see who has priority on that property.\n\nGiven that the bank's mortgage was recorded in December 1993, and the husband's mortgage to his sister was recorded in August 1994, the bank's mortgage was recorded first.\n\nUnder the recording statute, the first to record has priority over subsequent unrecorded instruments, but in this case, both are recorded, so it's a question of which one has priority based on recording time.\n\nSince the bank recorded its mortgage in December 1993 and the husband's mortgage to his sister was recorded in August 1994, the bank's mortgage has priority over the sister's mortgage on the lemon grove.\n\nHowever, we need to consider if the husband took the lemon grove subject to the bank's mortgage.\n\nGiven that the bank recorded its mortgage before the husband mortgaged the orange grove, and assuming the husband had notice of the bank's mortgage when he mortgaged the orange grove, but since the bank's mortgage was recorded before the husband's mortgage to his sister, the bank should have priority.\n\nBut the question is about foreclosing on the lemon grove, and we need to see if the husband's mortgage to his sister affects the bank's mortgage on the lemon grove.\n\nGiven that the husband's mortgage to his sister covers all real estate he owns in the city, including the lemon grove, and it was recorded after the bank's mortgage, the bank's mortgage on the lemon grove should have priority over the sister's mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the bank should be able to foreclose on the lemon grove, and the husband's mortgage to his sister wouldn't affect that.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest.\n\nBut let's look at the other options:\n\nA. the husband, if he was unaware of the existence of the mortgage at the time he acquired title to the lemon grove.\n\nBut under the recording statute, since the bank recorded its mortgage before the husband mortgaged the orange grove, the bank should have priority.\n\nB. the husband, only if the lemon grove was not subject to the mortgage when he acquired title.\n\nBut the lemon grove was subject to the mortgage when the grower died and willed it to the husband.\n\nC. the bank, because the husband assumed the mortgage when he acquired title to the lemon grove.\n\nWell, the husband may have taken the property subject to the mortgage, but that's different from assuming it.\n\nGiven all that, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) the bank, because property once mortgaged remains mortgaged as against the mortgagor's successors in interest."
