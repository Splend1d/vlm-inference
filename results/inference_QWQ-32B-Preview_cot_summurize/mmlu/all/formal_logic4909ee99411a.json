In this case, the argument is about utilitarian theory and the concept of a \"utility monster.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the argument:\n\n1. **Premise**: Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters.\n   - This seems to be introducing the topic but might not be the main point.\n\n2. **Definition**: A utility monster gets enormous gains in utility.\n   - This is defining what a utility monster is.\n\n3. **Comparison**: These gains are greater than the utility lost by the sacrifices of others.\n   - This explains the impact of the utility monster on others.\n\n4. **Implication**: The sacrifices of even large numbers of other people are outweighed by the gains of the utility monster.\n   - This elaborates on the previous point, emphasizing the extent of the utility monster's impact.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster's maw in order to increase total utility.\n   - This appears to be the main point the author is making about utilitarian theory in light of the utility monster concept.\n\nGiven this breakdown, the conclusion is the final statement, which criticizes utilitarian theory for potentially requiring the sacrifice of many for the benefit of one (the utility monster).\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters.\n\nB. A utility monster gets enormous gains in utility.\n\nC. A utility monster gets gains in utility greater than the utility lost by the sacrifices of others.\n\nD. The sacrifices of even large numbers of other people are outweighed by the gains of the utility monster.\n\nNone of these directly match the final statement in the argument. However, option A is closest because it summarizes the overall point about utilitarian theory being embarrassed by the utility monster concept. The other options focus more on defining or describing the utility monster rather than the conclusion about the theory.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
