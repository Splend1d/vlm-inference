                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. We've got Alfred and Ben, who don't know each other, each thinking about asking Charlene to the school prom. There are a few probabilities given, and we need to find the probability that Ben asks Charlene.\n\nFirst, let's list out what we know:\n\n- The probability that at least one of them asks her is 0.72.\n\n- The probability that both ask her is 0.18.\n\n- The probability that Alfred asks her is 0.6.\n\nWe need to find the probability that Ben asks her.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- A: Alfred asks Charlene.\n\n- B: Ben asks Charlene.\n\nWe're given:\n\n- P(A or B) = 0.72 (at least one of them asks her).\n\n- P(A and B) = 0.18 (both ask her).\n\n- P(A) = 0.6.\n\nWe need to find P(B).\n\nThere's a formula that relates these probabilities:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).\n\nThis formula accounts for the overlap when both A and B occur.\n\nWe can plug in the values we know and solve for P(B).\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18.\n\nNow, let's solve for P(B):\n\n0.72 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.18.\n\nFirst, combine the constants on the right side:\n\n0.6 - 0.18 = 0.42.\n\nSo, 0.72 = 0.42 + P(B).\n\nNow, subtract 0.42 from both sides:\n\nP(B) = 0.72 - 0.42 = 0.30.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.30.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.78\n\nB. 0.3\n\nC. 0.24\n\nD. 0.48\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.3.\n\nJust to double-check, let's make sure that everything adds up correctly.\n\nWe have P(A or B) = 0.72, P(A and B) = 0.18, P(A) = 0.6, and we calculated P(B) = 0.3.\n\nLet's verify using the formula:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + 0.3 - 0.18 = 0.72.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the individual probabilities.\n\nThe probability that at least one asks her is 0.72.\n\nThe probability that both ask her is 0.18.\n\nThe probability that only Alfred asks her is P(A) - P(A and B) = 0.6 - 0.18 = 0.42.\n\nThen, the probability that only Ben asks her is P(B) - P(A and B).\n\nWe know that P(A or B) is the sum of the probabilities of only A, only B, and both:\n\nP(A or B) = only A + only B + both.\n\nSo, 0.72 = 0.42 + (P(B) - 0.18) + 0.18.\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n0.72 = 0.42 + P(B) - 0.18 + 0.18.\n\nThe -0.18 and +0.18 cancel out, so:\n\n0.72 = 0.42 + P(B).\n\nAgain, P(B) = 0.72 - 0.42 = 0.30.\n\nThis confirms our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed 0.3, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.3} \\]"
