                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about prenatal development stages. The question is: \"Which of the following is the term used to refer to a stage in prenatal development which in humans begins at roughly the second week of pregnancy and lasts until roughly the eighth week?\" The options are A. fertilization, B. fetal stage, C. embryonic stage, and D. viability.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the stages of human prenatal development. I know that human development starts with fertilization, where the sperm and egg combine to form a zygote. After fertilization, the zygote begins to divide and develops into an embryo. Later, the embryo develops into a fetus.\n\nLet me think about the timeline here. Fertilization is the beginning, so that's week 1 or before pregnancy is detected. Then, the embryonic stage follows, and after that, the fetal stage.\n\nLooking at the question, it mentions \"begins at roughly the second week of pregnancy and lasts until roughly the eighth week.\" So, that sounds like it's starting after fertilization and ending before the fetal stage begins.\n\nI remember that the embryonic stage is from about week 3 to week 8. Wait, but the question says week 2 to week 8. Hmm, maybe there's a difference in how weeks are counted.\n\nSometimes, pregnancy is counted from the last menstrual period, which is about two weeks before fertilization occurs. So, week 2 of pregnancy would be around the time of ovulation and fertilization.\n\nBut, to confirm, let's think about the standard divisions:\n\n1. **Fertilization**: the beginning of development, when sperm and egg unite.\n\n2. **Embryonic stage**: from fertilization to about week 8.\n\n3. **Fetal stage**: from week 9 to birth.\n\n4. **Viability**: the stage at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, usually around 24 weeks.\n\nGiven this, the embryonic stage spans from fertilization to week 8, which aligns with the time frame mentioned in the question: second week to eighth week.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure about the starting point. If week 1 is before fertilization, and week 2 is when fertilization occurs, then the embryonic stage would start at week 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe different sources have slightly different timings.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. fertilization: that's a single event, not a stage.\n\nB. fetal stage: starts later, around week 9.\n\nC. embryonic stage: seems to fit the time frame.\n\nD. viability: that's a concept related to the ability to survive outside the womb, not a developmental stage.\n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be C. embryonic stage.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm the exact timing.\n\nI recall that the embryonic period is characterized by the formation of the major organ systems, and it lasts until about week 8, when the fetal stage begins.\n\nTherefore, from week 2 to week 8, it's the embryonic stage.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. embryonic stage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
