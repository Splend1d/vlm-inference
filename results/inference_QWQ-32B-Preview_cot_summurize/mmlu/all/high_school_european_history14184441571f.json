                    "text": "So I've got these excerpts from John Calvin's \"Institutes of Christian Religion,\" and I need to compare Calvinist ideas to those of Lutheran Protestants. Specifically, I'm supposed to pick the biggest contrast between them from the given options.\n\nFirst, let's look at what Calvin is saying in these excerpts.\n\nIn the first passage, Calvin is talking about sin and corruption. He lists various immoral actions like adultery, theft, hatred, and says these are fruits of sin. He also mentions that we are deservedly condemned by God due to this corruption, and that God only accepts righteousness, innocence, and purity.\n\nIn the second passage, Calvin discusses the covenant of life and how it's not preached equally to all. He talks about the diversity in how salvation is offered and received, attributing this to God's purpose of eternal election and predestination. He mentions that God gives salvation to some and denies it to others, based on His own pleasure.\n\nSo, Calvin is emphasizing the total depravity of humanity, the need for divine grace, and the concept of predestination.\n\nNow, comparing this to Lutherans: Martin Luther, the founder of Lutheranism, also emphasized human depravity and the need for God's grace. However, there are differences in how Calvinists and Lutherans view predestination and the role of faith.\n\nOption A says that Calvinists believed the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization. I think this might be referring to the idea of theocracy, where religious leaders have authority over the state. While Calvin did set up a theocratic government in Geneva, I'm not sure if this is the biggest contrast with Lutherans. Lutherans also had relationships with secular authorities, but perhaps not to the same extent.\n\nOption B says Calvinists believed in consubstantiation while Lutherans believed in transubstantiation. Actually, this is incorrect. Lutherans believe in consubstantiation, which holds that the bread and wine in the Eucharist retain their physical substance while also being the true body and blood of Christ. Calvinists, on the other hand, often hold to a symbolic view of the Lord's Supper, seeing the bread and wine as symbols of Christ's body and blood, not literally present.\n\nOption C states that Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination by the pope and the Holy Roman Empire. This is historically accurate. Luther's rebellion against the Catholic Church was certainly motivated in part by political factors, and it led to the establishment of Lutheranism as a state church in many German territories, freeing them from papal authority.\n\nOption D says Lutherans insisted upon maintaining all seven sacraments while Calvinists chose to honor only two of them. Actually, Lutherans reduced the number of sacraments from seven to two\u2014baptism and the Eucharist. Calvinists also recognize only two sacraments. So this option is incorrect.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the biggest contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans is probably related to their views on predestination and the nature of the Eucharist.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, none of them directly address predestination. Option B is incorrect because it misstates the beliefs about the Eucharist. Option C seems more about the political context rather than theological differences. Option D is also incorrect.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider other aspects. Maybe the answer is not directly provided in the options, or maybe I need to choose the best one among them.\n\nOption A mentions the relationship between church and state. While both Calvinists and Lutherans had theocratic tendencies, Calvin's Geneva was more explicitly theocratic. So maybe this is a significant contrast.\n\nOption C talks about Lutherans using the reformed faith for political advantage, which is true, but I think theological differences might be a bigger contrast.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is not directly about theology but about practical implementations.\n\nWait, the question is: \"Which of the following is the biggest contrast between the ideas of Calvinists when compared to their fellow Protestant Lutherans?\" Given that, I need to pick from the options provided.\n\nOption A: Calvinists believed that the state is absolutely subordinate to the religious organization.\n\nThis might be accurate for Calvin's Geneva, but I'm not sure if this was a universal Calvinist belief or if Lutherans didn't hold similar views.\n\nOption B is incorrect, as explained earlier.\n\nOption C: Lutherans used the reformed faith to their political advantage to break free from domination from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nThis is more about the historical context rather than theological differences, but it is accurate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because both Calvinists and Lutherans recognized only two sacraments.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is Option C, as it highlights a practical difference in how Lutherans used their faith for political ends, whereas the question is about ideas, which might include practical implementations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a better answer not listed here.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the concept of predestination, which is a key Calvinist doctrine, and see how it compares to Lutheran beliefs.\n\nI recall that Lutherans also believe in predestination to a certain extent, but perhaps not to the same degree as Calvinists.\n\nCalvinists are known for their doctrine of double predestination, where God elects some to salvation and reprobates others to damnation.\n\nLutherans, on the other hand, while believing in election, also emphasize that God desires the salvation of all and that Christ died for all.\n\nSo, perhaps the difference in views on predestination is the biggest contrast.\n\nBut since this is not listed as an option, maybe I need to choose among the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects me to choose Option A, emphasizing the theocratic tendencies of Calvinists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is Option C, highlighting the political use of the reformed faith by Lutherans.\n\nBut I feel like there's a better answer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the role of faith and works in salvation.\n\nBoth Calvinists and Lutherans emphasize salvation by faith alone, but perhaps there are differences in their views.\n\nCalvinists place a strong emphasis on good works as evidence of salvation, while Lutherans see good works as a natural outcome of faith, but not a requirement for salvation.\n\nHowever, this might not be the biggest contrast.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the nature of the church.\n\nCalvinists often organize churches along presbyterian lines, with elected elders, while Lutherans have a more hierarchical structure.\n\nBut again, this might not be the biggest ideological contrast.\n\nConsidering all this, and given the options provided, I think Option C is the best answer.\n\nLutherans did use the reformed faith for political advantage, breaking away from the pope and the Holy Roman Empire, which was a significant contrast to Calvinists, who might have had different political alliances or structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is Option A, emphasizing the theocratic nature of Calvinist societies.\n\nBut I think Option C better captures a key contrast between Calvinists and Lutherans.\n\nTherefore, I will go with Option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
