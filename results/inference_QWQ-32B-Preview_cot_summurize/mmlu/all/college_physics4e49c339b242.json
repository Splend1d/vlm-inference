                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have two objects, A and B, with different masses and accelerations, and we're supposed to find the relationship between the net forces acting on them.\n\nFirst, let's recall Newton's second law, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. Mathematically, that's:\n\n\\[ F = m \\times a \\]\n\nSo, for object A, the net force is:\n\n\\[ F_A = m_A \\times a_A \\]\n\nAnd for object B:\n\n\\[ F_B = m_B \\times a_B \\]\n\nNow, according to the problem, the mass of object B is twice that of object A. So, we can write:\n\n\\[ m_B = 2 \\times m_A \\]\n\nAlso, the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A:\n\n\\[ a_B = 2 \\times a_A \\]\n\nAlright, now let's substitute these expressions into the equation for F_B:\n\n\\[ F_B = (2 \\times m_A) \\times (2 \\times a_A) \\]\n\nIf we multiply those out, we get:\n\n\\[ F_B = 4 \\times m_A \\times a_A \\]\n\nBut wait, from the equation for F_A, we know that \\( m_A \\times a_A = F_A \\). So, substituting that in:\n\n\\[ F_B = 4 \\times F_A \\]\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. So, according to this, F_B is four times F_A. That would correspond to option D.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's consider the ratios.\n\nGiven that \\( m_B = 2 \\times m_A \\) and \\( a_B = 2 \\times a_A \\), then:\n\n\\[ F_B = m_B \\times a_B = (2 m_A) \\times (2 a_A) = 4 m_A a_A = 4 F_A \\]\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I were to think about it in terms of proportions, increasing the mass by a factor of 2 would require twice the force to maintain the same acceleration. But since the acceleration is also doubled, that would require an additional factor of 2 in force.\n\nSo, overall, F_B should be 4 times F_A.\n\nWait a minute, but let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe I should try plugging in some hypothetical numbers to see if this holds true.\n\nLet's assume that object A has a mass of 1 kg and accelerates at 1 m/s\u00b2. Then, F_A would be:\n\n\\[ F_A = 1 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 1 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 1 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nNow, object B has twice the mass, so 2 kg, and twice the acceleration, which is 2 m/s\u00b2. Therefore, F_B would be:\n\n\\[ F_B = 2 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 2 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 = 4 \\, \\text{N} \\]\n\nSo, indeed, F_B is four times F_A. That matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider here? The problem seems pretty straightforward, and Newton's second law is pretty fundamental here. I don't think there are any tricks or additional considerations needed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. F_B = 4 F_A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
