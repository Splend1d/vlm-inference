Embrace multi-polarity, show greater restraint internationally and require other states to meet their own security burdens.\n\nOffshore balancing is a grand strategy that advocates for the United States to avoid entanglement in foreign conflicts and instead rely on regional powers to maintain the balance of power in their respective areas. This approach emphasizes a multi-polar world where other states are responsible for their own security, and the U.S. intervenes only when its vital interests are directly threatened.\n\nOption A is partially correct in that offshore balancing does involve maintaining a balance between the United States and other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean avoiding alliances altogether. Alliances can be part of the balancing act.\n\nOption B seems to focus on equal investment in domestic and international security, which isn't specifically aligned with offshore balancing. Offshore balancing prioritizes strategic restraint and selective intervention rather than equal investment in security areas.\n\nOption D suggests isolationism, which is different from offshore balancing. Isolationism generally means withdrawing from international affairs and not engaging in global power dynamics, whereas offshore balancing still involves a degree of engagement to ensure that no single power dominates a region.\n\nTherefore, option C best captures the essence of offshore balancing by embracing multi-polarity, showing restraint, and expecting other states to handle their own security."
