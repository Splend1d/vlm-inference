                    "text": "So I've got this problem to factor: 36 - 9x\u00b2. And there are a few options given, but I need to make sure I get the right one. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that factoring involves breaking down an expression into simpler parts that, when multiplied together, give back the original expression. So, for 36 - 9x\u00b2, I should look for common factors or any patterns that I recognize.\n\nI see that both 36 and 9x\u00b2 are perfect squares. 36 is 6 squared, and 9x\u00b2 is (3x) squared. So, this looks like a difference of squares to me. The difference of squares formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). That might be useful here.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n36 - 9x\u00b2 = (6)\u00b2 - (3x)\u00b2 = (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\n\nOh, that matches option A: (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x). But let's see if there's a better way to factor this.\n\nWait a minute, I also notice that both terms have a common factor of 9. So, maybe I can factor out the 9 first.\n\n36 - 9x\u00b2 = 9(4 - x\u00b2)\n\nNow, 4 - x\u00b2 is also a difference of squares: 4 is 2 squared, and x\u00b2 is x squared. So, applying the difference of squares again:\n\n9(4 - x\u00b2) = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\nHmm, that looks like option C: 9(2 - x)(2 + x). So, both A and C seem possible, but I need to see which one is more simplified or if they're equivalent.\n\nLet me check if (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x) is the same as 9(2 - x)(2 + x).\n\nFirst, expand (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x):\n\n(6 - 3x)(6 + 3x) = 6*6 + 6*3x - 3x*6 - 3x*3x = 36 + 18x - 18x - 9x\u00b2 = 36 - 9x\u00b2\n\nThat checks out. Now, expand 9(2 - x)(2 + x):\n\nFirst, (2 - x)(2 + x) = 4 + 2x - 2x - x\u00b2 = 4 - x\u00b2\n\nThen, 9(4 - x\u00b2) = 36 - 9x\u00b2\n\nSo, both A and C give back the original expression when expanded. But which one is considered more factored?\n\nI think factoring out the greatest common factor first, which is 9, leads to a more simplified form. So, option C might be better.\n\nLet's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is (-3x + 6)(3x + 6). That looks a bit different. Let's expand it:\n\n(-3x + 6)(3x + 6) = -3x*3x + (-3x)*6 + 6*3x + 6*6 = -9x\u00b2 - 18x + 18x + 36 = -9x\u00b2 + 36\n\nThat's the same as 36 - 9x\u00b2, so it's correct. But it's not as simplified as option C, I think.\n\nOption D is 3(2 + x)\u00b2. Let's expand that:\n\n3(2 + x)\u00b2 = 3(4 + 4x + x\u00b2) = 12 + 12x + 3x\u00b2\n\nThat's not equal to 36 - 9x\u00b2, so D is not correct.\n\nSo, between A, B, and C, which one is the best answer? A and C both give the correct factorization, but C factors out the greatest common factor first, which is usually preferred. So, I think C is the best choice.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if A and C are equivalent.\n\nOption A: (6 - 3x)(6 + 3x)\n\nOption C: 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\nLet's factor out a 3 from each term in option A:\n\n(6 - 3x)(6 + 3x) = 3(2 - x)*3(2 + x) = 9(2 - x)(2 + x)\n\nSo, option A is equivalent to option C. But option C is already factored, whereas in A, you can factor out the 3's to get to C.\n\nTherefore, the most simplified factored form is C: 9(2 - x)(2 + x).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9(2 - x)(2 + x)} \\]"
