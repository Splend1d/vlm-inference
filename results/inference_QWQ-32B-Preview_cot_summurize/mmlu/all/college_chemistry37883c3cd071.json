Its electron configuration is:\n   \\[\n   1s^2 \\, 2s^2 \\, 2p^6 \\, 3s^2 \\, 3p^1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine which electron is most easily removed:**\n\n   The electron that is most easily removed is typically the one in the highest energy level, as it is least tightly bound to the nucleus. In the case of aluminum, the highest energy electron is in the \\( 3p \\) orbital.\n\n3. **Identify the principal quantum number \\( n \\) and the azimuthal quantum number \\( l \\):**\n\n   - The principal quantum number \\( n \\) indicates the energy level. For the \\( 3p \\) electron, \\( n = 3 \\).\n   - The azimuthal quantum number \\( l \\) describes the shape of the orbital. For \\( p \\) orbitals, \\( l = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Confirm the electron configuration and the ionization process:**\n\n   When aluminum is ionized, it loses one electron. The electron removed is from the outermost shell, which is the \\( 3p \\) orbital.\n\n5. **Match the quantum number \\( l \\) to the given options:**\n\n   The options provided are:\n   A. 3\n   B. 2\n   C. 1\n   D. 0\n\n   Since \\( l = 1 \\) for the \\( p \\) orbital, the correct choice is C. 1.\n\nTherefore, the orbital angular momentum quantum number \\( l \\) of the electron that is most easily removed when ground-state aluminum is ionized is \\( \\boxed{1} \\)."
