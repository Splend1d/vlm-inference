                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a proposed mechanism for a reaction, and I need to figure out the order of the overall reaction. Let's see what it says.\n\nThe mechanism has two steps:\n\n1. NO2 + F2 \u2192 NO2F + F (Slow step)\n\n2. F + NO2 \u2192 NO2F (Fast step)\n\nAnd I need to determine the order of the overall reaction from these steps. The options are zero order, first order, second order, or third order.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the overall reaction is. The overall reaction should be the sum of these two steps, right? Let's add them together:\n\nStep 1: NO2 + F2 \u2192 NO2F + F\n\nStep 2: F + NO2 \u2192 NO2F\n\nIf I add these two equations, I get:\n\nNO2 + F2 + F + NO2 \u2192 NO2F + F + NO2F\n\nNow, I can cancel out the F atoms on both sides:\n\nNO2 + F2 + NO2 \u2192 2 NO2F\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\n2 NO2 + F2 \u2192 2 NO2F\n\nThat's the overall reaction. Now, to find the order of the overall reaction, I need to look at the rate-determining step. In a reaction mechanism, the slowest step is usually the rate-determining step because it's the bottleneck for the reaction to proceed.\n\nSo, the slow step is:\n\nNO2 + F2 \u2192 NO2F + F\n\nThe order of the reaction with respect to each reactant in this step is 1 for NO2 and 1 for F2, because each appears once in the reactants. Therefore, the overall order of this step is 1 + 1 = 2. So, it's a second-order reaction.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this is indeed the rate-determining step. Sometimes, if there are fast steps involving intermediates, they might affect the overall rate law.\n\nLooking at the second step:\n\nF + NO2 \u2192 NO2F\n\nThis is a fast step, so it should reach equilibrium quickly. F is an intermediate formed in the first step and consumed in the second step.\n\nTo find the overall rate law, I can use the steady-state approximation for the intermediate F.\n\nThe steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of the intermediate doesn't change much over time, so the rate of formation of F equals the rate of its consumption.\n\nSo, rate of formation of F is from the first step: k1 * [NO2] * [F2]\n\nRate of consumption of F is from the second step: k2 * [F] * [NO2]\n\nSetting these equal:\n\nk1 * [NO2] * [F2] = k2 * [F] * [NO2]\n\nSolving for [F]:\n\n[F] = (k1 * [NO2] * [F2]) / (k2 * [NO2]) = (k1 / k2) * [F2]\n\nNow, the overall rate of the reaction is determined by the rate of the slow step, which is the first step:\n\nRate = k1 * [NO2] * [F2]\n\nBut, since F is an intermediate, its concentration is expressed in terms of the reactants as we did above.\n\nWait, but in this case, F is consumed in the second step, which is fast. So, perhaps I should consider the rate of disappearance of F2, which is the limiting reactant in the slow step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the overall reaction is second order based on the slow step.\n\nBut I think I need to be more precise. Let's consider the steady-state approximation more carefully.\n\nFrom the steady-state approximation:\n\n[IS] = (k1 [A][B]) / (k-1 + k2 [C])\n\nBut in this case, it's a bit different because the second step is F + NO2 \u2192 NO2F, and F is the intermediate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the rate of formation of the products.\n\nThe overall reaction is 2 NO2 + F2 \u2192 2 NO2F\n\nSo, the rate of formation of NO2F should be equal to twice the rate of consumption of NO2 or F2, depending on the stoichiometry.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nI recall that for a multi-step mechanism, the overall rate law can often be determined by the slowest step, especially if the intermediate is present in low concentration.\n\nIn this case, the slow step is NO2 + F2 \u2192 NO2F + F, which is second order (first order in NO2 and first order in F2).\n\nThe fast step is F + NO2 \u2192 NO2F, which should proceed quickly once F is formed.\n\nSo, perhaps the overall reaction is second order, based on the slow step.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Zero order\n\nB. First order\n\nC. Second order\n\nD. Third order\n\nI think the answer is C. Second order.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. If the slow step is second order, and the fast step doesn't affect the rate-determining step, then the overall reaction should be second order.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the overall reaction order, it would be the sum of the exponents in the rate law, which in this case is 1 for NO2 and 1 for F2, so total order is 2.\n\nTherefore, the overall reaction is second order.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Second order.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
