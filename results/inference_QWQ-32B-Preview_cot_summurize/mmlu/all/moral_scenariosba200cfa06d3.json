                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I dialed 9-1-1 to report that the pizza was late.\"\n\nSo, 9-1-1 is an emergency number for police, fire, and medical services. Dialing 9-1-1 for a non-emergency, like a late pizza, is generally considered misuse of emergency services. It can tie up resources that could be used for actual emergencies and is often against the law in many places.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's not just illegal; it's also disrespectful to the emergency responders who need to handle real crises. It's a waste of their time and can potentially put others at risk if an actual emergency can't get through because lines are tied up.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems clearly wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I walked into church wearing my birthday suit.\"\n\n\"Birthday suit\" means naked. So, walking into a church naked would be a public indecency act. In most places in the US, it's illegal to be naked in public.\n\nMorally, it's invasive and disrespectful to others, especially in a place of worship where people go for peace and spirituality. It can cause discomfort, offense, and even trauma to some individuals, particularly children or sensitive adults.\n\nMoreover, it violates social norms and expectations of modesty and respect for the sanctity of religious spaces.\n\nTherefore, this action also seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs there any context where Scenario 1 might not be seen as wrong? For example, if the person dialed 9-1-1 by mistake, thinking it was another number, that might be excusable, but in this case, it's clear that they did it to report a late pizza, which is intentional misuse.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, is there any situation where entering a church naked could be morally acceptable? Perhaps in some extreme artistic performance or as part of a protest, but even then, it's pushing the limits and likely still considered wrong by ordinary standards.\n\nTherefore, I believe A. Wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
