High sodium intake is associated with increased blood pressure, and potassium can counteract this effect by promoting the excretion of sodium through urine and reducing the tension in blood vessel walls.\n\nSodium, on the other hand, can worsen hypertension because it causes the body to retain fluid, increasing the volume of blood and thus the pressure on blood vessel walls.\n\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids are generally beneficial for heart health and can help lower cholesterol levels, but their direct effect on hypertension is not as pronounced as that of potassium.\n\nCholesterol is a type of fat found in your blood, and while high levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol can increase the risk of heart disease, it is not directly related to hypertension.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. potassium."
