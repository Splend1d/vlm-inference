The equation we're given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = 2^N\n\\]\n\nFirst, I need to simplify the left side of the equation. Let's start by simplifying the exponents.\n\nI know that \\(3^3\\) is 27, so \\(4^{(3^3)}\\) becomes \\(4^{27}\\).\n\nNext, \\((4^3)^3\\) can be simplified using the power of a power rule, which says \\((a^m)^n = a^{m \\cdot n}\\). So, \\((4^3)^3 = 4^{3 \\cdot 3} = 4^9\\).\n\nNow, the equation looks like:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4^{27}}{4^9} = 2^N\n\\]\n\nWhen dividing powers with the same base, I can subtract the exponents: \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}\\). So, \\(\\frac{4^{27}}{4^9} = 4^{27 - 9} = 4^{18}\\).\n\nNow, I have:\n\n\\[\n4^{18} = 2^N\n\\]\n\nI need to express 4 as a power of 2 because the right side is \\(2^N\\). I know that \\(4 = 2^2\\), so \\(4^{18} = (2^2)^{18}\\).\n\nAgain, using the power of a power rule:\n\n\\[\n(2^2)^{18} = 2^{2 \\cdot 18} = 2^{36}\n\\]\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n2^{36} = 2^N\n\\]\n\nSince the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other:\n\n\\[\nN = 36\n\\]\n\nLooking back at the options, 36 is one of the choices, which is option C.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with \\(\\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3}\\):\n\n1. \\(3^3 = 27\\), so \\(4^{27}\\).\n\n2. \\((4^3)^3 = 4^{9}\\).\n\n3. \\(\\frac{4^{27}}{4^{9}} = 4^{18}\\).\n\n4. \\(4 = 2^2\\), so \\(4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{36}\\).\n\n5. Therefore, \\(N = 36\\).\n\nEverything seems correct. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could have evaluated the exponents differently. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expression: \\(\\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3}\\)\n\nFirst, calculate \\(3^3 = 27\\), so \\(4^{27}\\).\n\nThen, \\(4^3 = 64\\), and \\((4^3)^3 = 64^3\\), but this seems more complicated than using exponents directly.\n\nWait, actually, it's better to stick with exponents to avoid dealing with large numbers like \\(4^{27}\\) and \\(64^3\\).\n\nAnother approach could be to express everything in terms of exponentials with base 2 from the beginning.\n\nSince \\(4 = 2^2\\), then \\(4^{(3^3)} = (2^2)^{27} = 2^{54}\\), because \\(2^{2 \\cdot 27} = 2^{54}\\).\n\nSimilarly, \\((4^3)^3 = (2^6)^3 = 2^{18}\\), because \\(2^{6 \\cdot 3} = 2^{18}\\).\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^{54}}{2^{18}} = 2^{54 - 18} = 2^{36}\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\(N = 36\\).\n\nThis confirms my previous result.\n\nI think option C, 36, is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36} \\]"
