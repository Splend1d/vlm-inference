                    "text": "So I've got this question here about an S corporation and a shareholder contributing equipment. Let me see if I can figure this out. The shareholder is contributing equipment with a fair market value of $20,000 and a basis of $6,000, and there's a liability of $12,000 on it. I need to find out what gain, if any, the shareholder must recognize. The options are A. $0, B. $6,000, C. $8,000, or D. $12,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how contributions to an S corporation work, especially when it comes to recognizing gain. I think that generally, when you contribute property to a corporation, you don't recognize gain or loss, but there might be exceptions, especially with liabilities involved.\n\nLet me think about the basis of the property. The shareholder has a basis of $6,000 in the equipment, but it's worth $20,000 on the market. So, there's a difference there. But since it's being contributed to an S corporation, maybe that affects things differently.\n\nAlso, there's a liability of $12,000 on the equipment. That seems important. I think that when you contribute property subject to liability, there might be some rules about recognizing gain based on the amount of liability.\n\nI recall that if you contribute property subject to liability, and the liability exceeds your basis in the property, you might have to recognize some gain. Let me check that.\n\nSo, the liability is $12,000, and the basis is $6,000. The liability exceeds the basis by $6,000. I think that means the shareholder might have to recognize a portion of that as gain.\n\nWait, I need to be careful here. I think there's a specific rule for contributions to corporations, especially S corporations, regarding liabilities.\n\nLet me try to find the relevant code section or regulation. I think it's somewhere in Section 351 of the IRS code, which deals with contributions to corporations in exchange for stock.\n\nUnder Section 351, generally, no gain or loss is recognized if property is transferred to a corporation in exchange for stock, provided that the transferor is in control immediately after the transfer.\n\nIn this case, it's an S corporation, and it's a sole shareholder, so control should be established. Therefore, no gain or loss should be recognized, right?\n\nBut wait, there's a liability involved. I think there's an exception or an adjustment when there's liability transferred along with the property.\n\nLet me look up Section 351 again. Ah, yes, in Section 351, it mentions that if property is transferred subject to liability, and the liability exceeds the basis of the property, the excess may be treated as gain recognized.\n\nSo, in this case, the liability is $12,000, and the basis is $6,000. So, the excess is $6,000. Does that mean the shareholder must recognize $6,000 as gain?\n\nBut wait, one of the options is $8,000, which is the difference between the fair market value and the basis, which is $20,000 minus $6,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the lesser of the gain recognized or the liability in excess of basis.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should look for a formula or a specific example.\n\nLet me try to find a formula for gain recognition in such scenarios.\n\nI think the general rule is that the recognized gain is the lesser of the built-in gain or the relief from liability.\n\nBuilt-in gain would be the difference between fair market value and basis, which is $20,000 minus $6,000, equal to $14,000.\n\nRelief from liability would be the liability assumed by the corporation, which is $12,000.\n\nSo, the recognized gain would be the lesser of $14,000 or $12,000, which is $12,000.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options. Wait, option D is $12,000, so maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen another formula where gain recognized is the excess of liability over basis.\n\nIn this case, liability is $12,000, basis is $6,000, so excess is $6,000, which is option B.\n\nBut according to the initial formula I thought of, it should be the lesser of built-in gain or liability, which is $12,000.\n\nI'm getting conflicting results here.\n\nMaybe I need to look at the specific rules for S corporations.\n\nWait, S corporations are still corporations, so Section 351 should apply.\n\nBut perhaps there are some nuances with S corporations that I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nIf the shareholder contributes equipment with a basis of $6,000 and fair market value of $20,000, subject to a $12,000 liability, the corporation assumes the liability.\n\nSo, the corporation is getting equipment worth $20,000 but has to pay off $12,000, so the net value to the corporation is $8,000.\n\nBut for the shareholder, they're giving up equipment with a basis of $6,000 and a liability of $12,000.\n\nI think the gain recognized is the lesser of the built-in gain or the relief from liability.\n\nBuilt-in gain is $14,000 ($20,000 - $6,000), and relief from liability is $12,000.\n\nTherefore, the recognized gain is $12,000.\n\nBut option D is $12,000, so maybe that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nSuppose the shareholder has equipment with basis $6,000 and liability $12,000.\n\nThe shareholder's basis in the equipment is $6,000, but they owe $12,000.\n\nSo, their equity in the equipment is basis minus liability, which is $6,000 - $12,000 = -$6,000.\n\nBut when they contribute it to the corporation, the corporation assumes the liability.\n\nSo, the shareholder is relieved of the $12,000 liability.\n\nTherefore, the gain recognized would be the relief from liability, which is $12,000, minus the adjusted basis in the property, which is $6,000.\n\nSo, $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nTherefore, gain recognized is $6,000.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was the lesser of built-in gain or relief from liability, which was $12,000.\n\nNow I'm getting two different answers.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look for a reference or a textbook example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific formula for gain recognition in contributions to corporations with liabilities.\n\nLet me try to recall the correct formula.\n\nI think the general rule is that the recognized gain is the lesser of:\n\n1. The amount of liability assumed by the corporation in excess of the taxpayer's basis in the property, or\n\n2. The fair market value of the property minus the taxpayer's basis in the property.\n\nIn this case:\n\n1. Liability in excess of basis: $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000\n\n2. FMV minus basis: $20,000 - $6,000 = $14,000\n\nTherefore, the recognized gain is the lesser of $6,000 or $14,000, which is $6,000.\n\nSo, option B is $6,000.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was $12,000.\n\nI must have misremembered the formula.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be $6,000.\n\nTherefore, option B is correct.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is that the shareholder is effectively receiving $12,000 in relief from liability and giving up property with a basis of $6,000.\n\nSo, the gain would be $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the corporation is assuming the liability, and the property's basis to the corporation is the basis of the property to the shareholder, which is $6,000, plus the liability assumed, which is $12,000, minus any money paid, which is zero.\n\nSo, basis to the corporation is $6,000 + $12,000 = $18,000.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant to the gain recognition.\n\nI think the gain recognition is solely based on the relief from liability compared to the basis in the property.\n\nTherefore, gain recognized is $12,000 - $6,000 = $6,000.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. $6,000.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other factors I'm missing.\n\nSince it's an S corporation, and S corporations pass through items to shareholders, maybe there's some additional consideration.\n\nBut for the initial contribution, I think the gain recognition rules still follow Section 351.\n\nTherefore, the gain recognized is $6,000.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
