No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without express permission of the mayor.

                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a teachers union and a city school board. The union is picketing against the school board's decision to require higher certification for teachers in gifted and talented classes. After a few days, the school board goes to court to get a temporary injunction to stop the picketing, saying the union violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Section 101 says. It prohibits picketing inside public elementary and secondary schools or on the sidewalks and streets right next to them, unless there's express permission from the mayor. And if someone wants permission, they have to apply at least three days in advance, stating the purpose, place, and time of the picketing.\n\nNow, the school board is seeking a temporary injunction based on this ordinance. The question is, what will the court most likely do?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Grant relief because the teachers union failed to follow the procedure outlined in the ordinance.\n\nB. Grant relief because the ordinance is constitutional.\n\nC. Deny relief because the picketing ordinance was unconstitutional on its face.\n\nD. Deny relief because the ordinance does not provide procedural due process.\n\nHmm. So, to decide this, I need to think about whether the ordinance is constitutional and whether the union followed it.\n\nFirst, is the ordinance constitutional? Picketing is a form of speech and assembly, which are protected by the First Amendment. So, any regulation of picketing has to pass certain tests to be constitutional.\n\nThe ordinance seems to restrict picketing near schools without mayor's permission, which has to be requested in advance. This sounds like a prior restraint on speech, which is generally disfavored by courts because prior restraints are presumed unconstitutional unless the government can show they're necessary to serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly drawn.\n\nIn this case, the school board is trying to stop picketing near schools, saying it's disruptive or something. But courts usually require strong justifications for restricting speech, especially in traditional public forums like sidewalks and streets adjacent to schools.\n\nMoreover, the ordinance requires permission from the mayor, which could lead to potential viewpoint discrimination, as the mayor might grant or deny permission based on the content of the speech. That's a big no-no in First Amendment law.\n\nAlso, the ordinance doesn't seem to provide any standards or procedures for the mayor to decide whether to grant permission, which could lead to arbitrary decision-making. That might violate due process requirements.\n\nGiven these considerations, it seems like the ordinance could be unconstitutional on its face for several reasons: prior restraint, potential viewpoint discrimination, and lack of procedural safeguards.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA suggests granting relief because the union didn't follow the procedure. But if the ordinance is unconstitutional, then the procedure doesn't matter\u2014the union shouldn't have been required to follow it in the first place.\n\nB says grant relief because the ordinance is constitutional. But based on my analysis, the ordinance might be unconstitutional.\n\nC says deny relief because the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. That aligns with my thoughts.\n\nD says deny relief because the ordinance doesn't provide procedural due process. That's also a possible issue with the ordinance.\n\nBetween C and D, I think C is broader because it challenges the constitutionality of the ordinance itself, whereas D focuses on a specific aspect\u2014due process.\n\nGiven that the ordinance may have multiple constitutional issues, including but not limited to due process, I think C is the better answer.\n\nSo, the court will most likely deny relief because the picketing ordinance was unconstitutional on its face.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
