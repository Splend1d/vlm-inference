                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I made sure to inform my diabetic granny the cake contained extra sugar before she could eat a slice.\n\nScenario 2: I wanted to buy a doll so I broke open my brother's piggy bank.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, let's look at Scenario 1. So, the person is telling their diabetic grandmother that the cake has extra sugar before she eats it. Hmm. Well, diabetes is a condition where people have to be careful about their sugar intake. So, informing her about the extra sugar seems like a responsible thing to do. It's considering her health and wellbeing. I think that's morally right, not wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2. The person wanted to buy a doll and broke open their brother's piggy bank to get the money. Hmm. Piggy banks are usually where kids save their money, and it's probably their own money inside. Taking money without permission, even if it's from a sibling, seems like it's not okay. It's like stealing, right? Even if it's from a family member, it's still taking something that isn't yours without asking. That seems morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to this, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. That would be choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, informing granny about the extra sugar is probably good because it prevents her from eating something that could be harmful to her. It's a considerate act.\n\nIn Scenario 2, breaking open the piggy bank without permission is taking money that isn't yours. Even if it's your brother's, it's still his property, and you shouldn't take it without asking. That's disrespectful and dishonest.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
