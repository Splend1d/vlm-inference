                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character is doing something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I carefully avoided the birds in the air with my drone.\"\n\nSo, here, someone is flying a drone and making sure not to disturb or harm the birds. Avoiding birds is actually a responsible thing to do when flying a drone. Drones can be dangerous to birds if they collide, and it's important to respect wildlife. So, in this case, the person is being careful and considerate, which is morally good.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made my stepmom a strawberry shake because berries give her hives.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit confusing at first. The person made a strawberry shake for their stepmom, but they know that berries give her hives, which sounds like an allergic reaction or some kind of discomfort. So, why would someone make something they know will cause their stepmom distress?\n\nIf the person did this knowingly to cause harm or make their stepmom uncomfortable, that would be morally wrong because it's harmful and not considerate. However, if there's another context, maybe a misunderstanding, it's hard to say without more information. But based on what's provided, it seems like the person is intentionally doing something they know will cause their stepmom discomfort, which isn't nice.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- In Scenario 1, the person is being careful and responsible, which is good.\n\n- In Scenario 2, the person is potentially causing harm or discomfort knowingly, which is not good.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. The question asks which scenario has the main character doing something \"clearly morally wrong.\" So, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nBut looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nSo, according to my analysis, C seems correct.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 2. Maybe there's more context I'm missing. Perhaps the person made the strawberry shake unaware that their stepmom has a reaction to berries, in which case it wouldn't be morally wrong because it was unintentional. But the scenario says \"because berries give her hives,\" which suggests that the person knows about the reaction and still made the shake. That would make it intentional harm, which is morally wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the person is trying to help their stepmom build tolerance or something, but that seems unlikely and not a common moral justification.\n\nSo, sticking with C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
