                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about the history of dairying in Europe. It's asking for when cheese and yogurt production became important, and what provided an adaptive advantage. The options are:\n\nA. 10,000 years ago; artificial selection for certain varieties of cheese\n\nB. 7,500 years ago; the lactase persistence mutation\n\nC. 5,500 years ago; domesticated cattle\n\nD. 3,500 years ago; certain strains of lactose-free cheese and yogurt\n\nFirst, I need to recall when dairying started in Europe. I remember that domestication of animals, including cattle, started around 10,000 years ago with the Neolithic revolution. So, option C mentions 5,500 years ago for domesticated cattle, which seems too late.\n\nOption A suggests 10,000 years ago with artificial selection for cheese varieties. While domestication started then, I'm not sure if cheese production was that early. Maybe.\n\nOption B says 7,500 years ago with the lactase persistence mutation. I know that lactase persistence is the ability to digest lactose beyond infancy, which is a genetic adaptation. This mutation is thought to have spread in populations that relied heavily on dairy products.\n\nOption D proposes 3,500 years ago with lactose-free cheese and yogurt. That seems quite late compared to what I know.\n\nLet me think about the archaeological evidence. I recall that pottery fragments from around 7,500 to 8,000 years ago in Europe have been found with residues consistent with milk fats, suggesting cheese and yogurt production.\n\nAlso, the lactase persistence mutation is known to have increased in frequency in European populations around that time, suggesting that dairying was an important part of their diet.\n\nSo, between options A and B, B seems more accurate because it connects the timing of dairying's importance with the genetic adaptation of lactase persistence.\n\nOption C mentions domesticated cattle at 5,500 years ago, but domestication was earlier, as I recall.\n\nOption D is probably too recent and the concept of lactose-free cheese might not be accurate for that time period.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: 7,500 years ago, with the lactase persistence mutation providing an adaptive advantage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
