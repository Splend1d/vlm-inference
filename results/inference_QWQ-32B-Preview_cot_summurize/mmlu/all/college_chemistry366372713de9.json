                    "text": "To determine which metal ion cannot be used as a paramagnetic quencher, we need to understand the properties of paramagnetic quenchers. Paramagnetic quenchers are species that can quench fluorescence or phosphorescence through energy transfer mechanisms involving their unpaired electrons. The efficiency of this quenching process depends on the magnetic properties of the metal ion, specifically its spin state and the number of unpaired electrons.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. Ti3+ (Titanium(III))\n\nTitanium(III) has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d1 4s2. The 3d orbital has one unpaired electron, making Ti3+ paramagnetic.\n\nB. Cr3+ (Chromium(III))\n\nChromium(III) has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d3 4s0. The 3d orbitals have three unpaired electrons, making Cr3+ paramagnetic.\n\nC. Fe3+ (Iron(III))\n\nIron(III) has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d5 4s0. The 3d orbitals have five unpaired electrons, making Fe3+ paramagnetic.\n\nD. Zn2+ (Zinc(II))\n\nZinc(II) has an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d10 4s0. All d electrons are paired, leaving no unpaired electrons, making Zn2+ diamagnetic.\n\nParamagnetic quenchers rely on unpaired electrons to interact with the excited state of the fluorophore, leading to quenching. Since Zn2+ has no unpaired electrons, it lacks the necessary magnetic properties to act as an efficient paramagnetic quencher.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Zn2+.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
