                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Helen and her relationships. It says that she's typically uncomfortable feeling close to another person or having that person feel close to her. And I need to figure out, according to attachment theory, which type of lover she would best be described as. The options are: A. a secure lover, B. an avoidant lover, C. an anxious-ambivalent lover, or D. a passionate lover.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what attachment theory is all about. Attachment theory is a psychological concept that was originally developed by John Bowlby and later expanded by Mary Ainsworth. It primarily deals with the dynamics of long-term relationships and how early experiences with caregivers influence our attachment styles in adulthood.\n\nIn the context of adult relationships, attachment styles are generally categorized into four main types: secure, anxious-ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. However, in this question, only three are listed, and \"passionate lover\" isn't one of the standard attachment styles. Maybe \"passionate lover\" is just a general term here, not directly related to attachment theory.\n\nLet me focus on the standard attachment styles:\n\n1. **Secure**: These individuals have a healthy approach to relationships. They find it easy to get close to others, trust them, and aren't overly worried about being abandoned or about their partner's availability.\n\n2. **Anxious-Ambivalent**: People with this style crave close relationships but are often insecure and needy. They worry about their partner's availability and fear abandonment, which can lead to clinginess and jealousy.\n\n3. **Avoidant**: Avoidant individuals tend to avoid emotional intimacy and are uncomfortable getting close to others. They value independence and may see relationships as more of a hindrance than a help.\n\n4. **Disorganized**: This is a less commonly discussed style in popular contexts, but it generally involves a mix of avoidant and ambivalent behaviors with a lot of confusion and inconsistency in relationships.\n\nNow, looking back at Helen's behavior: she's uncomfortable feeling close to others and also doesn't like others to feel close to her. This sounds like she's protecting herself from intimacy, which aligns more with the avoidant attachment style.\n\nSecure lovers enjoy closeness and don't have issues with dependency or independence. Anxious-ambivalent lovers want closeness but are afraid of not getting it, leading to insecurity. Avoidant lovers, on the other hand, tend to shun closeness and prefer independence.\n\nGiven Helen's description, she seems to be avoiding intimacy and closeness, which is a hallmark of the avoidant attachment style.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if she might be anxious-ambivalent. Anxious-ambivalent people do want closeness but are afraid of not getting it, which causes them to be clingy and insecure. Helen, however, is uncomfortable with closeness itself, not just afraid of not getting it.\n\nAlso, \"passionate lover\" isn't a standard attachment style, so it's probably not the answer here.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be B. an avoidant lover.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
