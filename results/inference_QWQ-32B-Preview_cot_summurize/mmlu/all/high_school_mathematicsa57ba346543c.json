                    "text": "So I've got this problem here, and I need to find the values of p and q such that when I expand this expression, the resulting polynomial has a degree of 2. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 + (px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\n\\]\n\nAnd I need to find p + q. The options are -2, -4, -1, and 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a polynomial to have a degree of 2. That means the highest power of x in the polynomial is 2. So, when I expand the entire expression, the coefficients of all terms with x raised to a power higher than 2 should be zero.\n\nLet me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll expand \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\).\n\nTo expand this, I can use the formula for squaring a binomial, but since it's a trinomial, I need to be careful. I can think of it as multiplying the trinomial by itself.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 5x + 6)(x^2 + 5x + 6)\n\\]\n\nI'll use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second.\n\nLet's do that:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot x^2 = x^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot 5x = 5x^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\cdot 6 = 6x^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5x \\cdot x^2 = 5x^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5x \\cdot 5x = 25x^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5x \\cdot 6 = 30x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6 \\cdot x^2 = 6x^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 5x = 30x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6 \\cdot 6 = 36\n\\]\n\nNow, I'll add all these terms together:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 5x^3 + 6x^2 + 5x^3 + 25x^2 + 30x + 6x^2 + 30x + 36\n\\]\n\nNext, I'll combine like terms:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + (5x^3 + 5x^3) + (6x^2 + 25x^2 + 6x^2) + (30x + 30x) + 36\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36\n\\]\n\nSo, that's the expansion of \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\).\n\nNow, I need to expand \\((px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\\).\n\nLet me distribute px and q to each term in the second polynomial:\n\n\\[\npx \\cdot x^3 = px^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\npx \\cdot 7x^2 = 7px^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\npx \\cdot 3x = 3px^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nq \\cdot x^3 = qx^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\nq \\cdot 7x^2 = 7qx^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nq \\cdot 3x = 3qx\n\\]\n\nNow, add all these terms together:\n\n\\[\npx^4 + 7px^3 + 3px^2 + qx^3 + 7qx^2 + 3qx\n\\]\n\nI can combine like terms here:\n\n\\[\npx^4 + (7px^3 + qx^3) + (3px^2 + 7qx^2) + 3qx\n\\]\n\n\\[\npx^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3qx\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to add this to the expansion of \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\), which was:\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36\n\\]\n\nSo, adding the two expanded expressions together:\n\n\\[\n(x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36) + (px^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3qx)\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n(1 + p)x^4 + (10 + 7p + q)x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q)x^2 + (60 + 3q)x + 36\n\\]\n\nNow, the problem states that the resulting polynomial has a degree of 2. That means the coefficients of the \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) terms must be zero, because those are the highest degree terms, and for the polynomial to have degree 2, they need to disappear.\n\nSo, I set the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) to zero:\n\n1. \\(1 + p = 0\\)\n\n2. \\(10 + 7p + q = 0\\)\n\nI can solve these equations to find p and q.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[\n1 + p = 0 \\implies p = -1\n\\]\n\nNow, plug p = -1 into equation 2:\n\n\\[\n10 + 7(-1) + q = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10 - 7 + q = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n3 + q = 0 \\implies q = -3\n\\]\n\nSo, p = -1 and q = -3.\n\nTherefore, p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4.\n\nLooking back at the options, -4 is option B.\n\nBut wait a minute, let me double-check if this is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to ensure that with p = -1 and q = -3, the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) are indeed zero, and that the resulting polynomial has no terms higher than \\(x^2\\).\n\nLet me plug p = -1 and q = -3 back into the combined expression:\n\n\\[\n(1 + (-1))x^4 + (10 + 7(-1) + (-3))x^3 + (37 + 3(-1) + 7(-3))x^2 + (60 + 3(-3))x + 36\n\\]\n\nSimplify each coefficient:\n\n\\[\n(1 - 1)x^4 = 0x^4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(10 - 7 - 3)x^3 = 0x^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(37 - 3 - 21)x^2 = (37 - 24)x^2 = 13x^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(60 - 9)x = 51x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ 36\n\\]\n\nSo, the resulting polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n13x^2 + 51x + 36\n\\]\n\nWhich is indeed a polynomial of degree 2, as required.\n\nTherefore, p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. -4.\n\nBut the options include A. -2, B. -4, C. -1, D. 1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it seems like option B is -4, which matches our answer.\n\nHowever, the user mentioned that the correct answer is 1, which corresponds to option D.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\):\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, expanding \\((px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\\):\n\n\\[\npx^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3qx\n\\]\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[\n(1 + p)x^4 + (10 + 7p + q)x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q)x^2 + (60 + 3q)x + 36\n\\]\n\nSetting the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) to zero:\n\n1. \\(1 + p = 0\\) \u2192 \\(p = -1\\)\n\n2. \\(10 + 7p + q = 0\\)\n\nPlugging \\(p = -1\\):\n\n\\[\n10 + 7(-1) + q = 0 \\implies 10 - 7 + q = 0 \\implies 3 + q = 0 \\implies q = -3\n\\]\n\nThen, p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4.\n\nBut according to the user, the correct answer is 1, which would be option D.\n\nIs there something I'm missing here?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a condition that the constant term should be zero or something like that, but the problem specifically says the polynomial has degree 2, which only requires that the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) are zero.\n\nWait, maybe I need to ensure that the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is not zero, because otherwise, the polynomial would have degree less than 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"degree 2\", which means the highest degree is 2, so the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) should not be zero.\n\nIn my calculation, with p = -1 and q = -3, the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 13, which is not zero, so that's fine.\n\nSo, according to my calculations, p + q = -4.\n\nBut the user says the answer is 1, which would be p + q = 1.\n\nIs there a possibility that the problem is asking for something else?\n\nWait, perhaps the polynomial should have degree 2, but some of the lower degree coefficients could be zero, as long as the \\(x^2\\) term is present.\n\nIn my calculation, the \\(x^2\\) term is present with coefficient 13, and the constant term is 36, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the expansion.\n\nLet me re-expand \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 5x + 6)(x^2 + 5x + 6) = x^4 + 5x^3 + 6x^2 + 5x^3 + 25x^2 + 30x + 6x^2 + 30x + 36 = x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, \\((px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x) = px^4 + 7px^3 + 3px^2 + qx^3 + 7qx^2 + 3qx = px^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3qx\\)\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nCombining them:\n\n\\[\n(1 + p)x^4 + (10 + 7p + q)x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q)x^2 + (60 + 3q)x + 36\n\\]\n\nSetting the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) to zero:\n\n1. \\(1 + p = 0\\) \u2192 \\(p = -1\\)\n\n2. \\(10 + 7p + q = 0\\)\n\nPlugging \\(p = -1\\):\n\n\\[\n10 + 7(-1) + q = 0 \\implies 10 - 7 + q = 0 \\implies 3 + q = 0 \\implies q = -3\n\\]\n\nSo, p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4.\n\nBut according to the user, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps there's a sign error or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the polynomial is supposed to have degree 2, and the coefficients of \\(x^4\\), \\(x^3\\), and \\(x^2\\) are zero, making it a constant polynomial, which would have degree 0.\n\nBut that can't be, because the problem says \"degree 2\".\n\nWait, no, if the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is zero, then the polynomial would have degree less than 2, which contradicts the condition of having degree 2.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) must be non-zero.\n\nIn my calculation, with p = -1 and q = -3, the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 37 + 3(-1) + 7(-3) = 37 - 3 - 21 = 13, which is not zero.\n\nSo, that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the expansion of \\((px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\\).\n\nWait, let me check the expansion again.\n\n\\[\n(px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x) = px \\cdot x^3 + px \\cdot 7x^2 + px \\cdot 3x + q \\cdot x^3 + q \\cdot 7x^2 + q \\cdot 3x = px^4 + 7px^3 + 3px^2 + qx^3 + 7qx^2 + 3qx\n\\]\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and it's supposed to be \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 + (px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x) = 0\\), but that doesn't make sense because it's asking for a polynomial of degree 2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression equals zero, but that's not stated in the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"the polynomial which results from the expansion of \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 + (px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\\) has degree 2. Find \\(p + q\\).\"\n\nSo, it's saying that after expanding, the resulting polynomial has degree 2, and I need to find p and q such that this is true.\n\nI think my approach is correct, and the answer should be p + q = -4.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the provided options or in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach to solving this problem.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nSince the resulting polynomial has degree 2, that means that the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) must be zero.\n\nSo, I can set up the equations based on that.\n\nFrom the combined expression:\n\n\\[\n(1 + p)x^4 + (10 + 7p + q)x^3 + (37 + 3p + 7q)x^2 + (60 + 3q)x + 36\n\\]\n\nSetting the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) to zero:\n\n1. \\(1 + p = 0\\) \u2192 \\(p = -1\\)\n\n2. \\(10 + 7p + q = 0\\)\n\nPlugging \\(p = -1\\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[\n10 + 7(-1) + q = 0 \\implies 10 - 7 + q = 0 \\implies 3 + q = 0 \\implies q = -3\n\\]\n\nSo, p + q = -1 + (-3) = -4.\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nBut according to the user, the answer is 1, which is option D.\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe the polynomial is set equal to zero, and I need to find p and q such that the equation holds for all x.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say that; it says the polynomial resulting from the expansion has degree 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the polynomial is set equal to a constant, but again, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct, and the answer should be p + q = -4.\n\nUnless there's a mistake in the problem or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion of \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\) is incorrect.\n\nLet me double-check that expansion again.\n\n\\[\n(x^2 + 5x + 6)^2 = x^4 + 5x^3 + 6x^2 + 5x^3 + 25x^2 + 30x + 6x^2 + 30x + 36 = x^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the polynomial has degree 2, which means that the coefficients of \\(x^4\\) and \\(x^3\\) are zero, and the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is non-zero.\n\nIn my calculation, with p = -1 and q = -3, the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is 13, which is non-zero.\n\nSo, that satisfies the condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the addition of the two expanded expressions.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in adding the like terms.\n\nLet me add them again.\n\nFrom \\((x^2 + 5x + 6)^2\\):\n\n\\[\nx^4 + 10x^3 + 37x^2 + 60x + 36\n\\]\n\nFrom \\((px + q)(x^3 + 7x^2 + 3x)\\):\n\n\\[\npx^4 + (7p + q)x^3 + (3p + 7q)x^2 + 3qx\n\\]\n\nAdding them together:\n\n\\[\n(1 + p"
