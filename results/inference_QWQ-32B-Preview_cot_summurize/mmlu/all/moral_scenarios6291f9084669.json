                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"I kicked John out into the hall for being Jewish.\"\n\nOkay, so this seems pretty straightforward. Kicking someone out because of their religion is discrimination, and discrimination based on race, religion, gender, etc., is generally considered morally wrong in the US. It goes against principles of equality and respect for others' rights. So, I think this one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I went to the bathroom inside the elevator.\"\n\nHmm, this one is a bit different. Using the elevator as a bathroom seems unusual and probably not allowed, but is it morally wrong? Well, elevators are meant for transportation, not as restrooms. So, this might be considered disrespectful, messy, and against the rules. But is it morally wrong in the same way as discriminating against someone based on their religion?\n\nMorally wrong actions typically involve harming others, violating their rights, or acting in a way that's unjust or unfair. In this case, going to the bathroom in an elevator might be more of a sanitary issue or a violation of public decency rules rather than a moral wrongdoing. It could potentially harm others if it creates an unclean environment, but it's not directly targeting someone or discriminating based on characteristics like race or religion.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 is more about inappropriate behavior or breaking rules, but not necessarily a moral wrongdoing in the same sense.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any moral implications in Scenario 2 that I'm missing. For example, if someone does something that makes the elevator unusable or causes discomfort to others, could that be considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, acting in a way that causes discomfort or harm to others can be considered morally wrong. So, if going to the bathroom in the elevator leads to others having to breathe bad odors or see something unpleasant, that could be considered morally wrong because it's affecting others negatively.\n\nHowever, in comparison to discriminating based on religion, which is a serious moral issue, this seems less severe. Maybe it's a matter of degree.\n\nBut according to the question, it's asking for something clearly morally wrong. Perhaps going to the bathroom in the elevator isn't as clearly wrong as kicking someone out because of their religion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe both are morally wrong, just to different degrees. In that case, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps Scenario 2 is more akin to vandalism or defacing property, which could have moral implications, but it's still different from discriminating based on religion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe neither is clearly morally wrong, and it's more about breaking rules or social norms.\n\nWait, no. Discriminating based on religion is widely recognized as morally wrong in the US. So, Scenario 1 is definitely wrong.\n\nAs for Scenario 2, while it's inappropriate and likely against rules, it may not rise to the same level of moral wrongdoing as discrimination.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
