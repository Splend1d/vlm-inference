                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Rune Co.'s cash balance at the end of December. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nOn December 31, the checkbook balance is $10,000. But there are some additional items in the safe that might affect the cash balance reported on the balance sheet. Let's list them out:\n\n1. A $4,000 check payable to Rune, postdated to January 3, for a sale made in December. This check isn't included in the December 31 checkbook balance.\n\n2. A $1,000 check payable to Rune, deposited on December 15 and included in the December 31 checkbook balance, but returned by the bank on December 30 stamped \"NSF\" (Non-Sufficient Funds). This check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what amount Rune should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet, considering these items.\n\nFirst, let's think about the postdated check. It's a $4,000 check payable to Rune, but it's postdated to January 3. That means it's not yet due on December 31. So, should this be included in the cash balance as of December 31?\n\nWell, postdated checks are generally not considered available for withdrawal until the postdated date. So, I think this $4,000 shouldn't be included in the December 31 cash balance. It's like a receivable that will turn into cash in January.\n\nNow, the second item is the $1,000 check that was deposited on December 15 and included in the checkbook balance, but was returned by the bank on December 30 as NSF. Then it was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9.\n\nSo, on December 31, the checkbook balance still includes this $1,000 check, but in reality, the bank returned it as NSF. That means the $1,000 wasn't actually collected by the bank as of December 31.\n\nTherefore, I need to adjust the checkbook balance by removing this $1,000 NSF check.\n\nSo, starting with the checkbook balance of $10,000, I should subtract the $1,000 NSF check.\n\n$10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000.\n\nWait, but there's also the postdated check. Should I do anything with that?\n\nAs I thought earlier, the postdated check isn't yet due, so it shouldn't be included in the cash balance as of December 31. It's similar to an accounts receivable.\n\nSo, I shouldn't add the $4,000 to the cash balance.\n\nTherefore, the adjusted cash balance should be $9,000.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\n- Checkbook balance: $10,000\n\n- Subtract NSF check: -$1,000\n\n- Postdated check: not included\n\n- Total: $9,000\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider?\n\nHmm, maybe the fact that the $1,000 check was redeposited on January 2 and cleared on January 9. Does that affect the December 31 balance?\n\nWell, since the check was returned on December 30 and redeposited in January, the actual collection happens in January. So, as of December 31, the $1,000 wasn't collected, and thus shouldn't be included in the cash balance.\n\nSo, my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the amount Rune should report as cash in its December 31 balance sheet is $9,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. $9,000\n\nB. $10,000\n\nC. $13,000\n\nD. $14,000\n\nOption A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose I were to include the postdated check in the cash balance. Then, $10,000 (checkbook balance) + $4,000 (postdated check) - $1,000 (NSF) = $13,000.\n\nBut that would be option C, which is higher than the initial balance.\n\nHowever, as I thought earlier, postdated checks aren't typically included in the cash balance because they aren't yet available for withdrawal.\n\nAnother way to look at it: the postdated check is like an accounts receivable, not cash.\n\nSimilarly, the NSF check needs to be deducted because it was included in the checkbook balance but wasn't actually collected.\n\nTherefore, the correct adjustment is to subtract the NSF check and not to add the postdated check.\n\nHence, $10,000 - $1,000 = $9,000.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. $9,000\n"
