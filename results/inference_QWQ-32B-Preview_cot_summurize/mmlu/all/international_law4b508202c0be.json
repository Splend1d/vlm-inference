It's an obligation of result, meaning states must resolve their disputes ASAP.\n\nB. It's an obligation of conduct, meaning states should try to resolve disputes peacefully, but aren't strictly required to resolve them.\n\nC. It's a peremptory norm, and all states have a legal interest in ensuring it's applied.\n\nD. It's an obligation that only concerns international courts and tribunals.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"obligation of result\" and \"obligation of conduct\" mean. An obligation of result would mean that states must achieve a specific outcome\u2014 in this case, resolving their disputes peacefully and quickly. On the other hand, an obligation of conduct means that states are required to make a good faith effort to settle disputes peacefully, but they're not guaranteed to reach a resolution.\n\nOption C mentions a peremptory norm, or jus cogens. These are fundamental principles of international law from which no deviation is permitted, and all states are bound to respect them.\n\nOption D suggests that only international courts and tribunals are obligated to settle disputes peacefully, which seems narrow, considering that states are the primary actors in international law.\n\nNow, turning to international law, the UN Charter, specifically Article 2(3), states that \"All Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.\" This seems to emphasize the method or conduct rather than guaranteeing a particular result.\n\nMoreover, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in various cases has held that states have a legal obligation to settle disputes peacefully, but this doesn't necessarily mean they have to reach a resolution; rather, they must pursue peaceful means in good faith.\n\nConsidering this, option B seems most accurate: it's an obligation of conduct, meaning states have to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but there's no strict requirement to actually resolve them.\n\nOption A is too strong because it implies a guarantee of resolution, which isn't the case in international law. Disputes can be complex and may not always be resolvable, despite good faith efforts.\n\nOption C is interesting because peaceful settlement of disputes is indeed important, but is it a peremptory norm? Jus cogens norms include prohibitions on genocide, slavery, torture, etc. While peaceful settlement is crucial, it might not be on the same level as these peremptory norms. Additionally, the question seems to be specifically about the nature of the obligation, not its status as a norm.\n\nOption D is too narrow, as the obligation clearly falls on states themselves, not just on courts and tribunals.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, option B appears to be the correct answer: it's an obligation of conduct, meaning states have an obligation to try to resolve their disputes through peaceful means, but this doesn't entail an obligation to resolve their disputes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
