                    "text": "I'm looking at this question about the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies, comparing two time periods: 600 BCE to 600 CE and 600 to 1450 CE. The quote is from Tacitus's \"Germania,\" written around 98 CE, which talks about different tribes and their interactions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying. It mentions that the Chamavi and Angrivarii drove out and exterminated the Bructeri with the help of neighboring tribes, possibly out of hatred for their tyranny or because of the allure of plunder, or perhaps because heaven favored the Romans. It's interesting that Tacitus seems pleased by this, noting that over sixty thousand were killed, not by Roman arms, but by their own conflicts, which he finds gratifying.\n\nSo, in this context, the \"civilized\" society seems to be the Romans, and the \"barbarian\" peoples are the Germanic tribes. The Romans had various interactions with these tribes, including conquest, trade, and sometimes allowing them to serve in the Roman army.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a similarity in the treatment of barbarian peoples by civilized societies between 600 BCE to 600 CE and 600 to 1450 CE. So, I need to think about how civilized societies treated barbarians in both periods and find a common thread.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Barbarian peoples were converted to the religions of their host societies.\n\nB. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\nC. Barbarian peoples were uniformly relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.\n\nD. Barbarian peoples were often invited by their host societies to rule instead of the societies' own ruling classes.\n\nI need to evaluate which of these treatments was similar in both time periods.\n\nOption A: Conversion to the host society's religion.\n\nIn the earlier period, from 600 BCE to 600 CE, there were instances of religious conversion. For example, during the Roman Empire, many barbarian groups were exposed to and eventually converted to Roman paganism or, later, Christianity. Similarly, in the later period, from 600 to 1450 CE, during the Middle Ages, there was significant missionary activity aimed at converting barbarian or pagan peoples to Christianity.\n\nSo, conversion was a common strategy in both periods.\n\nOption B: Utilization as soldiers.\n\nIn the Roman period, barbarians were often recruited into the Roman army, especially in the later Empire. This practice continued into the Middle Ages, where mercenary forces and the inclusion of non-noble, sometimes barbarian, soldiers in armies were common.\n\nSo, this is also a similar treatment in both periods.\n\nOption C: Uniformly relegated to servile status through laws.\n\nIn the Roman period, there were laws that sometimes discriminated against barbarians, but it's not clear that they were uniformly relegated to servile status. Many barbarians were free allies or clients, while some were slaves. In the Middle Ages, the treatment varied; some barbarian groups were integrated into society, while others remained outside the legal system.\n\nSo, this seems less uniform across both periods.\n\nOption D: Invited to rule instead of the host society's ruling classes.\n\nThis seems to refer to instances where barbarian leaders were invited to take power or rule over certain regions. In the late Roman Empire, there are examples of barbarian chieftains being given authority within the Empire. Similarly, in the Middle Ages, there are cases where barbarian or foreign rulers were invited or allowed to govern.\n\nSo, this also has similarities in both periods.\n\nHowever, the question is to choose the one that is similar in both periods. Since all seem plausible, I need to think which one is most consistently similar.\n\nOption A: Conversion to religion was a significant aspect in both periods, but it might not be the primary way barbarians were treated.\n\nOption B: Utilization as soldiers was a practical approach in both periods, indicating a need for military manpower.\n\nOption C: The legal relegation to servile status seems less uniform and may not have been as prevalent in both periods.\n\nOption D: Inviting barbarians to rule was more sporadic and perhaps not as common a treatment.\n\nConsidering that the passage from Tacitus discusses the Romans' attitude towards the Germanic tribes and their conflicts, and given that the Romans often used barbarians as soldiers, I think option B is the most consistent similarity between the two periods.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Barbarian peoples were utilized as soldiers in their host societies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
