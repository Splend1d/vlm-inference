                    "text": "Let's see what Singer is up to here. He's presenting a three-premise argument along with the drowning child case. So, the question is why he's doing that. Let's look at the options:\n\nA says he believes abstract arguments are more likely to convince one to act. Hmm, that seems plausible. Maybe he thinks that logical arguments are more persuasive than emotional stories.\n\nB says he argues that emotional reactions have no bearing on which moral claims are true. That sounds like he's separating emotions from morality, saying that truths are independent of how we feel.\n\nC says he believes arguments are a more efficient way to appeal to one's emotions. Wait, that seems a bit contradictory. If he's using arguments to appeal to emotions, isn't that mixing reason and emotion?\n\nD says he wants to appeal to the reader's reason and not just pull at the reader's heartstrings. So, maybe he's trying to be more rational and not just rely on emotional appeal.\n\nLet me think about this. The drowning child case is a thought experiment that tugs at our heartstrings. It's an emotional scenario designed to make us feel a certain way about our moral obligations. By adding a three-premise argument, Singer might be trying to back up that emotional intuition with logical reasoning.\n\nSo, option A suggests he thinks abstract arguments are more convincing for action. Maybe, but it seems like he's using both emotion and reason together, not just relying on abstract arguments.\n\nOption B says he thinks emotions don't affect moral truths. Well, that might be part of his view, but I'm not sure if that directly explains why he's using both the argument and the emotional case.\n\nOption C says he thinks arguments are a more efficient way to appeal to emotions. That seems a bit off. Arguments are typically used to appeal to reason, not directly to emotions.\n\nOption D says he wants to appeal to reason and not just emotions. That makes sense. Maybe he's trying to show that there's a rational basis for the moral intuition evoked by the drowning child case.\n\nWait, perhaps he's trying to cover both bases: using the emotional case to engage people's feelings and the logical argument to engage their reasoning. That way, he can reach people who are more emotionally driven as well as those who are more logically oriented.\n\nBut the question seems to be asking why he presents the three-premise argument in addition to the drowning child case. So, maybe he's trying to provide a rational foundation beyond just the emotional appeal.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: He believes abstract arguments are more likely to convince one to act. Maybe, but it doesn't explain the combination of emotion and reason.\n\nB: He argues that emotional reactions have no bearing on which moral claims are true. That might be his view, but again, it doesn't directly explain the use of both methods.\n\nC: He believes arguments are a more efficient way to appeal to one's emotions. That seems contradictory; arguments are usually for reasoning, not emotions.\n\nD: He wants to appeal to the reader's reason and not just pull at the reader's heartstrings. This seems most plausible. He's providing a logical argument to support the emotional intuition, making his case stronger by engaging both emotion and reason.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer. He wants to appeal to the reader's reason in addition to emotion, to make a more compelling overall argument.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
