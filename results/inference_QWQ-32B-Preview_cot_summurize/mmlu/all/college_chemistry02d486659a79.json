                    "text": "So I've got this question about Henry's law, and I need to find the concentration of dissolved CO2 in a vessel that's pressurized with 2.0 atm of CO2. The Henry's law constant for CO2 in water at 25\u00b0C is given as 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9. The options are A. 1.5 M, B. 0.15 M, C. 0.067 M, and D. 0.015 M.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Henry's law is. Henry's law states that the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid. The mathematical expression for Henry's law is:\n\n\\[ c = k_p P \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( c \\) is the concentration of the dissolved gas,\n- \\( k_p \\) is the Henry's law constant,\n- \\( P \\) is the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid.\n\nIn this problem, I'm given \\( k_p = 30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\, \\text{M}^{-1} \\) and \\( P = 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\). I need to find \\( c \\).\n\nPlugging the values into the equation:\n\n\\[ c = 30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\, \\text{M}^{-1} \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\]\n\nWait, that gives:\n\n\\[ c = 60.0 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because 60 M is a very high concentration, and none of the options are anywhere near that. I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me check the units. The Henry's law constant is given in atm M\u207b\u00b9, which means that the concentration is equal to the pressure multiplied by the constant. But maybe I need to rearrange the equation.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes Henry's law is expressed as:\n\n\\[ P = k_p c \\]\n\nIn this case, pressure is equal to the Henry's law constant times the concentration. If I rearrange this to solve for concentration, I get:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{P}{k_p} \\]\n\nThat seems more reasonable. Let me try that.\n\nSo, \\( c = \\frac{2.0 \\, \\text{atm}}{30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\, \\text{M}^{-1}} \\)\n\nNow, atm in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving units of M (molarity), which is correct.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{2.0}{30.0} = 0.0667 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nRounding to three significant figures, that's approximately 0.067 M.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 0.067 M, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check because I initially thought the first equation was \\( c = k_p P \\), but that seems to give an unreasonably high concentration. Maybe the constant is given differently.\n\nI recall that sometimes Henry's law is expressed with the constant in different units, such as M/atm or L\u00b7atm/mol. Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nLet me look up Henry's law to confirm.\n\nAccording to my notes, Henry's law can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ c = k_p P \\]\n\nwhere \\( k_p \\) has units of M/atm.\n\nHowever, in this problem, the Henry's law constant is given as 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the constant is given as \\( k_H \\), where \\( k_H = \\frac{P}{c} \\), so \\( P = k_H c \\).\n\nIn this case, \\( k_H = 30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\, \\text{M}^{-1} \\), so to find concentration, I should use:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{P}{k_H} \\]\n\nWhich is what I did earlier, giving \\( c = 0.0667 \\, \\text{M} \\), or 0.067 M.\n\nAlternatively, if the constant is defined as \\( k_H = \\frac{c}{P} \\), then \\( c = k_H P \\), but in that case, the units of \\( k_H \\) would be M/atm.\n\nGiven that the constant here is in atm M\u207b\u00b9, it makes sense that \\( c = \\frac{P}{k_H} \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct concentration is 0.067 M, which is option C.\n\nI think that's the answer, but I'll cross-verify with another approach.\n\nLet me consider the units again. If \\( k_H = 30.0 \\, \\text{atm} \\, \\text{M}^{-1} \\), then its reciprocal would be \\( \\frac{1}{k_H} = \\frac{1}{30.0} \\, \\text{M} \\, \\text{atm}^{-1} \\), which is approximately 0.0333 M/atm.\n\nIf I multiply this by the pressure:\n\n\\[ c = \\left( \\frac{1}{k_H} \\right) P = 0.0333 \\, \\text{M} \\, \\text{atm}^{-1} \\times 2.0 \\, \\text{atm} = 0.0667 \\, \\text{M} \\]\n\nAgain, I get the same result, confirming that option C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the higher the pressure, the higher the concentration, which makes sense for gas solubility, and since 2.0 atm is being applied, with a proportionality constant of 30.0 atm M\u207b\u00b9, dividing pressure by the constant gives a reasonable low concentration, which aligns with real-world solubility values.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is C. 0.067 M.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
