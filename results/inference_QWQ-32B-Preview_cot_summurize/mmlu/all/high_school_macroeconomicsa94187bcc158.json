The options are:\n\nA. increasing the length of the business cycle.\n\nB. balancing the budget.\n\nC. increasing a budget surplus in a recession.\n\nD. lessening the impact of a recession.\n\nI think automatic stabilizers are supposed to help smooth out economic fluctuations, so maybe they lessen the impact of a recession. But let me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, what are automatic stabilizers? They are built-in mechanisms in the economy that help stabilize economic activity without requiring new government actions. Examples include unemployment benefits and progressive tax systems.\n\nDuring a recession, when people lose their jobs, unemployment benefits kick in automatically. This means that even though people are earning less, they still have some income from unemployment benefits, which they can spend. Similarly, in a progressive tax system, as people's incomes fall during a recession, they pay less in taxes, leaving them with more disposable income to spend.\n\nSo, these stabilizers help maintain consumption levels during a recession, which can help lessen the impact of the recession by preventing a further decline in economic activity.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Increasing the length of the business cycle.\n\nI don't think that's right. Automatic stabilizers should help shorten the business cycle by mitigating the effects of recessions.\n\nB. Balancing the budget.\n\nWell, automatic stabilizers can lead to budget deficits during recessions because government spending increases (e.g., on unemployment benefits) and tax revenues decrease. So, they might not necessarily balance the budget; in fact, they can cause deficits.\n\nC. Increasing a budget surplus in a recession.\n\nActually, during a recession, automatic stabilizers tend to decrease tax revenues and increase government spending, which would lead to a larger budget deficit, not a surplus.\n\nD. Lessening the impact of a recession.\n\nThis seems consistent with what I've read about automatic stabilizers. They help smooth out economic fluctuations and reduce the severity of recessions.\n\nLet me check if there's any other perspective.\n\nSome people might argue that automatic stabilizers can have long-term effects on the economy, but in the context of this question, it seems like the focus is on their role during the business cycle.\n\nAlso, I recall that some economists argue that automatic stabilizers can help stabilize the economy and reduce the amplitude of business cycles.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D. Lessening the impact of a recession.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider option A again. If automatic stabilizers increased the length of the business cycle, that would mean they make recessions last longer, which doesn't align with their purpose.\n\nOption B, balancing the budget, isn't necessarily their goal; their goal is to stabilize economic activity, which might come at the cost of budget deficits.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because, during a recession, automatic stabilizers would likely lead to a budget deficit, not a surplus.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
