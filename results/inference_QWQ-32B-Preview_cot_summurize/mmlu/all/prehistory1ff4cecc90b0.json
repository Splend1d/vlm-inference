It was characterized by repeated glacial cycles, known as ice ages, where large parts of the Earth's surface were covered in ice sheets and glaciers. This epoch saw the evolution of many species, including early humans.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. 1,000,000 years\n\nB. 100,000 years\n\nC. 10,000 years\n\nD. 1,000 years\n\nThe Pleistocene epoch ended approximately 11,700 years ago, which is closest to option C, 10,000 years. However, it's important to note that 11,700 years is slightly more than 10,000 years, but among the given choices, C is the most appropriate.\n\nTo provide more context, the end of the Pleistocene epoch marks the transition into the Holocene epoch, which is the current geological epoch we are in. The transition was characterized by a warming climate and the retreat of ice sheets, leading to significant changes in ecosystems and the emergence of human civilizations.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 10,000 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
