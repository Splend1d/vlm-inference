                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option correctly identifies the elaborate memorial that marked the death of Qin Dynasty emperor Ying Zheng. Let's consider each choice one by one.\n\nOption A suggests an enormous mortuary temple filled with gold and gems. Now, I know that ancient Chinese emperors were often buried with valuable goods, but I'm not sure if Ying Zheng specifically had a mortuary temple like that. Maybe I need to look into what was typical for Qin Dynasty burials.\n\nOption B mentions an enormous pyramid constructed out of millions of huge limestone blocks. Hmm, that sounds more like the pyramids in Egypt rather than in China. I think Chinese tombs were different in structure. Perhaps this is a misdirection.\n\nOption C talks about the collective suicide of 60 members of the royal family. Suicides or human sacrifices were sometimes part of ancient burials, but I don't recall anything specific about 60 royal family members committing suicide for Ying Zheng's burial. Maybe this is a less likely option.\n\nOption D refers to an 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army. I've heard about the Terra Cotta Army before; it's a famous archaeological site associated with Ying Zheng's mausoleum. It seems plausible that this could be the elaborate memorial being referred to.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Ying Zheng, also known as Qin Shi Huang, was the first emperor of a unified China. He was known for his grand projects, including the Great Wall and his own mausoleum. The Terra Cotta Army is indeed a part of his mausoleum complex, intended to protect him in the afterlife.\n\nComparing this with the other options, the Terra Cotta Army seems like the most significant and well-documented elaborate memorial associated with his death. The other options don't seem to align as accurately with historical records.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. An 8,000-member life-sized terra cotta army.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
