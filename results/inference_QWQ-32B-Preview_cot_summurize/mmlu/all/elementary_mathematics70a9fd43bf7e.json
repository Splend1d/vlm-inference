                    "text": "So I have this equation to solve: -47 = g + 24. I need to find the value of g. Let me see how to do this.\n\nFirst, I remember that to solve for a variable, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. So, in this case, I need to get g by itself. The equation is -47 equals g plus 24.\n\nTo isolate g, I should subtract 24 from both sides of the equation. That way, the +24 on the right side will cancel out. Let me write that down:\n\n-47 - 24 = g + 24 - 24\n\nOn the right side, +24 and -24 cancel each other out, so I'm left with just g. On the left side, -47 minus 24 is... let's calculate that.\n\n-47 minus 24. Since both are negative, subtracting a positive is like adding a negative. So, -47 + (-24). To add two negative numbers, I add their absolute values and keep the negative sign.\n\n47 plus 24 is 71, so -47 + (-24) is -71. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\n-71 = g\n\nSo, g equals -71.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If I plug g = -71 back into the original equation:\n\n-47 = -71 + 24\n\nLet's compute -71 + 24. Adding a positive 24 to -71, it's like moving 24 units to the right on the number line from -71.\n\n-71 + 24: 24 units to the right from -71 brings me to -47, because -71 + 24 = -47.\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the correct answer is -71, which is option A.\n\nWait a minute, the options are:\n\nA. -71\n\nB. -23\n\nC. 23\n\nD. 71\n\nSo, A is -71, which matches what I got. But just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe someone might think that adding 24 to g equals -47, and try to add 24 to both sides instead of subtracting. But that wouldn't isolate g. Let's see:\n\nStarting again with -47 = g + 24.\n\nIf someone adds 24 to both sides:\n\n-47 + 24 = g + 24 + 24\n\nThat would give -23 = g + 48, which doesn't help and makes it more complicated. So, subtracting 24 from both sides is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, someone might mistakenly subtract 24 from -47 incorrectly. For example, they might think -47 minus 24 is -23, which is wrong because subtracting a positive is adding a negative, so it should be -47 + (-24) = -71.\n\nSo, common mistakes could lead to choosing -23, which is option B, but that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed A. -71.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. } -71} \\]"
