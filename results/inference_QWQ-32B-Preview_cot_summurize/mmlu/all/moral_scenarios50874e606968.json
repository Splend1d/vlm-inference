Urinating in a public pool is generally considered inappropriate and unhealthy. Pools are shared spaces, and it's expected that people follow certain hygiene rules to maintain cleanliness and safety for everyone. So, from a moral standpoint, not getting out of the pool before peeing could be seen as disrespectful to others and potentially harmful due to health concerns.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character tests out their laser pointer by aiming it at a wall. Using a laser pointer in this manner seems relatively harmless. Aiming it at a wall doesn't pose any direct harm to people or property. However, there could be some considerations depending on the context, like if it's in a place where laser pointers are prohibited or if it disturbs others. But generally, aiming a laser pointer at a wall doesn't seem to be morally wrong.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 appears to involve something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
