In other words, we need to ensure that the condition in the while loop is always false.\n\nThe condition in the while loop is:\n\n```cpp\nnum1 > num2 || num1 > num3\n```\n\nThis is a logical OR condition, which means that the loop will execute as long as either `num1 > num2` or `num1 > num3` is true.\n\nTo ensure that the loop body never executes, we need to make sure that both `num1 > num2` and `num1 > num3` are false. In other words, both conditions must be false for the entire while condition to be false.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: num1 < num2**\n\nIf `num1 < num2`, then `num1 > num2` is false. However, `num1 > num3` could still be true, depending on the value of `num3`. Therefore, the loop might still execute if `num1 > num3` is true.\n\nSo, Option A is not sufficient to guarantee that the loop body will never execute.\n\n**Option B: num1 < num3**\n\nSimilarly, if `num1 < num3`, then `num1 > num3` is false. But `num1 > num2` could still be true, depending on the value of `num2`. Therefore, the loop might still execute if `num1 > num2` is true.\n\nSo, Option B is not sufficient to guarantee that the loop body will never execute.\n\n**Option C: num1 > num2 && num1 > num3**\n\nThis option states that `num1` is greater than both `num2` and `num3`. However, this would actually make the while condition true, because both `num1 > num2` and `num1 > num3` are true, and since it's an OR condition, the loop would execute.\n\nTherefore, Option C would guarantee that the loop body will be executed, not that it won't be executed.\n\n**Option D: num1 < num2 && num1 < num3**\n\nIf `num1 < num2` and `num1 < num3`, then both `num1 > num2` and `num1 > num3` are false. Since both parts of the OR condition are false, the entire condition becomes false, and the loop body will never execute.\n\nTherefore, Option D is sufficient to guarantee that the loop body will never be executed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is Option D: `num1 < num2 && num1 < num3`.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
