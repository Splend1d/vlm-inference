Let's look at each option:\n\nA. Group roles - This sounds pretty relevant. Roles in a group usually define what each member is supposed to do or how they should behave.\n\nB. Virtual teamwork - This seems more about teamwork in online or remote settings, not specifically about expected behaviors and tasks within a group.\n\nC. Synergy - I think synergy refers to the combined effect of different elements working together, like when a group achieves more than the sum of its parts. It doesn't directly relate to individual expectations.\n\nD. Role making - I'm not sure about this one. It might be related to how roles are created or developed within a group, but it doesn't seem to fit exactly with the question.\n\nSo, between these options, \"group roles\" (option A) seems to be the most appropriate term for describing the set of behaviors and tasks expected from a group member solely because of their membership in the group.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
