Let's look at each choice one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"responding to an argument with an expression of derision instead of a counter argument.\" This sounds like ad hominem or perhaps tu quoque, but I don't think it's specifically appeal to spite.\n\nOption B says: \"arguing against a position based only on negative personal feelings toward the position.\" Hmm, this seems close. Appeal to spite often involves using negative emotions to persuade someone, so maybe this is it.\n\nOption C says: \"arguing someone should do something only because that person dislikes someone else.\" This sounds more like appealing to someone's dislike for another person to influence their action, which might be a form of ad hominem or perhaps appeal to hatred.\n\nOption D says: \"saying someone shouldn't do something because if he or she does it people won't like him or her.\" This seems like an appeal to popularity or peer pressure, possibly related to appeal to consequences.\n\nNow, thinking about appeal to spite, it's a type of fallacy that plays on the listener's negative emotions, like jealousy or resentment, to support a conclusion. So, it's about using spite as a reason to accept a conclusion, rather than logical evidence.\n\nComparing that to the options, option B seems the closest because it mentions arguing against a position based on negative personal feelings. Spite is a negative personal feeling, so this fits.\n\nOption C is about someone's dislike for another person influencing their action, which is more about personal relationships and less about the position or argument itself.\n\nOption D is about social acceptance, which is different from spite.\n\nOption A is about derision, which is more about mocking or ridiculing the argument rather than appealing to negative emotions like spite.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option B: \"arguing against a position based only on negative personal feelings toward the position.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
