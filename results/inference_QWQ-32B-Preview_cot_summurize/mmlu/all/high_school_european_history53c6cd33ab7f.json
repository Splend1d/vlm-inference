It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nWhat was the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few\"?\n\nA. The populous demanded rights from the state.\nB. People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\nC. Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.\nD. European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this passage about Erasmus and his work, specifically the \"Adagiorum Collectanea,\" which is a collection of Latin proverbs meant to help people write better Latin. It seems like Erasmus was really into spreading classical knowledge, and this book was a big part of that. The text says that before him, humanists kind of kept their knowledge to themselves, like it was some secret club, but Erasmus wanted to share it with more people.\n\nHe wrote this book in Latin, which means only educated people could read it, so it wasn't like everyone in Europe suddenly had access to classical ideas. But still, it reached a wider audience than before. The passage mentions that some humanists were upset with him for sharing their \"secrets,\" but Erasmus didn't care; he wanted more people to learn from ancient wisdom.\n\nNow, the question is about the impact of humanism no longer being just for a select few. It's asking what the primary effect was of humanism becoming more widespread. The options are:\n\nA. The populace demanded rights from the state.\n\nB. People could begin to question the Church on a wider scale.\n\nC. Latin replaced many of the vulgar languages throughout Europe.\n\nD. European literature stagnated due to widespread interest in the writings of antiquity.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this.\n\nOption A talks about the populace demanding rights from the state. Well, humanism is more about intellectual and cultural development, focusing on classical learning and humanities. While it did contribute to a broader intellectual environment that could lead to political changes, it's not directly about demanding rights from the state. So, maybe not the primary impact.\n\nOption B suggests that people began to question the Church more widely. Humanism did lead to a critical examination of traditional authority, including the Church, because it encouraged people to think for themselves and question established norms based on classical ideals. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C says that Latin replaced many vulgar languages. Actually, during the Renaissance and Reformation periods, there was a movement towards using vernacular languages for wider communication. Erasmus wrote in Latin, but many others started writing in their native tongues to reach a broader audience. So, this seems contrary to what was happening.\n\nOption D mentions that European literature stagnated because of interest in antiquity. That doesn't sound right. The Renaissance was a time of great literary flourishing, inspired by classical models but also\u521b\u65b0 and new ideas. So, saying literature stagnated doesn't align with what I know.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most accurate. Humanism spreading beyond a small elite allowed more people to question established authorities, including the Church, which was a significant factor leading up to the Protestant Reformation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
