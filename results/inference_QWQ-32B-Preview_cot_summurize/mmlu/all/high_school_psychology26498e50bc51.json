We need to figure out which option best matches this description.\n\nOption A is \"manic coping strategy.\" I'm not sure what that means exactly, but it doesn't sound like something that aligns with being confident and taking responsibility. Manic might relate to mood disorders, which isn't directly about how someone handles responsibility.\n\nOption B is \"discriminative expectancy.\" I think this might be related to expecting certain outcomes based on different situations, but it doesn't seem directly related to taking responsibility for one's actions.\n\nOption C is \"internal locus of control.\" I recall that locus of control refers to whether people believe they can control events in their lives or not. An internal locus of control means someone believes they have control over their own life and outcomes, which sounds a lot like taking responsibility for their own actions.\n\nOption D is \"external locus of control.\" This would be the opposite, where someone believes that external forces control their life, like luck or other people, which doesn't match Lynda's description.\n\nSo, between these options, C, internal locus of control, seems to fit best with someone who is confident, capable, and takes responsibility for their actions.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's more to it. Discriminative expectancy might be about distinguishing between different expectations, but again, it doesn't directly relate to taking responsibility.\n\nManic coping strategy doesn't seem relevant here. It's probably not the right choice.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C, internal locus of control.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
