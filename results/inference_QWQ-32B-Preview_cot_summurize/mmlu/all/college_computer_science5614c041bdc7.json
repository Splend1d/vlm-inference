                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about decidability. I need to determine which of the given problems are decidable. Let's recall that a problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can always provide a yes or no answer in a finite amount of time.\n\nOkay, let's look at problem I: Given a finite string w, is w a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0? Hmm, \u03c0 is a mathematical constant with an infinite non-repeating decimal expansion. But the expansion is fixed and known. So, in theory, I can compute the decimal expansion of \u03c0 to a certain number of digits and check if w is a prefix of that expansion. Since w is finite, I can always compute enough digits of \u03c0 to compare with w. If w matches the beginning of \u03c0's decimal expansion up to its length, then yes; otherwise, no. This seems decidable because I can write an algorithm to do this comparison.\n\nNow, problem II: Given a program and an input, is the program\u2019s output the decimal expansion of \u03c0? This seems trickier. Here, I have a program and an input, and I need to determine if the program's output is the decimal expansion of \u03c0. The decimal expansion of \u03c0 is infinite, so the program would need to output an infinite sequence that matches \u03c0's digits. But programs run on computers, which have finite resources, so actually producing an infinite sequence isn't possible in practice. However, perhaps the program is designed to generate as many digits of \u03c0 as required.\n\nBut more fundamentally, determining whether an arbitrary program's output matches \u03c0's expansion seems similar to the problem of determining what a program does, which can be undecidable in general due to the halting problem. The halting problem tells us that it's undecidable whether a program will halt on a given input, and here, I need to check if the program's output matches \u03c0's expansion, which might require running the program indefinitely to compare its output to \u03c0's infinite digits. This sounds undecidable because I can't ever be completely sure that the program will continue to output the correct digits forever.\n\nWait, but maybe if the program is designed to compute \u03c0, like using a known algorithm, then it should be possible to verify its correctness up to a certain number of digits. But the problem is asking about the program's output being the entire decimal expansion of \u03c0, which is infinite. So, I think this is undecidable.\n\nMoving on to problem III: Given a program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0, is the program\u2019s output always the same for every prefix? This seems even more complex. Here, the program takes a prefix of \u03c0's decimal expansion and produces some output, and I need to determine if the output is always the same, regardless of which prefix is provided.\n\nThis sounds like I need to check the program's behavior on all possible prefixes of \u03c0's expansion. Since \u03c0's expansion is infinite, there are infinitely many possible prefixes. Checking the program's output for every possible prefix would require running the program an infinite number of times, which is impossible in finite time. Therefore, this problem also seems undecidable.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to analyze the program's code to determine if its output is always the same, regardless of the input prefix. But even then, without knowing exactly what the program does, it's hard to say. Perhaps if the program ignores the input and always produces the same output, then yes, the output is always the same. But if the program depends on the input in some way, then its output could vary based on the prefix provided.\n\nHowever, without more specific information about the program, it's seems impossible to decide this in general. So, I think this is also undecidable.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- Problem I: Decidable\n\n- Problem II: Undecidable\n\n- Problem III: Undecidable\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. I only.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at problem I, I think it's straightforward. Since w is finite, and \u03c0's decimal expansion is known and can be computed to any finite number of digits, comparing w to the beginning of \u03c0's expansion is straightforward and decidable.\n\nProblem II seems undecidable because it requires comparing potentially infinite outputs, which isn't feasible algorithmically in finite time.\n\nProblem III also seems undecidable because it involves checking the program's behavior across infinitely many inputs (all possible prefixes of \u03c0's expansion).\n\nSo, I stick with A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
