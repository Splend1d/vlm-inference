                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who is likely to prevail in this lawsuit where an investor is suing the original land owner for specific performance after the owner refused to close the sale. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, there was a contract between the original owner and the original buyer to sell the land for $100,000, which was the fair market value at the time of the contract. Then, there was an unanticipated zoning change that increased the land's value to $150,000. After this change, the owner refused to close the deal.\n\nThe original buyer, wanting to avoid a lawsuit, assigned the contract to an investor in an arm's-length transaction, receiving $25,000 in return. The investor was aware of the owner's refusal to close and still proceeded to sue for specific performance.\n\nNow, I need to determine who is likely to win this lawsuit. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The investor, because an assignee of the original party purchaser in a real estate contract is entitled to specific performance under these circumstances.\n\nB. The investor, because she has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change.\n\nC. The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\n\nD. The owner, because the investor, who is experienced in buying and selling real estate, is entitled to money damages but not to specific performance.\n\nLet's analyze each option.\n\nOption A suggests that the investor, as an assignee, is entitled to specific performance. But I need to consider if there are any limitations or requirements for an assignee to seek specific performance.\n\nIn general, in real estate contracts, specific performance is a remedy that requires the party to perform their obligations under the contract, such as completing the sale. It's often sought when monetary damages are inadequate, which is usually the case with unique properties like land.\n\nHowever, there might be rules about when an assignee can seek specific performance. I recall that for an assignee to be entitled to specific performance, they need to be a bona fide assignee without notice of any defects or defenses that the original party had.\n\nIn this case, the investor knew about the owner's refusal to close when they bought the contract. So, the investor had notice of the potential problem. This might affect their status as a bona fide assignee without notice.\n\nOption C directly mentions that the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus doesn't have clean hands. The \"clean hands\" doctrine means that a party seeking equitable relief, like specific performance, must have acted equitably themselves.\n\nGiven that the investor knew about the owner's refusal to close and still bought the contract, they might be seen as proceeding with eyes wide open, which could disqualify them from seeking specific performance.\n\nOption B mentions that the investor has elected to waive the owner's lack of marketable title caused by the zoning change. But I'm not sure about this. Zoning changes can affect the usability and value of the land, but I don't know if it necessarily makes the title unmarketable.\n\n Marketable title generally means that the title is free from significant defects or encumbrances that would deter a reasonable buyer from purchasing it. A zoning change might affect value but doesn't necessarily make the title unmarketable.\n\nMoreover, even if there was an issue with marketable title, I don't know if the investor's waiver would entitle them to specific performance.\n\nOption D states that the owner will likely prevail because the investor is entitled to money damages but not specific performance. This seems plausible if the investor isn't entitled to equitable relief like specific performance due to not having clean hands or not being a bona fide assignee.\n\nBut I need to think about whether money damages would be an adequate remedy for the investor. If the land is unique and money damages wouldn't compensate the investor fully, then specific performance might still be an option.\n\nHowever, given that the investor bought the contract for $25,000, and the land's value is now $150,000, perhaps money damages could be calculated based on the difference between the contract price and the current market value.\n\nBut in real estate, specific performance is often granted because land is considered unique, and monetary damages might not fully compensate the buyer.\n\nStill, the investor's knowledge of the owner's refusal to close might be a barrier to seeking specific performance.\n\nLet me consider the legal principles involved.\n\nFirst, in contract law, assignment is the transfer of rights under a contract from the assignor to the assignee. In this case, the original buyer assigned their rights under the purchase contract to the investor.\n\nGenerally, the assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor, meaning they have the same rights and responsibilities under the contract.\n\nHowever, there might be limitations, especially in equity, regarding the remedies available to the assignee.\n\nSpecific performance is an equitable remedy, and equity requires that the party seeking it has acted equitably themselves, hence the clean hands doctrine.\n\nIn this scenario, the investor knew about the owner's refusal to close when they bought the contract. This suggests that the investor was aware of the potential problem and still proceeded.\n\nCourts might view this as the investor assuming the risk and therefore not grant specific performance.\n\nAdditionally, if the investor is experienced in buying and selling real estate, they should have known better and perhaps should be held to a higher standard.\n\nOn the other hand, the land is unique, and specific performance is commonly granted in real estate contracts when there's a breach.\n\nBut again, the investor's knowledge and willingness to proceed despite known issues might disqualify them from seeking specific performance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the investor could sue the original buyer for breach of warranty of authority or fitness, but that's not directly relevant to this lawsuit against the owner.\n\nAnother angle to consider is whether the owner's refusal to close is a material breach, which would entitle the assignee to seek remedies, including specific performance.\n\nGiven that the owner refused to close after the zoning change increased the land's value, it seems like the owner is trying to renege on the contract to sell at a lower price.\n\nIn such cases, specific performance is often granted to enforce the contract as agreed.\n\nHowever, the assignee's status and conduct might affect their ability to seek this remedy.\n\nI also need to consider if the assignment of the contract was proper. The contract didn't forbid assignment, and it was an arm's-length transaction, so the assignment seems valid.\n\nMoreover, the investor is experienced in real estate, which might mean that they understand the risks involved and should bear the consequences of the owner's refusal to close.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the owner will prevail because the investor, being experienced in real estate and knowing about the owner's refusal to close, doesn't have clean hands and therefore isn't entitled to specific performance.\n\nSo, option C seems the most plausible.\n\nWait, but option D says the owner will prevail because the investor is entitled to money damages but not specific performance.\n\nThis might also be a possible outcome, but I think option C provides a stronger reason for the owner to prevail, based on the investor's lack of clean hands due to having notice of the owner's refusal to close.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: The owner, because the investor is not a bona fide assignee without notice, and thus does not have clean hands.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
