                    "text": "So I've got this finance problem here, and I need to figure out the effective annual interest cost for the Houser Company when they borrow $200,000 from Chitwood National Bank under a revolving credit agreement. The agreement has a few components that I need to consider: an interest rate of 10% on funds used, a 15% compensating balance, and a 1% commitment fee on the unused amount of the credit line. The total credit agreement is for $500,000, and the compensating balance wouldn't otherwise be maintained. I need to find the effective annual interest cost if the firm borrows $200,000 for one year, and the closest answer is among the options provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these components means and how they affect the total cost of borrowing.\n\n1. **Interest Rate**: This is straightforward. It's 10% on the funds used. So, if they borrow $200,000, the interest cost would be 10% of $200,000.\n\n2. **Compensating Balance**: This is a requirement for the borrower to keep a certain percentage of the loan amount as a balance in the bank. Here, it's 15% of the funds used. So, for $200,000 borrowed, the compensating balance would be 15% of $200,000, which is $30,000. This means that out of the $200,000 borrowed, $30,000 can't be used because it has to be kept as a balance with the bank. Therefore, the actual amount available to the company is $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\n3. **Commitment Fee**: This is a fee charged on the unused portion of the credit line. The credit agreement is for $500,000, and if they borrow $200,000, then the unused amount is $500,000 - $200,000 = $300,000. The commitment fee is 1% on this unused amount, which is 1% of $300,000 = $3,000.\n\nNow, to find the effective annual interest cost, I need to consider both the interest paid on the borrowed amount and the commitment fee on the unused amount, relative to the actual amount available to use, which is $170,000.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n- Calculate the interest cost: 10% of $200,000 = $20,000.\n\n- Calculate the compensating balance: 15% of $200,000 = $30,000.\n\n- Calculate the actual amount available: $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\n- Calculate the commitment fee: 1% of $300,000 = $3,000.\n\n- Total cost of borrowing: interest + commitment fee = $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.\n\n- Effective interest rate: (total cost) / (actual amount available) = $23,000 / $170,000.\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n$23,000 / $170,000 = 0.1353, which is 13.53%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 11.5 percent.\n\nB. 15 percent.\n\nC. 26.5 percent.\n\nD. 13.53 percent.\n\nIt seems like option D is exactly 13.53 percent.\n\nWait a minute, but I should double-check if this is the correct way to calculate the effective interest cost. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the compensating balance reduces the effective principal, and the commitment fee is an additional cost.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nTotal funds needed: $200,000.\n\nBut because of the 15% compensating balance, they need to borrow more to have $200,000 available.\n\nWait, no. In this case, they're borrowing $200,000, and out of that, $30,000 must be kept as a compensating balance, so only $170,000 is usable.\n\nBut the interest is on the full $200,000 borrowed.\n\nWait, no, the interest is on the funds used, which is $200,000.\n\nBut the compensating balance is part of the funds used, but it's not available to the company.\n\nSo, the effective interest rate should consider that only $170,000 is available, but they're paying interest on $200,000, plus the commitment fee on the unused $300,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total cost as interest plus commitment fee, and divide by the actual amount available.\n\nThat's what I did earlier: $23,000 / $170,000 = 13.53%.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nSometimes, the formula for effective interest rate considering compensating balances is:\n\nEffective interest rate = (interest + fees) / (principal - compensating balance)\n\nIn this case:\n\nInterest = $20,000\n\nFees = $3,000\n\nPrincipal = $200,000\n\nCompensating balance = $30,000\n\nSo, effective interest rate = ($20,000 + $3,000) / ($200,000 - $30,000) = $23,000 / $170,000 = 13.53%\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the commitment fee as part of the interest rate on the unused portion.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the effective interest rate based on the usable funds.\n\nThat is, the company only has use of $170,000, but they're paying $23,000 in total costs.\n\nSo, $23,000 / $170,000 = 13.53%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the commitment fee as a separate cost, but it's still part of the total cost of borrowing.\n\nWait, but the commitment fee is a cost for not using the unused portion, so it's a cost associated with borrowing $200,000.\n\nTherefore, it should be included in the total cost.\n\nSo, total cost is interest plus commitment fee: $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.\n\nAnd the amount effectively borrowed is $170,000.\n\nTherefore, effective interest rate is $23,000 / $170,000 = 13.53%.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D is 13.53 percent.\n\nBut the question says \"the effective annual interest cost is closest to\", and option D is exactly 13.53 percent.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me try calculating it again.\n\nInterest: 10% of $200,000 = $20,000.\n\nCompensating balance: 15% of $200,000 = $30,000.\n\nUsable funds: $200,000 - $30,000 = $170,000.\n\nCommitment fee: 1% of ($500,000 - $200,000) = 1% of $300,000 = $3,000.\n\nTotal cost: $20,000 + $3,000 = $23,000.\n\nEffective interest rate: $23,000 / $170,000 = 0.1353, or 13.53%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the compensating balance should be considered in a different way.\n\nSometimes, the effective interest rate is calculated as:\n\nEffective interest rate = (interest / usable funds) * (1 - compensating balance ratio)\n\nBut in this case, that would be:\n\nEffective interest rate = ($20,000 / $170,000) * (1 - 0.15)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nEffective interest rate = (interest + fees) / (principal - compensating balance)\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the compensating balance as part of the interest rate.\n\nBut I think the initial approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the effective annual interest cost is 13.53%, which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let me check if there's any other factor I might have missed.\n\nIs there any other fee or cost associated with the borrowing that's not accounted for?\n\nThe problem mentions only the interest rate, compensating balance, and commitment fee.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all the costs.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 13.53 percent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
