                    "text": "In classical economic analysis, when an economy is in a recession, it's believed that the economy can naturally return to full employment through certain mechanisms. Let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Falling wages and prices.\n\nThis option suggests that as wages and prices decrease, the economy adjusts itself back to full employment. This idea is rooted in the classical theory's assumption of wage and price flexibility. According to this view, during a recession, there's excess supply in both the labor market and the goods market. As a result, wages and prices should fall to eliminate this excess supply. Lower wages make labor cheaper, encouraging firms to hire more workers, thus reducing unemployment. Similarly, lower prices make goods more attractive, increasing demand and helping businesses to sell more, which in turn may lead to higher production and more jobs.\n\nHowever, this adjustment process can take time, and in the short run, it might lead to deflation, which has its own set of problems, such as increasing the real burden of debt for borrowers.\n\nB. Rising wages and prices.\n\nThis option seems counterintuitive in the context of a recession. Typically, during a recession, wages and prices are more likely to fall due to excess supply. Rising wages and prices would suggest an inflationary pressure, which is not usually associated with recessionary periods. Therefore, this option doesn't align well with the classical analysis of recession and recovery.\n\nC. Expansionary monetary policy.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy involves actions by the central bank to increase the money supply, lower interest rates, and stimulate borrowing and spending. This can help to boost economic activity and pull the economy out of a recession. However, in classical economic theory, there is a belief in the neutrality of money in the long run, meaning that changes in the money supply only affect nominal variables like prices and wages, not real variables like employment and output.\n\nTherefore, while expansionary monetary policy might have short-term effects, classical theory suggests that in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its natural rate of employment regardless of monetary policy changes.\n\nD. Increased government spending.\n\nIncreased government spending is a form of fiscal policy that can stimulate economic activity by increasing overall demand in the economy. This can help to reduce unemployment and pull the economy out of a recession. However, classical economic theory generally favors minimal government intervention in the economy, relying instead on market forces to achieve equilibrium.\n\nGiven this perspective, increased government spending might not be the preferred method in classical analysis for returning to full employment.\n\nConsidering these points, the option that best aligns with classical analysis is A: falling wages and prices. Classical economists believe that the economy has an inherent self-correcting mechanism that, through flexible wages and prices, will restore full employment in the long run.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
