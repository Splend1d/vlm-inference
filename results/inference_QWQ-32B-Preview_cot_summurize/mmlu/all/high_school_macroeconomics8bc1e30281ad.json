                    "text": "Let's see which groups get hurt by unexpectedly high inflation. I need to think about how inflation affects each of these options.\n\nOption A is about borrowers repaying a long-term loan at a fixed interest rate. Normally, inflation favors borrowers because the money they repay is worth less than when they borrowed it. So, if inflation is higher than expected, the real value of their repayments decreases, which is good for them. Therefore, they are not harmed by higher inflation; in fact, they benefit from it.\n\nOption B is about savers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate. Savers rely on the interest they earn to maintain their purchasing power. If inflation rises higher than expected, the purchasing power of the interest they receive decreases. So, their savings lose value over time because the interest isn't keeping up with inflation. This means savers are harmed by unexpectedly high inflation.\n\nOption C is about workers who have negotiated cost-of-living raises into their contracts. Cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) are designed to protect workers' purchasing power by increasing their wages in line with inflation. So, if inflation is higher than expected, their wages should increase accordingly to maintain their standard of living. Therefore, these workers are not harmed by higher inflation because their wages adjust to match it.\n\nOption D is about renters who have signed a lease that holds rent constant for two years. If inflation rises unexpectedly, the rent they pay remains the same in nominal terms, but its real value decreases. This means they're effectively paying less in terms of purchasing power, which benefits them. So, renters are not harmed by higher inflation in this scenario.\n\nBased on this analysis, the group that is harmed by unexpectedly high rates of inflation is Option B: savers who have put their money in long-term assets that pay a fixed interest rate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
