                    "text": "So Hart says that just because something is legally valid, that doesn't necessarily mean people have to obey it. He's saying that even if the law seems really authoritative and majestic, people still need to think about whether it's morally right or not. So, they should do a moral check before deciding to follow the law.\n\nNow, the question is asking what this says about legal positivism. Legal positivism is a theory that separates law and morality, saying that law is based on social facts, not moral values.\n\nOption A says that legal positivism is unconcerned about the morality of the law. That sounds pretty close to what Hart is saying. He's pointing out that even if something is legally valid, it doesn't automatically mean it's morally acceptable, and people should consider that.\n\nOption B says that validly enacted law should always be obeyed. But Hart is actually saying the opposite\u2014that just because a law is valid, doesn't mean it should always be obeyed. People should look at its morality.\n\nOption C says that moral issues fall outside the official legal system. Again, this aligns with legal positivism's separation of law and morality. Hart seems to be suggesting that morality is something separate that individuals should consider on top of the law.\n\nOption D says that there's no moral duty to obey an unjust law. This seems to be in line with what Hart is saying\u2014that if a law is unjust, people shouldn't feel morally obligated to obey it.\n\nSo, looking at these options, A, C, and D all seem to align with Hart's view to some extent. But the question is asking what this says about the nature of legal positivism.\n\nLegal positivism holds that the validity of law is determined by sources like legislation and court decisions, not by moral considerations. So, according to positivism, as long as a law is validly enacted, it is law, regardless of its moral content.\n\nHart is suggesting that people shouldn't just obey the law because it's valid; they should also consider its morality. This implies that there's more to deciding whether to obey a law than just its legal validity, which is a positivist concern.\n\nSo, option A says that legal positivism is unconcerned about the morality of the law. That seems accurate because positivism focuses on the sources and structures of law without considering whether the law is moral or not.\n\nOption B is the opposite of what Hart is saying, so that can be ruled out.\n\nOption C says that moral issues fall outside the official legal system. Again, this aligns with positivism's separation of law and morality.\n\nOption D says that there's no moral duty to obey an unjust law. This seems to be a conclusion that someone might draw from Hart's statement, but it's more of a normative position about obedience, whereas the core of positivism is about the nature of law itself.\n\nGiven that the question is about the nature of legal positivism, options A and C both seem to capture aspects of positivism's approach to morality and law.\n\nHowever, option A directly addresses positivism's indifference to the morality of the law, which is a central tenet of positivism. Option C says that moral issues fall outside the official legal system, which is also true but perhaps a bit more nuanced.\n\nBut since option A clearly states that positivism is unconcerned about the morality of the law, which aligns with Hart's assertion that legal validity doesn't conclusively determine obedience, I think A is the best answer.\n\nHart is essentially critiquing positivism by saying that legal validity isn't enough to guarantee obedience; morality matters too. Therefore, positivism's focus solely on legal validity, without regard to morality, is highlighted by Hart's statement.\n\nSo, the answer is A: That legal positivism is unconcerned about the morality of the law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
