The company wants to gather information about customers who joined in the past 12 months and plans to send out a survey via email. They're offering a free month of service to those who complete the survey. The key point is that musical tastes vary by geographical region, so the sample needs to be representative of the customer base in terms of geography.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Choose all of the customers who joined in the last month.\n\nWell, this seems like it might not be representative. If we only select customers who joined in the last month, we might miss out on variations in musical tastes from customers who joined earlier in the year. Also, new customers might have different preferences compared to those who have been around longer.\n\nB. Make a list of all the customers who joined in the last 12 months and choose a random sample of customers on this list.\n\nThis is a simple random sample (SRS) of all customers who joined in the last 12 months. It's a common method and should, in theory, be representative of the entire customer base from that period. However, since musical tastes vary by geographical region, this method might not ensure that all regions are proportionately represented, especially if some regions have more customers than others.\n\nC. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.\n\nThis seems like a stratified sampling method where states are the strata, and we're selecting a fixed number (10) from each stratum. This ensures that each state is represented equally in the sample, regardless of the state's customer size. This could be problematic if some states have significantly more customers than others because states with larger customer bases would be underrepresented in the sample.\n\nD. From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 3% of the customers from each state.\n\nThis also appears to be a stratified sampling method, but here, instead of choosing a fixed number from each state, we're selecting a fixed percentage (3%) from each state. This means that states with more customers will have more representatives in the sample, which might better reflect the overall customer distribution.\n\nNow, considering that musical tastes vary by geographical region, it's important that the sample reflects the geographical distribution of the customer base. Option B, the simple random sample, might not do this adequately because states with more customers would naturally have more representation, but there's no guarantee that the sample will proportionately reflect the geographical diversity.\n\nOptions C and D both use stratified sampling based on states, which is better because it explicitly accounts for geographical differences. Between C and D, option C chooses a fixed number (10) from each state, which could lead to underrepresentation of larger states. Option D chooses a percentage (3%) from each state, meaning that larger states will have more representatives in the sample, proportional to their customer base.\n\nOption A is probably the least representative because it only includes the most recent month's customers, who may not be representative of the entire 12-month period.\n\nSo, overall, option D seems to be the best choice because it uses stratified sampling based on states and selects a percentage from each stratum, which should result in a sample that is representative of the entire customer base in terms of geographical distribution.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
