                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to evaluate the sum of the ceiling values of the square roots from \u221a5 to \u221a29. The ceiling function, denoted by \u2308x\u2309, means the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x. So, for each integer n from 5 to 29, I'll calculate \u221an and then take the ceiling of that value.\n\nFirst, I should understand the behavior of the ceiling of the square root function. For a given integer k, \u2308\u221an\u2309 = k when (k-1)^2 < n \u2264 k^2. But actually, since ceiling goes to the next integer, it's better to think in terms of when \u221an is between k and k+1.\n\nWait, let me think again. For \u2308\u221an\u2309 = k, it means that k-1 < \u221an \u2264 k, which implies (k-1)^2 < n \u2264 k^2. So, for each integer k starting from ceil(\u221a5) up to ceil(\u221a29), I need to find the range of n where \u2308\u221an\u2309 = k and sum up k for each n in that range.\n\nFirst, let's find ceil(\u221a5). Since \u221a4 = 2 and \u221a5 is approximately 2.236, ceil(\u221a5) = 3. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, \u221a4 = 2 and \u221a5 \u2248 2.236, so ceil(\u221a5) should be 3. Wait, no, ceil(2.236) is indeed 3. Similarly, ceil(\u221a6), \u221a6 \u2248 2.449, so ceil is 3. ceil(\u221a7) \u2248 2.645, ceil is 3. ceil(\u221a8) \u2248 2.828, ceil is 3. ceil(\u221a9) = 3, since \u221a9 = 3. ceil(\u221a10) \u2248 3.162, ceil is 4. Wait, this seems inconsistent with my earlier statement.\n\nActually, for n from 5 to 8, \u221an is between 2 and 3, so ceil is 3. At n=9, \u221a9=3, so ceil is 3. For n=10 to 15, \u221an is between 3 and 4, so ceil is 4. For n=16, \u221a16=4, so ceil is 4. For n=17 to 24, \u221an is between 4 and 5, so ceil is 5. For n=25, \u221a25=5, so ceil is 5. For n=26 to 29, \u221an is between 5 and 6, so ceil is 6.\n\nSo, let's list out the ranges:\n\n- n=5 to n=8: \u2308\u221an\u2309=3 (4 terms)\n\n- n=9: \u2308\u221a9\u2309=3 (1 term)\n\n- n=10 to n=15: \u2308\u221an\u2309=4 (6 terms)\n\n- n=16: \u2308\u221a16\u2309=4 (1 term)\n\n- n=17 to n=24: \u2308\u221an\u2309=5 (8 terms)\n\n- n=25: \u2308\u221a25\u2309=5 (1 term)\n\n- n=26 to n=29: \u2308\u221an\u2309=6 (4 terms)\n\nNow, let's sum them up:\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12\n\n- 3 * 1 = 3\n\n- 4 * 6 = 24\n\n- 4 * 1 = 4\n\n- 5 * 8 = 40\n\n- 5 * 1 = 5\n\n- 6 * 4 = 24\n\nAdding these up: 12 + 3 = 15, 15 + 24 = 39, 39 + 4 = 43, 43 + 40 = 83, 83 + 5 = 88, 88 + 24 = 112.\n\nSo, the sum is 112.\n\nWait a minute, but looking back at the options, 112 is option A. But the other options are 111, 2006, and 110. Maybe I need to double-check my calculations.\n\nLet me count the number of terms again:\n\n- n=5 to n=8: that's 4 terms, ceil=3 \u2192 4*3=12\n\n- n=9: 1 term, ceil=3 \u2192 1*3=3\n\n- n=10 to n=15: 6 terms, ceil=4 \u2192 6*4=24\n\n- n=16: 1 term, ceil=4 \u2192 1*4=4\n\n- n=17 to n=24: 8 terms, ceil=5 \u2192 8*5=40\n\n- n=25: 1 term, ceil=5 \u2192 1*5=5\n\n- n=26 to n=29: 4 terms, ceil=6 \u2192 4*6=24\n\nNow, adding them up: 12 + 3 = 15, 15 + 24 = 39, 39 + 4 = 43, 43 + 40 = 83, 83 + 5 = 88, 88 + 24 = 112.\n\nSeems consistent. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the options. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the sum differently. Let's consider that for each k starting from ceil(\u221a5) up to ceil(\u221a29), I can find the number of n where ceil(\u221an) = k and sum k multiplied by the count.\n\nFirst, find ceil(\u221a5) = 3, ceil(\u221a29) = 6.\n\nSo, k ranges from 3 to 6.\n\nFor k=3:\n\n\u221an < 3 \u21d2 n < 9\n\nBut ceil(\u221an) = 3 when 2 < \u221an \u2264 3 \u21d2 4 < n \u2264 9.\n\nSo, n=5,6,7,8,9 \u2192 5 terms.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 4 terms from 5-8 and 1 term for 9, totaling 5 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4:\n\n\u221an < 4 \u21d2 n < 16\n\nBut ceil(\u221an) = 4 when 3 < \u221an \u2264 4 \u21d2 9 < n \u2264 16.\n\nSo, n=10,11,12,13,14,15,16 \u2192 7 terms.\n\nWait, earlier I had n=10 to 15 as 6 terms and n=16 as 1 term, totaling 7 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5:\n\n\u221an < 5 \u21d2 n < 25\n\nBut ceil(\u221an) = 5 when 4 < \u221an \u2264 5 \u21d2 16 < n \u2264 25.\n\nSo, n=17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 \u2192 9 terms.\n\nEarlier, I had n=17 to 24 as 8 terms and n=25 as 1 term, totaling 9 terms.\n\nFor k=6:\n\nceil(\u221an) = 6 when 5 < \u221an \u2264 6 \u21d2 25 < n \u2264 36.\n\nBut our n goes up to 29, so n=26,27,28,29 \u2192 4 terms.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- k=3: 5 terms\n\n- k=4: 7 terms\n\n- k=5: 9 terms\n\n- k=6: 4 terms\n\nNow, sum = 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 + 6*4 = 15 + 28 + 45 + 24 = 112.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nBut perhaps there's a miscalculation in the number of terms.\n\nLet's double-check the ranges:\n\n- For k=3: n=5 to 9 \u2192 5 terms\n\n- For k=4: n=10 to 16 \u2192 7 terms\n\n- For k=5: n=17 to 25 \u2192 9 terms\n\n- For k=6: n=26 to 29 \u2192 4 terms\n\nTotal terms: 5 + 7 + 9 + 4 = 25 terms, which is from n=5 to n=29, inclusive.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, sum = 3*5 + 4*7 + 5*9 + 6*4 = 15 + 28 + 45 + 24 = 112.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is interpreted differently, or there's a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that ceil(sqrt(n)) for perfect squares is equal to the square root, which I have already considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is from floor values, but the problem clearly states ceiling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum is from n=5 to n=29 inclusive, which is what I considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are misprinted, and the correct answer is indeed 112.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach using summation formulas, but given the small number of terms, the approach above seems sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the sum to be calculated differently, considering the ceiling function in a different light.\n\nWait, perhaps I can calculate the sum directly:\n\nCalculate ceil(sqrt(n)) for each n from 5 to 29 and sum them up.\n\nLet's do that to verify.\n\nCompute ceil(sqrt(n)) for n=5 to 29:\n\n- n=5: sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236 \u2192 ceil=3\n\n- n=6: sqrt(6) \u2248 2.449 \u2192 ceil=3\n\n- n=7: sqrt(7) \u2248 2.645 \u2192 ceil=3\n\n- n=8: sqrt(8) \u2248 2.828 \u2192 ceil=3\n\n- n=9: sqrt(9) = 3 \u2192 ceil=3\n\n- n=10: sqrt(10) \u2248 3.162 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=11: sqrt(11) \u2248 3.316 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=12: sqrt(12) \u2248 3.464 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=13: sqrt(13) \u2248 3.605 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=14: sqrt(14) \u2248 3.741 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=15: sqrt(15) \u2248 3.872 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=16: sqrt(16) = 4 \u2192 ceil=4\n\n- n=17: sqrt(17) \u2248 4.123 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=18: sqrt(18) \u2248 4.242 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=19: sqrt(19) \u2248 4.358 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=20: sqrt(20) \u2248 4.472 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=21: sqrt(21) \u2248 4.582 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=22: sqrt(22) \u2248 4.690 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=23: sqrt(23) \u2248 4.795 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=24: sqrt(24) \u2248 4.898 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=25: sqrt(25) = 5 \u2192 ceil=5\n\n- n=26: sqrt(26) \u2248 5.099 \u2192 ceil=6\n\n- n=27: sqrt(27) \u2248 5.196 \u2192 ceil=6\n\n- n=28: sqrt(28) \u2248 5.291 \u2192 ceil=6\n\n- n=29: sqrt(29) \u2248 5.385 \u2192 ceil=6\n\nNow, sum all these values:\n\n- 5 terms of 3: 5*3 = 15\n\n- 7 terms of 4: 7*4 = 28\n\n- 9 terms of 5: 9*5 = 45\n\n- 4 terms of 6: 4*6 = 24\n\nTotal sum: 15 + 28 + 45 + 24 = 112.\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different interpretation, such as summing floor values or something else, but the problem clearly states ceiling of square roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that ceil(sqrt(n)) for perfect squares is equal to the square root, which I have already considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is from n=5 to n=29 inclusive, which is what I considered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, or there's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have a different answer, but based on the calculations, it should be 112.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a clever way to compute this sum without listing all the terms, but given the small number of terms, it's not necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be a trick question, but I don't see any trick here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to test the understanding of ceiling and square roots.\n\nIn any case, based on the calculations, the sum should be 112.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{112} \\]"
