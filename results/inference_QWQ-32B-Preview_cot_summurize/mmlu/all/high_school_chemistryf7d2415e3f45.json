                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about irreversible reactions. So, we have four options here, and we need to identify which one is an irreversible reaction. Let's recall what an irreversible reaction is. An irreversible reaction is one that proceeds in one direction only, from reactants to products, and does not reverse back to form reactants under normal conditions.\n\nOption A: CH4(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2(g) + H2O(l)\n\nThis is the combustion of methane. Combustion reactions are generally considered irreversible because they release a lot of energy in the form of heat and light, and it's not easy to reverse the process to get back the original reactants. Once methane burns in oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, it's not straightforward to turn carbon dioxide and water back into methane and oxygen without inputting a significant amount of energy, like in processes such as electrolysis or photosynthesis, which are not spontaneous under normal conditions.\n\nOption B: HCN(aq) + H2O(l) \u2192 CN-(aq) + H3O+(aq)\n\nThis looks like an acid-base reaction where hydrogen cyanide (HCN) donates a proton (H+) to water (H2O), forming the cyanide ion (CN-) and the hydronium ion (H3O+). Acid-base reactions are typically reversible because the products can react back to form the reactants. In other words, the cyanide ion can accept a proton from the hydronium ion to reform HCN and water. So, this is likely a reversible reaction.\n\nOption C: Al(NO3)3(s) \u2192 Al3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)\n\nThis appears to be the dissociation of aluminum nitrate solid into its ions when dissolved in water. Dissolution processes are generally reversible because the ions can recombine to form the solid again upon concentration or change in conditions. However, in practice, for many salts, the dissociation is considered complete, but theoretically, it's reversible. But for the purpose of this question, we might consider it reversible.\n\nOption D: 2Ag+(aq) + Ti(s) \u2192 2Ag(s) + Ti2+(aq)\n\nThis seems to be a redox reaction where titanium metal (Ti) reduces silver ions (Ag+) to silver metal (Ag), while being oxidized itself to titanium(II) ions (Ti2+). Redox reactions can be reversible or irreversible depending on the standard electrode potentials of the half-reactions involved. If the cell potential is large and positive, the reaction is more likely to be irreversible under standard conditions.\n\nTo determine which one is irreversible, we need to consider the thermodynamics and kinetics of each reaction.\n\nFirst, let's look at the standard Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G\u00b0) for each reaction. For a reaction to be spontaneous and proceed in the forward direction, \u0394G\u00b0 should be negative. If \u0394G\u00b0 is highly negative, it suggests that the reaction strongly favors the products and may be considered irreversible under those conditions.\n\nHowever, without specific values for \u0394G\u00b0, we can make some generalizations based on our knowledge of these types of reactions.\n\nOption A: Combustion reactions usually have very negative \u0394G\u00b0 values because they release a lot of energy. The formation of carbon dioxide and water from methane and oxygen is exothermic and has a large negative entropy change, making the reaction highly spontaneous and effectively irreversible under normal conditions.\n\nOption B: Acid-base reactions are generally reversible, as they can establish an equilibrium in solution, where both the forward and reverse reactions occur simultaneously.\n\nOption C: Dissolution of salts is also typically reversible, as evidenced by the solubility product constant (Ksp), which describes the equilibrium between the dissolved ions and the undissolved solid.\n\nOption D: Redox reactions can be irreversible if the standard cell potential is sufficiently positive, indicating a spontaneous forward reaction. However, without specific values, it's harder to gauge the extent of irreversibility.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the energy changes and the likelihood of the reverse reaction occurring spontaneously.\n\nIn option A, the combustion of methane releases a substantial amount of energy, making it difficult for the products (CO2 and H2O) to react and reform methane and oxygen without inputting a large amount of energy. This is why combustion is considered irreversible.\n\nIn option B, the reverse reaction (CN- + H3O+ \u2192 HCN + H2O) can occur easily, as protons can be transferred back and forth between HCN and water, establishing an acid-base equilibrium.\n\nIn option C, the reverse reaction (Al3+ + 3NO3- \u2192 Al(NO3)3(s)) can occur upon concentration or change in conditions, leading to precipitation of the salt.\n\nIn option D, while the reaction may proceed spontaneously under standard conditions, it might still be possible to reverse the reaction by applying an external voltage, making it potentially reversible.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, option A, the combustion of methane, is the most likely to be an irreversible reaction.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in practice, some reactions are considered irreversible because the equilibrium constant is so large in favor of the products that the concentration of reactants is negligible. In such cases, the reaction is effectively irreversible.\n\nIn summary, among the given options, option A represents an irreversible reaction due to the exothermic nature of combustion and the difficulty in reversing the process under normal conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
