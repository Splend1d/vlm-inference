                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: The skate park was closed for the day so I entered anyway.\n\nScenario 2: I didn't give my kids vaccines because I forgot to.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: The skate park was closed for the day so I entered anyway.\n\nSo, the park was closed, but the person still went in. Now, entering a place when it's closed can be seen as disobeying rules, possibly trespassing, which is against the law. Morally, respecting rules and regulations is important for the smooth functioning of society. So, entering a closed park might be seen as morally wrong because it's breaking a rule that's probably there for safety or maintenance reasons.\n\nBut, maybe it's not that serious. Maybe the person just wanted to skate really bad and thought it would be okay this one time. Still, intentionally disregarding a closure sign could be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I didn't give my kids vaccines because I forgot to.\n\nThis one is about not vaccinating children due to forgetting. Vaccinations are widely regarded as important for public health, especially in preventing the spread of contagious diseases. Not vaccinating children can put them and others at risk, especially in a community.\n\nHowever, in this case, the person forgot to vaccinate their kids. It's not like they actively chose not to vaccinate; it was just forgetfulness. So, is forgetting considered morally wrong?\n\nWell, forgetfulness is human, but as a parent, there's a responsibility to ensure your children's health and well-being. Maybe the person should have set reminders or taken more steps to ensure vaccinations were up to date.\n\nBut, compared to Scenario 1, this seems less intentional. In Scenario 1, the person deliberately entered a closed park, whereas in Scenario 2, it was an oversight.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, I think Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong because it involves deliberate rule-breaking, potentially endangering oneself or others, and showing disrespect for the rules set by authorities.\n\nScenario 2 is more nuanced. While vaccinations are important, forgetting to do so might not be seen as morally wrong, but rather as a lapse in responsibility. Maybe it's more of a parental mistake than a morally wrong action.\n\nTherefore, I would say that Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, according to ordinary moral standards.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut, I should double-check. Maybe others think differently.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that not vaccinating children is morally wrong, even if it's due to forgetting. They might say that ensuring children's health is a fundamental moral obligation, and forgetting is no excuse.\n\nOn the other hand, entering a closed park might be seen as a lesser offense, especially if no harm comes from it.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps it depends on the potential consequences. Entering a closed park could be risky, but maybe not as risky as not vaccinating children.\n\nBut in Scenario 2, it's just forgetting, not an active decision against vaccination.\n\nMaybe in 2020, with the emphasis on vaccinations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not vaccinating could be seen as more morally wrong.\n\nWait, but the scenario is from 2020, before COVID vaccines were available. So, probably referring to childhood vaccinations like MMR, polio, etc.\n\nIn any case, vaccinations are important for public health.\n\nHowever, forgetting to vaccinate seems different from choosing not to vaccinate.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not morally wrong, but rather a mistake or failure in responsibility.\n\nIn contrast, deliberately entering a closed park seems more clearly wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
