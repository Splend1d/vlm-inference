                    "text": "So I have this equation: 3 over 4 times x equals 24. In math terms, that's (3/4)*x = 24. I need to find the value of x from the given options: A. 18, B. 32, C. 72, D. 96.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the equation is saying. It's saying that when I take x and multiply it by 3/4, I get 24. So, I need to find out what x is.\n\nOne way to solve for x is to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 3/4. But dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. So, I can multiply both sides by 4/3 to solve for x.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n(3/4)*x = 24\n\nMultiply both sides by 4/3:\n\n(4/3)*(3/4)*x = (4/3)*24\n\nOn the left side, (4/3)*(3/4) simplifies to 1, because 4/3 and 3/4 are reciprocals and their product is 1. So, I have:\n\nx = (4/3)*24\n\nNow, I just need to calculate (4/3)*24. Let's see:\n\nFirst, 24 divided by 3 is 8, and then multiplied by 4 is 32. So, x = 32.\n\nLooking back at the options, B is 32. So, is that the answer?\n\nWait a minute, let me check if there's another way to approach this to confirm.\n\nAnother way could be to think about what number, when multiplied by 3/4, gives 24. So, I can think of it as x*(3/4) = 24.\n\nTo find x, I can rearrange this to x = 24 / (3/4).\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so again, x = 24 * (4/3) = 32.\n\nOkay, that matches my first result. So, x is 32.\n\nLet me just double-check by plugging 32 back into the original equation to see if it makes sense.\n\n(3/4)*32 = ?\n\nWell, 3/4 of 32 should be 24, because 32 divided by 4 is 8, and 8 multiplied by 3 is 24. Yes, that checks out.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what the other options would give.\n\nOption A: 18\n\n(3/4)*18 = 13.5, which is not 24.\n\nOption C: 72\n\n(3/4)*72 = 54, which is not 24.\n\nOption D: 96\n\n(3/4)*96 = 72, which is also not 24.\n\nSo, only option B, which is 32, satisfies the equation.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer is 32.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{32} \\]"
