He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.\n\u2026\nHe looked to the West and prayed, \"I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal.\" When he had prayed he bowed again.\nFrom Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s\nIn which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about an excerpt from \"Journey to the West\" by Wu Chengen, and it's asking how this passage complicates historians' understanding of the real-life Xuanzang. So, first things first, I need to recall who Xuanzang was and what he's famous for.\n\nXuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who lived during the Tang Dynasty. He's best known for his 17-year journey to India, where he studied Buddhism and brought back a large number of Buddhist texts to China. His travels and experiences were documented in a book called \"Great Tang Records on the Western Regions,\" which is a valuable historical source about the regions he traversed.\n\nNow, \"Journey to the West\" is a novel that was written centuries after Xuanzang's time. It's a fictionalized account that takes Xuanzang's journey as its basis but adds a lot of mythological elements, such as the character of the Monkey King, also known as Sun Wukong. So, the excerpt provided here seems to be from this novel, not from a historical record.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.\n\nB. It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived.\n\nC. It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang.\n\nD. It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery.\n\nOption A seems plausible because \"Journey to the West\" definitely adds a lot of fictional elements to Xuanzang's story. For example, in the excerpt, there's a prayer to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King, which is a mythical element not present in historical accounts.\n\nOption B is also true; \"Journey to the West\" was written in the late 16th century, long after Xuanzang's time (he lived in the 7th century). However, the fact that it was written long after his time doesn't necessarily complicate historians' understanding unless it's mistaken for a historical account.\n\nOption C is interesting. Does the excerpt cast doubt on Xuanzang's actual existence? Well, Xuanzang is a well-documented historical figure, and his travels are corroborated by other sources. So, this novel doesn't really cast doubt on his existence; it just adds fictional elements to his story.\n\nOption D says that it's widely considered a forgery by scholars. I don't think that's the case. \"Journey to the West\" is widely recognized as a classic of Chinese literature, and while it's a work of fiction, it's not considered a forgery.\n\nSo, going back to option A, the excerpt does highly fictionalize Xuanzang's accomplishments by incorporating mythological elements like praying to release the Monkey King. This could complicate historians' understanding if readers confuse the fictional account with historical facts.\n\nOption B, while true, isn't directly complicating historians' understanding unless someone\u8beftakes the novel for a historical document.\n\nOption C is not accurate because Xuanzang's existence is well-established.\n\nOption D is not correct because the novel isn't considered a forgery.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be A: It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to consider. The novel is widely known to be a work of fiction, so historians generally wouldn't take its contents as literal history. However, it's possible that some readers might not distinguish between the fiction and history, leading to confusion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the novel reflects popular beliefs or myths about Xuanzang that could indicate something about how he was perceived in later times, which could be of interest to historians studying the evolution of his reputation.\n\nBut the question is specifically about how the excerpt complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career. I think the main complication arises from the fictional elements being attributed to a historical figure, which could lead to misunderstandings about what actually happened during his journey.\n\nSo, I still think option A is the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
