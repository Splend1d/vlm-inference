                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"If a couple has had three sons and the woman is pregnant with their fourth child, what is the probability that child 4 will also be male? A. 1/2 B. 1/4 C. 1/8 D. 1/16\"\n\nOkay, so at first glance, it seems straightforward. We know that the probability of having a boy or a girl is generally considered to be 50% for each, assuming that the chances are equal and that each birth is an independent event.\n\nSo, for the fourth child, regardless of what happened with the first three, the probability should still be 1/2, right? Because each birth is its own event, and the sex of previous children doesn't affect the sex of the next one.\n\nBut let me double-check this. Maybe there's something about having three sons in a row that affects the probability for the fourth child. I've heard about people thinking that if a couple has had several boys, the next one is more likely to be a girl, or vice versa. But in reality, each birth is an independent event, meaning the sex of the previous children doesn't influence the sex of the next one.\n\nSo, the probability should indeed be 1/2, option A.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the question is trying to trick me by presenting the number of previous children. Perhaps some people might think that after three boys, the next one is more likely to be a girl, but that's not how probability works. Each birth is independent, so the probability remains the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that since there have been three boys already, the probability of having another boy is (1/2)^4, which is 1/16. But that would be the probability of having four boys in a row, not the probability of the fourth child being a boy given that the first three were boys.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the probability that the fourth child is male, given that the first three were males.\n\nGiven that each birth is independent, the probability shouldn't be affected by previous outcomes. So, it should still be 1/2.\n\nLet me consider it another way. Suppose we flip a coin three times and get heads each time. What's the probability of getting heads on the fourth flip? It's still 1/2, because each flip is independent.\n\nSimilarly, the sex of each child is like an independent event, assuming that there are no genetic factors or other influences that skew the probability.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, I should consider if there are any factors that could make the probability different.\n\nFor example, some families might have a genetic predisposition to have more boys or more girls. But in general, for the purpose of probability questions like this, we assume that the probability is equal for both sexes, and that each birth is independent.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the concept of conditional probability. The probability of the fourth child being male given that the first three are male.\n\nIn probability terms, this would be P(4th is male | first 3 are male).\n\nSince the events are independent, P(A|B) = P(A), so P(4th is male | first 3 are male) = P(4th is male) = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 1/2, which is option A.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be tempting but are incorrect.\n\nOption B, 1/4, might be thought of as (1/2)^2, which could make sense if you were considering two events, but in this case, we're only considering one event: the fourth child being male.\n\nOption C, 1/8, is (1/2)^3, which might correspond to the probability of having four boys in a row, but again, the question is only about the fourth child.\n\nOption D, 1/16, is (1/2)^4, which would be the probability of having four boys in a row, but again, that's not what's being asked here.\n\nThe question is specifically about the probability of the fourth child being male, given that the first three were male.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct answer is A. 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
