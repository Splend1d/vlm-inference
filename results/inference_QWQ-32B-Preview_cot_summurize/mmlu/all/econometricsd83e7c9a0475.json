                    "text": "So I've got this question about residuals in a standard regression model. It asks for the definition of a residual and gives four options. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nOption A says the residual is the difference between the actual value, y, and the mean of y, which is y-bar. Hmm, that sounds familiar, but I think that might be related to something else.\n\nOption B is the difference between the fitted value, y-hat, and the mean, y-bar. Again, this seems like it could be related to some measure, maybe the total sum of squares or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption C states that the residual is the difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat. That rings a bell. I think this is the one. In regression, the residual is supposed to show how far off the prediction is from the actual value.\n\nOption D is the square of the difference between the fitted value, y-hat, and the mean, y-bar. Squaring differences makes me think of sum of squares, which is used in analyzing variance, but I don't think that's the residual.\n\nLet me try to recall: in regression, the residual is the error term, which is the difference between what you observe (y) and what the model predicts (y-hat). So, it should be y minus y-hat.\n\nWait, but sometimes it's y-hat minus y. No, I think it's y minus y-hat. Yeah, that makes sense because if y is higher than y-hat, the residual is positive, indicating the model underestimated, and vice versa.\n\nLet me see if I can find a way to confirm this. Maybe I can think about the least squares method. In least squares regression, we minimize the sum of squared residuals. So, residual squared would be (y - y-hat)^2. So, the residual itself should be y - y-hat.\n\nOption C matches that description. The other options don't seem to fit as well. For example, option A is y - y-bar, which is the total deviation, and option B is y-hat - y-bar, which is the explained deviation. Option D looks like it might be related to the explained sum of squares, but squared.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is option C: the difference between the actual value, y, and the fitted value, y-hat.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are not correct.\n\nOption A: y - y-bar is the total deviation of the observed value from the mean. This is used in the total sum of squares, but it's not the residual.\n\nOption B: y-hat - y-bar is the difference between the fitted value and the mean, which represents how much the model explains beyond the mean. This is related to the explained sum of squares.\n\nOption D: The square of (y-hat - y-bar) is indeed part of the explained sum of squares, but again, not the residual.\n\nTherefore, the residual in a standard regression model is indeed the difference between the actual value and the fitted value, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
