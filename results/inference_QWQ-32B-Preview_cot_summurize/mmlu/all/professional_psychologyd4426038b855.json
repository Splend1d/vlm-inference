                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which part of the brain is likely damaged when someone can't recognize objects just by touching them. The options are the medulla oblongata, corpus callosum, parietal cortex, and pons. I think this has something to do with sensory processing, maybe?\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these parts does. The medulla oblongata is really low in the brainstem, and it's involved in autonomic functions like heart rate and breathing. Doesn't seem directly related to touch recognition.\n\nThe corpus callosum is the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. It's important for communication between the left and right sides, but I don't think it's specifically involved in touch recognition.\n\nThe parietal cortex is part of the cerebral cortex and is known to be involved in processing touch and spatial information. There's something called the somatosensory cortex that's located in the parietal lobe, which is crucial for interpreting touch sensations.\n\nThe pons is also in the brainstem and is involved in controlling things like sleep, breathing, and motor functions. Again, not directly related to touch recognition.\n\nSo, if I had to guess, I'd say it's the parietal cortex. Specifically, maybe the somatosensory cortex is damaged, which would impair the ability to recognize objects by touch alone.\n\nWait, but I remember that there's a condition called tactile agnosia, where people can't identify objects by touch even though their sensory abilities are intact. Maybe that's related.\n\nLet me see. If the somatosensory cortex is damaged, that could interfere with processing touch information, but I think tactile agnosia might involve higher-level processing, maybe in the association areas of the parietal cortex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the connection between the sensory input and memory or other cognitive functions.\n\nI don't think the medulla or pons are involved in higher-level sensory processing like object recognition. They're more about basic life-sustaining functions.\n\nThe corpus callosum connects the hemispheres, but unless there's a disconnection syndrome, I don't see how that directly affects touch recognition.\n\nSo, I think the answer is the parietal cortex. That makes the most sense based on what I know about brain anatomy and function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
