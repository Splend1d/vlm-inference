                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about economics, and I need to pick the best description from these options. So, economics is basically about how we manage things when we don't have enough of something, right? Like, how we decide what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets it.\n\nOption A says: \"the study of how scarce material wants are allocated between unlimited resources.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit off. I think it's the other way around. Resources are scarce, and wants are unlimited, right?\n\nOption B says: \"the study of how scarce labor can be replaced by unlimited capital.\" Well, economics does involve labor and capital, but I don't think that's the core definition. It seems too narrow.\n\nOption C says: \"the study of how decision makers choose the best way to satisfy their unlimited material wants with a scarce supply of resources.\" That sounds more like it. It mentions scarce resources and unlimited wants, which are key concepts in economics.\n\nOption D says: \"the study of how unlimited material wants can best be satisfied by allocating limitless amounts of productive resources.\" Wait, but resources aren't limitless. That's not accurate.\n\nSo, based on what I know, economics is about making choices because we can't have everything we want due to limited resources. So, decision makers have to prioritize and allocate resources efficiently.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the best description. It captures both the unlimited nature of human wants and the scarcity of resources, which are fundamental to economic study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
