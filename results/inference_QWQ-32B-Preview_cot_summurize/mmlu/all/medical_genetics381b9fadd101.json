This enzyme is necessary for breaking down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in nerve cells. When HexA is deficient or absent, GM2 ganglioside accumulates in the brain, leading to progressive damage and degeneration of the nervous system.\n\nOption A, alpha-L-iduronidase, is deficient in another genetic disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), which affects the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans.\n\nOption B, glucose-6-phosphatase, is deficient in a condition known as glycogen storage disease type I, which affects glucose metabolism.\n\nOption D, homogentisic acid oxidase, is deficient in alkaptonuria, a disorder that leads to the accumulation of homogentisic acid and causes various health issues, including ochronosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Hexosaminidase A."
