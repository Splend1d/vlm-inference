                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this contract law problem. So, there's a man who offered to sell his motorcycle to a woman for $1,000, and she responded with a fax saying she'll pay $800. The man said no to that. Then, the next day, she calls him and says she'll pay $1,000, but he refuses to sell. Now, if she sues him for breach of contract, what's the best defense for the man among the options given?\n\nLet me try to understand this step by step. First, the man made an offer to sell his motorcycle for $1,000. That's a clear offer, right? Then, the woman responded with a counteroffer, saying she'll pay $800 instead. So, her fax is a counteroffer, not an acceptance, because she's changing the terms of the original offer.\n\nThe man rejects her counteroffer, saying he won't accept $800. So, at this point, the original offer is still on the table, but she hasn't accepted it yet. Then, the next day, she calls him and says she'll pay $1,000, which is the same as the original offer.\n\nNow, I need to think about whether this phone call constitutes an acceptance of the original offer or not. Since she's agreeing to the original terms, maybe it's an acceptance. But I remember that in contract law, there are rules about when an offer can be accepted and when it can't.\n\nOption A says that since her purported acceptance was oral, it's a different mode of communication from the written offer. I think there's a principle that acceptance should be in the same or a lesser formal manner than the offer, unless specified otherwise. Here, the offer was in writing, and her acceptance is oral. So, maybe oral acceptance is acceptable because it's less formal than writing.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best defense for the man. Option B says the contract is unenforceable under the statute of frauds because the acceptance was oral. Well, the statute of frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing, but I think this might not apply here because the offer was in writing, and they were trying to agree on the terms.\n\nOption C says the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance. Hmm, that seems plausible. When someone makes a counteroffer, it's considered a rejection of the original offer, and the original offer is no longer open for acceptance. So, by making a counteroffer, she might have killed the original offer.\n\nOption D is similar: the man's rejection of the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance. Wait, but she's trying to accept the original offer again after her counteroffer was rejected.\n\nI think option C is stronger because once she made a counteroffer, the original offer is off the table. So, even if the man didn't reject her counteroffer, the original offer might still be dead because she countered.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the original offer is still open, and she can accept it even after making a counteroffer, especially since the man rejected her counteroffer. In some cases, the power of acceptance can be revived after a counteroffer.\n\nI recall that in some scenarios, if the offeree makes a counteroffer and then wants to accept the original offer, they might need to communicate that clearly. Maybe in this case, her phone call saying she'll pay $1,000 is an attempt to accept the original offer.\n\nBut the man might argue that by making a counteroffer, she terminated the original offer, and since he rejected her counteroffer, there's no contract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phone call is a new offer to buy at $1,000, but in that case, the man can accept or reject it. If he rejects it, there's no contract.\n\nWait, but the question is, if she sues for breach of contract, what's the best defense? So, presumably, there was some kind of agreement that she's relying on.\n\nI think option C is the strongest defense for the man because her counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance of the original offer. Therefore, even if she later says she'll accept the original terms, it's too late because the offer is no longer valid.\n\nOption D is similar, but option C directly addresses that her counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nLet me check if there's any other angle. Is there something about the mode of communication affecting the acceptance? Option A mentions that oral acceptance is different from the written offer.\n\nI think the general rule is that acceptance can be oral unless the offer specifies that acceptance must be in writing. Here, the offer was in writing, but it didn't specify that acceptance must be in writing. So, an oral acceptance might be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, option A might not be a strong defense.\n\nOption B about the statute of frauds: typically, contracts that need to be in writing include sales of land or contracts that can't be performed within one year. A motorcycle sale might not fall under that, unless there are specific state laws requiring it.\n\nSo, option B might not apply.\n\nThat leaves option C as the best defense: the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure. Maybe I should look up some case law or principles on this.\n\nIn contract law, when an offeree makes a counteroffer, it's considered a rejection of the original offer and a new offer. Therefore, the original offer is no longer open for acceptance.\n\nIn this case, the woman made a counteroffer by proposing $800 instead of $1,000. By doing so, she rejected the original offer, and the man's offer is no longer available for her to accept.\n\nThen, when she later tries to accept the original offer by offering $1,000 again, it's too late because the original offer has been terminated by her counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid acceptance, and no contract was formed.\n\nHence, the man's best defense would be that the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nSo, option C is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider option D: the man's rejection of the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance.\n\nWell, actually, it's the making of the counteroffer that terminates the original offer, not necessarily the rejection of the counteroffer.\n\nIn other words, when the woman makes a counteroffer, she's rejecting the original offer, regardless of whether the man accepts or rejects her counteroffer.\n\nSo, even if the man hadn't responded to her counteroffer, the original offer would still be terminated by her counteroffer.\n\nTherefore, option C is more accurate than option D.\n\nOption A about the mode of communication isn't relevant here because acceptance can be oral even if the offer was in writing, unless specified otherwise.\n\nOption B about the statute of frauds doesn't apply because this is likely not a type of contract that requires writing.\n\nThus, the man's best defense is that the woman's counteroffer terminated her power of acceptance, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
