                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement doesn't describe a factor that contributed to suburbanization in the United States. So, suburbanization is when people move from the city to the suburbs, right? And there were several factors that led to this trend, especially after World War II.\n\nOption A says, \"A shorter workweek made time for a commute possible.\" Hmm, that's interesting. If people had a shorter workweek, they might have more time to spend commuting back and forth from the suburbs to the city. So, that could be a contributing factor.\n\nOption B says, \"Changes in the housing mortgage regulations made home ownership easier.\" Yeah, after World War II, there were programs like the G.I. Bill that helped veterans get mortgages with low interest rates and no down payment. This made it easier for people to buy homes, and many chose to buy in the suburbs rather than in the city.\n\nOption C says, \"Fixed-route public transit routes increased in importance.\" Now, I think public transit was more important in the city, where people could take buses or subways to get around. But in the suburbs, people relied more on cars because suburbs are spread out and don't have as much public transportation. So, if fixed-route public transit increased in importance, that might actually discourage suburbanization, because people might prefer to stay in the city where public transit is better.\n\nWait, but suburbanization was partly driven by the desire for single-family homes and more space, which suburbs offered. So, maybe an increase in public transit importance wouldn't be a factor contributing to suburbanization. In fact, it might be the opposite.\n\nOption D says, \"Improved automobiles made transportation easier and less limited.\" That makes sense because better cars and highways made it feasible for people to live farther from their workplaces. So, that definitely contributed to suburbanization.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, A, B, and D seem to be factors that contributed to suburbanization, while C seems to be contrary to it. Therefore, the statement that does NOT describe a factor that contributed to suburbanization is C: \"Fixed-route public transit routes increased in importance.\"\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe in some suburbs, public transit did play a role. However, generally speaking, suburbs are more car-dependent, so an increase in the importance of fixed-route public transit would probably be more beneficial for city dwellers who rely on public transport.\n\nYes, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
