                    "text": "To obtain a high value of capacitance, the permittivity of the dielectric medium should be high.\n\nCapacitance (C) is directly proportional to the permittivity (\u03b5) of the dielectric material between the plates of a capacitor. The formula for capacitance in a parallel-plate capacitor is:\n\nC = \u03b5 * (A / d)\n\nwhere:\n\n- C is the capacitance\n\n- \u03b5 is the permittivity of the dielectric material\n\n- A is the area of one of the plates\n\n- d is the distance between the two plates\n\nFrom this formula, it's clear that increasing the permittivity \u03b5 will increase the capacitance C, provided that the plate area A and the plate separation d remain constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. high.\n\nOption A (low) would result in lower capacitance, which is not desirable in this context.\n\nOption B (zero) is not practical because a dielectric with zero permittivity wouldn't store any electrical energy, rendering the capacitor ineffective.\n\nOption D (unity) means that the permittivity is equal to 1, which in SI units would be 1 F/m (farad per meter). However, the permittivity of free space (vacuum) is approximately 8.854 x 10^-12 F/m, and most dielectric materials have a relative permittivity greater than 1, meaning their absolute permittivity is higher than that of free space. Therefore, choosing a dielectric with a permittivity of unity wouldn't maximize capacitance; in fact, it would be less than using a material with a higher permittivity.\n\nIn summary, to achieve a high capacitance value, one should select a dielectric material with a high permittivity.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- **Relative Permittivity (\u03b5r):** Often, dielectric materials are characterized by their relative permittivity, which is the ratio of the permittivity of the material to the permittivity of free space (\u03b50). So, \u03b5 = \u03b5r * \u03b50.\n\n- **Dielectric Materials:** Materials with high relative permittivity, such as ceramics, are often used in capacitors to maximize capacitance in a small volume.\n\n- **Practical Considerations:** While higher permittivity leads to higher capacitance, other factors such as dielectric strength (the maximum electric field the material can withstand without breaking down) and stability under temperature variations are also important considerations in selecting a dielectric material for a capacitor.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\n\nSuppose we have two dielectric materials: Material X with \u03b5r = 5 and Material Y with \u03b5r = 10. If we use these materials in identical capacitors (same A and d), the capacitance with Material Y will be twice that of Material X because its permittivity is twice as high.\n\nThis demonstrates how choosing a material with higher permittivity can directly increase the capacitance of a capacitor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor obtaining a high value of capacitance, it is beneficial to use a dielectric material with a high permittivity. This is because capacitance is directly proportional to the permittivity of the dielectric, as shown by the capacitance formula for a parallel-plate capacitor.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
