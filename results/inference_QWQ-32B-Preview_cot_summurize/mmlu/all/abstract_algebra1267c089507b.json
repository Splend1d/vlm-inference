                    "text": "So I have this problem: I need to find all values of \\( c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) such that the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \\) is a field. The options are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what it means for \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) \\) to be a field. I think that this quotient ring is a field if and only if the polynomial \\( x^3 + x^2 + c \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Is that correct?\n\nYes, that's right. So, my task reduces to finding for which \\( c \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) the polynomial \\( x^3 + x^2 + c \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nNow, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is the field with three elements: 0, 1, and 2. Wait, but the options include 3. Is 3 equivalent to 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\)? Because 3 mod 3 is 0.\n\nYes, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), 3 is the same as 0. So, option D (3) is actually the same as option A (0).\n\nSo, I need to check for \\( c = 0, 1, 2 \\) whether the polynomial \\( x^3 + x^2 + c \\) is irreducible over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nA polynomial of degree 3 over a field is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in that field. Is that a correct statement?\n\nYes, that's correct. So, to check irreducibility, I can simply check if the polynomial has any roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). If it doesn't, then it's irreducible.\n\nAlright, let's proceed to check each value of \\( c \\).\n\nFirst, \\( c = 0 \\):\n\nConsider \\( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 \\).\n\nLet's check if this has any roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).\n\nCheck \\( x = 0 \\):\n\n\\( f(0) = 0^3 + 0^2 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, x = 0 is a root. Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) is reducible.\n\nSo, \\( c = 0 \\) is not a valid choice.\n\nNext, \\( c = 1 \\):\n\nConsider \\( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1 \\).\n\nCheck for roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\):\n\nx = 0:\n\n\\( f(0) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \\neq 0 \\).\n\nx = 1:\n\n\\( f(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\) mod 3.\n\nSo, x = 1 is a root. Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) is reducible.\n\nThus, \\( c = 1 \\) is not a valid choice.\n\nNext, \\( c = 2 \\):\n\nConsider \\( f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 2 \\).\n\nCheck for roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\):\n\nx = 0:\n\n\\( f(0) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 \\neq 0 \\).\n\nx = 1:\n\n\\( f(1) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\neq 0 \\).\n\nx = 2:\n\n\\( f(2) = 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \\equiv 14 - 4*3 = 14 - 12 = 2 \\neq 0 \\).\n\nSo, no roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) is irreducible.\n\nHence, \\( c = 2 \\) is a valid choice.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem includes option D, which is 3. As I mentioned earlier, 3 is equivalent to 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), and we've already seen that \\( c = 0 \\) is not a valid choice because the polynomial is reducible.\n\nSo, the only valid value for \\( c \\) is 2.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning. Is it true that a cubic polynomial over a field is irreducible if and only if it has no roots in that field?\n\nYes, that's a standard result. Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\) is a field, this should hold.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I've checked all possible values of \\( c \\) correctly.\n\nFor \\( c = 0 \\), the polynomial is \\( x^3 + x^2 = x^2(x + 1) \\), which is clearly reducible.\n\nFor \\( c = 1 \\), the polynomial is \\( x^3 + x^2 + 1 \\), which has x = 1 as a root, so it's reducible.\n\nFor \\( c = 2 \\), the polynomial is \\( x^3 + x^2 + 2 \\), which has no roots in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), so it's irreducible.\n\nTherefore, the only value of \\( c \\) that makes the quotient ring a field is \\( c = 2 \\).\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 2.\n\nWait, but the problem includes option D. 3, which is equivalent to 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\), and we've seen that \\( c = 0 \\) does not work. So, perhaps the problem includes 3 to test if the student remembers that 3 is congruent to 0 mod 3.\n\nIn any case, my conclusion is that only \\( c = 2 \\) makes the quotient ring a field.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
