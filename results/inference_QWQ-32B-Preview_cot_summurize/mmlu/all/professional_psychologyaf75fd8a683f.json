                    "text": "So I've come across this term \"Zeigarnik effect\" and there's a multiple-choice question about it. The question is: \"The basic premise of the \u2018Zeigarnik effect\u2019 is that:\" and then it gives four options. Let me see what each option says.\n\nOption A: \"we tend to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones.\"\n\nOption B: \"we tend to remember finished tasks better than unfinished ones.\"\n\nOption C: \"we tend to remember difficult tasks better than easy ones.\"\n\nOption D: \"we tend to remember easy tasks better than difficult ones.\"\n\nHmm, I think I've heard about the Zeigarnik effect before, but I need to recall what it's about. I believe it has something to do with how we remember tasks based on whether they're completed or not.\n\nLet me try to remember. I think Bluma Zeigarnik, a psychologist, observed that people remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones. She noticed this in a restaurant where waiters had better memories for orders that were in the process of being served, as opposed to those that were completely served and paid for.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then option A seems to be the correct one: \"we tend to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones.\"\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misremembering. Perhaps the effect is about finished tasks being remembered better. No, I think the core idea is that there's a tension or an urge to complete tasks, and that unfinished tasks stay active in our memory until they're resolved.\n\nLet me consider option B: \"we tend to remember finished tasks better than unfinished ones.\" That seems contrary to what I recall about the Zeigarnik effect.\n\nOptions C and D are about the difficulty of tasks: whether difficult or easy tasks are remembered better. I don't think the Zeigarnik effect is about the difficulty of tasks, but rather about their completion status.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct answer. But to be thorough, maybe I should look up the Zeigarnik effect to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the effect applies only under certain conditions. For example, perhaps it's about interrupted tasks or tasks that were intentionally left unfinished.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about what motivates people to complete tasks. If there's an innate drive to finish what we start, then unfinished tasks might stay prominent in our memory until they're completed.\n\nAlso, perhaps this relates to cognitive dissonance\u2014there's a mental discomfort associated with unfinished tasks, which prompts us to remember them better so we can complete them and reduce that discomfort.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the allocation of attention. Unfinished tasks might remain in our working memory, occupying cognitive resources until they're resolved, making them more memorable.\n\nOn the other hand, once a task is finished, it might be filed away in long-term memory, making it less accessible in the short term.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to confuse the Zeigarnik effect with other memory phenomena.\n\nPerhaps I should consider some examples. Let's say I'm working on a puzzle, and I have to leave in the middle of it. According to the Zeigarnik effect, I should remember the puzzle and its current state better than puzzles I've already completed.\n\nSimilarly, if I'm reading a book and put it down in the middle of an interesting part, I might remember that part more vividly than parts I've already finished reading.\n\nIn contrast, tasks that are completed might be less memorable because there's no need to remember them\u2014they're done.\n\nSo, based on this, option A seems correct.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should consider the original research. Bluma Zeigarnik conducted experiments where she observed that waiters had better recall for unpaid orders than for those that were paid and thus considered completed.\n\nThis supports the idea that unfinished tasks are better remembered.\n\nAdditionally, in experimental settings, participants who were interrupted while working on tasks remembered those interrupted tasks better than the ones they completed.\n\nThis further reinforces the notion that unfinished tasks stick in our memory more than finished ones.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that option A is correct: \"we tend to remember unfinished tasks better than finished ones.\"\n\nOptions B, C, and D are not aligned with the Zeigarnik effect.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
