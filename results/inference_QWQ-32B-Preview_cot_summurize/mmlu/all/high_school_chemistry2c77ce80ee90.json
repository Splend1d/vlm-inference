                    "text": "To find the molar mass of a monoprotic weak acid, we need to determine how many moles of the acid are present in a given mass and then use that to find the molar mass. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Determine the number of moles of KOH used in the titration:**\n\n   The titration involves reacting the weak acid with KOH, a strong base, until neutralization occurs. Since the acid is monoprotic, it donates one proton per molecule, and KOH donates one hydroxide ion per molecule. Therefore, the reaction is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{HA} + \\text{KOH} \\rightarrow \\text{KA} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n   \\]\n\n   From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of HA to KOH is 1:1.\n\n   First, calculate the number of moles of KOH used:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of KOH} = \\text{concentration of KOH} \\times \\text{volume of KOH}\n   \\]\n\n   Given:\n\n   - Concentration of KOH = 0.122 M\n\n   - Volume of KOH = 26.3 mL = 0.0263 L (since 1 L = 1000 mL)\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of KOH} = 0.122 \\, \\text{M} \\times 0.0263 \\, \\text{L} = 0.0032086 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the number of moles of the weak acid (HA):**\n\n   From the stoichiometry of the reaction, the number of moles of HA is equal to the number of moles of KOH:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{moles of HA} = 0.0032086 \\, \\text{mol}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the molar mass of the weak acid:**\n\n   The molar mass (M) is the mass of the substance divided by the number of moles:\n\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{\\text{mass of HA}}{\\text{moles of HA}}\n   \\]\n\n   Given:\n\n   - Mass of HA = 0.682 g\n\n   - Moles of HA = 0.0032086 mol\n\n   \\[\n   M = \\frac{0.682 \\, \\text{g}}{0.0032086 \\, \\text{mol}} \\approx 212.5 \\, \\text{g/mol}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Select the closest answer from the options provided:**\n\n   The calculated molar mass is approximately 212.5 g/mol, which corresponds to option A: 212 g mol-1.\n\nTherefore, the molar mass of the monoprotic weak acid is \\boxed{212 \\, \\text{g mol}^{-1}}."
