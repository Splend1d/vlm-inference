Let me see why.\n\nFirst, AIDS activism in the U.S. was really intense, especially in the 1980s and 1990s when there was a lot of fear and misunderstanding about the disease. Activists were pushing for more research, better treatments, and greater acceptance of people with AIDS.\n\nSo, starting with option A, FDA reforms. The FDA is the Food and Drug Administration, and they regulate drugs and medical devices in the U.S. AIDS activists were frustrated because the FDA was taking too long to approve new drugs that could help people with AIDS. So, they pushed for reforms that would speed up the drug approval process without compromising safety. This led to things like fast-track designations and accelerated approval pathways, which are still used today for life-threatening conditions.\n\nOption B, easier access to investigational drugs. Before a drug is approved by the FDA, it's considered investigational and isn't available to the general public. But AIDS patients were dying waiting for these drugs to be approved. So, activists fought for expanded access programs, also known as compassionate use, which allow seriously ill patients to try drugs that are still in clinical trials. This was a big victory for patients who had no other options.\n\nOption C, changes in the way medicine was practiced in the U.S. AIDS activism also had an impact on medical practice. For example, activists pushed for more patient involvement in clinical trials, better informed consent processes, and more community-based care. They also advocated for harm reduction strategies, like needle exchange programs, to prevent the spread of HIV among drug users.\n\nSo, all three of these options\u2014FDA reforms, easier access to investigational drugs, and changes in medical practice\u2014were areas where AIDS activism brought about significant changes. Therefore, the correct answer is D, all of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
