                    "text": "So here's this scenario: it's late at night, and this guy is at home in his apartment, all by himself. Someone keeps buzzing his apartment ringer outside the building, but he's really tired and just wants to sleep, so he doesn't answer. Then, all of a sudden, he hears his apartment door being kicked in, and there's a guy with a gun who threatens him, saying something like, \"Give me your cash or else.\" The man complies, hands over the money from his safe, and the perpetrator runs off with it. But pretty quickly, the police catch the perpetrator a few minutes later.\n\nNow, the question is asking about common law crimes that the perpetrator has probably committed. The options are:\n\nA. Burglary and attempted murder.\n\nB. Robbery and attempted murder.\n\nC. Robbery, burglary, and attempted murder.\n\nD. Robbery and burglary.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these crimes entails under common law.\n\nStarting with burglary. Traditionally, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering of a building belonging to another person at night, with the intent to commit a felony inside. Now, in this scenario, the perpetrator kicks in the door to enter the apartment, which sounds like \"breaking and entering.\" The apartment is certainly a building belonging to another person, and it's night time. The intent here seems to be to commit theft or robbery, which are felonies. So, it seems like burglary is one of the crimes committed.\n\nNext, robbery. Robbery is generally defined as the taking of property from another person by force or threat of force. In this case, the perpetrator enters the apartment with a gun, threatens the man, and demands his cash. The man hands over the money from his safe. This seems to fit the definition of robbery perfectly.\n\nNow, attempted murder. This is where it gets a bit tricky. Attempted murder is an attempt to commit murder without actually succeeding. Murder is the unlawful killing of another person with malice aforethought. In this scenario, the perpetrator threatens the man with a gun but doesn't actually harm him. Is this enough to constitute attempted murder?\n\nWell, under common law, attempted murder requires specific intent to kill, and some act towards that intent, falling short of actual killing. Here, the perpetrator is waving a gun and making threats, but there's no actual violence inflicted. So, it's not entirely clear if there was an intent to kill or just an intent to intimidate to get the money.\n\nGiven that, I'm a bit skeptical about charging attempted murder in this case. It seems more like the perpetrator wanted to rob the man, not necessarily kill him. The gun was used as a tool for intimidation to get the money, not necessarily with the intent to kill.\n\nSo, considering that, options A, B, and C include attempted murder, which I'm not entirely sure about. Option D includes only robbery and burglary, which both seem clearly applicable.\n\nLet me think about this some more. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, brandishing a gun during a robbery could elevate the charges, but that's different from attempted murder. Also, if the perpetrator had pulled the trigger or otherwise acted in a way that directly endangered the man's life, then attempted murder might be more applicable. But as it stands, it seems like the threat was to get the money, not necessarily to kill the man.\n\nAdditionally, at common law, burglary and robbery are separate offenses, and it's possible to be charged with both if the elements of each are met, as they are in this case.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the most accurate answer is D: robbery and burglary.\n\nOptions A, B, and C include attempted murder, which, based on the information provided, doesn't seem to be supported. There's no indication that the perpetrator had the intent to kill or attempted to kill the man; it was more about intimidating him to hand over the money.\n\nTherefore, D seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
