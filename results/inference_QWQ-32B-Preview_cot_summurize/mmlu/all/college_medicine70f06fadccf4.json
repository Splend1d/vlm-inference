The question is: \"The transcription of DNA to a molecule of messenger RNA occurs:\n\nA. on the ribosomes.\n\nB. in the cytosol.\n\nC. in the nucleus.\n\nD. only during cell division.\"\n\nOkay, so transcription is when the information in DNA is copied into mRNA. I need to remember where in the cell this process takes place.\n\nFirst, let's think about the locations mentioned in the options.\n\nA. Ribosomes: I know that ribosomes are where translation occurs, which is the process of translating the mRNA into protein. So, transcription shouldn't happen there.\n\nB. Cytosol: That's the jelly-like substance inside the cell. Some processes happen there, but I'm not sure about transcription.\n\nC. Nucleus: That's where the DNA is stored in eukaryotic cells. It makes sense that transcription would happen where the DNA is.\n\nD. Only during cell division: Transcription can happen at any time, not just during cell division. Cells need to make proteins all the time for various functions.\n\nSo, considering that, option C, the nucleus, seems like the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. In prokaryotic cells, there's no nucleus, so does transcription happen in the cytoplasm there? Well, the question doesn't specify the type of cell, but usually, when they just say \"the cell,\" it refers to eukaryotic cells.\n\nAlso, I recall that in eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus, and then the mRNA is processed and transported to the cytoplasm for translation.\n\nSo, yes, I think C. in the nucleus is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider why the other options are incorrect.\n\nA. Ribosomes: As I said, ribosomes are for translation, not transcription.\n\nB. Cytosol: In eukaryotes, transcription doesn't occur in the cytosol because the DNA is confined to the nucleus.\n\nD. Only during cell division: Transcription can occur throughout the cell cycle, not just during division.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. in the nucleus.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
