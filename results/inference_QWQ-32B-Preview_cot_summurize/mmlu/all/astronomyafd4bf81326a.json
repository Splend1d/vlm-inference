The options are:\n\nA. infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays, radio\n\nB. radio, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma rays\n\nC. gamma rays, X-rays, visible light, ultraviolet, infrared, radio\n\nD. gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio\n\nI know that electromagnetic radiation includes things like radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. They all make up the electromagnetic spectrum, and they're ordered by their wavelengths and frequencies.\n\nI remember that wavelengths and frequencies are inversely related, meaning that the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency and energy. So, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest energy, while radio waves have the longest wavelengths and lowest energy.\n\nLet me try to list them in order from shortest to longest wavelength:\n\n1. Gamma rays\n\n2. X-rays\n\n3. Ultraviolet\n\n4. Visible light\n\n5. Infrared\n\n6. Radio waves\n\nWait, does that match any of the options?\n\nLooking at option D: gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, radio. That seems to match what I just listed.\n\nOption A has infrared before visible light, which I think is incorrect because visible light has shorter wavelengths than infrared.\n\nOption B starts with radio, which has the longest wavelength, so that doesn't make sense for ordering from shortest to longest.\n\nOption C has gamma rays and X-rays first, which is correct, but then it has visible light before ultraviolet, which I think is wrong because ultraviolet has shorter wavelengths than visible light.\n\nWait, no. Actually, visible light has shorter wavelengths than infrared, but longer than ultraviolet. So, ultraviolet comes before visible light in terms of shorter wavelengths.\n\nWait, no, visible light is between ultraviolet and infrared. Ultraviolet has shorter wavelengths than visible light, and infrared has longer wavelengths.\n\nSo, correcting my earlier list:\n\nFrom shortest to longest wavelength:\n\n1. Gamma rays\n\n2. X-rays\n\n3. Ultraviolet\n\n4. Visible light\n\n5. Infrared\n\n6. Radio waves\n\nYes, that matches option D.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGamma rays: shortest wavelength, highest energy.\n\nX-rays: longer than gamma, still very short.\n\nUltraviolet: longer than X-rays, still shorter than visible light.\n\nVisible light: the light we can see, shorter wavelength than infrared.\n\nInfrared: longer than visible light, shorter than radio waves.\n\nRadio waves: longest wavelength, lowest energy.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nOption A has infrared before visible light, which is incorrect because visible light has shorter wavelengths than infrared.\n\nOption B starts with radio, which is the opposite of what we need since we're going from shortest to longest.\n\nOption C has visible light before ultraviolet, which is incorrect because ultraviolet has shorter wavelengths than visible light.\n\nOption D is the correct order.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
