                    "text": "Let's see, Big Bertha. I think I've heard that name in different contexts, but I need to figure out which one matches the options given here: a comet, a World War I gun, a pro wrestling champion, or a giant Muppet.\n\nFirst, Big Bertha could be a comet. I don't recall any famous comet named Big Bertha, but maybe there was one. Comets usually have names like Halley's Comet or Hale-Bopp. Maybe I'm wrong about this.\n\nNext, a World War I gun. I think Big Bertha was a type of heavy artillery used in World War I. I remember something about German guns called Big Bertha. Maybe it was a nickname for a specific type of weapon.\n\nThen there's pro wrestling. I know that professional wrestling has had many champions with colorful names, but I don't recall anyone called Big Bertha. Maybe it was a gimmick character or something.\n\nLastly, a giant Muppet. The Muppets have lots of characters, but I don't think there's one named Big Bertha. Maybe it's a reference to someone else.\n\nLet me try to recall more about the World War I gun. I think Big Bertha was a type of siege gun used by the Germans during World War I. It was known for its large size and powerful firepower. It was used to break through fortified positions on the Western Front.\n\nI think that matches option B: a World War I gun.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think about the other options again.\n\nA comet named Big Bertha: I've never heard of a comet with that name. Comets are usually named after the astronomers who discovered them, like Halley, Hale-Bopp, or more recently, NEOWISE.\n\nPro wrestling champion: Professional wrestling has a long history of characters with unique names. However, I don't think Big Bertha was a prominent champion. Maybe there was a wrestler with that name, but it's not ringing any bells for me.\n\nGiant Muppet: The Muppets have characters like Big Bird from Sesame Street, but that's not a Muppet. Actual Muppets include Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, and Gonzo, but none of them are called Big Bertha.\n\nSo, based on my knowledge, I'm going to go with option B: a World War I gun.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
