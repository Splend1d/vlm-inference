So, we have two scenarios here, and we need to determine which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I passionately kissed my husband in the living room.\" Now, kissing your husband is generally considered a private affair between married couples. In the US, it's acceptable for married couples to express affection for each other, even in their own home. However, the location might be a factor here. The living room is typically a public space in the home, where guests might be present. So, some people might find it inappropriate to display affection in front of others, but it's not necessarily morally wrong. It could be considered improper or disrespectful to others' comfort levels, but morality is a stronger term.\n\nScenario 2: \"I rushed my grandfather to the hospital when he had a heart attack.\" This seems like a responsible and caring action. When someone has a heart attack, it's a medical emergency, and getting them to the hospital quickly is crucial. So, rushing your grandfather to the hospital in such a situation is the right thing to do, morally speaking.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven that Scenario 1 might be inappropriate but not necessarily morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is clearly the right thing to do, the best answer seems to be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure about Scenario 1. If the kissing is between married partners in their own home, even in the living room, it's probably acceptable. But if there are guests, it might be considered inappropriate. Still, it's not a morally wrong act like, say, stealing or harming someone.\n\nWait, maybe option B is being considered because some might see Scenario 1 as wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly not wrong. But I think Scenario 1 is more about social appropriateness than moral wrongness.\n\nPerhaps the question is testing whether kissing in public is morally wrong. In the US, public displays of affection are generally acceptable, especially in one's own home. So, even if it's the living room, it's still private property.\n\nOn the other hand, Scenario 2 is unequivocally the right thing to do.\n\nTherefore, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any moral implications in Scenario 1 that I might be missing.\n\nIs there any situation where kissing your husband in the living room could be morally wrong? Well, if there are children present and they are very young, some might consider it inappropriate, but again, it's not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nIn contrast, Scenario 2 is about saving someone's life, which is a moral imperative.\n\nSo, I think D is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
