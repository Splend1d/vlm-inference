                    "text": "Let's dive into this scenario. So, we have a driver who was carefully driving within the speed limit when suddenly an 11-year-old girl darted into the street. Despite the driver's efforts to brake and swerve, the car still hit the girl, causing fractures to her legs. After the accident, the driver approached the girl, expressed apologies, and offered to pay for all her hospital bills. Later, when the girl was released from the hospital, the driver refused to pay anything, blaming the girl for running into the street and even threatening to sue for damages to his car.\n\nNow, if the girl's parents sue the driver in tort, we need to figure out which statements made by the driver after the accident are admissible in court regarding the issue of negligence.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Both the driver's statement about his operation of the car and his statement about paying the hospital bills are admissible on the issue of negligence.\n\nB. Only the statement about paying the hospital bills is admissible, but the statement about his operation of the car is not.\n\nC. Only the statement about his operation of the car is admissible on the issue of negligence, but the statement about paying the hospital bills is not, due to public policy considerations.\n\nD. Neither statement is admissible on the issue of negligence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes a statement admissible in a tort case, especially regarding negligence.\n\nIn tort cases, particularly negligence claims, the focus is on whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and caused harm as a result. Statements made by the defendant after the accident can be relevant to show admissions of fault or negligence.\n\nLet's consider each statement separately.\n\n1. **Statement about operation of the car: \"This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened, but it must have been my fault.\"**\n\nThis statement seems like an admission of fault. In many jurisdictions, statements made by a party regarding their own negligence can be admissible as admissions against interest. These are considered exceptions to the hearsay rule because they are spontaneous and indicate the party's acceptance of responsibility.\n\nHowever, I need to consider whether this statement is actually an admission of negligence. Just saying \"it must have been my fault\" doesn't necessarily specify what the fault was. It could be interpreted as a general expression of regret or responsibility, but not necessarily an admission of negligent behavior.\n\nMoreover, the driver also says, \"This is the first time I ever drove this car. I don't know what happened.\" This might suggest that the driver is unsure about what caused the accident, which could be interpreted as lack of knowledge rather than an admission of negligence.\n\n2. **Statement about paying hospital bills: \"Send me all your hospital bills. I'll pay for everything.\"**\n\nThis statement is an offer to pay for the girl's expenses. In some jurisdictions, offers to pay for damages can be seen as admissions of liability. However, this is a bit tricky because in some places, such offers are considered gestures of goodwill and are not admissible as admissions of guilt.\n\nI recall that in some legal systems, payments or offers to pay medical expenses are not admissible to prove liability, as they are seen as humanitarian gestures. This is often based on public policy considerations that encourage people to help those who are injured without fear that their generosity will be used against them in court.\n\nBut, if the offer is coupled with an admission of fault, it might be admissible. In this case, the driver says, \"It must have been my fault. Send me all your hospital bills. I'll pay for everything.\" So, there is a connection between the admission and the offer to pay.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Both statements are admissible on the issue of negligence.\n\nB. Only the hospital bill statement is admissible; the operation statement is not.\n\nC. Only the operation statement is admissible; the hospital bill statement is not, due to public policy.\n\nD. Neither statement is admissible on the issue of negligence.\n\nGiven what I've thought so far, option A seems plausible because both statements could be seen as admissions related to negligence. However, I need to consider the public policy aspect regarding offers to pay.\n\nOption C suggests that the operation statement is admissible, but the hospital bill statement is not, due to public policy. This aligns with the idea that offers to pay might be excluded to encourage humanitarian assistance.\n\nOption D says neither is admissible, which seems unlikely because the operation statement appears to be an admission against interest.\n\nOption B says only the hospital bill statement is admissible, but the operation statement is not. This seems counterintuitive because the operation statement seems more directly related to negligence.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the statement about the operation of the car is not directly an admission of negligence because he says it's the first time driving the car, but he also says \"it must have been my fault,\" which could be interpreted as an admission.\n\nHowever, in legal terms, for a statement to be admissible as an admission, it needs to clearly indicate an acknowledgment of negligence or fault.\n\nMoreover, the driver later refuted any responsibility, claiming it was the girl's fault, which could complicate the admissibility of his earlier statements.\n\nIn evidence law, prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach the witness's credibility. So, if the driver made contradictory statements, that could affect his testimony, but it's not directly about the admissibility of the statements regarding negligence.\n\nConsidering public policy, many jurisdictions have rules that exclude payments or offers to pay as evidence of liability to encourage people to assist those who are injured without worrying about legal repercussions.\n\nTherefore, the statement about paying the hospital bills might not be admissible as an admission of negligence due to these public policy considerations.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement about his operation of the car, particularly \"it must have been my fault,\" could be admissible as an admission of negligence, assuming it's clear and directly relates to his acceptance of responsibility.\n\nGiven that, option C seems the most accurate: The driver's statement regarding his operation of the car is admissible on the issue of negligence, but his statement concerning payment of the hospital bills is not admissible in accordance with public policy considerations.\n\nHowever, I should double-check this.\n\nLet's consider another perspective. Maybe both statements are admissible. The operation statement is an admission of fault, and the hospital bill statement is a related act consistent with that admission.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps neither statement is admissible. The operation statement might be too vague to constitute a clear admission of negligence, and the hospital bill statement is excluded due to public policy.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the operation statement does suggest some level of acceptance of responsibility.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the driver later withdrew his admission by denying responsibility and blaming the girl. In some jurisdictions, a subsequent repudiation of an admission can render the original statement inadmissible.\n\nHowever, I think that's less common. Typically, admissions are considered reliable evidence, and a party's attempt to retract them doesn't necessarily make the original admissions inadmissible.\n\nIn fact, the retraction might be considered as evidence of the party's attempt to fabricate a defense.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with option C as the most accurate statement regarding the admissibility of the driver's post-accident statements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
