                    "text": "Let's dive into this poem by Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, titled \"To Roosevelt.\" It's from 1904, and it's addressed to Theodore Roosevelt, who was the President of the United States at that time. The poem is a response to the U.S.'s expanding influence in Latin America during the early 20th century, a period often referred to as the era of \"dollar diplomacy\" and \"big stick diplomacy.\"\n\nFirst off, Dar\u00edo is positioning the United States as a potential invader of Latin America, specifically mentioning \"native America that has Indian blood, that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.\" This line highlights the rich cultural heritage of Latin America, blending indigenous, European, and African influences, particularly Spanish and Catholic elements.\n\nDar\u00edo characterizes the United States as \"Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar,\" referencing two powerful conquerors from history. He suggests that the U.S. views life and progress through the lens of force and eruption, believing that whatever they do leads to the future. However, Dar\u00edo contradicts this notion with a firm \"No,\" indicating his disagreement with this perspective.\n\nShifting focus, Dar\u00edo celebrates Latin America's own rich cultural history, mentioning poets from ancient times like Netzahualcoyotl, an Aztec ruler known for his poetry. He references the astronomical knowledge of these civilizations and their connection to mythical places like Atlantis. This emphasizes the depth and antiquity of Latin American culture, which has been thriving long before European colonization.\n\nDar\u00edo describes Latin America as having lived on light, fire, perfume, and love, associating it with figures like Montezuma and the Inca, and even Christopher Columbus, who arrived in the Americas in 1492. By calling it \"Catholic America, Spanish America,\" he underscores the lasting influence of Spanish colonization and the Catholic faith.\n\nA poignant moment in the poem is when Dar\u00edo mentions Cuauht\u00e9moc, the last Aztec emperor, who famously said, \"I'm not in a bed of roses.\" This quote reflects the hardships and struggles that Latin America has endured, yet despite these challenges, the region \"trembles in hurricanes and lives on love.\" This suggests resilience and a vibrant, passionate spirit.\n\nDar\u00edo addresses the readers as \"men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul,\" likely referring to the Anglo-Saxon heritage of the United States, implying a cultural and perhaps moral inferiority in comparison to the refined culture of Latin America.\n\nThe poem concludes with a warning: \"Be careful. Viva Spanish America! There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion.\" This is a metaphor suggesting that Latin America, having been part of the Spanish empire, has produced many strong and independent nations ready to defend themselves.\n\nDar\u00edo then directly addresses Roosevelt, saying that even someone as powerful as him would need divine intervention to subdue Latin America. He implies that while the U.S. may have military and economic power, it lacks something essential: God. This could be interpreted as a statement about moral authority or divine favor.\n\nNow, considering the multiple-choice question: Which statement best reflects the theme of the poem?\n\nA. Latin Americans are too naive and should fight back.\n\nB. Latin America has survived many invaders and will endure.\n\nC. The Spanish have already destroyed Latin American culture.\n\nD. Change is necessary for progress.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. The poem does not portray Latin Americans as naive. In fact, it celebrates their cultural richness and resilience. Dar\u00edo acknowledges their hardships but doesn't suggest they are naive.\n\nB. This seems aligned with the poem's message. Dar\u00edo highlights Latin America's historical depth, cultural heritage, and resilience in the face of adversity. The reference to surviving past invaders like Alexander and Nebuchadnezzar, and the assertion that Latin America will endure, supports this option.\n\nC. While the poem acknowledges the influence of Spanish colonization, it doesn't suggest that the Spanish destroyed Latin American culture. On the contrary, it celebrates the synthesis of indigenous and Spanish elements in Latin American culture.\n\nD. The poem doesn't advocate for change as a necessity for progress. Instead, it seems to valorize Latin America's existing cultural heritage and its ability to endure against external threats.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B. Latin America has survived many invaders and will endure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
