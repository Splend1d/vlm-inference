                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here about theories of morality. It says: \"_______ theory can be described as a code of conduct to which all rational beings should adhere. This contrasts with ________ morality which is the code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society.\" And then there are options A through D.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand the difference between the two types of morality being discussed here. One is a universal code that all rational beings should follow, and the other is specific to particular groups or societies. So, it's like a general vs. specific approach to morality.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Descriptive, Normative\n\nB. Normative, Instrumental\n\nC. Normative, Descriptive\n\nD. Ethical, Descriptive\n\nHmm. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what's the difference between descriptive and normative?\n\nDescriptive morality would be about describing how people actually behave morally. It's observational and factual.\n\nNormative morality, on the other hand, is about how people ought to behave. It prescribes moral standards.\n\nInstrumental morality... I think that refers to morality that is instrumental in achieving certain goals, maybe?\n\nAnd ethical morality is pretty broad, but I think it's similar to normative morality.\n\nSo, the first blank is asking for a theory that prescribes a code of conduct for all rational beings. That sounds normative to me because it's about how people should act, not necessarily how they do act.\n\nThe second blank is about the code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society. That sounds like descriptive morality because it's about what specific groups actually do, their moral practices.\n\nSo, if I put normative in the first blank and descriptive in the second, that would be option C.\n\nWait, but let's check option A: descriptive, normative. That would mean the first blank is descriptive morality, which is about how people actually behave, and the second blank is normative morality, which is about how they should behave. But the question says the first blank is a code that all rational beings should adhere to, which sounds normative, not descriptive.\n\nOption B has normative and instrumental. Instrumental morality I'm not sure about, but it doesn't seem to fit with being specific to particular groups or societies.\n\nOption D has ethical and descriptive. Ethical morality is similar to normative, but descriptive is about actual behaviors.\n\nSo, option C seems to make the most sense: normative theory prescribes a universal code, while descriptive morality describes specific group practices.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nNormative theory: prescribes how all rational beings should act.\n\nDescriptive morality: describes how particular groups actually act.\n\nYes, that matches the question's description.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Normative, Descriptive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
