I remember that the subjunctive is used to express wishes, suggestions, or hypothetical situations, especially with verbs like \"wish\" or in certain clauses.\n\nOption A: \"I am not your man.\" This seems like a straightforward statement in the indicative mood, which is used for facts or truths.\n\nOption B: \"I wish I were your man.\" Here, \"wish\" is a key word that often triggers the subjunctive mood. Also, \"were\" is the subjunctive form of \"to be\" in the past tense. So, this looks like a likely candidate for the subjunctive.\n\nOption C: \"Wherefore art your man?\" This seems a bit old-fashioned or perhaps Shakespearean. \"Wherefore\" means \"why\" or \"for what reason,\" and \"art\" is the second-person singular form of \"to be\" in the present tense. It's not clearly expressing a wish or hypothesis, so probably not subjunctive.\n\nOption D: \"Your man is where?\" This is a question in the indicative mood, asking for information about the location of \"your man.\"\n\nSo, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the one written in the subjunctive mood.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
