Maybe it was developed in the 1970s. I need to check some sources to confirm the exact decade.\n\nLet me think about this. Email, or electronic mail, is a method of exchanging messages from one person to another through electronic devices like computers or smartphones. It's a fundamental part of modern communication.\n\nI know that the internet as we know it today evolved from ARPANET, which was created in the late 1960s by the U.S. Department of Defense. ARPANET was one of the first networks to use packet switching, which is a key technology for sending data over the internet.\n\nGiven that ARPANET was developed in the late 1960s, it's possible that email was developed around the same time or shortly after. Maybe I should look into when ARPANET started facilitating email services.\n\nI recall that Ray Tomlinson is often credited with sending the first email in 1971. If that's the case, then email would have been developed in the 1970s. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact year.\n\nMaybe I should look up when the first email was sent. According to some sources, the first email was sent in 1971 by Ray Tomlinson, who also invented the use of the @ symbol in email addresses. So, that would place the development of email in the 1970s.\n\nBut I've also heard that there were earlier forms of electronic messaging even before ARPANET. For example, in the 1960s, there were mainframe computers that allowed users to leave messages for each other on the same machine. These were more like internal messaging systems rather than emails sent over a network.\n\nSo, perhaps the development of email spans multiple decades. The primitive forms might have originated in the 1960s, but the first networked email system was developed in the 1970s.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the development of protocols for email. For instance, SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) was first defined in 1982, which is in the 1980s. So, if we consider the standardization of email protocols as part of its development, then the 1980s would also be a relevant decade.\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the early development of email. Given that the first networked email was sent in 1971, I think the correct answer is the 1970s.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check some reliable sources to confirm this information.\n\nLet me look it up. According to the Internet Hall of Fame, Ray Tomlinson sent the first email over a network in 1971. He also chose the @ symbol to separate the username from the machine name, which is still used in email addresses today.\n\nBefore Tomlinson's work, there were indeed internal messaging systems on mainframe computers, but these were not designed for communication between different machines or networks.\n\nSo, while the concept of electronic messaging might have started in the 1960s, the development of email as we know it today, with the ability to send messages over a network, began in the 1970s.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 1970s.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption A is the 1960s. While there were early forms of electronic messaging in the 1960s, they weren't what we would consider email today.\n\nOption C is the 1980s. This is when email protocols like SMTP were standardized, but email already existed before that.\n\nOption D is the 1990s. This is way too late, as email was already widely used by then.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the answer should be B. 1970s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
