                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about who said that jurisprudence is the philosophy of positive law. The options are Gray, Holland, Hart, and Austin. I need to recall who among these legal theorists defined jurisprudence in this way.\n\nFirst, let's think about what \"positive law\" means. Positive law refers to human-made laws, as opposed to natural law, which is based on moral or ethical principles. So, jurisprudence being the philosophy of positive law would mean that it's the study of the theoretical aspects of human-made laws.\n\nNow, let's consider each option:\n\nA. Gray - John Chipman Gray was an American legal theorist. I think he was known for his work on the nature of law and legal reasoning. But I'm not sure if he specifically defined jurisprudence as the philosophy of positive law.\n\nB. Holland: I believe this is Thomas Erskine Holland, a British legal scholar. He was influential in the development of analytic jurisprudence. Maybe he defined jurisprudence in terms of positive law.\n\nC. Hart: H.L.A. Hart was a prominent legal philosopher, known for his work \"The Concept of Law.\" He is often associated with legal positivism, which emphasizes the separation of law and morality. It's possible that he defined jurisprudence in this manner.\n\nD. Austin: John Austin was an English legal philosopher who is also associated with legal positivism. He is known for his book \"The Province of Jurisprudence Determined,\" where he tried to define the subject matter of jurisprudence.\n\nLooking back, Austin's work seems particularly relevant here. In \"The Province of Jurisprudence Determined,\" Austin tried to establish what jurisprudence should study. He distinguished between positive law (the laws made by human beings) and other forms of rules or norms.\n\nI think Austin is the one who said that jurisprudence is the philosophy of positive law. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, John Austin is often credited with defining jurisprudence as the general theory of law, which is essentially the philosophy of positive law. He sought to make jurisprudence a science that studies the actual laws of societies, without getting into moral or philosophical questions beyond what the laws are.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. Austin.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options quickly.\n\nGray, John Chipman Gray, was an American legal theorist, and while he contributed to legal theory, I don't recall him defining jurisprudence in this specific way.\n\nHolland, Thomas Erskine Holland, was indeed a influential jurist, and he did write about jurisprudence, but I don't think he is the one who specifically defined it as the philosophy of positive law.\n\nHart, H.L.A. Hart, is more known for his contributions to legal positivism and his critique of Austin's command theory of law, rather than defining jurisprudence in the way described in the question.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is D. Austin.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
