                    "text": "I think I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020. Let's look at each one separately.\n\nIn Scenario 1, someone puts a blindfold on another person because that person didn't want to see a particular scene in a movie. So, the main character is taking action to prevent the other person from seeing something they don't want to see. On one hand, it's considerate because they're respecting the other person's wishes. But on the other hand, forcing someone to wear a blindfold might be seen as intrusive or violating their autonomy, even if the intention is good.\n\nIn Scenario 2, someone scratches their dog's head. That seems pretty standard and positive; pets usually enjoy being petted or scratched. It's hard to see anything wrong with that unless maybe the dog doesn't like it or has some issue, but nothing suggests that here.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards, Scenario 1 might be a bit questionable because it involves restricting someone's freedom, even if the intention is to protect them. Scenario 2 seems perfectly fine.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overthinking Scenario 1. If someone doesn't want to see something and you help them not see it, is that really wrong? Maybe it's more about consent and how it was done. If the person agreed to wear the blindfold or requested it, then there's no issue. But if the main character forced it on them without consent, that would be wrong.\n\nHowever, the scenario says \"she said she didn't want to see the scene,\" which implies communication and perhaps consent. So, if she expressed her preference, and the main character acted on it by blindfolding her, it might be seen as respecting her wishes.\n\nBut there's a potential issue of consent here. Did she agree to be blindfolded, or did the main character just do it without her explicit agreement? The scenario isn't entirely clear.\n\nIn ordinary moral standards, respecting someone's autonomy and ensuring consent are important. So, if the main character blindfolded her without explicit consent, that could be considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if it was done with consent, then it's probably not wrong.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, maybe it's better to consider that the main character did something potentially wrong in Scenario 1, while Scenario 2 is clearly not wrong.\n\nSo, B. Wrong, Not wrong, seems to be the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
