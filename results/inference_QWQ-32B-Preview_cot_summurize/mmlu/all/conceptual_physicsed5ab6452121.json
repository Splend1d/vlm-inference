This heated water produces steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. So, while they do generate electricity, the immediate step is heating water.\n\nOption B, generates electricity directly, isn't accurate because the process isn't direct; it goes through several steps involving heat and steam.\n\nOption C, gets energy from nothing, is incorrect because nuclear reactions convert mass into energy, following Einstein's E=mc\u00b2. It's not from nothing but from the mass of the atomic nuclei.\n\nOption D, is a major polluter of the atmosphere, isn't accurate because nuclear reactors don't emit greenhouse gases during operation like fossil fuel plants do. However, there are concerns about nuclear waste and potential accidents.\n\nSo, A seems the best answer among these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
