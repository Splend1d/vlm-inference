It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict. More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.

                    "text": "Let's see. This passage is from Tacitus's \"Germania,\" written around 98 CE, which is during the Roman Empire period. It talks about some tribes in Germany and how they interacted with each other and, indirectly, with the Romans.\n\nSo, the question is asking which conclusion about imperial treatment of \"barbarian\" peoples is most directly supported by this passage, in the period from 600 BCE to 600 CE.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the passage is saying. It mentions that the Chamavi and Angrivarii drove out and exterminated the Bructeri with the help of neighboring tribes. The reason for this was either hatred of their tyranny, attraction to plunder, or Heaven's regard for the Romans.\n\nTacitus seems pleased about this development because it resulted in the destruction of the Bructeri, and he hopes that the tribes will continue to hate each other. He even says that it's better for the empire if the tribes are at odds with each other rather than uniting against the Romans.\n\nSo, the passage suggests that the Romans might have preferred it when barbarian tribes fought among themselves, as it reduced the threat to the empire.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n\nB. Empies welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples as sources of military manpower or economic productivity.\n\nC. Empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.\n\nD. Empires used religion to convert barbarian peoples so that they might become friendlier to the state.\n\nFrom the passage, option A seems to be the most directly supported. Tacitus expresses pleasure that the tribes are fighting each other and hopes they continue to do so. This suggests that the Romans might have preferred or even encouraged such conflicts to weaken potential enemies.\n\nOption B isn't directly supported because the passage doesn't mention anything about welcoming migrations for military or economic reasons.\n\nOption C is too broad. While the Romans did use military force against some barbarian tribes, the passage specifically highlights a situation where the Romans benefited from tribal conflict without directly engaging in military action.\n\nOption D isn't supported at all; there's no mention of religion in the passage.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion most directly supported by the passage is that empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another to reduce threats to the state.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
