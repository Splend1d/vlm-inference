                    "text": "So Jonathan's IQ score is in the 97th percentile. I need to figure out which of these scores is most likely his. The options are 85, 100, 130, and 150.\n\nFirst, I should remember what a percentile means. Being in the 97th percentile means that Jonathan scored higher than 97% of the population on the IQ test. So, only 3% of the population scores higher than him.\n\nIQ scores are typically distributed normally, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. So, the average IQ is 100, and most people's scores cluster around that.\n\nLet me think about where the 97th percentile would fall on this normal distribution. I recall that in a normal distribution, about 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.\n\nSo, from the mean of 100:\n\n- One standard deviation above is 115 (100 + 15).\n\n- Two standard deviations above is 130 (100 + 30).\n\n- Three standard deviations above is 145 (100 + 45).\n\nWait, but 145 is approximately the 99.7th percentile. So, the 97th percentile should be a bit below that.\n\nI think I can use z-scores to find the exact IQ score corresponding to the 97th percentile. The z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean.\n\nI can look up the z-score for the 97th percentile in a standard normal distribution table. Let's see, the 97th percentile corresponds to a z-score of about 1.88.\n\nSo, the formula to find the IQ score (X) is:\n\nX = mean + (z-score * standard deviation)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nX = 100 + (1.88 * 15)\n\nFirst, calculate 1.88 times 15:\n\n1.88 * 15 = 28.2\n\nThen add that to the mean:\n\n100 + 28.2 = 128.2\n\nSo, the IQ score at the 97th percentile is approximately 128.2.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 85 - That's below the mean, around the 16th percentile.\n\nB. 100 - That's the mean, 50th percentile.\n\nC. 130 - That's about two standard deviations above the mean, around the 97.7th percentile.\n\nD. 150 - That's three standard deviations above the mean, around the 99.9th percentile.\n\nHmm, 130 is closest to the 97th percentile. Actually, since the 97th percentile is around 128.2, 130 is a bit higher, but it's the closest option.\n\nOption D, 150, is way higher, corresponding to almost the 99.9th percentile.\n\nSo, the most likely score for Jonathan is 130.\n\nWait, but 130 is slightly above the 97th percentile. Maybe there's a better way to confirm.\n\nLet me check the percentile for an IQ of 130.\n\nTwo standard deviations above the mean is 130, which is approximately the 97.7th percentile.\n\nThat's very close to the 97th percentile.\n\nOption C is 130, which aligns well with the 97th percentile.\n\nOption D, 150, is much higher and would be in the 99.9th percentile, which is too high.\n\nTherefore, the most likely score for Jonathan is 130.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n**View Solution**\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
