                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a statute that makes it a misdemeanor for any vehicle to travel to the left of the center line on a two-way highway. That means you're not supposed to drive into the oncoming lane unless it's allowed, like passing another car.\n\nThe businesswoman was driving north and decided to pass the car in front of her. She swung across the center line into the southbound lane and collided with a fire engine. Because of this accident, the fire engine was delayed and couldn't save a house that was on fire, which was about a mile away from the accident scene.\n\nNow, the owner of the house is asserting a claim against the businesswoman. We need to figure out what will most likely happen in this situation.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Recover the fair market value of his house before the fire.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward damages claim. If the businesswoman's actions led to the house burning down, maybe the owner can get compensated for the value of the house.\n\nB. Recover that part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman had not hit the fire truck.\n\nThis option is a bit more specific. It's saying that the owner can recover the damages that were directly caused by the businesswoman's action of hitting the fire truck.\n\nC. Recover nothing, because the businesswoman was not responsible for causing the fire.\n\nThis option suggests that since the businesswoman didn't start the fire, she shouldn't be liable for the damages caused by the fire.\n\nD. Recover nothing, because the traffic statute was not designed to protect against the type of harm that the owner suffered.\n\nThis option is talking about the purpose of the traffic statute. If the statute wasn't meant to protect against this kind of harm, then maybe the businesswoman isn't liable.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, was the businesswoman's action a violation of the statute? She crossed the center line to pass another vehicle and collided with a fire engine. Passing another vehicle might be allowed under certain conditions, but if she crossed the center line into the oncoming lane and caused an accident, it's possible she violated the statute.\n\nNow, did her action cause the fire engine to be delayed? Yes, because of the collision, the fire engine couldn't reach the owner's house in time, and the house burned down.\n\nSo, is there a causal link between the businesswoman's action and the owner's loss? It seems like there is, because if she hadn't hit the fire engine, the fire engine could have arrived in time to put out the fire.\n\nOption C says that the businesswoman wasn't responsible for causing the fire, so she shouldn't be liable. But in law, especially in tort law, you can be liable for consequences that were foreseeable, even if you didn't directly cause the harm.\n\nIn this case, the businesswoman's reckless driving led to a collision with the fire engine, which in turn led to the house burning down. If it's foreseeable that delaying the fire engine could result in property damage, then she might be liable for that damage.\n\nOption D talks about the purpose of the traffic statute. Sometimes, in law, you have to consider whether a statute was intended to protect against a particular type of harm. This is relevant in statutory interpretation and in determining liability based on statutory violations.\n\nIf the statute was meant to prevent collisions between vehicles going in opposite directions, and not to protect against delays in emergency services, then maybe the businesswoman wouldn't be liable for the owner's loss.\n\nBut in this case, the collision did result in a delay to the fire engine, which directly led to the house burning down. So, perhaps the statute was intended to prevent such consequences, even if not explicitly stated.\n\nOption A is asking for the fair market value of the house before the fire. That's a common measure of damages in property claims. If the owner can prove that the house was lost due to the businesswoman's actions, then this could be the amount he recovers.\n\nOption B is a bit more nuanced. It's saying that the owner can recover the part of his loss that would have been prevented if the businesswoman hadn't hit the fire truck. In other words, the owner can only recover the damages that were directly caused by the businesswoman's action.\n\nIn this case, since the house would have been saved if the fire engine had arrived on time, the owner can recover the entire loss attributable to the house burning down.\n\nComparing options A and B, they seem similar, but option B is more precise in that it links the recovery to the specific harm caused by the businesswoman's action.\n\nOption C argues that since the businesswoman didn't cause the fire, she shouldn't be liable. But in law, you can be liable for foreseeable consequences of your actions, even if you didn't directly cause the harm.\n\nFor example, if someone shoots at a target and misses, and the bullet hits a power line, causing a power outage that leads to a factory burning down, the shooter could be liable for the factory's damages because it was a foreseeable consequence of his action.\n\nSimilarly, here, the businesswoman's action of hitting the fire engine, which delayed the fire engine and led to the house burning down, could be considered a foreseeable consequence.\n\nOption D is about the purpose of the statute. If the statute was not intended to protect against this type of harm, then perhaps the businesswoman wouldn't be liable.\n\nHowever, statutes are often interpreted broadly to prevent harm in various forms. The purpose of the statute is likely to prevent collisions and ensure safe driving, which includes preventing delays to emergency vehicles.\n\nMoreover, in tort law, particularly negligence, you can be liable for foreseeable damages, regardless of the specific purpose of a statute.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely outcome is that the owner can recover the part of his loss that was caused by the businesswoman's action, which is option B.\n\nOption A is too broad because it doesn't specify that the recovery is limited to the harm caused by the businesswoman's action.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, as discussed, you can be liable for foreseeable consequences, even if you didn't directly cause the harm.\n\nOption D might have some merit, but given that the statute is about preventing collisions, which in this case led to the delay and the subsequent fire, it's likely that the court would find that the businesswoman is liable.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to be the most accurate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
