                    "text": "So here's this scenario about a stamp collector and his cousin. The collector has this valuable collection with rare stamps, and he's been turning down offers to sell it. But finally, on December 1, he decides to sell it to his cousin for $75,000. The thing is, there's a mix-up because his secretary typed $75,000 instead of the $78,000 he intended, and he signed it without noticing.\n\nThen, his cousin receives the letter on December 3 and sends back an acceptance on December 5. Now, the question is about the agreement's price term and its legal effect. We have four options:\n\nA. The price is $75,000 and it's enforceable.\n\nB. The price is $78,000 and it's enforceable.\n\nC. The price is $75,000, but the court will change it to $78,000 to correct a mistake.\n\nD. The price is $75,000, but either party can cancel the contract because there was a mutual mistake about a basic fact.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what happened here is that the collector intended to offer his collection for $78,000, but due to his secretary's mistake, the letter offered it for $75,000, and he signed it without catching the error.\n\nNow, the cousin received the letter and accepted the offer as stated, which was $75,000.\n\nIn contract law, for a contract to be formed, there needs to be an offer and an acceptance. Here, the letter is the offer, and the cousin's letter back is the acceptance.\n\nBut there's a mistake here. The collector thought he was offering $78,000, but the offer actually said $75,000, and the cousin accepted based on that.\n\nSo, is there a mutual mistake? Well, mutual mistake is when both parties are mistaken about a material fact, and if that fact wasn't as they thought, they wouldn't have entered into the contract.\n\nIn this case, the collector was mistaken about the price he was offering because of the secretary's typo, and the cousin accepted based on the price stated in the letter, which was $75,000.\n\nBut was the cousin also mistaken? Not necessarily. The cousin received the letter saying $75,000 and accepted that price. So, the cousin's understanding was $75,000.\n\nThe collector, however, thought he was offering $78,000.\n\nSo, there's a mismatch between what the collector intended and what was actually offered.\n\nIn contract law, the rule is that the terms of the contract are what was communicated, not what was intended but not communicated.\n\nSo, the offer was $75,000, and the acceptance was for that amount.\n\nTherefore, the contract is for $75,000.\n\nBut the collector was mistaken about the price he was offering due to the secretary's error.\n\nNow, regarding mistakes in contract formation, there are different types:\n\n1. Mistake as to a fact: Both parties mistaken about something fundamental.\n\n2. Unilateral mistake: Only one party is mistaken.\n\nIn this case, it seems like a unilateral mistake by the collector because only he was mistaken about the price he was offering. The cousin accepted based on the stated price.\n\nHowever, sometimes, if a unilateral mistake is so fundamental and the other party knew or had reason to know of the mistake, the contract might be voidable by the mistaken party.\n\nBut in this scenario, there's no indication that the cousin knew about the secretary's typo or the collector's intention to offer $78,000.\n\nSo, it seems like the cousin reasonably relied on the price stated in the letter, which was $75,000.\n\nTherefore, the contract is for $75,000, and it's enforceable.\n\nOption A seems correct: the price term is $75,000, and it's enforceable.\n\nBut let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B says $78,000 and enforceable. That was the collector's intention, but what was communicated was $75,000, and that's what the cousin accepted. So, this seems incorrect.\n\nOption C mentions reformation by the court to correct a mistake in integration. Integration refers to the final written contract. Here, the mistake was in drafting the offer, not in integrating the terms into the contract. So, perhaps this doesn't apply.\n\nOption D says the price is $75,000, but either party can rescind due to mutual mistake. But was there a mutual mistake? The collector was mistaken about the price he was offering, but the cousin accepted based on the stated price. So, maybe it's not mutual.\n\nWait, maybe it's a unilateral mistake by the collector, and the cousin didn't share that mistake. So, perhaps only the collector could argue for rescission, but the cousin couldn't.\n\nBut in contract law, unilateral mistakes generally don't allow for rescission unless the other party knew or had reason to know of the mistake.\n\nHere, there's no indication that the cousin knew about the secretary's typo or the collector's intended price of $78,000.\n\nTherefore, the contract stands as written, which is $75,000, and it's enforceable.\n\nSo, option A seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about reformation. Reformation is a legal remedy where the court corrects the written contract to reflect the true agreement between the parties.\n\nIn this case, there was a mistake in drafting the offer due to the secretary's typo.\n\nIf both parties agreed that there was a mistake and what was intended was $78,000, then perhaps the court could reform the contract to reflect that.\n\nBut in this scenario, the cousin accepted based on the stated price of $75,000, and there's no indication that the cousin was aware of the typo or the collector's intended price.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the court would reform the contract unless both parties agreed to it.\n\nSo, option C might not be correct.\n\nOption D suggests that either party can rescind due to mutual mistake. But again, was there a mutual mistake? The collector was mistaken about the price he was offering, but the cousin accepted based on the stated price.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not mutual; it's unilateral, and since the cousin didn't know about the mistake, rescission might not be allowed.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward answer is option A: the price term is $75,000, and it is enforceable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
