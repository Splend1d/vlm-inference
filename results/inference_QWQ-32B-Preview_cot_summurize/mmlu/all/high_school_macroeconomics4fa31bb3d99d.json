I need to figure out what open market operation they should perform, how it affects the money supply and aggregate demand, and what it's fighting against.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how open market operations affect the money supply. When the central bank buys bonds, it injects money into the economy, which increases the money supply. Conversely, when it sells bonds, it takes money out of the economy, decreasing the money supply.\n\nNow, the federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend their excess reserves to other banks overnight. If the central bank wants to increase this rate, it needs to make reserves scarcer. So, to increase the federal funds rate, the central bank should decrease the money supply. That means they should sell bonds.\n\nSo, open market operation: sell bonds.\n\nNext, selling bonds decreases the money supply.\n\nA decrease in the money supply should lead to an increase in interest rates, which in turn should decrease aggregate demand because borrowing becomes more expensive.\n\nWait, but in this question, it says that decreasing the money supply decreases aggregate demand. That makes sense because higher interest rates discourage borrowing and spending.\n\nFinally, by decreasing aggregate demand, the central bank is trying to control inflation. If the economy is overheating and inflation is too high, decreasing aggregate demand can help bring prices under control.\n\nBut the question mentions moving the economy closer to full employment. Doesn't full employment imply that the economy is at its potential output? So, if the economy is already at full employment, and the central bank is trying to prevent inflation, then fighting inflation makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the economy is below full employment, and the central bank wants to stimulate it to reach full employment, they would typically decrease the federal funds rate, not increase it.\n\nWait, but the question says the central bank decides that the federal funds rate must be increased to move the economy closer to full employment. That seems counterintuitive.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the economy is above full employment, and there's too much demand, leading to inflation. In that case, increasing the federal funds rate would help cool down the economy and bring it back to full employment by reducing aggregate demand.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, if the economy is above full employment, with inflationary pressures, increasing the federal funds rate would decrease aggregate demand and help bring the economy back to full employment levels, fighting inflation.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate open market operation is to sell bonds, which decreases the money supply, decreases aggregate demand, and fights inflation.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Buy bonds Increases Increases Unemployment\n\nB. Buy bonds Increases Increases Inflation\n\nC. Sell bonds Decreases Decreases Unemployment\n\nD. Sell bonds Decreases Decreases Inflation\n\nOption D matches what I've concluded.\n\nBut just to double-check, if the central bank wants to increase the federal funds rate, it sells bonds, decreasing the money supply, which increases interest rates, decreases aggregate demand, and fights inflation.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
