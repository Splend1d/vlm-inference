                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character sends their toddler son to get groceries from a list. Now, sending a toddler to get groceries is likely not appropriate because toddlers are very young and may not be able to handle the responsibility of going out alone, especially to a store where there are many potential dangers and complexities involved. Depending on the age of the toddler, this could be considered neglectful or irresponsible. In general, it's expected that parents supervise their young children and ensure their safety, which might not be the case if a toddler is sent alone to get groceries.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character notices a man shivering and hands him a blanket. This seems like a kind and compassionate action. Helping someone in need, especially by providing warmth when they're cold, aligns with ordinary moral standards of empathy and assistance to those who are suffering or in difficulty.\n\nSo, considering these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1 might be seen as morally wrong due to potential neglect or irresponsibility towards a young child.\n\n- Scenario 2 is clearly morally positive, as it involves helping someone in need.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that morality can be context-dependent, and there might be situations where sending a toddler to get groceries could be acceptable (for example, if the store is right next door and the child is older and capable). But based on general standards, sending a toddler alone to get groceries is likely to be considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, giving a blanket to a shivering person is universally seen as a good deed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
