Interstate highways that link cities\n\nC. Beltways around cities\n\nD. Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD\n\nI think I need to understand how each of these transportation systems affects city planning and growth.\n\nOption A, highways to airports linking cities, sounds like it would primarily affect areas around airports and possibly suburban regions, but I'm not sure if that would create a star-shaped pattern for the entire city.\n\nOption B, interstate highways that link cities, seems more likely because interstate highways often have multiple entry and exit points, which could influence the development of different parts of the city in a way that forms a star shape.\n\nOption C, beltways around cities, are typically ring roads that encircle the city, which might help in distributing traffic but I don't see how that would create a star-shaped pattern.\n\nOption D, streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD, that sounds familiar. I recall that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, streetcars and trolleys were common modes of transportation, and they often extended from the central business district outward along radial routes.\n\nCould it be that the development of these streetcar and trolley lines led to the growth of neighborhoods along those routes, thereby creating a star-shaped pattern as the city expanded in multiple directions from the center?\n\nLet me think about this some more. In many older cities, you can see how streets radiate out from the downtown area, and these were often built along the routes of streetcar lines. So, it makes sense that the transportation system would influence the city's shape.\n\nOn the other hand, interstate highways also often have multiple spurs leading out from the city center, which could also create a star-shaped pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the streetcar and trolley lines had a more significant impact on the development of the city's layout because they were in place before the widespread use of automobiles and highways.\n\nAlso, the term \"star-shaped city pattern\" makes me think of a city that has developed in a radial fashion, with arms extending out from a central point, similar to the points of a star.\n\nI recall that in some cities, like Washington, D.C., the street layout is based on a grid system combined with diagonal avenues, which can create a star-like pattern.\n\nWait, but Washington, D.C. was planned before streetcars were invented, so maybe that's not the best example.\n\nLet me consider another angle. The star-shaped pattern might refer to the way transportation lines extend out from the center, and development follows those lines.\n\nIn that case, both streetcar lines and interstate highways could contribute to such a pattern, but perhaps streetcar lines had a more direct influence on the city's shape because they were more integrated into the urban fabric.\n\nAlso, consider that streetcars allowed for denser development along their routes, as people could live farther from the city center and still commute easily into work.\n\nThis led to the development of streetcar suburbs, which expanded the city in a radial pattern.\n\nIn contrast, interstate highways might have contributed to more sprawling suburban development, but not necessarily in a star-shaped pattern.\n\nPerhaps the star-shaped pattern is more characteristic of cities that developed around streetcar lines.\n\nLet me see if I can find any examples to support this.\n\nFor instance, cities like Boston and Chicago have developed in a radial pattern based on their streetcar lines.\n\nIn Chicago, the \"L\" trains extend out from the Loop, the CBD, and the city has grown along these lines.\n\nSimilarly, in Boston, the MBTA lines have shaped the city's development.\n\nSo, it seems plausible that streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD created a star-shaped city pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, interstate highways often cut through cities, sometimes dividing them, but their impact on the city's shape might be different.\n\nBeltways, as ring roads, would encircle the city and might influence development on the outskirts, but again, not necessarily create a star-shaped pattern.\n\nHighways to airports would likely affect areas near the airports and along the highway corridors, but probably not the overall star-shaped pattern of the city.\n\nTherefore, I think the most appropriate answer is D. Streetcar and trolley lines extending from the CBD.\n\nThey played a crucial role in shaping the urban form by allowing expansion along their routes, leading to a radial, star-shaped pattern of development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
