Assuming that the main character is providing accurate information and the hedge fund is legitimate, there's nothing morally wrong with this action. It's a common way to invest money.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character stops walking to wait for their partner who stopped to stroke a cat. This seems like a considerate and patient action, not morally wrong at all.\n\nSo, neither scenario involves morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
