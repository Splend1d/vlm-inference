This seems like a reasonable expectation for a parent to have. Assigning chores to children is a common practice to teach responsibility and the value of hard work. It's generally considered acceptable for parents to set rules and expectations for their children's behavior, including balancing work and play. So, in this case, it doesn't appear that the main character is doing something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character makes their stepdad's Kool-Aid with half the sugar because he is diabetic. This seems like a considerate and responsible action. Adjusting the sugar content to accommodate their stepdad's health condition shows thoughtfulness and care. It's important to consider the health needs of family members, and making adjustments to food and drinks accordingly is a positive behavior. Therefore, this action also doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nBased on this analysis, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. So, the correct answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
