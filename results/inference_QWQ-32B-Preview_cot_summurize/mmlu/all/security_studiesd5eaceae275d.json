                    "text": "I think the answer is D. All of these options. Let me explain why each one is important.\n\nFirst, option A says that environmental constraints can limit economic growth, threatening economic security and development. This makes sense because a healthy environment is often necessary for economic activities. For example, if there's severe deforestation, it can affect agriculture and tourism, which are big economic sectors in many countries. So, if the environment degrades, it can indeed hurt the economy, leading to social unrest and possibly conflict.\n\nOption B talks about environmental changes like rising sea levels threatening settlements and resource access, and how migration resulting from these changes can pose security threats. This is also very relevant. We've seen in places like Bangladesh and small island nations where rising sea levels are making land uninhabitable. People have to migrate, which can lead to strain on resources in the areas they move to, potentially causing tensions and conflicts with local populations.\n\nOption C mentions that environmental degradation and increased demand for resources can lead to scarcity and conflict. This is often referred to as \"resource scarcity leading to conflict.\" For example, disputes over water resources in the Middle East or in the Horn of Africa have sometimes turned violent. So, when essential resources become scarce due to environmental degradation, it can certainly increase the likelihood of conflict.\n\nSince all three options highlight different ways environmental issues can impact peace and security in the 21st century, I believe the correct answer is D. All of these options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
