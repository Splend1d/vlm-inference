The options are:\n\nA. impersonal and categorical.\n\nB. merely a matter of the mother's preferences.\n\nC. a complex matter of the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Little argues regarding abortion. I think Little is referring to Jeannie Erdberg Little, a philosopher who has written about moral issues, including abortion. From what I remember, she approaches the topic from a feminist ethical perspective, emphasizing the importance of the woman's autonomy and personal integrity.\n\nOption A says \"impersonal and categorical.\" Impersonal norms are those that don't take into account the particular characteristics or relationships of the individuals involved. Categorical norms are absolute rules that apply in all situations, regardless of consequences. If Little is arguing for a feminist ethic that considers the specific context and relationships, then this might not align with her view.\n\nOption B says \"merely a matter of the mother's preferences.\" This sounds like a relativistic view where the morality of abortion is solely based on the mother's personal choices without any deeper ethical considerations. While Little might value the mother's autonomy, saying it's \"merely\" a matter of preferences might be too simplistic and doesn't capture the complexity of her argument.\n\nOption C states that the norms are \"a complex matter of the mother's personal integrity and her ideals about motherhood and creation.\" This seems more in line with a feminist ethical approach that considers the woman's whole personhood, her values, and her life plans. It suggests that the decision to have an abortion isn't just about personal preference but is deeply connected to her sense of self and her vision for her future.\n\nOption D is \"none of the above,\" which would mean that Little's view doesn't fit any of the descriptions provided.\n\nGiven that Little likely advocates for a view that respects the woman's autonomy while considering the moral complexities involved, option C seems the most appropriate. It acknowledges that the decision is not just a casual preference but is rooted in profound personal and ethical considerations.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider whether Little might hold a different view. Perhaps she aligns with a more impersonal, categorical approach, or maybe she thinks that none of these options accurately represent her position.\n\nUpon reflection, I recall that feminist ethics often emphasize the importance of context, relationships, and the autonomy of the individual. Therefore, it's unlikely that Little would support an impersonal and categorical norm regarding abortion. Similarly, reducing the decision to merely personal preferences overlooks the ethical weight of the decision.\n\nThus, option C appears to be the best fit for Little's argument, as it recognizes the complexity of the decision and its connection to the mother's personal integrity and ideals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
