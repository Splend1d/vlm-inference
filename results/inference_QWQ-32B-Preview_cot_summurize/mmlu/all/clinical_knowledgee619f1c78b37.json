                    "text": "Let's see what a keloid is. I remember that it's a type of scar, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics. Let me think through each option to see which one fits best.\n\nOption A says it's evidence of infection. I don't think that's correct. Infections can lead to various types of scars, but a keloid isn't specifically an indication of infection. So, maybe I can rule that one out.\n\nOption B says it's a firm mass of scar tissue. That sounds familiar. I think keloids are raised scars that are firmer than normal scars. They can be bigger than the original wound, right? So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C mentions a fine, hairline scar. I think that describes a different type of scar, maybe one that's flat and not very noticeable. Keloids, on the other hand, are more prominent and raised. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption D says it's formed if a wound drain is removed too soon. I'm not sure about that. Wound drains are used to remove fluid from the wound site to prevent infection and promote healing. If removed too soon, it might lead to some complications, but I don't think keloids are directly related to that. So, perhaps this isn't the correct answer.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I think option B is the best choice. A keloid is a firm mass of scar tissue. It's important to note that keloids can occur when the body overproduces collagen during the healing process, leading to raised, sometimes painful scars that extend beyond the original wound site.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that keloids are more common in certain individuals and can be influenced by genetic factors. They can occur after surgery, acne, or even minor injuries like piercings. Treatment for keloids can be challenging and may include corticosteroid injections, silicone gel sheets, or sometimes surgery, although surgery can sometimes lead to larger keloids forming.\n\nSo, in summary, a keloid is indeed a firm mass of scar tissue, making option B the correct answer."
