                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's an obese woman who signed up for a weight loss program that promised to get her down to her medically recommended weight range. The promotional material claimed that they had patented methods and nutritional supplements that were a \"miraculous discovery\" and that it would work for anyone within 24 months. She paid $1,000 per month for two years, totaling $24,000, but only lost 6 pounds and still remained excessively obese. A former employee told her that there was no patent, no miraculous discovery, and that the supplements were just like a common vitamin brand. Now, she's suing the program for misrepresentation. The question is asking whether she is likely to prevail, and gives four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what misrepresentation means in legal terms. Misrepresentation is when one party makes a false statement of fact to another party, and the other party relies on that statement to their detriment. For misrepresentation to be actionable, the false statement must be material, meaning it induced the other party to enter into the contract or make a decision based on it.\n\nOption A says: \"No, because statements that are mere 'puffing' or opinions cannot be the basis for misrepresentation.\" Puffing refers to exaggerated claims or opinions that no reasonable person would take literally. For example, saying something is \"the best ever\" is likely puffing because people understand it's just hyperbole. However, in this case, the promotional material claims patented methods and miraculous discoveries, which sound more like factual assertions rather than just puffing. So, I'm not sure if this is the right answer.\n\nOption B says: \"Yes, because the program had a fiduciary duty to make full disclosure to her of all of the facts.\" A fiduciary duty is a high standard of care where one party owes a duty of loyalty and good faith to another. Typically, fiduciary relationships exist in scenarios like attorney-client or trustee-beneficiary relationships. It's less common in commercial transactions unless there's a special relationship. Here, it's a weight loss program and a customer, which doesn't necessarily imply a fiduciary relationship. So, this might not be the correct option.\n\nOption C says: \"No, because she did not justifiably rely on the incredible representations that were made.\" This suggests that the representations were so unbelievable that a reasonable person wouldn't rely on them. However, the woman did sign up and paid a significant amount of money, indicating that she did rely on these representations. Additionally, the fact that the representations were false and she suffered a loss suggests that her reliance was justified. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: \"Yes, because the program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on.\" This aligns closely with the definition of misrepresentation. If the program knowingly made false statements about having patented methods and miraculous discoveries, and the customer relied on these statements to pay a substantial sum, then the customer may have a claim for misrepresentation.\n\nLooking back, the former employee confirmed that there was no patent, no miraculous discovery, and that the supplements were just common vitamins. This suggests that the program knew or should have known that their representations were false.\n\nMoreover, the customer paid a lot of money based on these representations and didn't achieve the promised results. This indicates that she relied on the false statements to her detriment.\n\nTherefore, it seems that option D is the most appropriate answer. The program knowingly made false factual representations that the customer relied on, which is the essence of misrepresentation.\n\nTo further solidify this, let's consider if there are any defenses that the program might raise. One possible defense is that the customer should have known better or conducted due diligence before entering into the contract. However, in many jurisdictions, if the seller knows that the buyer is relying on their representations, they have a duty to ensure those representations are true.\n\nAnother defense could be that the representations were mere puffing, but as discussed earlier, claims of patented methods and miraculous discoveries seem like specific factual assertions rather than general exaggerations.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer is likely to prevail in her misrepresentation claim because the program knowingly made false factual representations that she relied on when deciding to enroll and pay for the program.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
