Monism posits that international law is superior to domestic laws\n\nB. Monism posits that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order\n\nC. Monism posits that domestic laws are superior to international law\n\nD. Monism posits that domestic and international law never clash\n\nFirst, I need to recall what monism is in the context of legal theory. I remember that monism is a theory that\u4e3b\u5f20\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u548c\u56fd\u5185\u6cd5\u5c5e\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u56fd\u9645\u6cd5\u548c\u56fd\u5185\u6cd5\u662f\u76f8\u4e92\u8054\u7cfb\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5206\u5f00\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\n\nOption A says that monism posits international law is superior to domestic laws. While in some monist systems, international law might take precedence, I don't think that's the core premise of monism. It's more about the integration of the two legal systems rather than the hierarchy.\n\nOption B states that monism posits international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. This sounds like the core idea I recall. Monism argues that there's one unified legal system, and international law is incorporated directly into the domestic legal system without the need for special\u8f6c\u5316 mechanisms.\n\nOption C suggests that domestic laws are superior to international law. That seems more like a dualist position, where domestic law takes precedence, and international law needs to be incorporated through domestic legislation. So, this doesn't align with monism.\n\nOption D says that domestic and international law never clash. That seems too absolute. In reality, there are cases where domestic and international laws may conflict, and how to resolve such conflicts is a separate issue from whether the two legal systems are part of the same order.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the fundamental premise of monist theory is that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order. So, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider if there's any nuance I might be missing. For example, in some monist systems, international law might automatically become part of domestic law upon ratification of a treaty, without the need for enabling legislation. This is different from dualist systems, where international law needs to be specifically incorporated into domestic law through legislation.\n\nAlso, I recall that monism is often associated with civil law countries, while dualism is more common in common law countries. But that's more about legal traditions rather than the core premise of monism.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the fundamental premise of monist theory is that international and domestic law are part of the same legal order, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
