These two parameters are essential for monitoring a child's growth and development over time. By tracking both weight and height, healthcare providers can identify any deviations from normal growth patterns and intervene if necessary. Additionally, using both measurements allows for the calculation of body mass index (BMI), which is an important indicator of overall health and can help identify issues such as undernutrition or obesity. While head circumference is also an important measurement, particularly in infants and young children, it is not typically included in routine growth assessments for older children and adults. Therefore, option C seems to be the most comprehensive and appropriate choice for assessing growth in routine practice."
