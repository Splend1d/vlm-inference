This occurs either because the body doesn't produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes), or because cells don't respond to the insulin that is produced (Type 2 diabetes), leading to an inability to properly metabolize glucose.\n\n- **Influenza** is a respiratory illness caused by viruses, not related to glucose metabolism.\n\n- **Septicemia** is a life-threatening condition arising from the body's response to an infection elsewhere in the body, not directly related to glucose metabolism.\n\n- **Arthritis** is a disease that affects the joints, causing pain and inflammation, and is not related to glucose metabolism.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Diabetes."
