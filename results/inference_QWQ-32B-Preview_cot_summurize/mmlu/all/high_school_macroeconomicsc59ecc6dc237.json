                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Theo loses his job at the public swimming pool when the pool closes for the winter. This is an example of...\" and then there are options A through D: cyclical unemployment, discouraged worker, seasonal unemployment, and frictional unemployment.\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each type of unemployment means.\n\nCyclical unemployment is related to the business cycle. It happens when there's a downturn in the economy, and companies lay off workers because there's less demand for their products or services. So, it's not specifically about a particular time of year or a personal choice.\n\nA discouraged worker is someone who has given up looking for work because they believe there are no jobs available for them. They're not currently looking for work, so they might not even be counted as unemployed in official statistics.\n\nSeasonal unemployment happens when certain jobs are only available at specific times of the year. For example, ski instructors might be unemployed in the summer because there's no snow, or beach lifeguards might be unemployed in the winter because the beach is closed.\n\nFrictional unemployment is when people are in between jobs, maybe looking for a better one or just entering the workforce. It's the time period when someone is searching for a new job or transitioning between jobs.\n\nNow, in this scenario, Theo loses his job at the public swimming pool when the pool closes for the winter. So, it sounds like his employment is tied to the season when the pool is open.\n\nPublic swimming pools typically operate during the warmer months when people are more likely to swim outdoors. In the winter, especially in areas with cold climates, the pool might close due to weather conditions or lower demand.\n\nSo, Theo's unemployment is directly related to the seasonal closure of the pool. This sounds a lot like seasonal unemployment.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nCyclical unemployment is about economic downturns, but here it's specifically about the pool closing for winter, which is a seasonal event, not related to the overall economy's performance.\n\nDiscouraged worker refers to someone who has given up looking for work, but in this case, Theo has lost his job due to the pool closing, but there's no mention that he's given up looking for work. Maybe he's looking for another job during the winter.\n\nFrictional unemployment is about people moving between jobs, but again, in this case, it's specifically because the pool is closed for the season.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer seems to be seasonal unemployment.\n\nI think the answer is C. Seasonal unemployment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
