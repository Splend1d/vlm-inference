                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Westview School buying basketball uniforms. Each uniform costs $46, and they're buying 12 of them. I need to find out which equation correctly shows how to calculate the total cost. There are four options, and I have to choose the right one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the total cost would be. If each uniform is $46 and they're buying 12, I guess I could just multiply 46 by 12. But the question is asking for an equation that breaks it down somehow, probably using some kind of distributive property or something like that.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. (40 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 2) = 400 + 12\n\nB. (40 \u00d7 6) + (10 \u00d7 2) = 240 + 20\n\nC. (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72\n\nD. (40 \u00d7 12) + (60 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 720\n\nHmm, okay. It seems like they're breaking down the number 46 into 40 and 6, which makes sense because 46 is 40 plus 6. And they're multiplying these by parts of 12.\n\nLet me think about the distributive property. I remember that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, for 46 times 12, that would be (40 + 6) \u00d7 12 = 40\u00d712 + 6\u00d712. That looks like option C.\n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A has (40 \u00d7 10) + (6 \u00d7 2). That would be 400 + 12, which equals 412. But 46 times 12 should be more than that. Let me do the math: 46 \u00d7 12. Okay, 46 \u00d7 10 is 460, plus 46 \u00d7 2 is 92, so total is 552. So 412 is too low. Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B has (40 \u00d7 6) + (10 \u00d7 2) = 240 + 20 = 260. Again, 260 is way less than 552. So option B is not correct.\n\nOption C has (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72 = 552. That matches the total I calculated earlier. So option C seems correct.\n\nOption D has (40 \u00d7 12) + (60 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 720 = 1200. That's way higher than 552. So option D is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation is option C: (40 \u00d7 12) + (6 \u00d7 12) = 480 + 72.\n\nI think that makes sense. They broke down 46 into 40 and 6, then multiplied each by 12 and added the results together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
