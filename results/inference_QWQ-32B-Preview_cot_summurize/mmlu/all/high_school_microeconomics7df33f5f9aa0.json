The scenario is that the price of good A increases, and as a result, the quantity demanded of good B increases. I need to determine what kind of goods these are: substitutes, complements, inferior, or normal goods.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the definitions of these terms. Let's start with substitute goods. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. So, if the price of one goes up, people might switch to the other. For example, if the price of coffee increases, people might buy more tea instead. So, in this case, tea and coffee are substitutes.\n\nNext, complement goods are those that are used together. If the price of one goes up, the demand for the other goes down. For example, if the price of cars increases, people might buy fewer cars, and therefore, fewer car tires as well. So, cars and tires are complements.\n\nInferior goods are those for which demand decreases as income increases. For example, generic brands might be considered inferior to name brands, so as people earn more, they might switch to name brands.\n\nNormal goods are the opposite of inferior goods; demand increases as income increases.\n\nNow, in this question, when the price of good A increases, the quantity demanded of good B increases. This seems like a positive relationship between the price of A and the quantity demanded of B.\n\nLooking back at the definitions, substitute goods fit this description because if A gets more expensive, people might buy more of B instead.\n\nOn the other hand, complement goods would show a negative relationship: if A gets more expensive, people buy less of A, and therefore less of B.\n\nInferior and normal goods relate to income changes, not directly to price changes of other goods.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like A and B are substitute goods.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nSuppose A and B are substitute goods. If the price of A increases, people should buy less A and more B, which matches the scenario.\n\nIf they were complement goods, an increase in the price of A would lead to a decrease in the quantity demanded of A, and consequently, a decrease in the quantity demanded of B.\n\nIf B is an inferior good, and income decreases, people might buy more B, but here the change is in the price of A, not income.\n\nIf B is a normal good, and income increases, people buy more B, but again, the change here is in the price of A.\n\nSo, the direct relationship between the price of A and the quantity demanded of B points towards a substitution effect, which is characteristic of substitute goods.\n\nI think the answer is A. substitute goods.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
