                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about which group of animals first developed lung tissue sufficient for their respiratory needs without needing extra gas exchange organs. The options are amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and trematoda. I think I need to recall some evolutionary biology here.\n\nFirst, I know that amphibians are the earliest terrestrial vertebrates. They have lungs, but they also use their skin for respiration, especially in water or moist environments. So, they rely on supplementary gas exchange organs like their skin.\n\nReptiles came after amphibians and are more adapted to terrestrial life. They have more efficient lungs and don't depend on their skin for respiration like amphibians do. But I'm not sure if their lungs are fully sufficient without any supplementary organs.\n\nMammals evolved from reptiles and have even more advanced lungs. They are completely terrestrial and don't rely on any external surfaces for gas exchange. So, maybe mammals were the first to have fully sufficient lung tissue.\n\nTrematoda are parasitic flatworms, like flukes. I don't think they have lungs; they probably have different ways of exchanging gases since they live inside hosts.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. The question is asking for the first group to develop lungs adequate to support their respiratory requirements without needing supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nAmphibians have lungs but also use their skin, so their lungs aren't sufficient on their own.\n\nReptiles have more efficient lungs and don't rely on their skin for respiration. So, perhaps reptiles were the first to have lungs that could support their respiratory needs without supplementary organs.\n\nMammals have even more advanced lungs, but they came after reptiles.\n\nTrematoda aren't even vertebrates; they're parasites and don't have lungs.\n\nSo, maybe reptiles are the answer.\n\nWait, but I recall that some amphibians, like salamanders, rely heavily on cutaneous respiration, meaning they need their skin for gas exchange, especially when in water. Frogs have more advanced lungs but still use their skin to some extent.\n\nReptiles, on the other hand, have lungs that are sufficient for their needs, and they don't rely on their skin for respiration. Their skin is usually covered with scales, which reduce water loss and don't participate in gas exchange.\n\nMammals also have efficient lungs and don't rely on skin respiration.\n\nSo, between reptiles and mammals, which group developed sufficient lung tissue first?\n\nSince reptiles evolved before mammals, it makes sense that reptiles were the first group to have lungs that could support their respiratory needs without supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. reptiles.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something about certain reptiles that still use skin respiration.\n\nI know that some reptiles, like turtles, have semi-permeable skin and can exchange gases through it, but their lungs are primarily responsible for respiration. However, it's not a major route for gas exchange compared to their lungs.\n\nIn contrast, amphibians rely more on their skin for respiration, especially when they are in water.\n\nSo, overall, it seems that reptiles were the first group to develop lungs that could support their respiratory needs without depending on supplementary gas exchange organs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
