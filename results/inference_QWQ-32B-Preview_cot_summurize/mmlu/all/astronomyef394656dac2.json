                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a sandbag and its properties on different planets. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nWe have a sandbag that has a mass of 5 kg and weighs 50 N on Earth. Now, we need to find out what its mass and weight would be on a planet that has half the gravity of Earth. The options are:\n\nA. Mass 5 kg, weight 100 N\n\nB. Mass 5 kg, weight 50 N\n\nC. Mass 5 kg, weight 25 N\n\nD. Mass 10 kg, weight 100 N\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what mass and weight are and how they relate to gravity.\n\nMass is the amount of matter in an object, and it doesn't change regardless of where the object is. Weight, on the other hand, is the force exerted on that mass due to gravity. So, weight can change depending on the gravitational field strength.\n\nOn Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2. The weight of an object is calculated using the formula:\n\nWeight = mass \u00d7 gravity\n\nSo, on Earth, for this sandbag:\n\nWeight = 5 kg \u00d7 9.8 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 49 N\n\nBut the question says 50 N, so maybe they're using 10 m/s\u00b2 for gravity, which is close enough for this problem.\n\nNow, if we're on a planet with half the gravity of Earth, the gravitational acceleration would be approximately 4.9 m/s\u00b2 (half of 9.8 m/s\u00b2).\n\nSo, the weight on that planet would be:\n\nWeight = 5 kg \u00d7 4.9 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 24.5 N\n\nAgain, if they're using 10 m/s\u00b2 for Earth's gravity, then half would be 5 m/s\u00b2, and:\n\nWeight = 5 kg \u00d7 5 m/s\u00b2 = 25 N\n\nThat matches option C: Mass 5 kg, weight 25 N.\n\nWait a minute, but let's make sure about the mass part. Does mass change with gravity? No, mass is an intrinsic property of the object and doesn't depend on the gravitational field it's in. So, the mass should remain 5 kg regardless of the planet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Mass 5 kg, weight 25 N.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to ensure I'm not missing something.\n\nOption A: Mass 5 kg, weight 100 N. That would be if the gravity was twice that of Earth, not half.\n\nOption B: Mass 5 kg, weight 50 N. That's the same as on Earth, but the planet has half the gravity, so weight should be less.\n\nOption D: Mass 10 kg, weight 100 N. Mass is incorrect because mass doesn't change with gravity. Weight would be 10 kg \u00d7 10 m/s\u00b2 = 100 N, which matches, but mass should still be 5 kg.\n\nSo, definitely, C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
