I think it's a model that helps predict and explain human behavior, especially when it comes to actions that people do intentionally.\n\nFrom what I recall, the theory suggests that people's behavior is guided by their intentions, and their intentions are influenced by three main factors. Let me see if I can remember them.\n\nOption A says: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. That rings a bell. Attitude toward the behavior is probably how someone feels about doing the action. Subjective norms might be about what other people think or expect from them regarding that behavior. And perceived behavioral control could be about how much control they feel they have over performing the behavior.\n\nOption B mentions degree of liking or attraction, beliefs, and action tendencies. Hmm, that seems a bit vague compared to option A. Liking or attraction could be related to attitude, but beliefs and action tendencies aren't specifically defined in the context of the theory of planned behavior as far as I know.\n\nOption C talks about level of ability, degree of motivation, and extent of behavioral control. Ability seems related to perceived behavioral control, and motivation might relate to attitude and subjective norms, but this option doesn't map directly to what I remember of the theory.\n\nOption D mentions attitudinal strength, social desirability, and perceived self-efficacy. Attitudinal strength could be part of attitude toward the behavior, social desirability might relate to subjective norms, and perceived self-efficacy is similar to perceived behavioral control, but again, it's not the standard terminology used in the theory.\n\nComparing all these options, option A seems the most accurate. It directly mentions the three components that are central to the theory of planned behavior: attitude toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control.\n\nTo make sure, maybe I should look back at some notes or a textbook, but since this is probably a multiple-choice question from a test or homework, and option A aligns best with what I recall, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
