The question is asking for three criteria they propose, and the options are:\n\nA. Breadth, Clarity, Accuracy\n\nB. Disclosure, Detail, Accuracy\n\nC. Disclosure, Clarity, Accuracy\n\nD. Disclosure, Clarity, Efficiency\n\nI need to recall or figure out which of these combinations is correct according to their research.\n\nFirst, I remember that transparency in corporate communications is about how companies share information with stakeholders. Schnackenberg and Tomlinson likely focused on aspects that ensure this information is effective and useful.\n\nLooking at option A: Breadth, Clarity, Accuracy.\n\n- Breadth could refer to the range of topics covered.\n\n- Clarity is about how easily understandable the information is.\n\n- Accuracy is about the truthfulness and correctness of the information.\n\nThis seems plausible, but I need to check if this is what Schnackenberg and Tomlinson specifically outlined.\n\nOption B: Disclosure, Detail, Accuracy.\n\n- Disclosure is similar to breadth; it's about what information is revealed.\n\n- Detail might refer to the level of depth or specificity in the information provided.\n\n- Accuracy is again about correctness.\n\nThis also makes sense, but I need to see which one matches their criteria.\n\nOption C: Disclosure, Clarity, Accuracy.\n\n- Disclosure: what information is made public.\n\n- Clarity: how well the information is presented and understood.\n\n- Accuracy: the truthfulness of the information.\n\nThis seems very similar to option A but uses \"disclosure\" instead of \"breadth.\"\n\nOption D: Disclosure, Clarity, Efficiency.\n\n- Disclosure and clarity are similar to the previous options.\n\n- Efficiency might refer to how quickly or effectively the information is communicated.\n\nBut I'm not sure if efficiency is a criterion they used.\n\nI think the key is to remember or look up exactly which terms Schnackenberg and Tomlinson used in their 2014 work.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have immediate access to the text, so I need to rely on my memory or make an educated guess based on common sense.\n\nGiven that transparency involves not only what is disclosed but also how it's presented and the quality of the information, I would guess that disclosure, clarity, and accuracy are the three key criteria.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most appropriate.\n\nOption A uses \"breadth\" instead of \"disclosure,\" but \"disclosure\" seems more precise in the context of transparency.\n\nOption B uses \"detail\" instead of \"clarity,\" but clarity is important for ensuring that the information is understandable, which is crucial for transparency.\n\nOption D introduces \"efficiency,\" which might be relevant but seems less directly related to the quality of the information itself compared to clarity and accuracy.\n\nSo, my best guess is option C: Disclosure, Clarity, Accuracy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
