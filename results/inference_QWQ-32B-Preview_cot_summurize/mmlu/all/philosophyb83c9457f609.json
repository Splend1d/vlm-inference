Let's see the options:\n\nA. what is considered complete happiness\n\nB. things that no one would want\n\nC. what is considered heavenly bliss\n\nD. what is considered deep insight\n\nFirst, I need to recall some information about Tolstoy and his life before his conversion. Leo Tolstoy was a famous Russian writer known for novels like \"War and Peace\" and \"Anna Karenina.\" He came from a noble family and had a privileged upbringing.\n\nBefore his spiritual and philosophical transformation, Tolstoy lived a life that many people might envy. He had wealth, social status, a large family, and success in his writing career. So, it seems like he was surrounded by what many people consider to be sources of happiness.\n\nOption A says \"what is considered complete happiness.\" That sounds plausible because he had a lot of things that people associate with happiness: wealth, success, family, etc.\n\nOption B says \"things that no one would want.\" That doesn't seem right because his life before the conversion was quite privileged and desirable.\n\nOption C says \"what is considered heavenly bliss.\" That sounds a bit too exaggerated for his pre-conversion life. Heavenly bliss might be more related to his spiritual pursuits after his conversion.\n\nOption D says \"what is considered deep insight.\" While Tolstoy was certainly insightful as a writer, before his conversion, he was more focused on worldly matters and his literary career, so this might not be the best fit.\n\nConsidering this, option A seems the most appropriate. Tolstoy was surrounded by what is considered complete happiness before his conversion. However, it's important to note that despite having all these external trappings of happiness, Tolstoy experienced a personal crisis that led to his spiritual awakening and transformation.\n\nI think the answer is A. what is considered complete happiness."
