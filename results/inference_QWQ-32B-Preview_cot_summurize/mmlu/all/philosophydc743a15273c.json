So, Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who founded Epicureanism, which is a school of thought that emphasizes the pursuit of happiness and the reduction of pain in life. I remember that for Epicurus, happiness comes from simple pleasures and living a peaceful life.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the greatest requirement for a complete life according to Epicurus. The options are honor, friendship, luxury, and good food. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, honor. In some philosophical traditions, honor is considered very important because it relates to one's reputation and standing in the community. However, Epicurus seemed more focused on inner contentment and less on external recognition. So, I'm not sure if honor would be his top priority.\n\nNext, friendship. Epicurus placed a lot of emphasis on friendship and considered it essential for a happy life. He believed that friends provide support, companionship, and help in times of need. In his view, true friends are those who are there for each other not just for superficial reasons but for mutual benefit and enjoyment.\n\nThen, luxury. Luxury typically refers to excessive comfort and material possessions. Epicurus, however, advocated for a simple life, free from unnecessary desires and attachments to material things. He believed that pursuing luxury can lead to unhappiness because it creates dependencies and causes worry.\n\nLastly, good food. While Epicurus was known for enjoying fine food and wine, he didn't consider it the most important aspect of life. For him, food was about nourishment and moderate pleasure, not about indulgence.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems that friendship would be the greatest requirement for a complete life according to Epicurus. He saw friendship as indispensable for happiness and peace of mind. So, I think the answer is B. friendship.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Maybe there's a quote from Epicurus that can confirm this. I recall that he said something like, \"Of all the means which are procured by wisdom to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is the acquisition of friends.\" That sounds pretty definitive.\n\nAlso, in his letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus writes, \"The principal thing to be sought for is to be able to live without being disturbed and without fear.\" He then goes on to say that friendship is crucial for achieving this state.\n\nOn the other hand, regarding luxury, he advises against excessive indulgence. In one of his letters, he mentions that luxurious living is not only impractical but also leads to discomfort and anxiety.\n\nAs for honor, Epicurus was more interested in living a quiet and peaceful life, away from the distractions of public life and the pursuit of honor. He established his school in a garden in Athens, where he and his followers could live and study philosophy without interference.\n\nGood food, while enjoyable, was not central to his philosophy. He advocated for moderation in all things, including eating and drinking.\n\nTherefore, based on Epicurus' teachings and emphasis on friendship as a foundation for a happy and complete life, I'm confident that the answer is B. friendship.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
