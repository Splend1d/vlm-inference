When employees in a certain age group might not perform as well as younger employees in the same job.\n\nB. When age is a bona fide occupational requirement.\n\nC. When properly administered intelligence and personality tests suggest the person might not perform well in the future.\n\nD. When standardized test results show that the person doesn't have all the aptitudes needed for the job.\n\nI need to pick the most appropriate time to ask about someone's age in personnel selection. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that age discrimination is generally frowned upon, and there are laws like the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that protect certain age groups from being discriminated against in employment. So, asking about age might be sensitive and not always appropriate.\n\nOption A suggests that it's okay to ask about age if employees in a certain age group don't perform as well as younger employees. But that sounds like age discrimination. Just because a group tends to perform differently doesn't mean it's okay to discriminate based on age. So, I think A is not the best choice.\n\nOption B mentions that age is a bona fide occupational requirement. Hmm, what does that mean? A bona fide occupational requirement, or BFOR, is a condition that is necessary for the job. For example, some jobs might have age restrictions for legal or safety reasons. Like, a job that involves operating heavy machinery might have age requirements due to licensing or insurance rules. So, in those cases, asking about age might be appropriate because it's essential for the job.\n\nOption C talks about intelligence and personality tests suggesting that someone might not perform well in the future. While it's important to assess a candidate's abilities, I don't think that just because test results suggest potential future performance issues, it's appropriate to ask about their age. The tests should be focused on abilities relevant to the job, not on age. So, I don't think C is the right answer.\n\nOption D is similar to C, mentioning that standardized test results show the incumbent doesn't have all the aptitudes expected for the job. Again, while aptitudes are important, asking about age doesn't seem directly related to assessing aptitudes. So, D doesn't seem right either.\n\nComparing all the options, B seems to be the most appropriate reason to ask about someone's age in personnel selection, provided that age is indeed a necessary requirement for the job. It's important to have legitimate reasons for considering age, and BFOR provides that justification.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Age is a bona fide occupational requirement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
