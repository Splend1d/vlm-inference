To create an elite of public relations practitioners\n\nC. To preserve the well-being of society\n\nD. To achieve better wages for licensed practitioners\n\nHmm, let's think about this. Licensing is something that's common in many professions, like law, medicine, and engineering. The general idea behind licensing is to ensure that people practicing these professions meet certain standards. So, for public relations, it might be similar.\n\nOption A says \"to regulate access to posts in the field.\" That sounds plausible. Licensing could be a way to control who can work in public relations, maybe to ensure they have the necessary education or experience.\n\nOption B suggests \"to create an elite of public relations practitioners.\" That seems a bit elitist. While licensing might inadvertently create a distinction between licensed and non-licensed practitioners, I don't think that's the primary purpose. It's more about ensuring competence than creating an elite group.\n\nOption C states \"to preserve the well-being of society.\" Hmm, public relations can influence public opinion and behavior. Maybe licensing is meant to ensure that practitioners act ethically and don't spread misinformation, which could harm society. That makes sense.\n\nOption D is \"to achieve better wages for licensed practitioners.\" While licensing might have the effect of increasing wages by creating a barrier to entry, I don't think that's the main purpose. It's more about quality control than boosting incomes.\n\nLet me consider this further. In many professions, licensing is required to protect the public interest. For example, you wouldn't want just anyone performing surgery or giving legal advice without proper training. Similarly, in public relations, practitioners often deal with sensitive information and can influence public perception. So, having a license might ensure they have a certain level of knowledge and ethics.\n\nAlso, licensing usually involves some form of examination or verification of qualifications. This process helps to maintain standards in the profession.\n\nLooking back at the options, A seems similar to regulating entry, which is part of licensing, but maybe too narrow. C, about preserving the well-being of society, seems broader and more aligned with the general purpose of licensing.\n\nPerhaps the main purpose is to ensure that public relations practitioners act in ways that don't harm society, by adhering to ethical standards and professional practices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of regulating access and preserving society's well-being.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, I'd probably go with C, to preserve the well-being of society. Because ultimately, that's who licensing is meant to protect.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
