Duration recording\n\nB. Latency recording\n\nC. Event recording\n\nD. Whole-interval recording\n\nI think I need to understand what each of these terms means to pick the right one.\n\nFirst, duration recording sounds like it's about measuring how long a behavior lasts. So, if a behavior occurs, you note how much time it takes from start to finish. That doesn't sound like counting occurrences; it's more about time spans.\n\nNext, latency recording seems to be about the time it takes for a behavior to start after a certain stimulus or cue. So, it's measuring the delay before the behavior begins. Again, that's not about counting how many times something happens; it's about the delay time.\n\nEvent recording sounds promising. I think this is where you count the number of times a behavior occurs during a set period. That seems to match what the question is asking for.\n\nThen there's whole-interval recording, which I believe is a method where you observe whether a behavior occurs at any point during a fixed time interval. If it happens even once during that interval, you record it as occurring in that interval. It's not about counting multiple occurrences, just whether it happened during the interval or not.\n\nSo, comparing these, event recording seems to be the one that involves counting the number of occurrences of a behavior during a specified time period.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm misunderstanding one of these terms.\n\nDuration recording is definitely about the length of time a behavior continues.\n\nLatency is about the time from a stimulus to the start of the behavior.\n\nEvent recording is about counting occurrences.\n\nWhole-interval is about whether the behavior occurred at least once during the interval.\n\nYes, event recording appears to be the correct answer.\n\nI should also consider if there's any overlap or if another method could also involve counting occurrences. For example, maybe whole-interval recording could be used to count how many intervals the behavior occurred in, but that's not the same as counting the number of times it happens within an interval.\n\nSo, I think C. Event recording is the right choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
