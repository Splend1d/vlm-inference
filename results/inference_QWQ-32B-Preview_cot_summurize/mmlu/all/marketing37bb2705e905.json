The options are lead generation, search, rich media, and social media marketing. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being described. It's about advertisers paying fees to online companies that refer potential customers who have expressed interest in being contacted by marketers. So, it's not just any kind of advertising; it's specifically about generating interested prospects.\n\nLead generation sounds familiar. I think lead generation is the process of identifying and cultivating potential customers for a business. So, if an online company is referring qualified potential customers, that sounds a lot like generating leads for advertisers. And the fact that consumers opt in to being contacted suggests that these are quality leads who have shown interest, which is even better.\n\nNow, let's consider the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nSearch: This might refer to pay-per-click advertising or search engine marketing, where advertisers pay each time their ad is clicked in search results. While this can generate leads, it's more broadly about getting traffic based on search queries, not necessarily about qualifying potential customers directly.\n\nRich media: This typically refers to interactive online advertising content, like videos, animations, or other engaging media. While rich media can be used in lead generation, the term itself doesn't specifically denote the process of referring qualified potential customers.\n\nSocial media marketing: This is promoting products or services through social media platforms. It's a broad term that can include various strategies, including lead generation, but it's not specifically about referring qualified leads.\n\nComparing all these, lead generation seems to be the most precise match for the description provided in the question. It directly involves referring qualified potential customers who have opted in to being contacted, which aligns with the scenario described.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. Lead generation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
