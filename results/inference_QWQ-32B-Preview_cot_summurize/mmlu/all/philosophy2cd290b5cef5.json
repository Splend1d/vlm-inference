                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about Tolstoy's life after his crisis of meaning. I remember that Tolstoy went through a deep spiritual and philosophical crisis, which really shook up his worldview. Let me think about each option:\n\nA. His income increased dramatically.\n\nI don't think this is likely. From what I recall, Tolstoy's crisis led him to question his wealth and social status. He actually became more interested in the lives of the peasants and started giving away his possessions. So, an increase in income doesn't seem to fit with his\u8f6c\u53d8.\n\nB. He distrusted everyone.\n\nHmm, maybe partially. During his crisis, Tolstoy did question many aspects of society and even his own family at times. But saying he distrusted everyone seems a bit too broad. His relationships, especially with his wife, became strained, but I don't think he distrusted everyone universally.\n\nC. He became religious.\n\nThis seems plausible. Tolstoy had a profound spiritual awakening during his crisis. He turned to religion, particularly a form of Christian anarchism, which emphasized moral righteousness and rejection of violence and materialism. He wrote \"A Confession\" and \"My Religion,\" which detail his spiritual journey and newfound beliefs.\n\nD. He became an agnostic.\n\nThis contradicts option C. If he became religious, it's unlikely he became agnostic, which is a lack of belief in religious doctrines. From what I know, Tolstoy's crisis led him to seek meaning beyond his previous secular views, and he found it in religion, albeit a personalized and unconventional form of it.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the best answer is C. He became religious. His crisis prompted a deep spiritual search, and he embraced a set of religious beliefs that guided the rest of his life and influenced his later works.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
