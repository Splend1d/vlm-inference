                    "text": "So I have this question about subspaces in R^4. It says that V and W are both 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4, and I need to find out what the possible dimensions are for their intersection, V intersect W. The options are:\n\nA. 1 only\n\nB. 2 only\n\nC. 0 and 1 only\n\nD. 0, 1, and 2 only\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some facts about subspaces and their intersections. I know that the intersection of two subspaces is also a subspace, so its dimension must satisfy certain properties.\n\nI remember there's a formula that relates the dimensions of V, W, and their sum V + W. The formula is:\n\ndim(V + W) = dim V + dim W - dim(V \u2229 W)\n\nIn this case, V and W are both 2-dimensional, so:\n\ndim(V + W) = 2 + 2 - dim(V \u2229 W) = 4 - dim(V \u2229 W)\n\nNow, V + W is a subspace of R^4, so its dimension can be at most 4. That means:\n\ndim(V + W) \u2264 4\n\nSubstituting the previous equation:\n\n4 - dim(V \u2229 W) \u2264 4\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\ndim(V \u2229 W) \u2265 0\n\nWell, that doesn't tell me much because dimensions can't be negative anyway. Let's think about the other extreme.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible dimension for V \u2229 W? If V and W are the same subspace, then their intersection is themselves, which is 2-dimensional. So, dim(V \u2229 W) can be as high as 2.\n\nNow, what's the minimum possible dimension? Could it be 0? That would mean that V and W have only the zero vector in common. Is that possible?\n\nYes, it is possible. For example, consider V to be the subspace spanned by e1 and e2, and W to be spanned by e3 and e4, where e1, e2, e3, e4 are the standard basis vectors of R^4. In this case, V and W have only the zero vector in common, so dim(V \u2229 W) = 0.\n\nSo, 0 is possible.\n\nWhat about dimension 1? Can V and W intersect in a 1-dimensional subspace?\n\nI think yes. For example, let V be spanned by e1 and e2, and W be spanned by e1 and e3. Then, their intersection is spanned by e1, which is 1-dimensional.\n\nSo, dimensions 0, 1, and 2 are all possible.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if there are any constraints I'm missing.\n\nI know that the dimension of the intersection can't be larger than the dimension of either subspace. Since both V and W are 2-dimensional, dim(V \u2229 W) can't be larger than 2.\n\nAlso, from the formula dim(V + W) = 4 - dim(V \u2229 W), and since dim(V + W) can be at least 2 (if one is contained in the other, for example), then:\n\n4 - dim(V \u2229 W) \u2265 2\n\nWhich implies:\n\ndim(V \u2229 W) \u2264 2\n\nWhich we already knew.\n\nMoreover, dim(V + W) can be as high as 4, which would correspond to dim(V \u2229 W) = 0.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- dim(V \u2229 W) can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. 0, 1, and 2 only.\n\nBut let me make sure that there isn't a scenario where dim(V \u2229 W) could be higher than 2. Well, since both V and W are 2-dimensional, their intersection can't be higher than 2-dimensional. Also, it can't be negative, so the possible dimensions are 0, 1, or 2.\n\nIs there any theorem or result that directly states what the possible dimensions of the intersection are for two subspaces of given dimensions in a vector space?\n\nI think the Grassmann formula, which is the one I used earlier, is the key here. It relates the dimensions of V, W, and their sum and intersection.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, I'm confident that the answer is D. 0, 1, and 2 only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
