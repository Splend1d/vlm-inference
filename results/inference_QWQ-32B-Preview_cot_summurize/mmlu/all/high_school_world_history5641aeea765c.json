                    "text": "Let's see. So, this passage is from The Epic of Gilgamesh, which is really old, like around 2100 B.C.E. It's talking about Gilgamesh, who was a king of Uruk. The first paragraph describes him as being given a perfect form by the gods, with glory from Shamash, the sun god, and courage from Adad, the god of storms. It says that the great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others, making him terrible like a great wild bull, and that he was two-thirds god and one-third man.\n\nSo, the question is asking which statement about ancient leaders is most directly supported by this description of Gilgamesh. The options are:\n\nA. Ancient leaders were valued for their mastery of complicated legal codes.\n\nB. Ancient leaders were expected to be experts of animal husbandry.\n\nC. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.\n\nD. Ancient leaders were not judged on their appearances.\n\nHmm. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A talks about mastery of legal codes. But in the passage, there's no mention of legal codes or anything related to laws or governance beyond being a king who built walls and temples. So, that doesn't seem directly supported by the description.\n\nOption B is about animal husbandry. Again, the passage doesn't mention anything about animals or farming practices, except perhaps referring to him being like a great wild bull, which might symbolize strength, but not necessarily expertise in animal husbandry. So, this also doesn't seem directly supported.\n\nOption C is about divine origins bolstering legitimacy. The passage describes Gilgamesh as being two-thirds god and one-third man, which suggests a divine heritage. It also mentions that the gods gave him a perfect form, glory, and courage. This seems directly related to the idea that ancient leaders had divine origins to support their rule. This looks promising.\n\nOption D says that ancient leaders were not judged on their appearances. But the passage describes Gilgamesh as having a perfect form, which seems to emphasize his physical appearance. So, this option seems contrary to what's stated in the passage.\n\nComparing all these, option C seems to be the one most directly supported by the description of Gilgamesh in the passage. The text clearly attributes divine qualities and origins to Gilgamesh, which would have been used to legitimize his position as king.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
