Labrador Retriever.\n\nThe Labrador Retriever has been a consistent favorite in the US for many years due to its friendly nature, intelligence, and adaptability. It's a great family dog and is also commonly used as a service dog and in various working roles.\n\nHere's a brief overview of why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Poodle - While Poodles are very intelligent and popular, they weren't the top breed in 1999.\n\nB. Beagle - Beagles are lovely dogs, known for their hunting skills and friendly personalities, but they weren't the most popular breed in 1999.\n\nC. German Shepherd - German Shepherds are known for their intelligence and versatility, often used in law enforcement and as service dogs, but in 1999, they were not the top breed according to the AKC.\n\nIt's worth noting that dog breed popularity can change over time, so it's always a good idea to check the latest rankings from the AKC or other reputable sources for the most current information.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nAmerican Kennel Club.
