                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about remote procedure calls, and I need to pick the correct statement from these options. Okay, first things first, I should understand what a remote procedure call (RPC) is.\n\nSo, RPC is a protocol that one computer program uses to request a service from another program located in another computer across a network. It's like making a function call, but instead of the function being in the same program, it's on a different machine. The idea is to make this interaction as transparent as possible, so the developer doesn't have to worry too much about the network communication details.\n\nOption A says: \"It is used to call procedures with addresses that are farther than 2^16 bytes away.\" Hmm, that sounds more like a memory addressing issue rather than a networking concept. RPC is about calling procedures on different machines over a network, not about memory addresses within a single machine. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption B: \"It cannot return a value.\" That doesn't sound right. The whole point of a procedure call is that it can perform some operations and return a result. If RPC couldn't return a value, it would be pretty useless for most purposes. So, I doubt this is the correct answer.\n\nOption C: \"It cannot pass parameters by reference.\" Now, this is interesting. In regular procedure calls within a single program, you can pass parameters by value or by reference. Passing by reference means passing the memory address of the variable, so the procedure can modify the original variable. But in RPC, since the procedure is on another machine, it's not possible to pass memory addresses directly because memory on one machine isn't accessible from another. So, RPC typically passes parameters by value or by copying them to a message that's sent over the network. Therefore, it can't pass parameters by reference in the same way as local procedure calls. This might be the correct answer.\n\nOption D: \"It cannot call procedures implemented in a different language.\" I don't think that's accurate. One of the advantages of RPC is that it allows different languages to communicate with each other, as long as they agree on a common interface and data representation. For example, a Python program can make an RPC call to a service written in Java, as long as they both understand the RPC protocol being used, like gRPC or SOAP. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nLooking back, option C seems the most plausible. RPC can't pass parameters by reference because the caller and the remote procedure don't share the same memory space. Instead, parameters are serialized and sent over the network, and the remote procedure works with local copies of those parameters. Therefore, the correct statement is likely C: \"It cannot pass parameters by reference.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
