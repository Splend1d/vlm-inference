Both A and B\n\nD. Neither A nor B\n\nI know that both Ridge and Lasso are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models. But I'm not sure how they differ in terms of feature selection.\n\nRidge regression adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This penalty causes the coefficients to shrink towards zero but doesn't actually set any of them exactly to zero. So, Ridge helps in reducing the model complexity and multicollinearity, but it doesn't perform feature selection because all features still have non-zero coefficients.\n\nOn the other hand, Lasso regression adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This penalty can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively removing those features from the model. Therefore, Lasso not only helps in regularization but also performs feature selection by setting irrelevant or less important features' coefficients to zero.\n\nGiven this, it seems like Lasso is more appropriate for feature selection because it can zero out coefficients, whereas Ridge just shrinks them towards zero without eliminating features.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps in some scenarios, Ridge can be used for feature selection indirectly. For example, if coefficients are shrunk close to zero, we could consider removing features with very small coefficients. However, this isn't a straightforward or standard approach compared to Lasso's built-in feature selection.\n\nAlso, there's Elastic Net, which is a combination of Ridge and Lasso penalties, and it can perform feature selection similar to Lasso but also handle correlated features better than Lasso.\n\nBut since the question is only between Ridge and Lasso, and possibly both or neither, I think the best answer is B. Lasso, because it directly performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero.\n\nOption C, both A and B, might seem plausible if Ridge's coefficient shrinkage is considered a form of feature reduction, but it's not the same as actual feature selection where features are entirely removed.\n\nOption D, neither A nor B, wouldn't make sense because Lasso does perform feature selection.\n\nSo, I think the most appropriate answer is B. Lasso.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
