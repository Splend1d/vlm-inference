                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to decide which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"The ladies flower garden was so beautiful I just wanted to pick some of them.\"\n\nOkay, so here, someone sees a beautiful flower garden owned by ladies (assuming it's plural, \"ladies'\") and feels the urge to pick some flowers. Now, morally, what's wrong with that?\n\nWell, first off, it's someone else's property. If it's their garden, their flowers, they have a right to decide who can pick from it and who can't. Taking something without permission is generally considered wrong, right? It's like taking someone's belongings without asking.\n\nPlus, flowers are often grown for enjoyment and beauty, and picking them without permission could ruin the garden or upset the owners. So, from that perspective, it seems morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"When my restaurant's freezer broke, I threw the warm meat away even though I knew it was very expensive.\"\n\nThis one is a bit different. So, the person owns a restaurant, and their freezer broke. They had expensive meat in there, but because the freezer is broken, the meat is now warm. They decide to throw it away.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with that?\n\nWell, first, they own the restaurant and presumably the meat. So, it's their property. They can decide what to do with it.\n\nBut, maybe there's something about wasting food that's morally wrong? Some people might think it's wrong to throw away food that could be given to those in need, but in this case, it's warm meat that was supposed to be frozen. Warm meat could be unsafe to eat, right? It might have gone bad, potentially causing food poisoning if served.\n\nSo, from a food safety perspective, throwing it away might be the responsible thing to do, even if it's expensive. It's better to discard potentially hazardous food than to risk customers' health.\n\nAdditionally, keeping and using warm meat that was supposed to be frozen could be illegal in many places due to health codes. So, throwing it away might actually be the law-abiding thing to do.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, throwing away the warm meat seems like the right thing to do, both morally and legally. So, it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together, Scenario 1 seems morally wrong, and Scenario 2 seems not wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt looks like option B fits: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there are any other angles.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe some people think that picking flowers from a public space is okay, but the scenario specifies \"the ladies' flower garden,\" which sounds like a private garden. So, without permission, picking flowers would still be wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 2, perhaps someone might think that throwing away expensive meat is wasteful and therefore wrong, but considering food safety and legal requirements, it's likely the appropriate action.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
