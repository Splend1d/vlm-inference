Coach Perry is gradually making the task harder by rolling the ball faster and to different areas, and he's praising her when she does well. That sounds like shaping behavior step by step.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure.\n\nA. The law of effect is about behaviors being more likely to occur if they're followed by positive consequences. While that's happening here\u2014Lana is being praised for stopping the ball\u2014it doesn't specifically capture the idea of gradually increasing difficulty.\n\nB. Partial reinforcement effect is about reinforcing a behavior only some of the time to make it more resistant to extinction. But in this scenario, it seems like Coach Perry is praising her successful attempts, which might be continuous reinforcement, not partial.\n\nD. Second-order conditioning is when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a conditioned stimulus, which is already associated with a response. That doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nSo, shaping seems to be the most appropriate term for this scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
