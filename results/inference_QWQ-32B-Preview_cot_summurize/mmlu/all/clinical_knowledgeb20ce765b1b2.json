                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about headaches, and I need to pick the true statement among the options. Let's go through each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"When associated with neck stiffness, it is always due to meningitis.\" Hmm, I know that meningitis can cause headaches with neck stiffness because the meninges are inflamed. But is it always meningitis? I think there could be other causes for headache and neck stiffness, like muscle tension or other infections. So, I'm not sure if it's always meningitis.\n\nOption B says: \"Severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause.\" Oh, this is interesting. I've had really bad headaches before, but they weren't life-threatening; maybe just migraines or something. So, does severe pain always mean something serious? I don't think so. There are many causes of severe headaches that aren't life-threatening, like cluster headaches or migraines. So, probably not.\n\nOption C says: \"Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\" I know that temporal arteritis is an inflammation of the blood vessels, particularly those in the head, and it can cause headaches. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects joints. Are they strongly associated? I'm not sure about that. I think temporal arteritis can occur independently of rheumatoid arthritis, but maybe there's a connection. I need to recall or look up if there's a strong association between the two.\n\nOption D says: \"Tension headaches are a common cause of headache.\" Yeah, I've heard of tension headaches. They're probably the most common type of headache, right? They feel like a tight band around your head, and they're often related to stress or muscle tension. So, this seems likely.\n\nAlright, let's evaluate them again.\n\nOption A: I don't think it's always meningitis when there's headache and neck stiffness. There could be other causes, like viral infections or even just muscle strain.\n\nOption B: Severe pain doesn't necessarily indicate a life-threatening cause. Migraines can be excruciating but aren't usually life-threatening.\n\nOption C: I'm not sure about the association between temporal arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis. I think temporal arteritis can occur in people without rheumatoid arthritis, so maybe it's not strongly associated.\n\nOption D: Tension headaches are indeed very common. In fact, they're probably the most frequent type of headache people experience.\n\nSo, based on this, I think option D is the correct answer. But let me make sure.\n\nMaybe I should consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Headache with neck stiffness could be meningitis, but it could also be other things like a stiff neck from muscle tension or even a viral illness. So, it's not always meningitis.\n\nOption B: Severe headache doesn't automatically mean a life-threatening condition. Migraines can be severe but aren't typically life-threatening.\n\nOption C: Temporal arteritis and rheumatoid arthritis\u2014while both are inflammatory conditions, I don't think there's a strong association between them. Temporal arteritis can occur in people without rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nOption D: Tension headaches are very common and are a frequent cause of headaches.\n\nYeah, I think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
