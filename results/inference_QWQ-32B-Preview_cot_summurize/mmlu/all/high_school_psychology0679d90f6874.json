She has high grades and is involved in lots of activities outside of school too. But then, on her second day of learning to drive, she causes an accident. Her instructor is shocked by this. The question is asking why the instructor is shocked, and it's probably because of something called the \"halo effect.\"\n\nLet me think about this. The halo effect is when someone has a positive overall impression of a person, and that positive view affects how they think about that person's specific behaviors or actions. So, because Tina is usually so great at everything, her instructor might have had really high expectations for her driving too. When she caused an accident so early on, it went against what the instructor expected from someone who is typically so competent. That's why the instructor was shocked.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure. Option A is \"modeling.\" I think modeling is when someone learns by observing and imitating others. That doesn't seem related to why the instructor was shocked.\n\nOption B is \"accommodation.\" I think accommodation is part of how we adapt our existing knowledge to new information. Maybe it's related to cognitive development. Not sure how that fits here.\n\nOption D is \"convergence.\" I'm not exactly sure what that means in this context. Maybe it's about different perceptions coming together. Doesn't seem directly related to the instructor's reaction.\n\nSo, compared to these other options, the halo effect makes the most sense. It's about having a general positive impression of someone and letting that influence your expectations in specific areas. In this case, Tina's overall excellence led her instructor to expect her to be a perfect student driver, and when that didn't happen, it was surprising.\n\nI think the answer is C, the halo effect.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
