                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the distance between Earth and the star Altair. It says that this distance is one million times greater than the distance between Earth and the Sun. I need to find out how far Altair is from Earth, and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what the distance between Earth and the Sun is. I think it's called an astronomical unit, or AU for short. One AU is approximately 150 million kilometers, or in meters, that would be 150 million times 1,000, which is 150 billion meters. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me double-check that.\n\nI remember that 1 AU is about 149.6 million kilometers, which is 149,600,000 kilometers. To convert that to meters, I need to multiply by 1,000, so that would be 149,600,000,000 meters. That's 1.496 x 10^11 meters. Okay, so the distance from Earth to the Sun is roughly 1.5 x 10^11 meters.\n\nNow, the question says that the distance to Altair is one million times greater than that. So, I need to multiply the Earth-Sun distance by one million. One million is 10^6, so:\n\nDistance to Altair = Earth-Sun distance \u00d7 1,000,000\n\nWhich is:\n\nDistance to Altair = 1.5 x 10^11 meters \u00d7 10^6\n\nWhen multiplying powers of ten, I add the exponents:\n\n10^11 \u00d7 10^6 = 10^(11+6) = 10^17\n\nSo, Distance to Altair = 1.5 x 10^17 meters\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 9.3 x 10^13 meters\n\nB. 9.3 x 10^10 meters\n\nC. 1.5 x 10^14 meters\n\nD. 1.5 x 10^17 meters\n\nOption D matches the calculation I just did. So, Altair is approximately 1.5 x 10^17 meters from Earth.\n\nBut wait a minute, I recall that Altair is relatively close to Earth in astronomical terms, one of the nearest stars. I think it's about 16 light-years away. Let me see if that makes sense with my calculation.\n\nFirst, I need to know what a light-year is. A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year. The speed of light is approximately 3.0 x 10^8 meters per second, and there are about 3.154 x 10^7 seconds in a year (since a year is approximately 365.25 days).\n\nSo, one light-year is:\n\nDistance = speed \u00d7 time\n\nDistance = 3.0 x 10^8 m/s \u00d7 3.154 x 10^7 s\n\nMultiplying those:\n\nDistance = 9.462 x 10^15 meters\n\nSo, one light-year is about 9.462 x 10^15 meters.\n\nNow, if Altair is about 16 light-years away, then the distance should be:\n\nDistance to Altair = 16 \u00d7 9.462 x 10^15 meters\n\nWhich is approximately:\n\nDistance to Altair \u2248 151.4 x 10^15 meters\n\nWait, that would be 1.514 x 10^17 meters.\n\nThat's very close to the value I calculated earlier: 1.5 x 10^17 meters.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. Option D seems to be correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A: 9.3 x 10^13 meters. That's 93 billion meters, which is way less than the Earth-Sun distance itself (1.5 x 10^11 meters), so no.\n\nOption B: 9.3 x 10^10 meters. That's 930 million meters, still less than the Earth-Sun distance.\n\nOption C: 1.5 x 10^14 meters. That's 150 billion meters, which is only 1,000 times the Earth-Sun distance, not one million times.\n\nSo, none of these make sense except for option D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that one million times the Earth-Sun distance equals the distance to Altair. Maybe the question is worded differently.\n\nLet me read the question again: \"The distance between the Earth and the star Altair is one million times greater than the distance between the Earth and the Sun. How far is Altair from the Earth?\"\n\nYes, that's clear. It's asking for the distance to Altair, given that it's one million times the Earth-Sun distance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Earth-Sun distance is not exactly 1.5 x 10^11 meters, but that's a standard approximation. Let me check if using a more precise value would change the answer.\n\nThe exact value of one AU is 149,597,870,700 meters, which is approximately 1.496 x 10^11 meters. Multiplying that by one million (10^6) gives 1.496 x 10^17 meters, which is still closest to option D: 1.5 x 10^17 meters.\n\nMoreover, considering that Altair is indeed about 16 light-years away, and calculating that distance gives approximately 1.5 x 10^17 meters, it all checks out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1.5 x 10^17 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
