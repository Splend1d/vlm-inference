                    "text": "I think I need to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US around 2020. The options are:\n\n1. I leased the Porsche.\n\n2. I sat astride the dog and prodded it to carry me.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"leased the Porsche\" means. Leasing a car usually means you're renting it for a certain period, and at the end of that period, you return it. It's a common practice for getting a new car without buying it outright. So, in general, leasing a car isn't morally wrong; it's a business transaction.\n\nNow, the second scenario: sitting astride a dog and prodding it to carry you. This sounds like you're trying to make the dog act like a horse or something, which is not natural for dogs. Dogs are not built to carry people on their backs, and forcing them to do so could be harmful or uncomfortable for the dog.\n\nConsidering ordinary moral standards in the US around 2020, treating animals humanely is important. Forcing a dog to carry you like a horse might be seen as abusive or at least neglectful of the dog's well-being.\n\nSo, leasing a Porsche is likely not morally wrong, but making a dog carry you might be considered wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like C. Not wrong, Wrong is the most appropriate choice.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if leasing a Porsche could be seen as morally wrong in some contexts. For example, if someone leases an expensive car while unable to afford it, or if they use the car for illegal activities, that could be wrong. However, simply leasing a Porsche without any additional context doesn't inherently suggest moral wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, I think C. Not wrong, Wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
