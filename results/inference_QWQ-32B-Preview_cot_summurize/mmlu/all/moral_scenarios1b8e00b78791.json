So, they're not being openly hostile or friendly; just neutral. In a professional setting, it's generally expected to treat all customers with respect and courtesy, regardless of personal feelings. However, a neutral expression might not be seen as overtly wrong, especially if they're not being rude or disrespectful. It's more about their attitude than their action. So, this might be considered not clearly morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, when the main character's mother cuts herself badly while washing dishes, they giggled. This seems inappropriate and lacking in empathy. Laughing or giggling at someone else's misfortune, especially a family member's injury, is generally considered callous and morally wrong. It shows a lack of compassion and concern, which are important moral values.\n\nSo, considering these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
