                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't a characteristic of a perfectly competitive industry. So, first things first, I should recall what perfect competition is all about.\n\nPerfect competition is an ideal market structure where there are many small firms and many buyers. No single firm can influence the market price; they're all price takers. The products offered by different firms are identical, so there's no differentiation. Also, there are no barriers to entry or exit in the market, meaning firms can freely enter or leave the industry.\n\nOption A says \"Free entry into the industry.\" That sounds right; in perfect competition, there are no barriers to entry. Firms can enter the market if they see profits, and exit if they're incurring losses. So, this seems like a characteristic of perfect competition.\n\nOption B is \"Product differentiation.\" Hmm, in perfect competition, products are homogeneous, meaning they're all the same, and there's no differentiation. So, actually, product differentiation would not be a characteristic of perfect competition. In fact, it's more associated with monopolistic competition or differentiated oligopoly.\n\nOption C says \"Perfectly elastic demand curve.\" In perfect competition, each firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve because if they try to sell at a higher price than the market price, buyers will just go to other firms that are selling at the market price. So, this is indeed a characteristic of perfect competition.\n\nOption D is \"Homogeneous products.\" As I recall, in perfect competition, all firms produce identical products. So, this is also a characteristic of perfect competition.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, it seems like option B, \"Product differentiation,\" is not a characteristic of perfect competition. In fact, it's the opposite of what happens in perfect competition, where products are homogeneous.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about it again. Perfect competition features homogeneous products, free entry and exit, and firms are price takers with perfectly elastic demand curves. Product differentiation is more related to markets where firms have some degree of market power and can distinguish their products from others.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Product differentiation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
