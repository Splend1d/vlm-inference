                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option is a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. First, I should recall what X-linked dominant means.\n\nSo, X-linked means that the gene in question is located on the X chromosome. Dominant means that having just one copy of the mutant gene is enough to express the trait or disease. Since males have only one X chromosome (and females have two), the expression can differ between sexes.\n\nOption A is \"Parental consanguinity.\" Consanguinity means that the parents are related, which can increase the chance of inheriting two copies of a recessive gene, but I don't think it's specifically a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption B is \"Male to male transmission.\" In X-linked recessive inheritance, males cannot pass the gene to their sons because they give their Y chromosome to sons, not the X. But in X-linked dominant, since males pass their X chromosome to their daughters, not their sons, I don't think direct male to male transmission is a feature. So, probably not B.\n\nOption C is \"Transmission only by females.\" Well, females can transmit X-linked genes to both sons and daughters because they have two X chromosomes. Males, as I mentioned, transmit their X chromosome only to their daughters. So, saying \"only by females\" isn't accurate because males can also transmit the gene, just to their daughters. So, C seems incorrect.\n\nOption D is \"Transmitted by males only to females.\" That sounds right because males pass their X chromosome only to their daughters. So, if a male carries the dominant X-linked mutation, he will pass it to all of his daughters but none of his sons, since sons receive the Y chromosome. Females, on the other hand, can pass it to both sons and daughters, depending on whether the X chromosome with the mutation is transmitted.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is about a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance, not just transmission patterns. Let me think again.\n\nIn X-linked dominant inheritance, since it's dominant, even a single copy of the mutant gene causes the phenotype. So, both heterozygous females and affected males would express the trait.\n\nNow, considering transmission:\n\n- An affected male will pass the mutation to all his daughters (since he passes his X chromosome to daughters) and none of his sons (since sons get the Y chromosome).\n\n- An affected female has two X chromosomes; if she's heterozygous, there's a 50% chance of passing the mutant X to either sons or daughters.\n\nSo, option D says \"Transmitted by males only to females,\" which is accurate for males transmitting the X-linked gene to their daughters.\n\nBut is there a better option? Let's look back.\n\nOption A: Parental consanguinity isn't specifically a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.\n\nOption B: Male to male transmission doesn't occur in X-linked conditions because males pass their Y chromosome to sons.\n\nOption C: Transmission only by females isn't correct because males can transmit the gene to their daughters.\n\nOption D: Transmitted by males only to females sounds correct.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another aspect of X-linked dominant inheritance that might be considered a feature.\n\nFor example, in X-linked dominant conditions, affected males and females can both pass on the condition, whereas in X-linked recessive, often only carrier females pass it on, and affected males don't have sons affected (since they pass Y to sons).\n\nWait, but the question is about a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance, and option D seems to describe a transmission pattern that is true for X-linked genes in general, dominant or recessive.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider what makes X-linked dominant inheritance unique.\n\n1. Both males and females can be affected, and both can pass on the trait.\n\n2. Males will pass the trait to all their daughters and none of their sons.\n\n3. Females have a 50% chance of passing the trait to either sons or daughters if they're heterozygous.\n\n4. Since it's dominant, even heterozygotes express the trait.\n\nGiven these points, option D is accurate regarding transmission from males to daughters. But perhaps there's a better option that captures a more distinctive feature of X-linked dominant inheritance.\n\nOption C says \"Transmission only by females.\" But that's not true because males can transmit the gene to their daughters.\n\nOption B says \"Male to male transmission.\" That doesn't occur in X-linked conditions, which is a feature, but not specific to dominant inheritance.\n\nOption A, \"Parental consanguinity,\" isn't directly related to the pattern of inheritance.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is C, but worded incorrectly. Transmission only by females would be incorrect because males can transmit to daughters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, recognizing that males transmit only to their daughters in X-linked inheritance.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me think about what the question is asking for.\n\nIt's asking for a feature of X-linked dominant inheritance. A feature should be something distinctive about this type of inheritance.\n\nOption D describes a transmission pattern that is true for X-linked inheritance in general, not just dominant.\n\nPerhaps there's a better answer.\n\nLet me consider penetrance. In dominant conditions, penetrance is usually high, but that's not listed as an option.\n\nAlternatively, variable expressivity might be a feature, but again, not listed.\n\nAnother consideration is that in X-linked dominant conditions, females can be more severely affected than males, due to X-inactivation patterns, but that's not among the options.\n\nGiven the choices provided, I think option D is the best answer, even though it describes a general X-linked transmission pattern, because it's accurate and relates specifically to how males transmit X-linked genes.\n\nOptions A, B, and C either are incorrect or not specific enough.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
