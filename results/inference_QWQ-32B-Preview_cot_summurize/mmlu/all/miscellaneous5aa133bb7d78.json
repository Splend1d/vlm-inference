The term \"organic\" in this context refers to the historical association of these compounds with living organisms, although many organic compounds are now synthesized in laboratories.\n\nThe key element in organic compounds is carbon, due to its unique ability to form stable covalent bonds with a variety of other elements and, importantly, with itself, allowing for the formation of long chains and complex structures. This property, known as catenation, is what enables the vast diversity of organic molecules, including hydrocarbons, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and many others that are essential for life.\n\nWhile other elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur are commonly found in organic compounds, it is the presence of carbon that defines them as organic. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"What element do organic compounds contain?\" is A. Carbon.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that some carbon-containing compounds, such as carbonates and cyanides, are classified as inorganic due to their properties and synthesis methods. But generally speaking, the presence of carbon is the primary characteristic of organic compounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
