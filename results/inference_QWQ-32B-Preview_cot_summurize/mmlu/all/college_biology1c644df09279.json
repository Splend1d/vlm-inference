I think lenticels might be the answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see what I remember about plant anatomy.\n\nFirst, lenticels are those small, raised areas on the bark of trees and some stems. I think they allow for the exchange of gases between the air and the living cells within the stem. Maybe they help the stem breathe, so to speak.\n\nTerminal buds are at the tips of branches and contain meristematic tissue for growth. They protect the bud scales and are mainly involved in growth, not gas exchange.\n\nNodes are the points on the stem where leaves are attached, and internodes are the regions between nodes. I don't recall nodes or internodes being directly involved in gas exchange.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up what lenticels are exactly. According to my notes, lenticels are porous structures in the bark that allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and the living parenchyma cells inside the stem. This seems to fit the description of sites for gas exchange.\n\nI also remember that in woody stems, as the bark grows and develops, lenticels provide pathways for gas exchange since the outer layers of bark are dead and impermeable to gases.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other structure that could be involved in gas exchange. Maybe the stomata on leaves are for gas exchange, but the question is specifically about the stem.\n\nHmm, perhaps terminal buds could have some role in gas exchange, but I think their main function is growth and protection. Nodes, where leaves are attached, might be involved in transporting gases through the leaves, but I don't think they are direct sites of gas exchange.\n\nInternodes are just the stem regions between nodes and don't seem to have a specific function in gas exchange.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is A. lenticels.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
