The options are A. $25.15, B. $26.50, C. $27.50, and D. $28.75.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the tip amount. The tip is 15% of the haircut cost, which is $25. To find 15% of $25, I can multiply 25 by 0.15.\n\nSo, 25 times 0.15 is... let's see, 25 times 0.1 is 2.5, and 25 times 0.05 is 1.25. Adding those together, 2.5 plus 1.25 is 3.75. So the tip is $3.75.\n\nNow, to find the total cost, I need to add the haircut cost and the tip: $25 plus $3.75.\n\n25 plus 3 is 28, and then plus 0.75 is 28.75. So, the total cost is $28.75.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. $28.75 matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total cost as the original amount plus 15%, which is the same as multiplying the original amount by 1.15.\n\nSo, 25 times 1.15 should also give us the total cost.\n\nLet's check: 25 times 1 is 25, and 25 times 0.15 is 3.75, added together is 28.75. Same result.\n\nI think D. $28.75 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
