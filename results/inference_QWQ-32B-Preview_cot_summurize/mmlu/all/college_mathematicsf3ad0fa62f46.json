                    "text": "Let's tackle this multiple-choice question about matrices and their traces. I need to determine which of the three statements are true. The options are:\n\nI. The trace of \\( A^2 \\) is nonnegative.\n\nII. If \\( A^2 = A \\), then the trace of \\( A \\) is nonnegative.\n\nIII. The trace of \\( AB \\) is the product of the traces of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. II only\n\nB. III only\n\nC. I and II only\n\nD. II and III only\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the trace of a matrix is. The trace of an \\( n \\times n \\) matrix is the sum of its diagonal entries. So, for a matrix \\( A = [a_{ij}] \\), the trace is \\( \\text{tr}(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} \\).\n\nLet's analyze each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement I: The trace of \\( A^2 \\) is nonnegative.**\n\nI need to check if \\( \\text{tr}(A^2) \\geq 0 \\) for any real matrix \\( A \\).\n\nLet's consider a simple example. Take \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then \\( A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), and \\( \\text{tr}(A^2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\), which is nonnegative.\n\nAnother example: \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then \\( A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), and \\( \\text{tr}(A^2) = 0 \\), which is also nonnegative.\n\nBut let's try another matrix: \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then \\( A^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), and \\( \\text{tr}(A^2) = -1 + (-1) = -2 \\), which is negative.\n\nSo, in this case, the trace of \\( A^2 \\) is negative. Therefore, statement I is not always true.\n\n**Statement II: If \\( A^2 = A \\), then the trace of \\( A \\) is nonnegative.**\n\nHere, \\( A \\) is an idempotent matrix since \\( A^2 = A \\). I need to check if \\( \\text{tr}(A) \\geq 0 \\) for such matrices.\n\nIdempotent matrices have eigenvalues that are either 0 or 1. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. Therefore, the trace of an idempotent matrix is equal to the number of eigenvalues that are 1, which is a nonnegative integer.\n\nHence, the trace of \\( A \\) is always nonnegative when \\( A^2 = A \\). So, statement II is true.\n\n**Statement III: The trace of \\( AB \\) is the product of the traces of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).**\n\nI need to check if \\( \\text{tr}(AB) = \\text{tr}(A) \\cdot \\text{tr}(B) \\) for any matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nLet's test this with some examples.\n\nTake \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then \\( AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), so \\( \\text{tr}(AB) = 2 \\), and \\( \\text{tr}(A) \\cdot \\text{tr}(B) = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4 \\). Here, \\( 2 \\neq 4 \\), so the statement doesn't hold.\n\nAnother example: \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\) and \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\). Then \\( AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), so \\( \\text{tr}(AB) = 0 \\), and \\( \\text{tr}(A) \\cdot \\text{tr}(B) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\). Again, \\( 0 \\neq 1 \\).\n\nIt seems that in these cases, the trace of the product is not equal to the product of the traces. Therefore, statement III is not true in general.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n\n- Statement I is false.\n\n- Statement II is true.\n\n- Statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. II only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
