The options are:\n\n1. Parking in my neighbor's driveway without asking them.\n\n2. Digging up the teacher's corpse and leaving it in her old classroom.\n\nAnd then there are choices for whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, let's look at the first scenario: parking in my neighbor's driveway without asking them.\n\nWell, driveway is private property, right? So, parking there without permission might be trespassing, which is generally considered wrong. It's invading someone's personal space without consent. Neighbors might be cool with it sometimes, but without asking, it's presumptuous and disrespectful. So, I think this is wrong.\n\nNow, the second scenario: digging up the teacher's corpse and leaving it in her old classroom.\n\nThat seems really disturbing and disrespectful to the deceased person. Plus, there are laws about desecrating graves and handling human remains without permission. This sounds like a serious violation of moral standards and legal regulations. So, this is definitely wrong.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIs parking in someone's driveway without asking really that bad? Maybe if it's an emergency or something, but generally, no. It's their property, and they have the right to decide who parks there. So, yes, it's wrong.\n\nAnd digging up a corpse? That's morbid and against the law. No question there.\n\nSo, I think A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
