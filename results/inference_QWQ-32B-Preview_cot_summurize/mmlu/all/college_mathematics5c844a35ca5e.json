                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have the set P, which consists of polynomials with coefficients in Z_5 (the integers modulo 5) and degrees less than or equal to 7. So, P is the vector space of polynomials of degree at most 7 over Z_5.\n\nThe operator D takes a polynomial p(x) in P and maps it to its derivative p'(x). We need to find the dimensions of the null space (n) and the range (r) of this operator D.\n\nFirst, let's recall some linear algebra concepts. The null space of D, denoted as null(D), is the set of all polynomials in P that get mapped to the zero polynomial by D. In other words, it's the set of polynomials whose derivatives are zero.\n\nThe range of D, denoted as range(D), is the set of all possible outputs of D, which are the derivatives of polynomials in P.\n\nWe also know that for any linear operator D from a vector space P to itself, the dimension of P is equal to the dimension of the null space plus the dimension of the range. This is known as the rank-nullity theorem.\n\nSo, dim(P) = n + r\n\nGiven that P is the space of polynomials of degree at most 7 over Z_5, its dimension is 8. Because a general polynomial in P can be written as:\n\np(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4 + a_5 x^5 + a_6 x^6 + a_7 x^7\n\nWhere each a_i is in Z_5, and the coefficients a_0 through a_7 are independent.\n\nTherefore, dim(P) = 8.\n\nNow, let's find the null space of D.\n\nnull(D) = { p(x) in P | D(p(x)) = p'(x) = 0 }\n\nSo, we need to find all polynomials in P whose derivative is the zero polynomial.\n\nRecall that the derivative of a constant is zero. In general, the derivative of x^n is n*x^{n-1}.\n\nBut we're working in Z_5, so coefficients are modulo 5.\n\nSo, for p'(x) to be zero, all coefficients of the derivative must be zero in Z_5.\n\nLet's consider a general polynomial p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_7 x^7\n\nThen, p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 0a_5 x^4 + 0a_6 x^5 + 0a_7 x^6\n\nWait, hold on. In Z_5, the coefficients are modulo 5.\n\nSo, 2a_2, 3a_3, 4a_4, then 5a_5 which is 0 in Z_5, since 5 \u2261 0 mod 5, similarly 6a_6 is also 0, and 7a_7 is 2a_7, but wait, 7 mod 5 is 2, but actually, 7 \u2261 2 mod 5, but 7a_7 x^6 would be 2a_7 x^6, but wait, no:\n\nWait, let's correct this.\n\nThe derivative of x^n is n*x^{n-1}.\n\nSo, p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 5a_5 x^4 + 6a_6 x^5 + 7a_7 x^6\n\nNow, reduce the coefficients modulo 5:\n\n2 remains 2\n\n3 remains 3\n\n4 remains 4\n\n5 \u2261 0 mod 5\n\n6 \u2261 1 mod 5\n\n7 \u2261 2 mod 5\n\nSo, p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 0a_5 x^4 + a_6 x^5 + 2a_7 x^6\n\nFor p'(x) to be the zero polynomial, all coefficients must be zero in Z_5:\n\na_1 = 0\n\n2a_2 = 0 \u21d2 a_2 = 0 (since 2 has an inverse in Z_5, which is 3, because 2*3=6\u22611 mod 5)\n\n3a_3 = 0 \u21d2 a_3 = 0 (3 has an inverse in Z_5, which is 2, since 3*2=6\u22611 mod 5)\n\n4a_4 = 0 \u21d2 a_4 = 0 (4 has an inverse in Z_5, which is 4, since 4*4=16\u22611 mod 5)\n\n0a_5 = 0 \u21d2 a_5 can be any element in Z_5 (since 0*a_5=0 always)\n\na_6 = 0 (from a_6 x^5 term)\n\n2a_7 = 0 \u21d2 a_7 = 0 (since 2 has an inverse in Z_5, as above)\n\nTherefore, the only polynomials in null(D) are those where a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_6 = a_7 = 0, and a_0 and a_5 can be any elements in Z_5.\n\nWait, a_0 is not constrained because it's the constant term, and its derivative is zero.\n\nSo, null(D) consists of polynomials of the form:\n\np(x) = a_0 + a_5 x^5\n\nWhere a_0, a_5 in Z_5.\n\nTherefore, null(D) is spanned by {1, x^5}, and these are linearly independent.\n\nHence, the dimension of null(D) is 2.\n\nSo, n = 2.\n\nNow, by the rank-nullity theorem:\n\ndim(P) = n + r\n\n8 = 2 + r\n\nTherefore, r = 6.\n\nSo, the dimensions are n = 2 and r = 6.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D matches this: n = 2 and r = 6.\n\nWait, but let's double-check to make sure.\n\nIs it possible that a_5 is not free? Let's re-examine the conditions for null(D).\n\nFrom p'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 0a_5 x^4 + a_6 x^5 + 2a_7 x^6 = 0\n\nThis implies:\n\na_1 = 0\n\n2a_2 = 0 \u21d2 a_2 = 0\n\n3a_3 = 0 \u21d2 a_3 = 0\n\n4a_4 = 0 \u21d2 a_4 = 0\n\na_6 = 0\n\n2a_7 = 0 \u21d2 a_7 = 0\n\nAnd 0a_5 = 0, which is always true, so a_5 can be anything in Z_5.\n\nAnd a_0 is not present in p'(x), so it's also free.\n\nTherefore, null(D) is indeed spanned by {1, x^5}, and n = 2.\n\nThen, r = 8 - 2 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the range of D.\n\nrange(D) consists of all possible derivatives of polynomials in P.\n\nGiven that p(x) in P has degree \u2264 7, p'(x) has degree \u2264 6.\n\nBut not all polynomials of degree \u2264 6 are in range(D), because the coefficients are constrained by the derivative operation.\n\nSpecifically, in p'(x), the coefficient of x^5 is a_6, and the coefficient of x^6 is 2a_7.\n\nBut in P, polynomials of degree \u2264 7 have coefficients up to x^7, but in range(D), the highest degree is x^6.\n\nWait, no, the derivative of x^7 is 7x^6, which is 2x^6 in Z_5.\n\nSo, range(D) consists of polynomials of degree \u2264 6, but with the coefficient of x^6 being twice the coefficient of x^7 in the original polynomial.\n\nBut actually, since a_7 can be any element in Z_5, and 2 is invertible in Z_5, the coefficient of x^6 in p'(x) can be any element in Z_5.\n\nWait, 2 is invertible in Z_5, with inverse 3, since 2*3=6\u22611 mod 5.\n\nTherefore, for any coefficient c in Z_5 for x^6, we can find a_7 = 3c, because 2*(3c) = 6c \u2261 c mod 5.\n\nWait, 2*3=6\u22611 mod 5, so 2*(3c)=3c mod 5, which is not c unless c=0 or c=3.\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, 2*(3c)=6c\u2261c mod 5, because 6\u22611 mod 5.\n\nSo, 2*(3c)=1* c mod 5.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, 2*(3c)=6c\u2261c mod 5, because 6-5=1.\n\nSo, yes, 2*(3c)=c mod 5.\n\nTherefore, for any c in Z_5, choosing a_7=3c will make 2a_7=2*(3c)=c mod 5.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^6 in p'(x) can be any c in Z_5.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of x^5 is a_6, which can be any element in Z_5.\n\nAnd so on for lower degrees.\n\nTherefore, range(D) is the space of polynomials of degree \u2264 6 with coefficients in Z_5.\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, but in p'(x), the coefficient of x^5 is a_6, which can be any element in Z_5, and the coefficient of x^6 is 2a_7, which, as we saw, can also be any element in Z_5.\n\nSimilarly, the coefficients of lower degrees are determined by the higher degree coefficients in p(x).\n\nTherefore, range(D) is indeed the space of all polynomials of degree \u2264 6 over Z_5.\n\nTherefore, dim(range(D)) = 7.\n\nWait, but earlier, by rank-nullity, we have r = 6.\n\nBut according to this, dim(range(D))=7.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nWait, what's going on here?\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nGiven that p(x) in P has degree \u22647, p'(x) has degree \u22646.\n\nBut not all polynomials of degree \u22646 are in range(D).\n\nFor example, consider x^4.\n\nIs there a p(x) in P such that p'(x)=x^4?\n\nWell, if p(x)= (1/5) x^5, then p'(x)=x^4.\n\nBut we're in Z_5, where 1/5 is not defined, since 5\u22610 mod 5.\n\nWait, in Z_5, 5=0, so 1/5 is undefined.\n\nTherefore, there is no p(x) in P such that p'(x)=x^4.\n\nWait, but let's think differently.\n\nSuppose p(x)=a x^5.\n\nThen p'(x)=5 a x^4=0 x^4=0.\n\nBecause 5\u22610 mod 5.\n\nTherefore, x^4 is not in range(D), because there is no p(x) in P with p'(x)=x^4.\n\nTherefore, range(D) is not all of the space of polynomials of degree \u22646.\n\nSo, what is range(D)?\n\nFrom p'(x)=a_1 + 2a_2 x + 3a_3 x^2 + 4a_4 x^3 + 0a_5 x^4 + a_6 x^5 + 2a_7 x^6\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^4 is zero.\n\nTherefore, range(D) consists of all polynomials of degree \u22646 where the coefficient of x^4 is zero.\n\nTherefore, range(D) is the space of polynomials of degree \u22646 with the x^4 term missing.\n\nTherefore, a basis for range(D) is {1, x, x^2, x^3, x^5, x^6}, since x^4 is missing.\n\nTherefore, dim(range(D))=6.\n\nThis matches with the rank-nullity theorem, since dim(P)=8, n=2, so r=6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D: n=2 and r=6.\n\nEarlier, I mistakenly thought that range(D) was all polynomials of degree \u22646, which would have dimension 7, but that's not the case because the coefficient of x^4 is always zero in p'(x), since the derivative of x^5 is 5x^4=0 in Z_5.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of range(D) is 6.\n\nSo, the final answer is D."
