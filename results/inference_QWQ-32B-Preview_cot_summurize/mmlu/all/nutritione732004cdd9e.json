According to their reports, in 2016, an estimated 13% of the world's adult population was obese. This percentage has been increasing, and as of recent estimates, it's closer to 15%. However, it's important to note that these statistics can vary based on different sources and the specific definitions used for obesity. So, considering the options provided:\n\nA. 11% - This seems a bit low based on recent data.\n\nB. 13% - This was a figure from around 2016.\n\nC. 15% - This might be closer to current estimates.\n\nD. 39% - This seems too high; it's likely the percentage of overweight and obese combined, or perhaps a regional statistic.\n\nGiven this information, the most accurate answer would probably be C. 15%. However, for the most precise and up-to-date information, it's always best to refer to the latest publications from health organizations like the WHO or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)."
