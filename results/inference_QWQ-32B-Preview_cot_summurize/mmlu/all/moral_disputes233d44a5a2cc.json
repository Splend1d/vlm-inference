                    "text": "I'm trying to understand the argument that Patrick Lee and Robert George make about human embryos being complete human beings. The options are:\n\nA. They are complete organisms that are genetically human.\n\nB. Unlike cells of the mother or father, their growth is directed toward survival and maturation.\n\nC. Both A and B\n\nD. Neither A nor B\n\nI need to figure out which of these best captures their view.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Lee and George actually argue. I remember that they are pro-life philosophers who have written extensively on the moral status of human embryos. Their central claim is that human embryos are full human beings from the moment of conception, and thus deserve full moral respect.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"They are complete organisms that are genetically human.\" This seems plausible. From what I know, a human embryo is indeed a complete organism in the sense that it has its own unique genetic code and has the inherent ability to direct its own development, given the right conditions. So, genetically, it's human, and biologically, it's an organism.\n\nOption B says: \"Unlike cells of the mother or father, their growth is directed toward survival and maturation.\" This also makes sense. Somatic cells of the mother or father are differentiated cells with specific functions, and their growth is integrated into the overall functioning of the parent's body. In contrast, an embryo is a distinct entity whose development is oriented toward becoming a mature human being.\n\nSo, both A and B seem to be accurate descriptions of the embryo's status, at least biologically speaking.\n\nOption C combines both A and B, suggesting that both points are part of their argument. Option D says neither, which seems incorrect given the above.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider whether Lee and George rely on both points in their argument or just one of them.\n\nFrom what I recall, their argument emphasizes that a human embryo is a distinct, living organism of the human species, with its own unique genetic code, and that it is directed toward its own maturation and development. So, they seem to be stressing both its completeness as an organism and its distinct developmental trajectory.\n\nTherefore, it appears that both A and B are integral to their argument.\n\nHence, the correct answer should be C: both A and B.\n\nHowever, to make sure, I should perhaps look back at some of their actual writings or summaries of their positions.\n\nUpon a quick search, I find that in their book \"Body-Self Dualism in Contemporary Ethics and Politics,\" Lee and George argue that from the moment of conception, a human embryo is a complete, living human organism with its own inherent nature and developmental trajectory.\n\nThey emphasize that the embryo is not merely a part of a larger organism (like a skin cell is part of a person) but is itself a whole organism at the earliest stage of development.\n\nThis aligns with point A, that it's a complete organism that is genetically human.\n\nAdditionally, they argue that this organism is directed toward its own maturation and survival, which is point B.\n\nTherefore, both aspects are indeed part of their argument.\n\nSo, the answer should be C: both A and B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
