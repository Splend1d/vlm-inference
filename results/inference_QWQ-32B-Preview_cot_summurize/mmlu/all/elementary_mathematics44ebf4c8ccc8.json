                    "text": "So Katie is going on vacation for 3 weeks, and she wants to find out how many days of work she'll miss. She decides to multiply 5 by 3 because there are 5 weekdays in a week, right? So, 5 days times 3 weeks equals 15 days she'll miss at work.\n\nNow, the question is asking for another way to find the same number of days. It's asking for an expression that equals the same as 5 multiplied by 3.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. 3 + 5\n\nB. 3 + 3 + 3\n\nC. 5 + 5 + 5\n\nD. 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5\n\nFirst, let's see what each option equals.\n\nOption A: 3 + 5 = 8\n\nBut 5 times 3 is 15, so 8 is not equal to 15. So, A is not the answer.\n\nOption B: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n\nAgain, 9 is not equal to 15, so B is not correct.\n\nOption C: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15\n\nOh, that equals 15, which is the same as 5 times 3.\n\nOption D: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 25\n\nThat's 25, which is more than 15, so D is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the expression that shows another way Katie can find the number of days of work she will miss is option C: 5 + 5 + 5.\n\nThis makes sense because adding 5 three times is the same as multiplying 5 by 3.\n\nSo, the answer is C."
