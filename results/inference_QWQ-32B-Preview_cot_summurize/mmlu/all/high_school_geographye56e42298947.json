                    "text": "Let's see what zero population growth means. I think it's when the population isn't increasing or decreasing, right? So, it's stable. That probably means that the number of people being added through births and immigration is equal to the number of people being removed through deaths and emigration.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. CBR \u2013 CDR \u2265 2.\n\nCBR is crude birth rate, and CDR is crude death rate. So, CBR - CDR is the difference between birth and death rates. If this difference is greater than or equal to 2, that means there are at least 2 more births than deaths per thousand population. That seems like it would lead to population growth, not zero growth. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nB. Births + immigration = deaths + emigration.\n\nThis looks promising. It's saying that the number of people added through births and immigration is equal to the number of people lost through deaths and emigration. That would balance out, resulting in no net change in population size. This seems like it could be the definition of zero population growth.\n\nC. Total fertility = 3.\n\nTotal fertility rate is the average number of children a woman has during her lifetime. If it's 3, that means on average, each woman has 3 children. In many developed countries, the replacement fertility rate is around 2.1, meaning that a total fertility rate of 3 is above replacement level, which would lead to population growth. So, this doesn't sound like zero population growth.\n\nD. Replacement fertility is achieved.\n\nReplacement fertility is when the total fertility rate is such that each generation replaces itself without increasing or decreasing in number. In many places, this is around 2.1 children per woman, accounting for some deaths before childbearing age. If replacement fertility is achieved, that should lead to zero population growth in the long run, assuming other factors like immigration are constant.\n\nWait a minute, both options B and D seem plausible. Option B is more specific about births, deaths, immigration, and emigration, while option D focuses on fertility rates.\n\nBut zero population growth is generally associated with the balance between births and deaths, considering migration as well. So, option B seems more comprehensive because it includes both births, deaths, and migration.\n\nOption D, replacement fertility, is important, but it doesn't account for migration. If there's significant immigration or emigration, population growth could still occur even if fertility is at replacement level.\n\nFor example, if a country has replacement fertility but also has high immigration, the population could still grow due to the added immigrants.\n\nTherefore, option B seems like the most accurate definition of zero population growth because it takes into account all the factors that affect population size: births, deaths, immigration, and emigration.\n\nOption A doesn't make sense in this context, and option C is actually indicating population growth.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
