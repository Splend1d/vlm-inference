During the physical exam, the doctor found a 1-centimeter mass visible near his anus, specifically below the dentate line. They're going to do a biopsy to see if it's malignant or not. If it turns out to be cancerous, I need to figure out which lymph nodes to check for possible spread, or metastasis.\n\nFirst, I need to understand a bit about the anatomy here. The dentate line is an important landmark in the anal canal. It's where the lower part of the rectum transitions into the anal canal. Above the dentate line is considered part of the internal anal canal, and below it is the external part. The type of tissue and the blood supply differ on either side of this line.\n\nThe mass is located below the dentate line, which means it's in the external part of the anal canal. If this mass is malignant, I need to think about how cancer spreads through lymphatic channels.\n\nLymphatic drainage from the anal canal depends on its location relative to the dentate line. Generally:\n\n- Above the dentate line, the lymphatics drain to the internal iliac lymph nodes.\n\n- Below the dentate line, the lymphatics drain to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.\n\nGiven that the mass is below the dentate line, if it's malignant, the most likely lymph nodes to check for metastasis would be the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.\n\nLet me double-check the options provided:\n\nA. Internal iliac\n\nB. Popliteal\n\nC. Sacral\n\nD. Superficial inguinal\n\nOption A, internal iliac, is more associated with areas above the dentate line.\n\nOption B, popliteal, is in the knee area, which doesn't make sense for anal cancer.\n\nOption C, sacral, could be involved in some cases, but for a mass below the dentate line, it's less likely to be the first choice.\n\nOption D, superficial inguinal, aligns with what I recall about lymphatic drainage below the dentate line.\n\nI think the best answer is D, superficial inguinal lymph nodes.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider the specific anatomy again. The dentate line is roughly at the level of the anal sphincters. Below it, the tissue is innervated by somatic nerves and drains into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. Above it, it's innervated by visceral nerves and drains to the internal iliac nodes.\n\nSince the mass is below the dentate line, it's more likely to drain into the superficial inguinal nodes.\n\nI don't think popliteal or sacral nodes would be the first choice for metastasis in this scenario.\n\nSo, I'm confident that D, superficial inguinal lymph nodes, is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
