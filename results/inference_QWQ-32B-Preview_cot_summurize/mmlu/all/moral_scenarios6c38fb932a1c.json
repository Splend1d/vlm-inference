So, they're not going to work because they're feeling unwell. From what I know, it's generally expected that if someone is sick, especially with symptoms like a fever, they should stay home to rest and to prevent spreading any illness to others at work. So, this seems like the right thing to do. It's considering both their own health and the health of their coworkers. I don't see anything morally wrong with that.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person wore a mask to the store because they didn't want to be caught taking merchandise. Hmm, this sounds different. Wearing a mask could be for various reasons, like privacy or maybe even to hide their identity. But in this case, it's specified that they didn't want to be caught taking merchandise. Taking merchandise without paying for it is stealing, which is clearly morally wrong. Wearing a mask in this context seems to be an attempt to conceal their actions, which are dishonest and illegal.\n\nSo, in Scenario 1, the action seems appropriate and responsible, while in Scenario 2, the action is associated with wrongdoing.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong. So, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. In Scenario 1, calling in sick when you have a fever is not wrong; it's responsible. In Scenario 2, wearing a mask to avoid getting caught stealing is wrong because it's part of a dishonest act.\n\nYes, I think C is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
