                    "text": "So I've got this passage from Kwame Nkrumah, the Ghanian leader, from 1961. He's talking about Africa and its role in the world, especially in terms of peace and unity. Let me try to understand what he's saying here.\n\nFirst, he mentions that Africa's greatest contribution to world peace is to avoid the dangers of disunity by creating a political union. So, he's emphasizing the importance of unity among African states. He believes that by uniting, Africa can set an example for the rest of the world, which is divided.\n\nHe also says that a union of African states would better project the African personality and command respect from the world, which seems to value size and influence. This suggests that he thinks unity would give Africa more clout on the global stage.\n\nThen, he points to two specific examples: the scant attention paid to African opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the United Nations' focus on constitutional technicalities in the Congo while the republic was falling into anarchy. These examples illustrate what he sees as the callous disregard of African independence by the great powers.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like Nkrumah is advocating for African unity as a way to increase Africa's standing and respect in the world, and to counter the disregard he perceives from the great powers.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Responses to failed unification attempts in Africa\n\nWell, he's proposing unity, but the question is whether this is a response to failed attempts. The passage doesn't mention any failed attempts; it's more about proposing unity as a solution to current issues.\n\nB. A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa\n\nActually, his examples suggest disappointment with the UN's handling of situations in Africa. He mentions the UN quibbling over constitutional niceties while the Congo was falling into anarchy, which seems critical of the UN's approach. So, it doesn't look like a plea for the UN to intervene; rather, it might be a critique of the UN's actions.\n\nC. A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world\n\nThis seems closely aligned with what he's saying. He wants Africa to have more respect and influence, which a political union would provide. This option appears to capture his main point.\n\nD. Ardent opposition to the influence of capitalism in Africa\n\nThere's no mention of capitalism in the passage. He's talking about unity and the respect Africa can gain from the world, but doesn't specifically address capitalism or any economic system.\n\nSo, between the options, C seems the most fitting. He's proposing unity as a way to increase Africa's standing and respect in the world.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any hint of responses to failed unification attempts? Not that I can see; he's proposing unity as a future goal, not reacting to past failures.\n\nIs he pleading with the UN to intervene? No, quite the opposite; he seems critical of the UN's approach.\n\nAnd capitalism isn't mentioned at all.\n\nTherefore, C appears to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
