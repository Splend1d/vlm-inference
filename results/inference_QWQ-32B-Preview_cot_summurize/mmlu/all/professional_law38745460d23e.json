                    "text": "In the United States, when there is a conflict between a congressional act and a valid treaty, the general principle is that the last in time prevails. This means that whichever was enacted or ratified most recently will take precedence over the other. So, in this case, the correct answer would be C. The last in time prevails.\n\nTo provide more context, both congressional acts and treaties are part of the law of the land in the U.S., and they can sometimes come into conflict with each other. The U.S. Constitution establishes that treaties are the supreme law of the land, equally with Acts of Congress. However, when there is a direct conflict between a treaty and a congressional act, the principle of \"last in time\" is often applied by courts to resolve the issue.\n\nThis principle is based on the idea that the most recent expression of the legislative will should govern. Therefore, if Congress passes a law after a treaty has been ratified, the congressional act would prevail, and vice versa if a new treaty is ratified after the congressional act.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a general rule, and there may be exceptions depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the conflict. Additionally, the executive branch plays a role in negotiating and ratifying treaties, but ultimately, it is up to the courts to interpret and apply the law in cases of conflict.\n\nSo, to summarize, the answer is C. The last in time prevails.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
