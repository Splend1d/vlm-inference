                    "text": "I have this case here about a 23-year-old woman who has bone marrow failure and was treated with a large dose of rabbit antithymocyte globulin. Ten days after treatment, she develops fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on her hands and feet. I need to figure out which of the options is most likely causing these symptoms.\n\nFirst, let's understand what antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is. ATG is a type of immunosuppressive therapy often used in bone marrow transplantations or to treat immune disorders like bone marrow failure. It contains antibodies against thymus cells, particularly thymocytes, which are immature T-lymphocytes. By targeting these cells, ATG helps suppress the immune system, which can be beneficial in preventing graft-versus-host disease or treating autoimmune conditions.\n\nHowever, like any medication, ATG can have side effects. One common side effect is serum sickness, which is an immune complex disease that occurs when foreign proteins or antigens are introduced into the body, triggering an immune response that leads to the formation of immune complexes. These complexes can deposit in various tissues, causing inflammation and the symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Cytokine secretion by natural killer cells\n\nNatural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and can secrete cytokines like interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. While cytokines play a role in inflammation, the symptoms described here seem more consistent with immune complex deposition, which is typical of serum sickness.\n\nB. Eosinophil degranulation\n\nEosinophils are white blood cells that play a role in allergic reactions and parasitic infections. Their degranulation can cause tissue damage and inflammation, but the symptoms in this case don't strongly suggest an allergic reaction or parasitic infection.\n\nC. Immune complex deposition in tissues\n\nThis aligns closely with the concept of serum sickness, which is a known complication of ATG therapy. The administration of foreign proteins (from rabbits in this case) can lead to the formation of immune complexes that deposit in various tissues, causing fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and skin rashes like erythema.\n\nD. Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation\n\nWhile ATG is intended to suppress T-lymphocyte function, sometimes it can have paradoxical effects, especially if there is an immune response against the foreign antibodies in the ATG. However, the symptoms described are more consistent with immune complex disease rather than direct T-lymphocyte activation.\n\nGiven this information, I think the most likely cause of her symptoms is immune complex deposition in tissues, which is option C. This is typical of serum sickness, a known reaction to the administration of exogenous proteins like those in ATG.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
