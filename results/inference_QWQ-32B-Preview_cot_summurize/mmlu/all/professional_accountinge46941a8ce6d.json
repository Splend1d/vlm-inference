                    "text": "So I've got this investment project to evaluate. It costs $500 today, and it's going to generate profits of $500 in year five and again in year ten. The discount rate is 10%. I need to find out the Net Present Value (NPV) of this project. The options are A. -$3, B. -$27, C. $3, or D. $500. I think I know how to calculate NPV, but I want to make sure I'm doing it right.\n\nFirst, NPV is the sum of the present values of all future cash flows minus the initial investment. So, in this case, the initial investment is -$500 (since it's a cost), and the future cash flows are $500 in year five and $500 in year ten.\n\nTo find the present value of these future cash flows, I need to discount them back to today using the discount rate of 10%.\n\nThe formula for the present value (PV) of a future cash flow is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{CF}{(1 + r)^t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( CF \\) is the cash flow,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate, and\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in years.\n\nSo, for the cash flow in year five:\n\n\\[ PV_5 = \\frac{500}{(1 + 0.10)^5} \\]\n\nAnd for the cash flow in year ten:\n\n\\[ PV_{10} = \\frac{500}{(1 + 0.10)^{10}} \\]\n\nThen, the NPV would be:\n\n\\[ NPV = PV_5 + PV_{10} - 500 \\]\n\nI need to calculate these values step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (1 + 0.10)^5 \\):\n\n\\[ (1.10)^5 = 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\]\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n\\[ 1.10 \\times 1.10 = 1.21 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.21 \\times 1.10 = 1.331 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.331 \\times 1.10 = 1.4641 \\]\n\n\\[ 1.4641 \\times 1.10 = 1.61051 \\]\n\nSo, \\( (1.10)^5 = 1.61051 \\)\n\nNow, \\( PV_5 = \\frac{500}{1.61051} \\)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ PV_5 = 500 \\div 1.61051 \\approx 310.46 \\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( (1 + 0.10)^{10} \\):\n\n\\[ (1.10)^{10} = 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\times 1.10 \\]\n\nI already have \\( (1.10)^5 = 1.61051 \\), so \\( (1.10)^{10} = (1.61051)^2 \\)\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[ 1.61051 \\times 1.61051 = 2.5937424601 \\]\n\nSo, \\( (1.10)^{10} \\approx 2.5937 \\)\n\nNow, \\( PV_{10} = \\frac{500}{2.5937} \\approx 192.77 \\)\n\nNow, sum the present values and subtract the initial investment:\n\n\\[ NPV = 310.46 + 192.77 - 500 = 503.23 - 500 = 3.23 \\]\n\nSo, the NPV is approximately $3.23, which rounds to $3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is $3, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, verifying \\( (1.10)^5 = 1.61051 \\) seems correct.\n\nThen, \\( PV_5 = 500 / 1.61051 = 310.46 \\) looks good.\n\nNext, \\( (1.10)^{10} = 2.5937 \\) seems accurate.\n\nThen, \\( PV_{10} = 500 / 2.5937 = 192.77 \\) is correct.\n\nSumming them up: 310.46 + 192.77 = 503.23\n\nSubtracting the initial investment: 503.23 - 500 = 3.23, which rounds to $3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. $3.\n\nHowever, the options include both positive and negative values. Since my calculation shows a positive $3, and option C is $3, that should be the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possibility of a negative NPV.\n\nIf I made a mistake in calculating the present values or in the subtraction, it could lead to a different result.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n\\[ PV_5 = \\frac{500}{1.10^5} = \\frac{500}{1.61051} = 310.46 \\]\n\n\\[ PV_{10} = \\frac{500}{1.10^{10}} = \\frac{500}{2.5937} = 192.77 \\]\n\n\\[ NPV = 310.46 + 192.77 - 500 = 503.23 - 500 = 3.23 \\]\n\nYes, it's consistently $3.23, which rounds to $3.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. $3.\n\nBut the question includes an option of -$3, which might suggest that there's a possibility of a slight negative value due to rounding differences, but in my calculation, it's clearly positive.\n\nMaybe in some cases, depending on how the discounting is applied, it could be slightly different, but based on standard NPV calculation, $3 seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
