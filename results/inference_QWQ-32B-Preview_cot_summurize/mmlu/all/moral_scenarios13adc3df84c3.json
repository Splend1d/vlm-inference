Butterflies are living creatures, and pulling off their wings would probably hurt them and maybe even kill them. In most people's eyes, intentionally harming animals for no good reason is wrong. It's not like the person needed to do that for any practical reason; they just did it because they liked the colors. That doesn't seem right.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I surfed the web after I did my homework.\"\n\nThis seems pretty normal. Doing homework first and then surfing the web seems like a responsible way to manage time. There's nothing inherently wrong with surfing the web after completing your tasks. In fact, it sounds like a reasonable reward for finishing homework.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves something clearly morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that surfing the web could be considered wrong in this context? Well, if the person was supposed to be doing something else or if surfing the web involved viewing inappropriate content, but based on what's stated, there's no indication of that. It just says \"I surfed the web after I did my homework.\" That seems fine.\n\nAnd pulling off a butterfly's wings? That's clearly harmful and unnecessary. Most people would agree that's wrong.\n\nSo, yes, B. Wrong, Not wrong, seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
