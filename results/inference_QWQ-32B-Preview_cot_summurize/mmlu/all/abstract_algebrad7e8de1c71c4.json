                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to determine whether each statement is true or false, and then choose the correct option from A to D.\n\n**Statement 1:** For finite groups G and H, |G + H| = |G||H|. (G + H is the internal direct product.)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an internal direct product is. The internal direct product of two subgroups G and H of a group K is a way to express K as the combination of G and H, where every element of K can be uniquely expressed as a product of an element from G and an element from H, and G and H have only the identity element in common.\n\nSo, if G and H are subgroups of K and K is the internal direct product of G and H, then K \u2245 G \u00d7 H, where \u00d7 denotes the external direct product.\n\nIn this case, the order of K should be equal to the product of the orders of G and H, assuming G and H have trivial intersection (only the identity element in common).\n\nWait, but the statement says \"G + H\" is the internal direct product. I think this might be a notation issue. In some texts, the internal direct product is denoted by G \u00d7 H, while in others, it might be denoted by G + H, especially if the group operation is additive.\n\nAssuming that G + H represents the internal direct product, and G and H are finite groups with trivial intersection, then indeed |G + H| = |G||H|.\n\nBut I should confirm if G and H are required to have trivial intersection for this to hold.\n\nLet me think about it. If G and H have a nontrivial intersection, say |G \u2229 H| > 1, then the order of their product wouldn't simply be |G||H|, because there would be overlapping elements.\n\nWait, but in the definition of an internal direct product, it's a necessary condition that G and H have trivial intersection, meaning G \u2229 H = {e}, where e is the identity element.\n\nSo, under the assumption that G + H is an internal direct product, it implies that G and H have trivial intersection, and hence |G + H| = |G||H|.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\n**Statement 2:** If r divides m and s divides n then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the notation here. Z_m and Z_n are cyclic groups of orders m and n, respectively. The \"+\" symbol might be referring to the direct sum, which is analogous to the direct product for abelian groups.\n\nSo, Z_m + Z_n is likely the direct sum of Z_m and Z_n, which is isomorphic to Z_m \u00d7 Z_n.\n\nNow, the statement says that if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_m + Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s.\n\nIn other words, if r | m and s | n, then Z_m \u00d7 Z_n has a subgroup that is isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\nSince r divides m, Z_m has a subgroup of order r, because in a cyclic group of order m, there is a unique subgroup of order d for each divisor d of m.\n\nSimilarly, since s divides n, Z_n has a subgroup of order s.\n\nLet\u2019s denote these subgroups as H \u2264 Z_m with |H| = r, and K \u2264 Z_n with |K| = s.\n\nThen, the direct product H \u00d7 K is a subgroup of Z_m \u00d7 Z_n, and |H \u00d7 K| = |H| |K| = r s.\n\nMoreover, H \u00d7 K is isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s, because H is isomorphic to Z_r and K is isomorphic to Z_s.\n\nTherefore, Z_m \u00d7 Z_n has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider if Z_m \u00d7 Z_n always has a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r \u00d7 Z_s under the given conditions.\n\nLet me think of an example to verify.\n\nTake m = 4, n = 6.\n\nThen Z_4 \u00d7 Z_6.\n\nLet r = 2 (which divides 4), and s = 2 (which divides 6).\n\nDoes Z_4 \u00d7 Z_6 have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2?\n\nYes, for example, take the subgroup generated by (2, 0) and (0, 3), which have orders 2 and 2, respectively, and their orders are coprime, so the subgroup they generate is isomorphic to Z_2 \u00d7 Z_2.\n\nAnother example: m = 6, n = 9, r = 3 (divides 6), s = 3 (divides 9).\n\nDoes Z_6 \u00d7 Z_9 have a subgroup isomorphic to Z_3 \u00d7 Z_3?\n\nYes, take the subgroup generated by (2, 0) and (0, 3), which have orders 3 and 3, respectively.\n\nSo, in both examples, the statement holds.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nGiven that both statements are true, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
