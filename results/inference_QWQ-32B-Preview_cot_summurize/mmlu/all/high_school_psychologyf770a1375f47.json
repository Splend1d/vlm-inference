So, Brittany received address stickers from a charity through the mail, and after using them, she felt like she had to send a donation back to that organization. The question is asking which psychological concept this behavior best illustrates.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. stereotyping\n\nB. the fundamental attribution error\n\nC. the mere exposure effect\n\nD. the reciprocity norm\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA. Stereotyping is when people categorize others into groups and assign certain characteristics to everyone in that group, regardless of individual differences. For example, thinking all teenagers are irresponsible.\n\nB. The fundamental attribution error is when people overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors in explaining others' behavior. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a rude person, rather than considering they might be in a hurry or not paying attention.\n\nC. The mere exposure effect is when people develop a preference for things simply because they are familiar with them. For example, you might like a particular song more just because you've heard it many times.\n\nD. The reciprocity norm is a social rule that suggests people should respond to positive actions with other positive actions. In other words, if someone does something nice for you, you feel obligated to do something nice back for them.\n\nNow, let's think about Brittany's situation. She received stickers from a charity, used them, and then felt obliged to send a donation back. What's connecting the dots here?\n\nWell, the charity sent her something (the stickers), which was a positive action. In response, Brittany felt obligated to reciprocate with a positive action of her own (sending a donation). This sounds a lot like the reciprocity norm.\n\nLet me double-check by considering the other options.\n\nA. Stereotyping doesn't seem relevant here. There's no indication that Brittany is categorizing the charity or anyone else based on group characteristics.\n\nB. The fundamental attribution error also doesn't fit. There's no mention of Brittany attributing the charity's actions to their personality rather than situational factors.\n\nC. The mere exposure effect might be a stretch. While Brittany did become familiar with the charity through receiving the stickers, the main point is that she felt obligated to give back after using their stickers, which is more about reciprocity than just familiarity.\n\nSo, it seems like the reciprocity norm is the most appropriate answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
