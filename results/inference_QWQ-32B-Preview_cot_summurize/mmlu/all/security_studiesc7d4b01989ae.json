In light of the difficulties Western democracies have - sustaining popular support in conflicts not threatening their vital interests - opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff. In practice this means that the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.\nB. To maximize credibility a threat of quick defeat backed by the required military capability is insufficient. A deadline of compliance must accompany it. It follows that a failure to set a deadline for compliance will be interrelated as evidence that the coercer lacks the will to implement the threat.\nC. Assurance against new demands must be included to enhance the prospects of success. The incentive to comply will be significantly reduced if fears are justifiably present.\nD. All of these options. To make non-compliance too costly the coercer must threaten to defeat the adversary to deny him his objectives quickly and with little costs. The threat is designed to accomplish two things: fear of unacceptable escalation; to make the threat credible.\n"

                    "text": "The Ideal Policy framework, as proposed by Alexander George, provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the necessary conditions for successful coercive diplomacy actions. It synthesizes and builds upon previous understandings in the field, offering a structured way to analyze and improve the effectiveness of such strategies. Let's examine how the framework addresses the points you've mentioned.\n\nOption A highlights the challenges Western democracies face in sustaining public support for conflicts that do not directly threaten their vital interests. This is a crucial aspect because the credibility of threats in coercive diplomacy is heavily dependent on the perceived resolve of the coercer. If the opponent believes that the coercer is bluffing due to domestic constraints, the threats lose their effectiveness. Therefore, the coercer must demonstrate both military superiority and the political will to follow through on their threats, even in the face of potential public opposition.\n\nOption B emphasizes the importance of setting clear deadlines for compliance. According to the Ideal Policy framework, a well-structured threat should include not only the potential for quick defeat but also a specific timeframe for the adversary to respond. The absence of a deadline can be interpreted as a lack of resolve or clarity in the coercer's intentions, thereby undermining the credibility of the threat. A deadline adds a sense of urgency and specificity, making the threat more credible and pressing for the adversary.\n\nOption C introduces the concept of assurance against new demands, which is essential for enhancing the prospects of success in coercive diplomacy. If the adversary fears that compliance will lead to further demands or punishment, they are likely to resist the initial threat. Therefore, the coercer must provide credible assurances that compliance will lead to the cessation of pressure and the normalization of relations, thereby reducing the adversary's incentives to continue resisting.\n\nOption D suggests that all of these elements are interconnected and necessary for the success of coercive diplomacy. The Ideal Policy framework indeed integrates these components, recognizing that military superiority, clear deadlines, and assurances against future demands are all vital for constructing a credible and effective threat.\n\nIn summary, the Ideal Policy framework explains previous understandings by incorporating these necessary conditions into a cohesive strategy. It underscores the importance of military capability, political will, clear communication through deadlines, and credible assurances to maximize the likelihood of successful coercive diplomacy. By addressing each of these aspects, the framework provides a robust guide for practitioners and scholars alike in evaluating and implementing coercive diplomacy actions.\n\n**References:**\n\n- Alexander L.
