I answer, the rule of liberty that all just government derives its authority from the consent of the governed, applies only to those who are capable of self-government. We govern the Indians without their consent, we govern our territories without their consent, we govern our children without their consent. How do they know that our government would be without their consent? Would not the people of the Philippines prefer the just, human, civilizing government of this Republic to the savage, bloody rule of pillage and extortion from which we have rescued them? And, regardless of this formula of words made only for enlightened, self-governing people, do we owe no duty to the world? Shall we turn these peoples back to the reeking hands from which we have taken them? Shall we abandon them, with Germany, England, Japan, hungering for them? Shall we save them from those nations, to give them a self-rule of tragedy?\u2026Then, like men and not like children, let us on to our tasks, our mission, and our destiny.\"\nAlbert J.

                    "text": "So I've got this quote from Albert J. Beveridge in 1898, and he's talking about governing people without their consent, especially in the context of the Philippines. He mentions that certain groups, like Indians, territories, and children, are governed without their consent because they're not capable of self-government. He also argues that the U.S. should keep governing the Philippines because other powers like Germany, England, and Japan are eager to get their hands on them.\n\nThe question is asking which of the following sentiments this best exemplifies: imperialism, anti-imperialism, isolationism, or manifest destiny.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nImperialism is when a country extends its influence over other countries, often by acquiring colonies or through economic and political control. It's about expanding a nation's power and prestige.\n\nAnti-imperialism is the opposition to imperialism, arguing against the expansion of a country's power and influence over others.\n\nIsolationism is a foreign policy where a country avoids entanglements and alliances with other nations, focusing on its own affairs.\n\nManifest destiny was a belief that the U.S. was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It was a doctrine used to justify expansion and often associated with the 19th century.\n\nLooking back at Beveridge's speech, he's defending the idea of governing the Philippines without their consent, comparing it to how the U.S. governs its territories and Indian reservations. He justifies this by saying that these peoples aren't capable of self-government, implying that the U.S. is acting in their best interest by ruling them.\n\nHe also mentions that turning the Philippines over to other powers like Germany, England, or Japan would be detrimental, suggesting that the U.S. has a responsibility to keep governing them to prevent worse outcomes.\n\nThis sounds a lot like imperialism\u2014expanding U.S. control over other territories and peoples, even if they don't consent to it, under the guise of bringing civilization and good governance.\n\nHe doesn't seem to be arguing against imperialism, so anti-imperialism can be ruled out. Isolationism is about avoiding foreign entanglements, but Beveridge is advocating for continued U.S. involvement in the Philippines, so that doesn't fit either.\n\nManifest destiny was primarily about expanding across the North American continent, but the Philippines are in Asia, so that seems less applicable, although some people did extend the idea of manifest destiny to include overseas territories.\n\nGiven that, imperialism seems to be the best fit for Beveridge's sentiment in this speech.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
