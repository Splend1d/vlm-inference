                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this lawsuit where a construction company is suing the city because the city didn't pay them after they finished some sewer repair work. At trial, the company wants to have their construction supervisor testify about things like how much pipe they used, how many hours it took, and how many workers were involved. But the city's lawyer is objecting, saying that the company keeps all this information in their log books, which are right there in the company's possession. So, the question is, should the supervisor's testimony be allowed or not?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Admissible, because it's based on firsthand knowledge.\n\nWell, the supervisor did oversee the work, so he probably does have firsthand knowledge about these details. But the city's lawyer is pointing out that this information is recorded in log books. So, maybe there's a better way to present this evidence.\n\nB. Admissible, because it's a report of regularly conducted business activities.\n\nHmm, that sounds like it might be related to business records exception to hearsay. If the log books are part of the company's regular record-keeping, maybe the records themselves could be admitted, or the supervisor could testify about them.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.\n\nThe best evidence rule generally requires that to prove the content of a writing, the original writing should be produced. If there's a writing that contains the information the witness is testifying about, and that writing is available, maybe the witness's testimony is not the best evidence.\n\nD. Inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.\n\nThis is similar to the best evidence rule. If the log books have the information, and they're available, maybe the party should produce those records instead of having a witness testify about them.\n\nSo, considering that the log books are in the company's possession, and they contain the factual information that the supervisor is going to testify about, it seems like the best approach would be to introduce the log books themselves, especially since they are regular business records.\n\nTherefore, the supervisor's testimony about these specific factual details might be excluded because of the best evidence rule, which prefers the original writing over oral testimony about its content, especially when the writing is available.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer: the testimony should be inadmissible because it would violate the best evidence rule.\n\nBut let's think a bit more. Maybe the supervisor can testify about the log books, like authenticating them or testifying about how they were created. But the question is about testifying about the amount of pipe used, number of hours, and number of workers, which are presumably recorded in the log books.\n\nIf the company introduces the log books as evidence, then the supervisor can testify about them, but testifying about the contents orally when the records are available might not be allowed.\n\nAlso, regarding option D, since the log books are in the company's possession, and presumably available, there's no need to rely on the witness's memory if the original records are accessible.\n\nBut the best evidence rule is primarily concerned with the content of writings, and preferring the original over a copy or oral testimony. So, in this case, since the log books contain the information, and they are available, the supervisor's testimony about their content might be excluded in favor of producing the original records.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
