The law is not valid unless it is formally enacted.\n\nB. Law has lexical priority over morality.\n\nC. An unjust law is not law.\n\nD. No-one is above the law.\n\nI think I need to understand the literal translation first. \"Lex\" means \"law,\" \"iniusta\" means \"unjust,\" and \"non est\" means \"is not.\" So putting it together, it seems like \"An unjust law is not a law.\" That matches option C.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe there's a deeper meaning or a legal principle behind this phrase. I recall that in law, there's sometimes a debate about whether unjust laws should still be considered laws. Some people argue that even an unjust law is still a law because it was properly enacted, which might relate to option A.\n\nOption B says \"law has lexical priority over morality.\" I'm not sure what \"lexical\" means in this context. Maybe it's a typo and should be \"legal\" instead of \"lexical.\" If it's \"legal priority over morality,\" that would mean that the law takes precedence over moral considerations. But I'm not sure if that's what the phrase is getting at.\n\nOption D, \"no-one is above the law,\" suggests equality before the law, which is a different concept altogether.\n\nGoing back to option C, \"an unjust law is not law,\" this seems to align with the idea that for a law to be valid, it must also be just. This is a principle associated with natural law theory, which holds that there are higher laws based on morality that human laws must conform to.\n\nSo, considering the literal translation and the legal principles behind it, I think option C is the correct meaning of \"Lex iniusta non est lex.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
