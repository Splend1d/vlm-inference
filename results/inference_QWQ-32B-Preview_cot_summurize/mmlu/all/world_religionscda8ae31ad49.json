                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question: \"Which of the following shuns politics?\" and the options are A. The sages of the Zhuangzi, B. The Songs of the South, C. The Duke of Zhou, and D. The Confucian \"sage kings.\" Hmm, I need to think about each one and see which one avoids or rejects political involvement.\n\nFirst, let's consider option A, the sages of the Zhuangzi. Zhuangzi is a key figure in Taoism, and his philosophy emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, which is the natural order of things. Taoists often advocate for minimal government interference and personal freedom. So, it seems like they might be more inclined to shun politics and focus on individual enlightenment and harmony with nature.\n\nOption B, The Songs of the South, I'm not entirely sure what this refers to. I think it might be a translation of \"Chuci\" or something similar, which is a collection of poems from the Warring States period in China. These poems often express the emotions and thoughts of scholars and officials, and they might include political commentary or expressions of frustration with the political climate. So, it's not clear if they shun politics; in fact, they might engage with it through their poetry.\n\nOption C, The Duke of Zhou, was a historical figure in ancient China who was known for his political prowess and his role in establishing the rites and rituals that became foundational to Confucian thought. He was a regent who governed on behalf of the young King Cheng and is revered for his wise and just rule. So, it's clear that he was deeply involved in politics and is held up as a model of a virtuous ruler.\n\nOption D, The Confucian \"sage kings,\" refers to idealized rulers in Confucian tradition who embody virtue and wisdom. Confucianism places a strong emphasis on the proper conduct of rulers and the importance of ethical governance. Sage kings are expected to be deeply engaged in politics and to use their wisdom to benefit the people. So, again, this is about engaging in politics in a positive way, not shunning it.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems like the sages of the Zhuangzi are the ones who are more likely to shun politics, given their focus on individual freedom and harmony with nature, which often contrasts with the political involvement emphasized in Confucian thought.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should look up a bit more about The Songs of the South to make sure. Let's see... after a quick search, it appears that \"The Songs of the South\" is another name for the \"Chu Ci,\" which is indeed a collection of poems from the Warring States period, attributed to Qu Yuan and other poets from the state of Chu. These poems often express personal feelings and criticisms of the political situation, so they don't seem to shun politics; rather, they engage with it, albeit indirectly through poetry.\n\nSo, considering that, option A, the sages of the Zhuangzi, seems to be the most appropriate answer. They are known for their detachment from worldly affairs, including politics, in favor of pursuing spiritual freedom and alignment with the Tao.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
