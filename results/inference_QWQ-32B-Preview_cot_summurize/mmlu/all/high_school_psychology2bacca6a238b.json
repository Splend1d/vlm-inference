This discomfort often leads to an alteration in one's beliefs, values, or ideas to make them more consistent or to rationalize the behavior.\n\nLet's briefly look at why the other options are not correct:\n\nA. Persuasion: This is the process of influencing someone's beliefs, attitudes, intentions, motivations, or behaviors. It doesn't describe conflicting attitudes or behaviors within a person.\n\nB. General adaptation syndrome: This is a model of stress that describes the body's short-term and long-term stress responses. It doesn't relate to conflicting attitudes or behaviors.\n\nC. Serial position: This refers to the tendency to remember the first and last items in a series better than those in the middle. It's a concept in memory and learning, not related to conflicting attitudes or behaviors.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Cognitive dissonance."
