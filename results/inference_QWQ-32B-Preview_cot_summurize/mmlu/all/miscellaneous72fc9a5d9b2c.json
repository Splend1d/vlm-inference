                    "text": "I've got this question here: \"Which of these famous baseball figures was once acquitted at court-martial for insubordination?\" And the options are A. Abner Doubleday, B. Ty Cobb, C. Jackie Robinson, and D. Billy Martin. I need to figure out who among these baseball legends faced a court-martial and was found not guilty of insubordination.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what a court-martial is. From what I know, a court-martial is a military court where members of the armed forces are tried for violations of military law. So, this means that whoever the answer is must have been in the military at some point.\n\nLet me look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Abner Doubleday. I remember hearing about him in relation to baseball, but I'm not sure about the details. I think there's a myth that he invented baseball, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. As for his military career, I believe he was a Union general in the American Civil War. Maybe I should look into whether he had any run-ins with military law.\n\nOption B: Ty Cobb. He's known as one of the greatest baseball players of all time, but I don't recall any stories about him being in the military or facing a court-martial. Maybe I need to check if he served in any wars.\n\nOption C: Jackie Robinson. He's famous for breaking the color barrier in Major League Baseball. I know he was in the military during World War II. In fact, I think there was some trouble he got into while in the army. Maybe that's relevant here.\n\nOption D: Billy Martin. He was a baseball player and manager, known for his combative style. I don't recall any military service or court-martial for him, but I might be wrong.\n\nLet me start with Abner Doubleday. I need to see if he was ever court-martialed for insubordination.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that Abner Doubleday was indeed a Union general during the Civil War. There was an incident where he was court-martialed after the Battle of Gettysburg for his performance during the battle. However, I'm not sure if it was specifically for insubordination. Maybe I should look deeper into that.\n\nMoving on to Ty Cobb. I'm not aware of any military service for him. He played baseball from 1905 to 1928, which would cover World Wars I and II, but I don't know if he served in either. Perhaps he didn't serve, which might eliminate him as the answer.\n\nNext, Jackie Robinson. I know he did serve in the army during World War II. There was an incident where he refused to move to the back of a bus on army grounds, which led to his court-martial. Let me verify if that's correct.\n\nYes, Jackie Robinson was court-martialed for refusing to move to the back of a segregated bus on a military base. He was charged with insubordination and other offenses. However, he was acquitted of all charges. This seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nFinally, Billy Martin. I don't think he had any notable military service, but I might be wrong. I'll check quickly.\n\nUpon checking, Billy Martin did serve in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean War. However, I don't find any records of him facing a court-martial for insubordination. So, it's unlikely that he's the answer.\n\nComparing all the options, it seems that Jackie Robinson is the one who was court-martialed for insubordination and acquitted. The other options don't seem to fit as clearly.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Jackie Robinson.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
