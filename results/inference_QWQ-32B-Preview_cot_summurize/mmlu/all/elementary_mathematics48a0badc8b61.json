To make it easier, you can eliminate the decimal by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 100, but since 5.50 is the same as 550 cents and 132 is 13200 cents, it might be simpler to keep it in dollars.\n\nSo, 132 divided by 5.50.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it as:\n\n\\[ 5.50 \\times \\text{hours} = 132 \\]\n\nTo find the hours, divide both sides by 5.50.\n\nNow, doing the division:\n\n132 \u00f7 5.50.\n\nLet's perform the division step by step.\n\n5.50 goes into 132 how many times?\n\nFirst, 5.50 times 20 is 110.\n\nBecause 5.50 \u00d7 20 = 110.\n\nSubtract that from 132:\n\n132 - 110 = 22.\n\nNow, 5.50 goes into 22 how many times?\n\n5.50 \u00d7 4 = 22.\n\nSo, 5.50 \u00d7 4 = 22.\n\nSubtract that from 22:\n\n22 - 22 = 0.\n\nSo, the total hours are 20 + 4 = 24.\n\nTherefore, Mai needs to work 24 hours to earn $132.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 16\n\nB. 20\n\nC. 24\n\nD. 28\n\nThe correct answer is C. 24.\n\nAlternatively, you can double-check by multiplying 24 hours by $5.50 per hour:\n\n24 \u00d7 5.50 = 24 \u00d7 5 + 24 \u00d7 0.50 = 120 + 12 = 132.\n\nYes, that matches the total earnings needed.\n\nSo, the answer is 24 hours.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
