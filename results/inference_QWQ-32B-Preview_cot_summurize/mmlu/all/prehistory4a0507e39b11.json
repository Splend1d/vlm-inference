It seems like that's what brachiation refers to. Bipedal locomotion is walking on two legs, like humans do, and quadrupedal is using four limbs, like many mammals. A savanna niche sounds like a type of environment or ecological role, not a method of movement. So, brachiation makes the most sense here."
