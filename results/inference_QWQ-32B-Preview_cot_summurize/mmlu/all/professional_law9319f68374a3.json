He gives her all sorts of materials like business cards, brochures, promotional stuff, price lists, and even order forms with his logo. The assistant tells others at the conference that she's there officially representing the boss and that she's authorized to make contracts on his behalf. She negotiates a deal with a third party, but the businessperson refuses to honor it because he doesn't like the terms. Now, the question is, will the third party likely prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\nB. Yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\n\nC. No, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\n\nD. No, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of agency and authority. In law, agency is a relationship where one person (the agent) has authority to act on behalf of another (the principal). There are different types of authority: actual authority, apparent authority, and ostensible authority.\n\nActual authority is when the principal actually gives the agent permission to act on their behalf. Apparent authority is when the principal's conduct leads a reasonable person to believe that the agent is authorized to act, even if the principal didn't actually grant that authority. Ostensible authority is similar to apparent authority; it's based on the principal's representations to third parties.\n\nIn this scenario, the businessperson gave the assistant all these materials\u2014business cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and order forms with his logo. He also sent her to the conference to represent him. Additionally, the assistant represented to third parties that she was there officially representing the principal and was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf.\n\nSo, it seems like the principal is giving the assistant the tools and the opportunity to represent him, and the assistant is telling others that she has the authority to make contracts.\n\nNow, the assistant negotiates a deal with a third party, but the businessperson refuses to honor it because he doesn't like the terms.\n\nThe question is whether the third party is likely to prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson.\n\nOption A says yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\nIndicia of authority are signs or indications that suggest someone has authority to act on behalf of another. In this case, the materials provided\u2014business cards, brochures, promotional materials, price lists, and order forms with the principal's logo\u2014are indicia of authority. They make it seem like the assistant is authorized to represent the principal.\n\nOption B says yes, because the principal is bound to the employee's actions whenever he sends an employee to attend a convention on his behalf.\n\nThis seems a bit broad. Just sending an employee to a convention doesn't automatically mean that the employee has authority to bind the principal to contracts. It depends on the specific authority granted.\n\nOption C says no, because people dealing with an assistant at a convention have a duty to determine whether that person is in fact an authorized agent.\n\nThis suggests that the third party had a duty to verify the assistant's authority before entering into the agreement.\n\nOption D says no, because the technological revolution makes it easy these days for a potential customer to first confirm the existence of actual authority.\n\nThis is similar to option C but emphasizes the ease of verification due to technology.\n\nNow, considering these options, I need to think about agency law principles.\n\nFirst, if the principal has held the assistant out as having authority to act on his behalf, that could create apparent authority. Apparent authority arises when the principal's conduct would lead a reasonable person to believe that the agent is authorized to act.\n\nIn this case, the principal provided the assistant with all these materials and sent her to the conference to represent him. Additionally, the assistant represented to third parties that she was authorized to execute contracts on his behalf.\n\nSo, it seems like the principal has held the assistant out as having authority, and the assistant has represented herself as having authority.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a reasonable third party might believe that the assistant had the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the principal.\n\nTherefore, the principal might be bound by the assistant's actions due to the principle of apparent authority.\n\nOption A seems plausible because the indicia of authority provided by the principal could be sufficient to bind him.\n\nOption B is too broad. Just sending an employee to a convention doesn't automatically confer authority to bind the principal to contracts. It depends on the specific authority granted.\n\nOption C suggests that the third party had a duty to verify the assistant's authority. While it's always a good idea to verify authority, especially in business dealings, agency law generally protects third parties who rely on the apparent authority of an agent.\n\nOption D is similar to C but emphasizes the ease of verification due to technology. Again, while technology makes verification easier, the principle of apparent authority is still relevant.\n\nIn agency law, the concept of apparent authority is designed to protect third parties who reasonably rely on the principal's representations about an agent's authority.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the principal provided the assistant with materials that suggest she has authority and the assistant represented that she was authorized to execute contracts, a reasonable third party might rely on that and believe that the assistant had the authority to bind the principal to a contract.\n\nTherefore, the third party is likely to prevail in enforcing the contract against the businessperson based on the principle of apparent authority.\n\nHence, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption B is too sweeping and doesn't accurately reflect the nuances of agency law.\n\nOptions C and D shift the burden to the third party to verify authority, but under the principle of apparent authority, the third party is protected as long as they reasonably believed the agent had authority based on the principal's conduct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A: Yes, because the furnishing of the indicia of authority to act to the employee was sufficient proof to bind the principal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
