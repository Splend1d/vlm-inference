                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Brandt's version of utilitarianism. So, utilitarianism is a theory that says the best action is the one that maximizes happiness or utility for the greatest number of people. Now, Brandt had his own take on this, and the question is asking what, according to his version, makes an action right.\n\nOption A says \"the consequences of particular acts.\" That sounds a lot like act-utilitarianism, where you look at each individual action and see what consequences it has, and if it maximizes happiness, it's right. But I think Brandt might have a different perspective.\n\nOption B mentions \"the actual and recognized rules of society.\" This seems more like rule-utilitarianism, where instead of looking at each act individually, you consider rules that, if followed by everyone, would lead to the greatest happiness. So, it's about following rules that are generally beneficial.\n\nOption C is \"ideal rules.\" This might be similar to rule-utilitarianism but perhaps with a twist that these are perfect or optimal rules, not just the ones that are currently recognized.\n\nOption D is about whether one\u2019s maxim can be universalized. That rings a bell; it sounds like Immanuel Kant's idea, where you check if your personal principle (maxim) could become a universal law. But Kant was a deontologist, not a utilitarian, so this seems out of place here.\n\nGiven that Brandt is associated with rule-utilitarianism, I think the answer is either B or C. Rule-utilitarianism focuses on rules that, when followed, lead to the greatest good, rather than evaluating each act on its own consequences.\n\nOption B talks about \"actual and recognized rules of society,\" which suggests that Brandt might be considering the rules that are already in place and accepted by society, and evaluating their utility.\n\nOption C says \"ideal rules,\" which might imply rules that are not necessarily current but are the best possible rules in terms of maximizing utility.\n\nI need to recall what Brandt specifically defended. I think he argued for rule-utilitarianism but with a focus on ideal rules, not necessarily the actual rules of society. His idea was to consider what rules would be best if everyone followed them, and then act in accordance with those rules.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the better answer. But let me think again. If he's talking about ideal rules, that might involve some kind of thought experiment where we consider what rules would lead to the greatest happiness if everyone followed them, regardless of what rules currently exist.\n\nOn the other hand, option B seems to be more about the rules that are already in place and recognized by society. While these rules might coincide with utilitarian principles, it's not necessarily the same as considering ideal rules.\n\nTherefore, I think C, \"ideal rules,\" is the correct answer. Brandt's version of utilitarianism makes rightness a function of ideal rules, which are the rules that would maximize utility if followed by everyone.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that Brandt discussed the concept of \"ideal morality\" in his work, which aligns with the idea of ideal rules. So, yeah, I'm fairly confident with C as the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
