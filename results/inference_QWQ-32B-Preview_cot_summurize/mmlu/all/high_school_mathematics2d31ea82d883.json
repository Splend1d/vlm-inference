                    "text": "To find the volume of the solid generated when the region bounded by the y-axis, y = e^x, and y = 2 is rotated around the y-axis, we can use the method of cylindrical shells or the washer method. In this case, using the washer method seems more straightforward because we are rotating around the y-axis.\n\nFirst, let's understand the region we are dealing with. The region is bounded by the y-axis (x = 0), the curve y = e^x, and the horizontal line y = 2. We need to find the volume of the solid formed by rotating this region around the y-axis.\n\nUsing the washer method, we need to express x in terms of y because we are integrating with respect to y. The curve y = e^x can be rewritten as x = ln(y), since the natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function.\n\nThe volume V of the solid of revolution is given by the formula:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u222b[R(y)^2 - r(y)^2] dy\n\nwhere R(y) is the outer radius and r(y) is the inner radius of the washer at height y.\n\nIn this problem, the outer radius is the distance from the y-axis to the curve x = ln(y), which is R(y) = ln(y). The inner radius is zero because the region touches the y-axis.\n\nHowever, there is a slight complication because the region is bounded above by y = 2. So, the limits of integration will be from y = 1 to y = 2. Wait, why y = 1?\n\nWell, when y = e^x, and x starts from 0 (the y-axis), y = e^0 = 1. So, the lower limit is y = 1, and the upper limit is y = 2.\n\nTherefore, the volume is:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u222bfrom 1 to 2 [ln(y)]^2 dy\n\nThis integral might look a bit tricky, but we can solve it using integration by parts.\n\nLet's set:\n\nu = [ln(y)]^2\n\ndv = dy\n\nThen:\n\ndu = 2 ln(y) * (1/y) dy\n\nv = y\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\n\nSo:\n\n\u222b [ln(y)]^2 dy = y [ln(y)]^2 - \u222b y * 2 ln(y) * (1/y) dy\n\nSimplify the integral on the right:\n\n\u222b y * 2 ln(y) * (1/y) dy = \u222b 2 ln(y) dy\n\nNow, we need to compute \u222b 2 ln(y) dy.\n\nWe can use integration by parts again.\n\nLet:\n\nu = ln(y)\n\ndv = 2 dy\n\nThen:\n\ndu = (1/y) dy\n\nv = 2y\n\nSo:\n\n\u222b 2 ln(y) dy = 2y ln(y) - \u222b 2y * (1/y) dy = 2y ln(y) - \u222b 2 dy = 2y ln(y) - 2y + C\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\u222b [ln(y)]^2 dy = y [ln(y)]^2 - (2y ln(y) - 2y) + C = y [ln(y)]^2 - 2y ln(y) + 2y + C\n\nNow, we can evaluate the definite integral from y = 1 to y = 2:\n\nV = \u03c0 [y [ln(y)]^2 - 2y ln(y) + 2y] from 1 to 2\n\nFirst, evaluate at y = 2:\n\n2 [ln(2)]^2 - 2*2 ln(2) + 2*2 = 2 (ln(2))^2 - 4 ln(2) + 4\n\nThen, evaluate at y = 1:\n\n1 [ln(1)]^2 - 2*1 ln(1) + 2*1 = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo, the volume is:\n\nV = \u03c0 [ (2 (ln(2))^2 - 4 ln(2) + 4) - 2 ] = \u03c0 [2 (ln(2))^2 - 4 ln(2) + 2]\n\nWe can factor out a 2:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 [ (ln(2))^2 - 2 ln(2) + 1 ]\n\nNotice that (ln(2))^2 - 2 ln(2) + 1 is a perfect square:\n\n(ln(2) - 1)^2\n\nSo:\n\nV = 2\u03c0 (ln(2) - 1)^2\n\nNow, let's calculate this numerically.\n\nFirst, find ln(2):\n\nln(2) \u2248 0.6931\n\nThen, ln(2) - 1 \u2248 0.6931 - 1 = -0.3069\n\nSquare it:\n\n(-0.3069)^2 \u2248 0.0942\n\nThen, multiply by 2\u03c0:\n\n2\u03c0 * 0.0942 \u2248 2 * 3.1416 * 0.0942 \u2248 6.2832 * 0.0942 \u2248 0.592\n\nTherefore, the volume is approximately 0.592 cubic units.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.296\n\nB. 0.592\n\nC. 2.427\n\nD. 3.998\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.592\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.592} \\]"
