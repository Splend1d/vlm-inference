It's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, here's what happened:\n\n- In June, a computer retailer ordered 100 computers from a manufacturer, to be delivered by August 1.\n\n- The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\n- In July, the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but added that \"shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20.\"\n\n- When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order.\n\nThe question is: Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?\n\nAnd we have four options:\n\nA. Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\n\nB. Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\n\nC. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nD. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the basics of contract formation. For a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be an offer, acceptance of that offer, and consideration (something of value exchanged between the parties).\n\nIn this case, the retailer made an offer in June for 100 computers to be delivered by August 1, and the manufacturer sent a confirmation in July agreeing to the terms but proposing a different shipment schedule.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the manufacturer's confirmation is a valid acceptance of the offer or if it's a counteroffer.\n\nThe offer specified that acceptance is limited to the terms of the offer. This is important because it suggests that any deviation from those terms would not be accepted unless explicitly agreed upon by both parties.\n\nThe manufacturer's confirmation agrees to the terms and specifications but changes the shipment dates. This could be seen as a material alteration of the offer's terms, particularly since the original delivery date was August 1, and the confirmation proposes deliveries on August 10 and 20.\n\nIn contract law, a material alteration in the terms of an offer typically constitutes a counteroffer rather than acceptance. A counteroffer rejects the original offer and proposes new terms.\n\nGiven that, the manufacturer's confirmation might be considered a counteroffer, not an acceptance. If that's the case, then there was no meeting of the minds on the original terms, and no contract was formed based on the original offer.\n\nHowever, the retailer didn't immediately reject the manufacturer's confirmation; instead, they waited until shipment wasn't made by August 1 and then withdrew the order.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the retailer's silence constituted acceptance of the manufacturer's proposed terms.\n\nIn contract law, silence generally isn't acceptance, especially when there's a material alteration in the terms. The retailer couldn't be expected to accept new terms just by not responding.\n\nMoreover, the original offer specified delivery by August 1, and the manufacturer proposed delivery by August 10 and 20. This change could be significant, especially if the retailer needed the computers by August 1 for certain purposes.\n\nWhen the manufacturer didn't ship by August 1, and the retailer withdrew the order, it seems like the retailer was sticking to the original terms they offered.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.\n\nI don't think this is correct because the change in delivery dates could be significant, especially since the original deadline was August 1.\n\nB. Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.\n\nThis seems problematic because, as I mentioned, silence doesn't\u901a\u5e38\u6784\u6210\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u65b9\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u65f6\u3002\n\nC. No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nThis seems plausible because the offer specified that acceptance was limited to its terms, which would mean any deviation wouldn't constitute acceptance but rather a counteroffer.\n\nD. No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.\n\nThis could be a factor, but the key issue is whether a contract was formed in the first place. If there was no valid acceptance, then no contract existed, and the withdrawal might be irrelevant.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is C: No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.\n\nThis is because the manufacturer's confirmation altered a material term (the delivery date), which would make it a counteroffer rather than acceptance. Since there was no valid acceptance, no contract was formed based on the original offer.\n\nTherefore, the manufacturer wouldn't prevail in enforcing a contract.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other angle.\n\nPerhaps the manufacturer could argue that the change in delivery dates was a minor variation, and the overall contract should still be enforceable. However, since the original offer specified delivery by August 1 and the confirmation proposed August 10 and 20, this seems like a significant change, especially if the retailer relied on the August 1 date.\n\nAlso, the retailer withdrew the order when the manufacturer didn't meet the original deadline, indicating that they didn't accept the modified terms.\n\nAdditionally, option D suggests that the order was withdrawn before shipment, but if no contract was ever formed due to lack of valid acceptance, then the withdrawal might not affect the enforceability anyway.\n\nTherefore, I believe option C is the most accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
