                    "text": "So I have this problem: \"Find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z.\" And there are options A through D. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 4Z and 2Z are. I know that 2Z is the set of all even integers, right? So, 2Z = {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...}. And 4Z is the set of all integers that are multiples of 4, so 4Z = {..., -4, 0, 4, 8, ...}.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the cosets of 4Z in 2Z. So, I need to find all the subsets of 2Z that are formed by adding an element of 2Z to 4Z.\n\nRemember, a coset of a subgroup H in a group G is of the form g + H for some g in G. Here, H is 4Z and G is 2Z.\n\nSo, I need to find all distinct sets of the form a + 4Z, where a is in 2Z.\n\nLet me pick some elements from 2Z and see what cosets I get.\n\nTake a = 0: 0 + 4Z = 4Z. That's option A.\n\nTake a = 2: 2 + 4Z = {..., -2, 2, 6, 10, ...}. That seems different from 4Z.\n\nTake a = 4: 4 + 4Z = {..., 0, 4, 8, 12, ...}. Wait, that's the same as 4Z, right? Because 4Z already includes 4.\n\nLet me check: 4 + 4Z = {4 + k*4 | k in Z} = {k*4 + 4 | k in Z} = {(k+1)*4 | k in Z} = {m*4 | m in Z} = 4Z.\n\nSo, a = 4 gives the same coset as a = 0.\n\nSimilarly, a = -2: -2 + 4Z = {..., -6, -2, 2, 6, ...}, which is the same as 2 + 4Z.\n\nA = 6: 6 + 4Z = {..., 2, 6, 10, 14, ...}, which is the same as 2 + 4Z.\n\nSo, it seems like there are only two distinct cosets: 4Z and 2 + 4Z.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4Z\n\nB. 4Z, 2 + 4Z\n\nC. 2Z\n\nD. Z\n\nOption B seems to match what I found.\n\nBut let me make sure. Is 2Z itself a coset of 4Z in 2Z? Well, 2Z is the group itself, and 4Z is a subgroup. But in the context of cosets, 2Z is the union of all its cosets.\n\nSimilarly, Z is the set of all integers, but here we're working within 2Z, so Z is larger than 2Z.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. 4Z, 2 + 4Z.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to find the index of 4Z in 2Z. The index should be the number of distinct cosets.\n\n2Z is generated by 2, and 4Z is generated by 4. So, the index should be [2Z : 4Z] = |2Z / 4Z|.\n\nSince 2Z / 4Z is isomorphic to Z_2, which has two elements, there should be two cosets.\n\nThat matches what I found earlier: 4Z and 2 + 4Z.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. 4Z, 2 + 4Z.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
