Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the number of pages and the time it takes to read them. Since she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, for each additional page, she needs another 3 minutes. So, if she reads 2 pages, it would be 6 minutes, 3 pages would be 9 minutes, and so on.\n\nSo, it seems like the total time is equal to the number of pages multiplied by the time per page. In this case, that would be 18 pages times 3 minutes per page.\n\nWait a minute, but let's look at the options:\n\nA. add 18 and 3\n\nThat would be 18 + 3 = 21 minutes. But that doesn't make sense because if she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, 18 pages should take much longer than 21 minutes.\n\nB. divide 18 by 3\n\nThat would be 18 \u00f7 3 = 6 minutes. But again, that's too short for 18 pages. If she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, 18 pages should take 18 times 3 minutes, not 18 divided by 3.\n\nC. multiply 3 by 18\n\nThat would be 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 minutes. That seems more reasonable. If each page takes 3 minutes, then 18 pages would take 54 minutes.\n\nD. subtract 3 from 18\n\nThat would be 18 - 3 = 15 minutes. Again, that's too short for 18 pages.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, it seems like option C is the correct method to determine the number of minutes for Susan to read 18 pages.\n\nBut let's double-check. If she reads 1 page in 3 minutes, then for 18 pages, it should be 18 times 3 minutes, which is 54 minutes. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of rates. Her reading rate is 1 page per 3 minutes, which is equivalent to 1/3 pages per minute. But I think the straightforward approach is to multiply the number of pages by the time per page.\n\nYes, I'm confident that option C is the correct method.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
