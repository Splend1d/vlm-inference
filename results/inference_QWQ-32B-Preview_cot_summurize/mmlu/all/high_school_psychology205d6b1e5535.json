While walking home in the increasing darkness, Lizette notices that she can no longer distinguish the colors of objects. Which of the following best explains why Lizette cannot see color in dim light?\n\nA. Rods, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas cones, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nB. Cones, which are specialized for color vision, require more light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in black, white, and gray, allow for vision in dim light.\nC. Cones, which are specialized for black and white vision, require a small amount of light to be activated, whereas rods, which produce images in color, require greater amounts of light for vision.\nD. The receptive fields in the retina respond to the loss of light through light adaptation, the process of rapidly adjusting to a diminution of light.\n"

Rods, on the other hand, are better at detecting light in low-light conditions but don't provide color information. So, in dim light, our rods take over, and we see in black and white.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says that rods are specialized for color vision, which I know is incorrect. Rods are for black and white vision in low light.\n\nOption C says cones are specialized for black and white vision, which is also wrong; cones are for color vision.\n\nOption D talks about receptive fields and light adaptation, which is a process that helps our eyes adjust to different light levels, but it doesn't directly explain why we can't see colors in dim light.\n\nSo, yeah, B seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
