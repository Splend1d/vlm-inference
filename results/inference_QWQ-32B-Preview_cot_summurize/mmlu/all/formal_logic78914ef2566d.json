                    "text": "Let's tackle this logic translation step by step. So, we have the proposition:\n\n(\u2200x)[Ax \u2283 (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 Bxy)]\n\nAnd the translation key is:\n\nAx: x is an apartment\n\nHx: x is a house\n\nLx: x is large\n\nBxy: x is bigger than y\n\nOkay, so the proposition is a universal quantifier followed by an implication. The implication says that if x is an apartment, then there exists some y that is a house and x is bigger than y.\n\nSo, in plain English, this means that for every apartment, there is at least one house that it is bigger than.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Every apartment is bigger than some house.\n\nB. Every house is bigger than all apartments.\n\nC. Every house is bigger than some apartment.\n\nD. Some house is bigger than every apartment.\n\nOption A says \"Every apartment is bigger than some house.\" That matches pretty closely with our interpretation. Each apartment is bigger than at least one house.\n\nOption B says \"Every house is bigger than all apartments.\" That would be something like (\u2200y)(Hy \u2283 (\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 Bxy)), which is different from our original statement.\n\nOption C says \"Every house is bigger than some apartment.\" That would be (\u2200y)(Hy \u2283 (\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 Bxy)), which again is different.\n\nOption D says \"Some house is bigger than every apartment.\" That would be (\u2203y)(Hy \u2022 (\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 Bxy)), which is not the same as the original.\n\nSo, the best match is option A: \"Every apartment is bigger than some house.\"\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about what the original statement is saying. It's saying that for every apartment, there is at least one house that it is bigger than. It doesn't say that every house is bigger than all apartments or anything like that.\n\nSo, yes, option A is the correct interpretation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
