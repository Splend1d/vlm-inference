The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I asked her for help with my computer, so she installed antivirus software on it.\n\nScenario 2: I kept the fireplace lit as the chimney cleaner was in it.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I asked her for help with my computer, so she installed antivirus software on it.\n\nHmm, so I asked for help, which implies consent, and she installed antivirus software. Antivirus software is generally good for a computer to protect it from malware and other threats. So, in this case, she's doing something that's beneficial for my computer, especially since I asked for help.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with that? It seems like she's being helpful and doing something positive. Maybe she could have asked for permission before installing software, but overall, it seems okay.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I kept the fireplace lit as the chimney cleaner was in it.\n\nThis sounds dangerous. If a chimney cleaner is working inside the chimney, and the fireplace is lit, there could be serious safety hazards, like smoke inhalation or even fire risks.\n\nKeeping the fireplace lit while someone is in the chimney could put that person's life in danger. That seems morally wrong because it endangers another person's safety.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat would be option C.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, is there any possible way that installing antivirus software could be wrong? Maybe if the software is malicious or if she installed it without my consent, but in this case, I asked for help, so it seems like she's acting in my best interest.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping the fireplace lit while a cleaner is in the chimney is clearly endangering the cleaner's welfare, which is a moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct answer: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
