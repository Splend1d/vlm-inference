                    "text": "David Baltimore is a renowned molecular biologist who has made significant contributions to our understanding of viruses and the immune system. Let's consider the options provided to determine what he discovered.\n\nOption A: The structure of DNA\n\nThe structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. They proposed the double helix model, which is a fundamental concept in molecular biology. While this is a monumental discovery, it was not made by David Baltimore.\n\nOption B: X-ray crystallographic techniques\n\nX-ray crystallography is a technique used to determine the three-dimensional structure of molecules, including DNA and proteins. This technique was pioneered by figures such as William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg, and it was used by Rosalind Franklin to produce the X-ray diffraction images that were crucial for Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA's structure. David Baltimore is not primarily known for developing X-ray crystallographic techniques.\n\nOption C: The enzyme reverse transcriptase\n\nReverse transcriptase is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the life cycle of retroviruses, such as HIV. It allows these viruses to transcribe their RNA genomes into DNA, which can then be integrated into the host cell's genome. David Baltimore was one of the scientists who discovered reverse transcriptase independently in 1970, along with Howard Temin and Renato Dulbecco. This discovery was a groundbreaking advancement in virology and molecular biology, for which Baltimore and Temin shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975.\n\nOption D: The anti-HIV drug zidovudine\n\nZidovudine, also known as AZT, was the first drug approved for the treatment of HIV infection. It was developed in the 1980s by researchers at Burroughs Wellcome Company (now GlaxoSmithKline). While David Baltimore has conducted research on HIV and contributed to the development of antiretroviral therapies, he is not credited with the discovery of zidovudine specifically.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is C: The enzyme reverse transcriptase. This discovery was a pivotal moment in the field of molecular biology and has had far-reaching implications for our understanding of viral replication and the development of antiviral therapies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
