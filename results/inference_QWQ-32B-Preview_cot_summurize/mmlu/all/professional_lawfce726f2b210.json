                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about a merchant's irrevocable written offer, also known as a \"firm offer.\" So, we're dealing with a situation where a merchant makes a written offer to sell goods, and this offer is irrevocable for a certain period. The question is asking which statement among the options A, B, C, and D is correct regarding such an offer.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what a firm offer is. In contract law, particularly under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in the United States, a merchant can make an irrevocable offer to sell goods. This means that for a specified time, the offer cannot be taken back by the merchant. This is a special rule because, generally, offers can be revoked by the offeror at any time before acceptance.\n\nOption A says: \"Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.\" Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Let's think about it. If the offeree provides a form contract that includes the offer, does the merchant need to sign it separately for the offer to be irrevocable? Under the UCC, for a firm offer to be valid, it must be in writing and signed by the merchant. But if the offeree supplies a form that contains the offer, perhaps the signature on that form would suffice. I'm not entirely sure about this one, so I'll keep it in mind and come back to it if necessary.\n\nOption B states: \"Is valid for three months.\" This seems familiar. Under the UCC, specifically section 2-205, a merchant's firm offer is irrevocable for a maximum of three months. So, this might be correct. But let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C says: \"Is nonassignable.\" Assignability of contracts is another aspect of contract law. Generally, contracts can be assigned unless there's a specific prohibition against assignment. Is there something in the UCC that makes firm offers nonassignable? I don't recall anything like that off the top of my head, so this might not be correct.\n\nOption D states: \"Cannot exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.\" This is interesting. It's mentioning that even if consideration is provided, the offer can't be valid for more than three months. Under the UCC, a firm offer can be irrevocable for up to three months, but what if parties agree to a longer period and provide consideration? Let's see what the UCC says about this.\n\nLooking back at UCC section 2-205, it specifies that a merchant's firm offer must be in writing and signed by the merchant, and it can be irrevocable for up to three months. If the offer designates a longer period, the three-month limit still applies. However, if additional consideration is given, perhaps in the form of a deposit or something similar, maybe that could extend the period. But according to the UCC, even with consideration, the maximum duration is three months.\n\nWait a minute, let's look up UCC section 2-205 to be precise. According to the UCC \u00a7 2-205, \"firm offers\" by merchants may be irrevocable for a stated time, but not exceeding three months, and even without consideration supporting the promise to keep the offer open. So, it seems that even without consideration, the offer can be irrevocable for up to three months, and consideration doesn't extend this period beyond three months.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be correct because it says the offer cannot exceed three months even if consideration is given. But wait, the UCC says that consideration isn't necessary for the irrevocability up to three months, and it doesn't mention that consideration can extend the period beyond three months. In fact, it sets three months as the maximum, regardless of consideration.\n\nSo, option D appears to be correct. But let's double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: \"Must be separately signed if the offeree supplies a form contract containing the offer.\" I don't think this is correct because the signature should be on the writing that constitutes the offer. If the offeree supplies a form that includes the offer, and the merchant signs it, that should suffice, unless there's a specific requirement for a separate signature. I don't recall such a requirement in the UCC.\n\nOption C: \"Is nonassignable.\" Again, there's no specific provision in the UCC that makes firm offers nonassignable. Assignability is generally allowed unless restricted by the terms of the contract or by law.\n\nOption B: \"Is valid for three months.\" This is partially correct in that a firm offer can be irrevocable for up to three months, but it doesn't capture the full picture because the offer can be for a shorter period as well. However, the question is asking for which statement is correct, and since option D seems to be more precise, option B might not be the best answer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely option D: \"Cannot exceed a three-month duration even if consideration is given.\" This aligns with the UCC's provisions regarding the maximum duration of a merchant's firm offer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
