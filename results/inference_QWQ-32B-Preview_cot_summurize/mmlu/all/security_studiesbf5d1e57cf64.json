                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement isn't applicable to the development of peace studies in the 20th century. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping.\" Hmm, that sounds right. Peace studies has evolved over time, and as we moved beyond the Cold War, there was a greater emphasis on preventing conflicts and resolving them peacefully, as well as on peacekeeping efforts. So, this seems like a valid development in the field.\n\nOption B: \"At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labelled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics.\" Okay, during the Cold War, peace studies might have been seen by some as too leftist or even communist, especially if it questioned the arms race or advocated for disarmament. So, being labeled \"appeasement studies\" makes sense, as critics might have viewed it as surrendering to the enemy or being soft on communism. So, this also seems plausible.\n\nOption C: \"By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts.\" Now, this is interesting. In the 1970s, peace studies was gaining more recognition, and perhaps scholars were trying to expand its scope beyond just nuclear disarmament or Cold War issues to include more diverse topics like ethnic conflicts, environmental issues, and so on. But were they unsuccessful? I'm not sure about that. It seems that by the 1980s and 1990s, peace studies had indeed broadened its focus significantly. So, maybe this statement isn't entirely accurate.\n\nOption D: \"Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict.\" This seems consistent with the development of peace studies. The field has always had a global perspective, considering that conflicts affect people worldwide. Also, focusing on non-state actors is important because in many conflicts, states are not the only players; there are also NGOs, multinational corporations, and other groups involved. So, this seems like a valid goal for peace studies.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems to be the one that might not be applicable. It suggests that efforts to broaden the field in the 1970s were largely unsuccessful, but in reality, peace studies did expand its scope in subsequent decades. Therefore, the answer is probably C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
