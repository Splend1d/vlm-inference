                    "text": "In a skewed smooth distribution with a tail extended to the left, which is also known as negatively skewed distribution, the values are concentrated on the higher side with fewer smaller values stretching out to the left. In such distributions, the mean, median, and mode do not coincide; instead, they follow a specific order.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Standard deviation: This measures the spread of the data points from the mean. It doesn't necessarily indicate the highest value in the distribution; it just tells us how much variation or dispersion there is.\n\nB. Mode: This is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mode is typically the highest point of the distribution curve, which is towards the right side.\n\nC. Median: This is the middle value when the data is ordered. In a negatively skewed distribution, the median lies between the mean and the mode.\n\nD. Mean: This is the average value of the dataset. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is pulled towards the tail, which is to the left in this case, making it smaller than the median and mode.\n\nGiven that the distribution is skewed to the left, the mean is less than the median, and the median is less than the mode. Therefore, the mode has the highest value among these statistics.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. mode.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
