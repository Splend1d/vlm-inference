                    "text": "The correct answer is B. The flag State.\n\nLet me explain this in a bit more detail. When it comes to crimes committed on board vessels, international law generally recognizes that the flag State has primary jurisdiction over what happens on its ships, regardless of where the ship is located in the world's oceans. This is based on the principle of \"flag State jurisdiction,\" which is a key concept in the law of the sea.\n\nHere's how it works: Every ship sailing international waters flies the flag of its home country, also known as the flag State. This flag State has the authority to enforce its own laws and regulations on board its vessels, even when they are in the territorial waters of another country or on the high seas. So, if a crime is committed on a ship, it's usually up to the flag State to investigate and prosecute the offenders.\n\nNow, let's look at why the other options aren't correct:\n\nA. The coastal State: This is the country whose coastline the ship is near or whose territorial waters it is passing through. While coastal States do have some rights and responsibilities regarding ships passing through their territorial waters, they generally don't have jurisdiction over crimes committed on foreign ships unless there's a specific reason, like the crime affecting the coastal State's peace or security.\n\nC. All States enjoy such jurisdiction: This isn't accurate because jurisdiction isn't universal. It's specifically assigned to certain States based on defined principles, like flag State jurisdiction or territorial jurisdiction.\n\nD. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea: This is an international judicial body that handles disputes related to the law of the sea. While it plays a role in interpreting and applying the law of the sea, it doesn't have direct jurisdiction over criminal matters on board vessels. Criminal jurisdiction typically rests with national courts, specifically those of the flag State.\n\nSo, to sum it up, when a crime happens on a ship, it's generally the flag State's responsibility to deal with it. This helps maintain order and legality on international waters by assigning clear responsibilities to specific nations.\n\n"
