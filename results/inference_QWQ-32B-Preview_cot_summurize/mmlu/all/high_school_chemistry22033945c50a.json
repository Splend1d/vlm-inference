                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have silver metal that's usually mixed with mercury to make an amalgam, and this amalgam is used to reduce substances to a desired oxidation state. But now, there are concerns about using mercury, so we need to find a safe substitute for this silver-mercury amalgam.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. Silver metal is being used as a reducing agent. Reducing agents donate electrons to other substances, causing them to be reduced, which means their oxidation state decreases. So, silver is giving away electrons to other substances to reduce them.\n\nNow, the problem is that silver is combined with mercury to make an amalgam, probably to make it more workable or something like that. But since mercury is a concern, we need to find an alternative that can serve the same purpose without using mercury.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. H+(aq) - This is hydrogen ions in aqueous solution. Hydrogen ions can act as oxidizing agents, not reducing agents. So, they take electrons from other substances, increasing their oxidation state. That's the opposite of what we need.\n\nB. Na(s) - Sodium metal. Sodium is a highly reactive metal that can act as a strong reducing agent. It readily donates electrons to other substances.\n\nC. Ca2+(aq) - Calcium ions in aqueous solution. These are usually formed when calcium metal dissolves in water, but here it's just the ion. Calcium ions have a +2 charge, meaning they have already donated two electrons. So, they aren't in a position to donate more electrons; in fact, they can be oxidized further, but that's not relevant here.\n\nD. Mg(s) - Magnesium metal. Like sodium, magnesium is a metal that can act as a reducing agent by donating electrons.\n\nSo, between B and D, both sodium and magnesium are metals that can act as reducing agents. But which one would be a better substitute for the silver-mercury amalgam?\n\nI need to consider a few factors:\n\n1. Reducing power: The ability to donate electrons and reduce other substances.\n\n2. Safety: Since mercury is a concern due to its toxicity, the substitute should be safe to use.\n\n3. Reactivity: It should be reactive enough to carry out the reduction but not so reactive that it causes other problems.\n\nLet's compare sodium and magnesium:\n\n- Sodium is more reactive than magnesium. It reacts more vigorously with water and other substances, which could make it less safe to handle.\n\n- Magnesium is less reactive but still a good reducing agent.\n\nGiven that silver is a transition metal and not as reactive as sodium or magnesium, perhaps magnesium would be a better choice because it's less reactive and safer to handle.\n\nBut wait, maybe I need to think about the oxidation states. Silver can be reduced or oxidized depending on the context, but in this case, it's being used to reduce other substances, so it's being oxidized itself.\n\nLet me recall that silver can exist in different oxidation states, like Ag0 (metallic silver) and Ag+ (silver ion). When it donates an electron to reduce another substance, it gets oxidized from Ag0 to Ag+.\n\nSo, in the amalgam, it's likely that the silver is in its elemental form and donates electrons to reduce other substances.\n\nNow, considering that, both sodium and magnesium can donate electrons as well:\n\n- Sodium: Na \u2192 Na+ + e-\n\n- Magnesium: Mg \u2192 Mg2+ + 2e-\n\nBoth can donate electrons, but magnesium donates two electrons per atom, whereas sodium donates only one.\n\nHowever, in terms of reducing power, sodium is a stronger reducing agent than magnesium because it's more reactive.\n\nBut perhaps in this context, we don't need an extremely strong reducing agent, just something that can reduce the substance to the desired oxidation state, like silver does.\n\nGiven that, magnesium might be a better choice because it's less reactive and safer to handle than sodium.\n\nAdditionally, calcium ions (option C) are not really reducing agents, as they already have a +2 charge and don't readily donate more electrons.\n\nOption A, H+(aq), is an oxidizing agent, not a reducing agent, so it's out.\n\nTherefore, between sodium and magnesium, magnesium seems like a more reasonable and safe substitute for the silver-mercury amalgam.\n\nBut let's think about it some more. Maybe there are other factors to consider.\n\nFor example, the reaction conditions. If the reduction needs to happen in a specific solvent or under certain conditions, maybe one metal is more suitable than the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the silver-mercury amalgam is used because of its ability to form a uniform reducing layer or something like that. In that case, maybe magnesium wouldn't work as well.\n\nHowever, based on the information provided, it seems that magnesium metal (option D) is a reasonable and safe substitute for the silver-mercury amalgam.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. Mg(s).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
