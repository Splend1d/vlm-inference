                    "text": "A weakly stationary process, also known as covariance stationary or second-order stationary, is a stochastic process that fulfills certain statistical properties that are constant over time. These properties are crucial for time series analysis and forecasting. Let's examine each condition mentioned to determine which are necessary for a process to be considered weakly stationary.\n\n**Condition (i): It must have a constant mean.**\n\nIn a weakly stationary process, the mean of the series should not depend on time. This means that the expected value \\( E[X_t] \\) is constant for all time points \\( t \\). This is a fundamental requirement for weak stationarity.\n\n**Condition (ii): It must have a constant variance.**\n\nAlongside a constant mean, the variance of the series should also be constant over time. The variance measures the spread of the data points around the mean. For a process to be weakly stationary, \\( Var[X_t] \\) must be the same for all \\( t \\).\n\n**Condition (iii): It must have constant autocovariances for given lags.**\n\nAutocovariance measures the linear dependence between observations at different times. In a weakly stationary process, the autocovariance depends only on the lag between the times and not on the actual time at which the covariance is computed. This means that \\( Cov[X_t, X_{t+k}] \\) depends only on \\( k \\) (the lag) and not on \\( t \\).\n\n**Condition (iv): It must have a constant probability distribution.**\n\nThis condition refers to the entire distribution of the process being constant over time. This is a stronger condition than that required for weak stationarity. Weak stationarity only requires that the first two moments (mean and covariance) are time-invariant, not the entire distribution. Therefore, having a constant probability distribution is not a necessary condition for weak stationarity.\n\nGiven these explanations, conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) are necessary for a series to be classified as a weakly stationary process. Condition (iv) is not required for weak stationarity, as it pertains to stronger forms of stationarity, such as strict stationarity, where the joint distribution of the series is invariant to time shifts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
