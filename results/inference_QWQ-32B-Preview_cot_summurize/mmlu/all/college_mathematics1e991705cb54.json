                    "text": "So I have this problem: (1 + i)^10, and I need to figure out what that equals. The options are A. 1, B. i, C. 32, D. 32i. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that 'i' is the imaginary unit, where i^2 = -1. So, 1 + i is a complex number. Raising a complex number to a power can be a bit tricky, but there might be a straightforward way to do this.\n\nOne way to handle powers of complex numbers is to use De Moivre's Theorem. That theorem says that for a complex number in polar form, (r * (cos\u03b8 + i*sin\u03b8))^n = r^n * (cos(n\u03b8) + i*sin(n\u03b8)).\n\nSo, maybe I can convert 1 + i into polar form and then apply De Moivre's Theorem.\n\nFirst, let's find the modulus r of 1 + i. The modulus is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), where a and b are the real and imaginary parts, respectively. So, r = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).\n\nNext, find the argument \u03b8. That's the angle such that cos\u03b8 = a/r and sin\u03b8 = b/r. So, cos\u03b8 = 1/sqrt(2) and sin\u03b8 = 1/sqrt(2). That means \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 radians, or 45 degrees.\n\nSo, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * (cos(\u03c0/4) + i*sin(\u03c0/4)).\n\nNow, raising this to the 10th power:\n\n(1 + i)^10 = [sqrt(2)]^10 * (cos(10*\u03c0/4) + i*sin(10*\u03c0/4)).\n\nLet's compute [sqrt(2)]^10. Sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^10 = 2^(10/2) = 2^5 = 32.\n\nNow, 10*\u03c0/4 = (10/4)*\u03c0 = (5/2)*\u03c0.\n\nSo, cos(5\u03c0/2) + i*sin(5\u03c0/2).\n\nNow, cos(5\u03c0/2) is the same as cos(\u03c0/2), because cosine is periodic with period 2\u03c0. Similarly, sin(5\u03c0/2) = sin(\u03c0/2).\n\ncos(\u03c0/2) = 0 and sin(\u03c0/2) = 1.\n\nTherefore, cos(5\u03c0/2) + i*sin(5\u03c0/2) = 0 + i*1 = i.\n\nSo, putting it all together: (1 + i)^10 = 32 * i = 32i.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 32i matches this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way to see this without going through De Moivre's Theorem. Let's try expanding (1 + i)^10 directly, but that seems messy. Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern by calculating smaller powers of (1 + i).\n\nLet's try:\n\n(1 + i)^1 = 1 + i\n\n(1 + i)^2 = (1 + i)*(1 + i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i\n\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)*(2i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i\n\n(1 + i)^4 = (1 + i)*(-2 + 2i) = -2 + 2i - 2i + 2i^2 = -2 + 0i - 2 = -4\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check:\n\n(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)*(2i) = 1*(2i) + i*(2i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i. Okay, that's correct.\n\nThen (1 + i)^4 = (1 + i)*(-2 + 2i) = 1*(-2) + 1*(2i) + i*(-2) + i*(2i) = -2 + 2i - 2i + 2i^2 = -2 + 0i + 2*(-1) = -2 - 2 = -4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought [sqrt(2)]^10 = 32, and the angle gives i, so (1 + i)^10 = 32i. But according to this pattern, (1 + i)^4 = -4, which doesn't immediately help me see how to get to (1 + i)^10 = 32i.\n\nMaybe I should try to express (1 + i)^10 in terms of (1 + i)^4.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Perhaps De Moivre's Theorem is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the binomial theorem to expand (1 + i)^10, but that would involve calculating a lot of terms, which might be time-consuming.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem:\n\n(1 + i)^10 = sum from k=0 to 10 of (10 choose k) * 1^(10 - k) * i^k = sum from k=0 to 10 of (10 choose k) * i^k.\n\nNow, i^k cycles every 4: i^0 = 1, i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1, and so on.\n\nSo, I can group the terms in sets of 4.\n\nBut this still seems cumbersome for an exponent as large as 10.\n\nComparing this to the De Moivre's Theorem method, which gave me the answer quickly, I think De Moivre's Theorem is the most efficient way to solve this problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 32i.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
