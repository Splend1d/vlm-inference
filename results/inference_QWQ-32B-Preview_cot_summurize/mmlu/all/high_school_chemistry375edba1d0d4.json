                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about the entropy change for the vaporization of water. The molar heat of vaporization is given as +43.9 kJ, and I need to find the entropy change. The options are A. 8.49 J mol^-1 K^-1, B. 4.184 J mol^-1 K^-1, C. 2.78 J mol^-1 K^-1, and D. 118 J mol^-1 K^-1.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what entropy is and how it relates to heat and temperature. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, and it's often associated with the dispersal of energy. In thermodynamics, entropy change can be calculated using the heat transferred divided by the temperature at which the transfer occurs, especially for reversible processes.\n\nThe formula that comes to mind is:\n\n\u0394S = q_rev / T\n\nWhere \u0394S is the entropy change, q_rev is the reversible heat transfer, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\n\nIn the case of vaporization, heat is absorbed by the system (water) to change its state from liquid to gas. So, the heat of vaporization (\u0394H_vap) is positive, as given (+43.9 kJ). This heat is essentially the q_rev for the vaporization process.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is indeed the case. Is the vaporization process reversible? Well, phase changes at constant temperature and pressure are typically considered reversible, so I think it's okay to use this formula here.\n\nNow, I need to know the temperature at which this vaporization is occurring. Since it's not specified, I'll assume it's at the normal boiling point of water, which is 100\u00b0C or 373.15 K. Unless otherwise stated, I think this is a safe assumption.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\u0394S = q_rev / T = \u0394H_vap / T\n\nGiven that \u0394H_vap = +43.9 kJ = 43900 J (since 1 kJ = 1000 J), and T = 373.15 K,\n\n\u0394S = 43900 J / 373.15 K \u2248 117.6 J K^-1 mol^-1\n\nLooking at the options, D is 118 J mol^-1 K^-1, which is very close to my calculation. So, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe the question is expecting something different. Perhaps it's not assuming the normal boiling point. Maybe it's at a different temperature.\n\nLet me see if there's a way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the relationship between enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. For a phase transition at constant temperature and pressure, the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G) should be zero.\n\nSo, \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S = 0\n\nTherefore, \u0394H = T\u0394S\n\nSo, \u0394S = \u0394H / T\n\nThis is the same equation I used earlier. So, I'm confident that this is the right approach.\n\nGiven that, and using the normal boiling point temperature, my calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the entropy change per mole of water, but my calculation already is per mole since the molar heat of vaporization is given.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the units. The options are in J mol^-1 K^-1, and my calculation gave me J K^-1 mol^-1, which is the same thing.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me look back at the options:\n\nA. 8.49 J mol^-1 K^-1\n\nB. 4.184 J mol^-1 K^-1\n\nC. 2.78 J mol^-1 K^-1\n\nD. 118 J mol^-1 K^-1\n\nMy calculation gives approximately 117.6 J mol^-1 K^-1, which rounds to 118 J mol^-1 K^-1.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me by giving the molar heat of vaporization in kJ, and I need to make sure I convert it to Joules correctly.\n\nYes, 43.9 kJ is 43900 J, which I did correctly.\n\nAnd the temperature is 373.15 K, which is standard.\n\nSo, I don't see any mistakes in my calculation.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
