                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which statement supply-side economists would disagree with. Let's see what each option says.\n\nOption A: \"Tax changes cause shifts in aggregate supply that work against shifts in aggregate demand, thus reducing the effect of the tax change on real GDP.\" Hmm, supply-side economists focus on how changes in tax policies can affect the supply side of the economy, like incentives to work, save, and invest. So, if tax changes shift aggregate supply in a way that counters shifts in aggregate demand, that might not align with their view that tax changes primarily affect supply.\n\nOption B: \"A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by boosting saving, investment, and thus capital accumulation.\" This sounds like something supply-side economists would agree with. They believe that reducing taxes can encourage people to save and invest more, which leads to more capital available for businesses, thereby increasing productive capacity and shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right.\n\nOption C: \"A tax increase is likely to decrease aggregate supply by decreasing after-tax wages and thus providing disincentives to work.\" Again, this seems consistent with supply-side economics. If taxes go up, people take home less of their earnings, which might make them less willing to work or put in extra hours. This could reduce the labor supply and shift the aggregate supply curve to the left.\n\nOption D: \"A tax cut is likely to increase aggregate supply by providing greater rewards for risk-taking.\" This also aligns with supply-side economics. Lower taxes can make entrepreneurial activities and investments more attractive because the rewards are higher after tax. This could lead to more innovation and business creation, increasing the economy's productive capacity.\n\nSo, looking back at option A, it seems to suggest that tax changes affect aggregate supply in a way that offsets changes in aggregate demand, thereby moderating the impact on real GDP. Supply-side economists might disagree with this because they emphasize the direct effects of tax changes on supply, rather than on demand. They might argue that tax cuts can stimulate supply, leading to economic growth, rather than just offsetting demand-side changes.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Supply-side economics is all about how changes in incentives, particularly through tax policy, can affect the supply of goods and services in an economy. So, if option A is saying that tax changes affect supply in a way that counteracts demand changes, that might contradict the supply-side view that tax changes have independent and significant effects on supply.\n\nMaybe I should consider what supply-side economists would prioritize. They would likely focus on how tax cuts can increase work effort, savings, and investment, all of which are supply-side factors. So, options B, C, and D are all in line with that perspective. Option A, however, seems to downplay the direct supply effects and instead suggests that supply shifts counteract demand shifts, which might not be the supply-side view.\n\nPerhaps another way to look at it is to consider the short-run and long-run effects. Supply-side economists might argue that tax changes have long-run effects on the economy's productive capacity, whereas option A seems to be describing a short-run adjustment where supply shifts offset demand shifts, perhaps stabilizing real GDP.\n\nGiven that, I think supply-side economists would disagree with option A because it doesn't capture their view that tax changes can have independent and lasting effects on the economy's supply side.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
