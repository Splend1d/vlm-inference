I remember reading somewhere that a significant number of capital cases are overturned due to serious errors, but I don't recall the exact percentage. Maybe I should look it up to be sure.\n\nLet me see. There have been studies on this topic, right? I think some research has been done on the rate of serious errors in capital cases, and how many of them are overturned as a result. I just need to recall or find out what that percentage is.\n\nOption A says under 50 percent. That seems too low. I feel like more than half of capital cases are overturned due to serious errors. Option B is 52 percent, which is just over 50, but still, I have a feeling it's higher than that. Option C is 68 percent, and D is 82 percent. Between those two, 68 seems more reasonable, but I'm not confident.\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. What does \"serious errors\" entail? Does it include procedural errors, misconduct, new evidence, etc.? I imagine there are various reasons why capital cases are overturned. Perhaps the percentage is higher than I think.\n\nWait a minute, I recall a study that suggested a high percentage of capital cases have serious errors. In fact, I think it was around 68 percent, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 82 percent. That seems really high, but if you consider all the possible errors that can occur in a capital case, it might be plausible.\n\nLet me consider the source. Where did I hear about this? I think it was in a law class or maybe in a news article about capital punishment and the justice system. I seem to remember that a significant proportion of capital cases are overturned due to serious errors.\n\nIf I had to choose, I would go with C. 68 percent. But honestly, I'm not entirely sure. It's a bit of a guess.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
