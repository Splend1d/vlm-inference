                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option fits best for tertiary prevention in a school setting. First, I need to remember what tertiary prevention is. I know that in health and education, prevention is often divided into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary.\n\nPrimary prevention is about stopping problems before they start. It's proactive and aims to prevent issues from occurring in the first place. For example, teaching students about healthy habits or providing social skills training.\n\nSecondary prevention is about early intervention. It targets students who show signs of potential problems and provides them with support before those problems become more serious. This might include screening for issues like depression or substance abuse and offering targeted interventions.\n\nTertiary prevention, on the other hand, is about providing comprehensive support to students who already have established problems. The goal is to help them manage their issues, prevent further deterioration, and promote recovery or rehabilitation.\n\nSo, in a school setting, tertiary prevention would involve working with students who have already experienced significant difficulties and may require more intensive support.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Individual counseling for students resuming from an institutional care facility.\n\nThis seems like it could be tertiary prevention. Students who have been in institutional care likely have experienced significant challenges and may require intensive support as they readjust to school life. Individual counseling can provide them with the necessary resources to handle their issues and integrate back into the school environment.\n\nB. Career guidance offered to students unsure about plans after graduation.\n\nThis seems more like a developmental service or a part of secondary prevention. While it's important, it doesn't necessarily target students with established problems. It's more about helping all students plan for their future, which is a general educational service.\n\nC. Small-group counseling of students affected by initial stages of divorce.\n\nThis might be considered secondary prevention. The initial stages of divorce suggest that the students are experiencing recent changes and may be at risk for emotional or behavioral issues, but they haven't yet developed full-blown problems. Small-group counseling can provide them with support and coping strategies before any issues escalate.\n\nD. Large-group programs emphasizing the development of children's self-esteem.\n\nThis sounds like primary prevention. These programs aim to build resilience and positive qualities in all students to prevent future problems. By enhancing self-esteem, students are better equipped to handle challenges they may face.\n\nComparing these options, A seems to be the most aligned with tertiary prevention, as it involves individual counseling for students who have already been in institutional care and are returning to school. This suggests that they have had significant life experiences that may require intensive support to address.\n\nOption C, while important, seems more geared towards students who are just beginning to experience the effects of divorce, which aligns more with secondary prevention.\n\nOption B is more about career development and doesn't specifically target students with established problems.\n\nOption D is a broad, proactive approach to prevent future issues, which is primary prevention.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
