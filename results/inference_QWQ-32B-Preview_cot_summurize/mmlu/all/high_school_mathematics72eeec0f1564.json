                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: express \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\) as a common fraction. The options are A) \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\), B) \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\), C) \\(\\frac{8}{7}\\), and D) \\(\\frac{8}{33}\\). Hmm, I'm not super confident with repeating decimals and fractions, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\) means. The notation means that the digit 7 repeats indefinitely after the decimal, so it's 0.17777..., right? So, it's 0.1 plus 0.07777... repeating.\n\nI remember that to convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, I can use algebra. Let me try setting \\(x = 0.1\\overline{7}\\). So, \\(x = 0.17777...\\).\n\nMaybe I can manipulate this equation to get rid of the repeating part. If I multiply both sides by 10, I get \\(10x = 1.7777...\\). Now, if I subtract the original \\(x = 0.17777...\\) from this, it should eliminate the repeating part.\n\nSo, \\(10x - x = 1.7777... - 0.17777...\\), which simplifies to \\(9x = 1.6\\). Then, \\(x = \\frac{1.6}{9}\\).\n\nWait, but 1.6 is the same as \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\), so \\(x = \\frac{8}{5} \\div 9 = \\frac{8}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{45}\\).\n\nOh, that's interesting. So, \\(x = \\frac{8}{45}\\). Looking back at the options, that's option A. But let me double-check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can think of the decimal as a sum of its parts. The 0.1 is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\), and the 0.07777... is a geometric series.\n\nSo, 0.07777... can be written as \\(0.07 + 0.007 + 0.0007 + ...\\), which is a geometric series with first term \\(a = 0.07\\) and common ratio \\(r = 0.1\\).\n\nThe sum of an infinite geometric series is \\(s = \\frac{a}{1 - r}\\), so \\(s = \\frac{0.07}{1 - 0.1} = \\frac{0.07}{0.9} = \\frac{7}{90}\\).\n\nThen, the total is \\(0.1 + 0.07777... = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{7}{90}\\). To add these fractions, I need a common denominator, which is 90.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{9}{90}\\), and \\(\\frac{9}{90} + \\frac{7}{90} = \\frac{16}{90} = \\frac{8}{45}\\).\n\nAgain, I get \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\), which is option A. That seems consistent.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe treating the entire decimal as a fraction directly.\n\nSo, \\(0.1\\overline{7} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{7}{100} + \\frac{7}{1000} + \\frac{7}{10000} + ...\\)\n\nThis is again a geometric series with the first term \\(\\frac{7}{100}\\) and common ratio \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\), plus the initial \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\).\n\nSo, sum = \\(\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{\\frac{7}{100}}{1 - \\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{\\frac{7}{100}}{\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{7}{100} \\times \\frac{10}{9} = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{7}{90} = \\frac{9}{90} + \\frac{7}{90} = \\frac{16}{90} = \\frac{8}{45}\\).\n\nOnce again, I end up with \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\). It seems like no matter which method I use, I get the same answer.\n\nLet me just quickly check if \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\) is indeed equal to \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\). If I divide 8 by 45, what do I get?\n\n8 divided by 45: 45 goes into 8 zero times, so 0., then 45 goes into 80 once, giving 45, subtract to get 35. Bring down a 0 to make it 350. 45 goes into 350 seven times (315), subtract to get 35. Bring down a 0 to make it 350 again. This process repeats indefinitely, so it's 0.1777..., which matches \\(0.1\\overline{7}\\).\n\nPerfect, that confirms it. So, the correct answer is \\(\\frac{8}{45}\\), which is option A.\n\nNow, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let's look at the other options. Option B is \\(\\frac{8}{5}\\), which is 1.6, way larger than 0.1777... Option C is \\(\\frac{8}{7}\\), which is approximately 1.1428..., also much larger. Option D is \\(\\frac{8}{33}\\), which is approximately 0.2424..., which is not equal to 0.1777...\n\nSo, definitely, option A is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{8}{45}} \\]"
