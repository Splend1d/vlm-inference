                    "text": "C. tardive dyskinesia\n\nChlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. One of the most significant concerns associated with its long-term use is the development of tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, repetitive body movements, often affecting the face, lips, tongue, and extremities.\n\nTardive dyskinesia occurs due to the prolonged blockade of dopamine receptors in the brain by chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic medications. This chronic dopamine receptor blockade can lead to supersensitivity of these receptors, resulting in abnormal involuntary movements.\n\nWhile chlorpromazine can cause other side effects, such as orthostatic hypotension, anticholinergic effects, and rarely, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia is a particular concern with long-term use.\n\nOption A, acute hypertensive crisis, is not typically associated with chlorpromazine use. In fact, chlorpromazine can cause a decrease in blood pressure due to its alpha-adrenergic blocking properties.\n\nOption B, profound anterograde amnesia, is not a known side effect of chlorpromazine. Anterograde amnesia is more commonly associated with conditions affecting the brain's memory centers, such as Korsakoff's syndrome or certain types of brain injury.\n\nOption D, renal toxicity, is not a primary concern with chlorpromazine. While all medications have the potential to affect kidney function, chlorpromazine is not known for causing significant renal toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. tardive dyskinesia.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- Davis, J.
