So, the correct answer is B. 3%.\n\nTo provide some context, the U.S. has consistently spent a significant portion of its GDP on defense, and 3% is in line with historical trends. This expenditure covers a wide range of areas including personnel costs, research and development, procurement of equipment, and operations and maintenance.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while 3% may seem low, given the size of the U.S. economy, this translates into a very large absolute amount, making the U.S. the world's largest military spender. For example, in 2017, the U.S. spent over $600 billion on its military, which is more than the next few highest spending countries combined.\n\nSo, even though 3% of GDP might not sound like a lot, it represents a substantial investment in national defense.\n\n**Reference:**\n- Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).
