                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: There's a sporting goods store that's offering a 10% discount on in-line skates that normally cost $110.99. I need to figure out how much the skates will cost with the discount, not including tax. The options are A. $99.89, B. $99.99, C. $100.99, and D. $109.88.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what a 10% discount means. Basically, it means I get to save 10% off the original price. So, to find out how much I save, I need to calculate 10% of $110.99.\n\nI know that to find a percentage of a number, I can multiply the number by the percentage, but I have to remember to convert the percentage to a decimal first. So, 10% as a decimal is 0.10.\n\nSo, the amount I save is $110.99 multiplied by 0.10.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 110.99 \u00d7 0.10 = 11.099.\n\nWait, that's $11.099, but money is usually rounded to the nearest cent, so that would be $11.10.\n\nNow, to find the discounted price, I need to subtract the amount I save from the original price.\n\nSo, $110.99 - $11.10.\n\nLet me do that subtraction: 110.99 - 11.10 = 99.89.\n\nSo, the skates would cost $99.89 with the discount.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is $99.89, B is $99.99, C is $100.99, and D is $109.88.\n\nSo, A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAnother way to think about a 10% discount is that you're paying 90% of the original price. Because 100% - 10% = 90%.\n\nSo, if I calculate 90% of $110.99, that should give me the discounted price directly.\n\nAgain, converting 90% to a decimal is 0.90.\n\nSo, $110.99 \u00d7 0.90.\n\nLet me calculate that: 110.99 \u00d7 0.90 = 99.891.\n\nRounded to the nearest cent, that's still $99.89.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which reinforces that A. $99.89 is correct.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility of tax being involved, but the problem specifically says \"not including tax,\" so I don't need to worry about that.\n\nAlright, I think I've got it. The answer is A. $99.89.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
