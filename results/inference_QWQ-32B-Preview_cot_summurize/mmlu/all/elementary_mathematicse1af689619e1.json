                    "text": "Let's see. Erin made 12 pints of juice, and she drinks 3 cups of juice each day. I need to find out how many days it will take her to drink all of the juice she made. The options are 2, 4, 8, or 9 days.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that the units are the same because she has pints of juice but drinks in cups. I know that 1 pint is equal to 2 cups. So, I can convert the pints to cups to make it easier to calculate.\n\nErin made 12 pints of juice. Since 1 pint is 2 cups, 12 pints would be:\n\n12 pints \u00d7 2 cups/pint = 24 cups\n\nSo, she has 24 cups of juice in total.\n\nNow, she drinks 3 cups of juice each day. To find out how many days it will take her to drink all 24 cups, I can divide the total cups by the number of cups she drinks per day:\n\n24 cups \u00f7 3 cups/day = 8 days\n\nSo, it will take her 8 days to drink all of the juice.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 8 days.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, conversion from pints to cups: 1 pint = 2 cups\n\n12 pints \u00d7 2 cups/pint = 24 cups. That seems correct.\n\nThen, dividing the total cups by the daily consumption: 24 cups \u00f7 3 cups/day = 8 days. That also seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it differently. Since 1 pint is 2 cups, and she drinks 3 cups per day, I can figure out how many pints she drinks per day.\n\n3 cups \u00f7 2 cups/pint = 1.5 pints per day\n\nThen, to drink 12 pints, it would be:\n\n12 pints \u00f7 1.5 pints/day = 8 days\n\nAgain, I get 8 days.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see how many days it takes to drink the juice. If she drinks 3 cups per day, and there are 24 cups in total, then 24 \u00f7 3 = 8 days.\n\nI think 8 days is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe the juice is being consumed in pints instead of cups, but no, the problem says she drinks 3 cups per day, not pints.\n\nAlso, I should confirm the conversion factor. Yes, in the U.S. measurement system, 1 pint is equal to 2 cups.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 8 days, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nErin made 12 pints of juice. Since 1 pint equals 2 cups, the total juice in cups is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n12 \\text{ pints} \\times 2 \\text{ cups per pint} = 24 \\text{ cups}\n\\]\n\nErin drinks 3 cups of juice each day. To find out how many days it will take her to drink all the juice, we divide the total cups by the daily consumption:\n\n\\[\n24 \\text{ cups} \\div 3 \\text{ cups per day} = 8 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nThus, it will take Erin 8 days to drink all the juice she made."
