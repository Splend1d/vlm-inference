(P \u2261 D) \u2261 G\n\nB. (D \u2022 G) \u2283 P\n\nC. P \u2283 (D \u2022 G)\n\nD. P \u2261 (D \u2022 G)\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. It's a conditional statement with \"if and only if,\" which means it's a biconditional. So, Pablo goes to the store exactly when his brother drives him and pays for gas.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- P: Pablo will go to the store.\n\n- D: His brother drives him.\n\n- G: His brother pays for gas.\n\nThe sentence is \"P if and only if D and G.\"\n\nIn logic, \"if and only if\" is represented by the biconditional operator, which is \u2261.\n\nSo, P \u2261 (D and G).\n\nIn logical notation, \"and\" is represented by \u2022.\n\nTherefore, P \u2261 (D \u2022 G).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (P \u2261 D) \u2261 G: This says that P is equivalent to D, and that equivalence is equivalent to G. That's not what the sentence is saying.\n\nB. (D \u2022 G) \u2283 P: This says that if D and G, then P. That's only one direction of the biconditional.\n\nC. P \u2283 (D \u2022 G): This says that if P, then D and G. Again, only one direction.\n\nD. P \u2261 (D \u2022 G): This matches what I came up with: P is equivalent to D and G.\n\nSo, the best answer seems to be D.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nThe sentence is \"P if and only if D and G.\"\n\nOption D directly translates to \"P if and only if D and G,\" which matches the sentence.\n\nOption A is different; it's saying \"P is equivalent to D, and that is equivalent to G,\" which is not the same as the original sentence.\n\nOptions B and C are only one-way conditionals, not biconditionals.\n\nTherefore, D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
