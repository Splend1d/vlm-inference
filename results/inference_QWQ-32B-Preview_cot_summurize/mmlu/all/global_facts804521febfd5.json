                    "text": "Let's see. I need to evaluate these two statements about life satisfaction and happiness based on economic conditions and life events.\n\nThe first statement says that as countries get richer, their population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. I think this makes sense because generally, wealthier countries can provide better standards of living, healthcare, education, and overall quality of life. There's something called the Easterlin paradox, but I think that's more about whether happiness increases with income within a country over time. Maybe I need to recall that research.\n\nThe second statement is about how important life events like marriage or divorce affect happiness but have surprisingly little long-term impact. I've heard about this before. It's often referred to as the hedonic treadmill or hedonic adaptation, where people tend to return to a baseline level of happiness after positive or negative events.\n\nSo, for the first statement, I believe it's true that richer countries tend to have higher reported life satisfaction. For the second statement, I also think it's true that major life events have temporary effects on happiness but people adapt over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check. Maybe there are exceptions or recent studies that challenge these views.\n\nWait, I remember that while there is a general trend that richer countries have higher life satisfaction, there are also exceptions and other factors at play. For example, some less wealthy countries have high life satisfaction due to strong social connections or other cultural factors. Also, beyond a certain point, increases in income may not lead to proportionate increases in happiness.\n\nAs for the second statement, research does show that life events like marriage can increase happiness, but over time, people adapt, and their happiness levels return to baseline. Similarly, after negative events like divorce, happiness may decrease but then recover over time.\n\nSo, overall, both statements seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
