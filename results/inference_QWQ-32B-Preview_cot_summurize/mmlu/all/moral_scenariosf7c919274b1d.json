The scenarios are:\n\n1. I throw a ball quickly to another child.\n\n2. I perused through a jewelry store over the weekend.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I throw a ball quickly to another child.\n\nThrowing a ball to another child seems like a normal activity, maybe they're playing a game. But it says \"quickly,\" which might imply that it's fast or perhaps without considering the other child's ability to catch it. However, in general, playing and throwing a ball is not morally wrong. Unless, of course, it's done in a way that could harm the other child intentionally or recklessly. But based on the information given, it seems like just a regular action between children playing.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I perused through a jewelry store over the weekend.\n\nPerusing means looking around or browsing. So, the main character is just looking at jewelry in the store. That's a standard activity when you're shopping or just browsing in a store. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. Unless, perhaps, they were handling items\u7c97\u66b4\u5730 or stealing something, but the scenario doesn't mention any of that. So, it seems like a normal action.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios seem not to involve anything clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the ball is thrown too quickly and could potentially hurt the other child, some might argue that it's negligent or morally wrong to endanger someone else's safety. However, in the context of playing games, children often engage in activities that have some level of risk, and it's generally accepted as part of play, especially if both parties consent and are aware of the risks.\n\nIn Scenario 2, perusing a jewelry store is a common activity. It's not wrong to look at items in a store, even if you don't buy anything. Some stores might not appreciate people browsing without buying, but it's not considered morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
