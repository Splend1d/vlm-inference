                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about electricity access in South Sudan in 2016. The options are 9%, 29%, 59%, or 79%. I don't remember the exact statistic, but I know that South Sudan is a country that gained independence in 2011, so it's a relatively new nation. I think that might affect its infrastructure, including electricity.\n\nFirst, I should consider what I know about South Sudan's development status. I believe it's one of the least developed countries in the world, facing various challenges like civil war, poverty, and inadequate infrastructure. So, I would guess that electricity access isn't very high there.\n\nLooking at the options, 79% seems too high for a country with such recent independence and ongoing issues. Even 59% might be too optimistic. Maybe 29% is more realistic, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 9% seems very low, but given the circumstances, it might be possible.\n\nI recall that in some Sub-Saharan African countries, electricity access is around 40-50%, but South Sudan might be an exception due to its specific circumstances.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that electricity access is often higher in urban areas compared to rural areas. In South Sudan, the population is mostly rural, which might mean lower overall access.\n\nI also think about the role of the government and external aid in providing electricity. If the government is unstable or there's limited investment in infrastructure, electricity access might be low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are some rural electrification programs or private sector initiatives that have improved access somewhat.\n\nI should probably look for some reliable sources to find the actual statistic. Maybe check reports from international organizations like the World Bank or the International Energy Agency.\n\nWait, the question is about 2016 specifically. I need to find data from that year.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've seen any statistics about electricity access in South Sudan around that time.\n\nI seem to remember that in some African countries, electricity access has been increasing over the years, but again, South Sudan might be different.\n\nPerhaps I can eliminate some options. 79% seems too high for a country with its challenges. 59% might be possible if there was significant investment in electricity infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, 9% seems extremely low, but given the circumstances, it's possible.\n\nMaybe 29% is a reasonable estimate.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of population without electricity.\n\nIf it's 9% with electricity, that means 91% without, which seems high.\n\nBut if it's 29% with electricity, that's 71% without, which still seems significant.\n\nAlternatively, 59% with electricity would be 41% without, and 79% with electricity would be 21% without.\n\nGiven the context, I think 29% might be the most plausible option.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider the impact of the civil war on electricity infrastructure.\n\nThe civil war in South Sudan started in 2013, so by 2016, it would have been in its third year. That likely had a detrimental effect on infrastructure, including electricity.\n\nSo, perhaps the electricity access was\u8f83\u4f4e in 2016 due to the conflict.\n\nIn that case, 9% might be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the conflict didn't completely destroy the electricity infrastructure, and some areas still had access.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nI know that in rural areas of South Sudan, access to electricity is likely much lower than in urban areas.\n\nIf the majority of the population lives in rural areas, then overall access would be lower.\n\nSuppose that in urban areas, access is around 50%, and in rural areas, it's around 10%.\n\nIf the population is, say, 20% urban and 80% rural, then the overall access would be:\n\n(0.2 * 50%) + (0.8 * 10%) = 10% + 8% = 18%.\n\nThat's just a rough estimate, and it's lower than any of the options provided.\n\nWait, but maybe in urban areas, access is higher, like 70%, and in rural areas, it's 5%.\n\nThen, overall access would be:\n\n(0.2 * 70%) + (0.8 * 5%) = 14% + 4% = 18%.\n\nStill, that's only 18%, which is lower than the lowest option, 9%.\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe my assumptions about urban and rural access are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the urban population is higher than 20%.\n\nLet's assume urban population is 30%, with 70% rural.\n\nIf urban access is 70% and rural access is 5%, then:\n\n(0.3 * 70%) + (0.7 * 5%) = 21% + 3.5% = 24.5%.\n\nStill lower than the lowest option.\n\nWait, but according to the United Nations, around 23% of South Sudan's population lives in urban areas.\n\nSo, using that:\n\nUrban access: 70%\n\nRural access: 5%\n\nOverall access: (0.23 * 70%) + (0.77 * 5%) = 16.1% + 3.85% = 19.95%, or approximately 20%.\n\nStill lower than the lowest option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe urban access is higher, say 80%.\n\nThen: (0.23 * 80%) + (0.77 * 5%) = 18.4% + 3.85% = 22.25%.\n\nStill only about 22%.\n\nBut the lowest option is 9%, which is higher than this estimate.\n\nThis suggests that my estimate might be too low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rural access is higher than 5%.\n\nSuppose rural access is 10%.\n\nThen: (0.23 * 80%) + (0.77 * 10%) = 18.4% + 7.7% = 26.1%.\n\nCloser to 29%, which is one of the options.\n\nBut I'm just making assumptions here, and I don't know the actual access rates for urban and rural areas.\n\nThis approach isn't helping me much.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total electricity generation capacity in South Sudan.\n\nI seem to recall that South Sudan has limited electricity generation capacity, relying partly on imports from neighboring countries like Uganda and Sudan.\n\nIf that's the case, then access might be limited.\n\nBut again, without specific data, it's hard to estimate the percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are some statistics about the number of people connected to the electricity grid.\n\nBut I don't have that information at hand.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about the Human Development Index (HDI) for South Sudan in 2016.\n\nI think South Sudan has a low HDI rank, which would correlate with lower electricity access.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in 2016, South Sudan had an HDI rank of around 187 out of 188 countries, which is very low.\n\nThis suggests that access to basic services, including electricity, is likely low.\n\nBut again, that doesn't give me a specific percentage.\n\nLet me try to recall if I've seen any news or reports about electricity access in South Sudan around 2016.\n\nI seem to remember that electricity supply was unreliable and that many people relied on generators or other forms of private electricity generation.\n\nBut in terms of being connected to the grid or having access to electricity, I don't remember the exact percentage.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the electrification rate targets set by the government or international organizations.\n\nBut again, without knowing the specific targets for 2016, that doesn't help much.\n\nMaybe I should consider the progress since independence in 2011.\n\nIn such a short period, it might be challenging to develop extensive electricity infrastructure, especially given the conflict.\n\nSo, perhaps electricity access didn't improve much from pre-independence levels.\n\nIf South Sudan was part of Sudan before 2011, maybe I can look at Sudan's electricity access and assume that South Sudan had a similar or lower rate.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, in 2016, Sudan's electricity access was around 65%.\n\nBut South Sudan might have lower access due to being a poorer region or having less infrastructure investment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reverse is true, and Sudan had lower access.\n\nWait, actually, Sudan is a larger and more developed country compared to South Sudan, so it's likely that Sudan had higher electricity access.\n\nTherefore, South Sudan might have lower access than Sudan's 65%.\n\nSo, 65% is higher than the highest option here, which is 79%, but perhaps South Sudan had lower access.\n\nStill, this doesn't give me a precise estimate.\n\nMaybe I should consider the population size of South Sudan in 2016.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, South Sudan's population in 2016 was approximately 12.2 million people.\n\nBut I don't know how many of them had access to electricity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the number of people per electricity subscriber.\n\nBut again, without data, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider the energy production capacity in South Sudan.\n\nIf I know the total electricity generation and the population, I could estimate the per capita electricity supply, but that still doesn't directly translate to the access rate.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should make an educated guess based on what I know about South Sudan's development status.\n\nGiven that it's a low-income country with recent independence and ongoing conflict, I would guess that electricity access is low.\n\nBetween the options provided, 9% seems too low, but it's possible.\n\n29% seems more plausible.\n\n59% seems a bit high, and 79% seems too high.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards 29%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 9%, but that seems too low.\n\nI think 29% is more reasonable.\n\nTherefore, my answer is B. 29%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
