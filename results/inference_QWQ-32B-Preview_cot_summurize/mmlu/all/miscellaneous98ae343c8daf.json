I recall he was a coach for the St. Louis Rams and won a Super Bowl with them in the late 90s, I think it was 1999 or 2000. Yeah, he definitely coached in the NFL.\n\nNext, Bill Parcells. He's a legendary coach, isn't he? I know he coached teams like the New York Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and New England Patriots, among others. So, definitely NFL experience.\n\nNow, Chuck Noll. He's famous for coaching the Pittsburgh Steelers to multiple Super Bowl victories in the 70s. No doubt about his NFL coaching career.\n\nLastly, Pat Riley. Hmm, I know Pat Riley as a basketball coach. He's won multiple championships in the NBA, coaching teams like the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks. But I don't recall him ever coaching in football, especially not in the NFL.\n\nSo, based on this, I'd say Pat Riley is the one who has never been a head coach in the NFL.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about Pat Riley's coaching career. I know he's predominantly a basketball coach, but perhaps he dabbled in football at some point. Although, I can't recall any such instance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one of the others didn't coach in the NFL, but from what I remember, all three of them\u2014Vermeil, Parcells, and Noll\u2014have\u786e\u786e\u5b9e\u5b9e coached in the NFL.\n\nTherefore, my answer is D. Pat Riley.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
