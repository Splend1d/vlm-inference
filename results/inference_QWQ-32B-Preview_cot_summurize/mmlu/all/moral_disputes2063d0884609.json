According to Confucianism, becoming a person is about learning through familial relationships and following the examples set by others, especially those who are virtuous and wise. Confucianism places a strong emphasis on filial piety and the roles within the family as foundational for personal development.\n\nOption B seems more aligned with Western philosophical or religious views, particularly those influenced by Christianity or Platonic thought, where the concept of an immortal soul is central to human personhood.\n\nOption C sounds similar to the Aristotelian view of developing rational capacities through education and experience, which is a key aspect of becoming a fully realized person in Aristotelian ethics.\n\nSince Confucianism has its own distinct approach, focusing on social relationships and moral exemplars, I believe A is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
