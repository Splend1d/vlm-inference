                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out what happens to the North Star, Polaris, when you travel north from the United States into Canada. So, I need to think about how the position of stars changes with latitude.\n\nFirst, I know that Polaris is located almost directly above the North Pole. That means its position in the sky is related to your latitude. The higher your latitude, the higher Polaris appears in the sky.\n\nSo, if I'm moving north from the U.S. into Canada, I'm increasing my latitude. That should mean Polaris gets higher in the sky. So, option C seems likely.\n\nBut let me double-check. Does Polaris get brighter as you go north? I don't think so. Its brightness should remain more or less the same, regardless of your location, assuming similar viewing conditions.\n\nWhat about dimmer? That doesn't make sense either. If anything, as you go north, it should be more visible, not less.\n\nHigher in the sky makes sense because the angle of Polaris above the horizon increases with latitude.\n\nLower in the sky would be the opposite of what I expect.\n\nWait, actually, as you go north, your latitude increases, and Polaris should appear higher in the sky. So, yes, C seems correct.\n\nBut let me think about this differently. Imagine you're at the equator. Polaris would be right on the horizon, at zero degrees altitude. As you move towards the North Pole, Polaris rises in the sky, reaching 90 degrees directly overhead at the pole.\n\nSo, traveling north from the U.S. into Canada, which is moving towards the North Pole, should mean Polaris appears higher in the sky.\n\nIs there any other factor that could affect this? Maybe atmospheric conditions or light pollution, but assuming those are similar, the main effect should be the change in latitude.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Higher in the sky.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider the other options again.\n\nA. Brighter - Polaris's intrinsic brightness doesn't change with your location.\n\nB. Dimmer - Again, no, that's not how stars work.\n\nD. Lower in the sky - This would be if you were going south, towards the equator, but not north.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. Higher in the sky.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
