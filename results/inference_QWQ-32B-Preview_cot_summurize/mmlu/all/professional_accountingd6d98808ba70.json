                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Alto Co. decided to split its common stock 5 for 1, and the fair value was $100 per share before the split. Initially, there were 10,000 shares outstanding with a par value of $10 each.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a stock split means. A stock split increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally decreasing the price per share. In this case, a 5 for 1 split means that for every 1 share an investor owns, they will receive 5 shares. So, the number of shares will increase by a factor of 5.\n\nLet's calculate the new number of shares outstanding after the split:\n\nOriginal shares outstanding: 10,000\n\nSplit ratio: 5 for 1\n\nNew shares outstanding: 10,000 * 5 = 50,000 shares\n\nNow, regarding the par value. Par value is a nominal value assigned to each share by the company, and it doesn't necessarily reflect the market value. When a stock split occurs, the par value per share is adjusted to reflect the new number of shares.\n\nThe total par value of the shares remains the same before and after the split because the company's capital structure doesn't change; it's just divided into more shares.\n\nSo, total par value before the split:\n\nOriginal shares outstanding: 10,000\n\nPar value per share: $10\n\nTotal par value: 10,000 * $10 = $100,000\n\nAfter the split, the total par value should still be $100,000, but now divided among 50,000 shares.\n\nTherefore, new par value per share:\n\nTotal par value: $100,000\n\nNew shares outstanding: 50,000\n\nNew par value per share: $100,000 / 50,000 = $2 per share\n\nSo, the par value is reduced from $10 to $2 per share.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check that. The question is asking for the par value after the split, and according to my calculation, it should be $2 per share.\n\nBut let's consider the options provided:\n\nA. Remained at $10.\n\nB. Was reduced to $8.\n\nC. Was reduced to $5.\n\nD. Was reduced to $2.\n\nMy calculation suggests option D is correct.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any other factor that might affect the par value. For instance, does the fair market value of $100 per share before the split have any impact on the par value?\n\nActually, no. Par value is a stated value by the company and is not directly related to the market value. So, the fair value should not affect the par value calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Was reduced to $2.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to look at this.\n\nSome companies might not change the par value during a stock split, but instead, adjust the number of shares. But in standard practice, when a stock split occurs, the par value per share is adjusted proportionally.\n\nGiven that it's a 5 for 1 split, the par value should be divided by 5.\n\n$10 / 5 = $2\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the par value remained the same at $10, the total par value would increase by a factor of 5, which wouldn't make sense because the company's stated capital shouldn't increase without issuing new shares or declaring additional capital.\n\nTherefore, to maintain the same total par value, the par value per share must decrease proportionally to the increase in the number of shares.\n\nHence, the par value is reduced to $2 per share.\n\nI think option D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
