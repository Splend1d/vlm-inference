                    "text": "So Jimmy and Kima are going on a trip and they're planning to drive for three days. The distances they'll cover each day are 182 miles, 439 miles, and 217 miles. We need to estimate the total miles they'll drive over these three days, and choose the expression that's closest to the actual sum.\n\nFirst, let's look at the distances:\n\n- Day 1: 182 miles\n\n- Day 2: 439 miles\n\n- Day 3: 217 miles\n\nTo estimate, we should round each of these distances to the nearest hundred or to numbers that are easy to work with mentally.\n\nStarting with Day 1: 182 miles.\n\n- 182 is closer to 200 than to 100, so we can round it up to 200 miles.\n\nNext, Day 2: 439 miles.\n\n- 439 is closer to 400 than to 500. Some might argue it's closer to 450, but standard rounding rules suggest rounding to the nearest hundred, which is 400 miles.\n\nLastly, Day 3: 217 miles.\n\n- 217 is closer to 200 than to 300, so we can round it down to 200 miles.\n\nNow, adding these estimated distances together:\n\n200 (Day 1) + 400 (Day 2) + 200 (Day 3) = 800 miles\n\nSo, the closest estimate should be 200 + 400 + 200, which is option B.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options to make sure:\n\nOption A: 150 + 400 + 200 = 750 miles\n\nOption C: 200 + 450 + 200 = 850 miles\n\nOption D: 200 + 500 + 200 = 900 miles\n\nComparing these to our calculated estimate of 800 miles:\n\n- Option A is 750 miles, which is 50 miles less than 800.\n\n- Option B is 800 miles, which matches our estimate.\n\n- Option C is 850 miles, which is 50 miles more than 800.\n\n- Option D is 900 miles, which is 100 miles more than 800.\n\nSo, Option B is the closest.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there's a better way to estimate. Maybe rounding to the nearest ten would give a more accurate estimate.\n\nLet's try rounding to the nearest ten:\n\n- 182 rounds to 180\n\n- 439 rounds to 440\n\n- 217 rounds to 220\n\nAdding these up: 180 + 440 + 220 = 840 miles\n\nNow, comparing 840 miles to the options:\n\n- Option B (800 miles) is 40 miles less than 840.\n\n- Option C (850 miles) is 10 miles more than 840.\n\nSo, in this case, Option C would be closer to the refined estimate of 840 miles.\n\nBut the problem asks for the closest estimate, and in the first approach, Option B was exact for the rounded to hundred values, while in the second approach, Option C is closer when rounding to the nearest ten.\n\nGiven that the distances are given in units that are closer to hundreds, and considering that the problem is about estimation, rounding to the nearest hundred is acceptable.\n\nMoreover, the problem provides options that are all rounded to hundreds, except Option C has 450, which is rounding to the nearest fifty.\n\nBut since the question is to choose the expression that is the closest estimate, and Option B matches our initial estimation exactly, while Option C is slightly higher, I think Option B is still the best choice.\n\nAdditionally, let's calculate the actual sum to see how our estimates compare.\n\nActual total miles: 182 + 439 + 217\n\nAdding these up:\n\n182 + 439 = 621\n\n621 + 217 = 838 miles\n\nSo the actual total is 838 miles.\n\nNow, comparing the options to 838:\n\n- Option A: 750 miles (difference of 88 miles)\n\n- Option B: 800 miles (difference of 38 miles)\n\n- Option C: 850 miles (difference of 12 miles)\n\n- Option D: 900 miles (difference of 62 miles)\n\nIn this case, Option C is closest to the actual total of 838 miles, with only a 12-mile difference, compared to Option B's 38-mile difference.\n\nWait a minute, that changes things. Initially, I thought Option B was the closest, but based on the actual total, Option C is closer.\n\nSo, perhaps rounding to the nearest ten, as I did earlier, giving 840 miles, which is closer to 838 than 800 is.\n\nTherefore, Option C might be a better choice.\n\nBut let's consider that the problem is about estimation, and the options provided are mostly rounded to hundreds, except for Option C's 450.\n\nMaybe the intention is to round each day's drive to the nearest hundred, which would lead to Option B.\n\nHowever, given that Option C has 450, which is a finer estimation for Day 2's 439 miles, it might be a better choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a mix of rounding methods is allowed to get a closer estimate.\n\nBut sticking to standard rounding rules, where we round each number individually to the nearest hundred, Option B makes sense.\n\nYet, considering the actual total is 838 miles, and Option C sums to 850 miles, which is closer to 838 than Option B's 800 miles.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to choose the option that minimizes the total estimation error.\n\nIn that case, Option C would be the better choice.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to round each day's drive individually and not consider the total.\n\nBut the question is about the closest estimate of the total miles.\n\nGiven that, and since Option C provides a sum closer to the actual total, I think Option C is the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Option C: 200 + 450 + 200.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
