The question is asking us to choose the statement that best reflects what Tolly said. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Changes a lot past age 50\n\nB. Doesn't change past age 50\n\nC. Pretty much stays the same\n\nD. Changes more for women than for men\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Tolly Kleckley discussed in the Senior View. I remember that Tolly talked about how personality tends to stabilize as people get older and that by age 50, most people have developed a consistent personality pattern. So, based on that, it seems like personality doesn't change drastically after age 50.\n\nOption A says \"Changes a lot past age 50.\" That doesn't align with what Tolly said about personality stabilizing.\n\nOption B says \"doesn't change past age 50.\" Well, this might be close, but I think Tolly might have mentioned that there can still be some changes, just not drastic ones.\n\nOption C says \"pretty much stays the same.\" This seems consistent with the idea of personality stabilizing by age 50.\n\nOption D says \"changes more for women than for men.\" Tolly didn't mention any differences based on gender in terms of personality changes after age 50.\n\nGiven this, option C seems to be the best fit. Tolly suggested that personality pretty much stays the same after age 50, as it has stabilized by that point.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should think about why personality might stabilize. As people age, they gain more life experiences, and their personality traits become more\u56fa\u5316\u7684. So, it makes sense that by age 50, personality is fairly set.\n\nAlso, I recall that in psychology, there's a concept called \"personality stability,\" which refers to how consistent personality traits are over time. Research generally shows that personality traits become more stable as people age, with the greatest stability seen in older adulthood.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that Tolly was referring to this stability when discussing personality past age 50.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the correct answer should be C. \"Pretty much stays the same,\" because personality tends to stabilize by age 50 and doesn't change dramatically after that point.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
