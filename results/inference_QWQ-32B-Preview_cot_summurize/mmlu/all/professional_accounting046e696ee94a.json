                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about assessing the tolerable rate of deviations in a test of controls using statistical sampling. This is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what a test of controls is. In auditing, controls are the procedures that management has put in place to ensure that transactions are recorded properly and that the financial statements are accurate. Auditors test these controls to see if they are working as intended.\n\nStatistical sampling is a method auditors use to select a sample of items from a population to test. It helps them make inferences about the entire population based on the sample results.\n\nNow, the tolerable rate of deviations is the maximum rate of deviations from a control that an auditor is willing to accept before they lose confidence in the control's effectiveness.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Deviations from pertinent controls do not affect the risk of material misstatement in the accounting records.\n\nThis seems incorrect because deviations from controls can lead to errors in the accounting records, which could result in material misstatements. So, if controls are not working as they should, the risk of material misstatement increases.\n\nB. Deviations from pertinent controls at a given rate ordinarily result in misstatements at a lower rate.\n\nThis one is a bit confusing. Generally, if there are deviations from controls, it could lead to misstatements. However, it's not necessarily true that deviations at a given rate will result in misstatements at a lower rate. In fact, it might be the opposite: more deviations could lead to more misstatements.\n\nC. When the degree of assurance desired in a sample is high, the auditor should allow for a high level of sampling risk.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. If an auditor wants high assurance, they would typically set a lower level of sampling risk, not a higher one. Sampling risk is the risk that the sample may not be representative of the population, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\nD. Increasing the number of items selected for the test of controls usually increases the tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nThis also seems off. Generally, if an auditor selects a larger sample, they might be able to accept a higher tolerable rate of deviations because the larger sample provides more evidence. However, I'm not entirely sure about this.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the question is about how the tolerable rate of deviations relates to other factors in the audit.\n\nI recall that the tolerable rate of deviations is set by the auditor based on the materiality and the risk of material misstatement. It's the maximum deviation rate that the auditor is willing to accept without changing their assessment of the control's effectiveness.\n\nOption A is clearly incorrect because deviations do affect the risk of material misstatement.\n\nOption B is\u53ef\u7591 because deviations don't necessarily lead to misstatements at a lower rate; it could be higher.\n\nOption C seems wrong because higher assurance would typically mean lower sampling risk, not higher.\n\nOption D might be correct because with a larger sample, the auditor might be more willing to accept a higher tolerable rate of deviations, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, actually, in statistical sampling, the tolerable rate of deviations is set by the auditor before selecting the sample. The sample size is determined based on the tolerable rate, the expected population deviation rate, and the desired level of assurance.\n\nSo, if the auditor wants a higher level of assurance, they might set a lower tolerable rate of deviations, which would require a larger sample size.\n\nWait, that seems contradictory to option D.\n\nOption D says that increasing the sample size increases the tolerable rate of deviations. But actually, with a larger sample size, the auditor can have more confidence in the results and might be willing to set a lower tolerable rate of deviations.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused.\n\nLet me look up some auditing standards or textbooks on this.\n\nAccording to the AICPA Audit Sampling Audit Guide, the tolerable rate of deviation is the maximum rate of deviation from a prescribed control that the auditor is willing to accept without changing the assessment of control risk.\n\nThe sample size for a test of controls is influenced by the tolerable rate of deviation, the expected population deviation rate, and the desired level of assurance.\n\nGenerally, a lower tolerable rate of deviation requires a larger sample size to achieve the same level of assurance.\n\nSo, if an auditor increases the sample size, they can either achieve a higher level of assurance or accept a higher tolerable rate of deviation.\n\nBut in practice, auditors often set the tolerable rate based on their assessment of materiality and risk, and then determine the sample size accordingly.\n\nGiven that, option D might be correct because with a larger sample size, the auditor can accept a higher tolerable rate of deviation while maintaining the same level of assurance.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nLet me consider this: if the sample size is increased, the auditor has more evidence, so they might be willing to accept a higher rate of deviations in the population without losing confidence in the controls.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo, option D could be correct.\n\nBut let's double-check the other options again.\n\nOption A is definitely incorrect because deviations from controls do affect the risk of material misstatement.\n\nOption B is\u53ef\u7591, as deviations don't necessarily lead to misstatements at a lower rate.\n\nOption C is likely incorrect because higher assurance typically requires lower sampling risk, not higher.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination, D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider why option D is correct.\n\nWith a larger sample size, the auditor has more evidence, which allows them to accept a higher tolerable rate of deviations while still maintaining the desired level of assurance.\n\nIn other words, the larger the sample, the higher the tolerable rate of deviations can be, because the auditor has more confidence in the sample results.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
