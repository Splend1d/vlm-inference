I need to figure out how to calculate the day of the week after 706 days from his birthdate.\n\nFirst, I know that a week has 7 days, so every 7 days from his birthdate will land on the same day, Saturday. So, maybe I can find out how many weeks and extra days are in 706 days.\n\nLet me divide 706 by 7 to see how many complete weeks and extra days there are.\n\n706 \u00f7 7 = 100 weeks and 6 days, because 7 times 100 is 700, and 706 minus 700 is 6.\n\nSo, 706 days is equal to 100 weeks and 6 days.\n\nNow, since 100 weeks from his birthdate will still be a Saturday, and then adding 6 more days will bring us to:\n\nSaturday + 1 day = Sunday\n\nSunday + 1 day = Monday\n\nMonday + 1 day = Tuesday\n\nTuesday + 1 day = Wednesday\n\nWednesday + 1 day = Thursday\n\nThursday + 1 day = Friday\n\nSo, 6 days after Saturday is Friday.\n\nTherefore, Carlos will be 706 days old on a Friday.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I add 7 days, it's again Saturday, so 6 days should be Friday.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of modulo 7 arithmetic, but that might be more complicated for this situation.\n\nAnother way is to use Zeller's Congruence or some other formula to find the day of the week for a given date, but since we're dealing with a number of days from a known date, the first method seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I think the answer is Friday.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Friday}} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nTo determine the day of the week 706 days after Carlos's birthdate, we calculate the number of weeks and extra days in 706 days. Dividing 706 by 7 gives 100 weeks and 6 days. Since 100 weeks from the birthdate will still be a Saturday, adding 6 days to Saturday brings us to Friday. Therefore, Carlos will be 706 days old on a Friday."
