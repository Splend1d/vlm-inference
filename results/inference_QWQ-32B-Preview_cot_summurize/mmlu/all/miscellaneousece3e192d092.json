External combustion engine\n\nC. Rotary engine\n\nD. Reaction engine\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with option A, the internal combustion engine. I know that in an internal combustion engine, the fuel is burned inside the engine, specifically within the combustion chamber, where the burning of the fuel creates heat and pressure that drives the mechanical motion, like in most cars today.\n\nOption B is external combustion engine. This seems different because, here, the fuel is burned outside the engine, and the heat generated is used to produce steam or hot air, which then drives the engine. Steam engines, like the ones used in old trains, fit this description.\n\nOption C, rotary engine, sounds like an engine where the movement is rotational, but I think this might refer to a specific type of internal combustion engine, like the Wankel engine, which uses a rotor instead of pistons.\n\nOption D, reaction engine, I think this is something like a rocket engine or a jet engine, where thrust is generated by expelling material in one direction and moving in the opposite direction, based on Newton's third law.\n\nNow, considering an early-nineteenth-century railroad steam engine, I recall that these engines burned coal outside the engine to produce steam, which was then used to drive pistons and move the train.\n\nSo, comparing this to the options:\n\n- It's not an internal combustion engine because the fuel isn't burned inside the engine's combustion chamber.\n\n- It is an external combustion engine because the fuel is burned outside the engine to produce steam.\n\n- It's not a rotary engine, as far as I know, because steam engines of that time used pistons and cylinders, not rotors.\n\n- And it's not a reaction engine because it doesn't rely on expelling material to generate thrust; it uses the pressure of steam to move mechanical parts.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B, external combustion engine.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. Maybe there's a chance it could be something else. For example, could a steam engine be considered a reaction engine? Well, in a way, the steam is expelled from the engine, but the primary movement comes from the steam pushing pistons, not from the reaction of expelling the steam itself.\n\nSo, I think B is still the best answer.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
