The question asks to whom the CPA would be liable: corporate shareholders or corporate bondholders.\n\nFirst, let's understand some key terms:\n\n1. **Unqualified Opinion**: This is the highest level of assurance a CPA can provide on financial statements, indicating that the statements present the financial position and performance of the company fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\n2. **Materially Misstated Financial Statements**: This means that the financial statements contain errors or omissions that are significant enough to influence the decisions of users of those statements.\n\n3. **Fraudulent Issuance**: This implies that the CPA knowingly issued an unqualified opinion despite being aware of the material misstatements.\n\nNow, regarding liability:\n\n- **Shareholders**: These are the owners of the corporation, holding stocks that represent ownership interests.\n\n- **Bondholders**: These are creditors who have loaned money to the corporation in exchange for promissory notes (bonds), which typically promise to pay back the principal amount plus interest at specified times.\n\nWhen a CPA issues an audited financial statement with an unqualified opinion, users of those statements, including shareholders and bondholders, rely on the accuracy and fairness of the presentation. If the CPA has fraudulently issued such an opinion despite knowing about material misstatements, they could be held liable for damages incurred by those who relied on the misstated financials.\n\nIn legal terms, the CPA could be liable for professional negligence or fraud to any party that relied on the audited financial statements. This includes both shareholders and bondholders, as both groups may use the financial statements to make investment decisions or to assess the corporation's financial health.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that the CPA is liable to both corporate shareholders and corporate bondholders in cases where they fraudulently issue an unqualified opinion on materially misstated financial statements.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nOption A indicates liability to both shareholders and bondholders, which aligns with the explanation above.\n\nOptions B, C, and D suggest that the CPA is not liable to one or both groups, which would not hold true in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation by the CPA.\n\nHence, the correct choice is A. Yes Yes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
