                    "text": " I'm trying to recall what Lukianoff and Haidt said about trigger warnings. I remember they discussed how trigger warnings can promote certain types of thinking that might not be healthy. Let's see, the options are fortune-telling, blaming, dichotomous thinking, and resentment.\n\nFirst, fortune-telling sounds like predicting the future in a negative way, maybe expecting bad things to happen. Is that what trigger warnings lead to? Well, trigger warnings are meant to prepare people for potentially distressing content, but I don't know if that directly leads to fortune-telling.\n\nBlaming could be another option. Maybe trigger warnings make people more likely to blame external things for their reactions. But I'm not sure if that's what Lukianoff and Haidt were getting at.\n\nDichotomous thinking sounds like black-and-white thinking, where everything is either good or bad with no middle ground. Could trigger warnings lead to that kind of thinking? Maybe by categorizing content as safe or triggering without acknowledging nuances.\n\nResentment is holding a grudge or feeling anger about past events. I'm not sure how trigger warnings would directly lead to resentment.\n\nLet me think back to the text. I think Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings can encourage a kind of thinking where students see the world as filled with potential threats and become hypersensitive to them. This sounds a bit like fortune-telling, where they anticipate negative events.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's dichotomous thinking, where everything is seen as either safe or triggering, with no in-between. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, in their book \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" they discuss how trigger warnings can be part of a broader trend towards protective measures that may actually harm students by not allowing them to develop resilience.\n\nThey might be arguing that trigger warnings promote a mindset where students blame external triggers for their emotional distress rather than developing coping mechanisms. So, blaming could be a possible answer.\n\nBut I think the most fitting answer is dichotomous thinking because trigger warnings categorize content into safe and unsafe, which can lead to a black-and-white view of the world.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look it up.\n\n[pauses to think]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's resentment because trigger warnings might make students feel victimized and foster a sense of resentment towards the triggers or those who don't acknowledge their sensitivities.\n\nBut I think dichotomous thinking is more directly related to how trigger warnings categorize content.\n\nLet me consider each option again:\n\nA. Fortune-telling: anticipating negative events.\n\nB. Blaming: attributing responsibility for one's emotional distress to external causes.\n\nC. Dichotomous thinking: seeing the world in black and white terms, safe vs. triggering.\n\nD. Resentment: feeling anger or bitterness over perceived injustices.\n\nMaybe it's a combination, but if I had to choose one, I'd go with dichotomous thinking.\n\nBut to be sure, I should remember that Lukianoff and Haidt criticize trigger warnings for potentially creating a culture of overprotection that doesn't allow students to confront challenging ideas and develop emotional resilience.\n\nIn that context, perhaps blaming is a better fit because students might be encouraged to blame external triggers for their discomfort rather than learning to manage their emotions.\n\nAlternatively, resentment could be a byproduct of feeling constantly threatened by potential triggers.\n\nBut I think dichotomous thinking is the most accurate because trigger warnings create a binary classification of content, which can lead to a polarized view of the world.\n\nSo, I'll go with C. dichotomous thinking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
