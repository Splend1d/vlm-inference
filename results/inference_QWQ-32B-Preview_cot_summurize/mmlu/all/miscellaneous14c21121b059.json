                    "text": "Amps are a unit of measurement of electric current. So the correct answer is B. Electric current is the rate at which electric charge flows through a conductor. The ampere, or amp for short, is the standard unit used to measure this flow. One ampere is defined as one coulomb of charge passing through a point in a circuit per second. This means that if you have a current of one amp, one coulomb of charge is moving through the circuit every second.\n\nTo give you a bit more context, let's briefly look at the other options:\n\nA. Electric charge: This is measured in coulombs. Charge is a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to electric forces. It's the amount of electric energy contained in a body.\n\nC. Electric field strength: This is measured in newtons per coulomb (N/C) or volts per meter (V/m). The electric field describes the force that would be exerted on a unit positive charge at a particular point in space.\n\nD. Electric potential: Also known as voltage, it's measured in volts. Electric potential is the potential energy per unit charge at a point in an electric field. It indicates how much work needs to be done to move a unit positive charge from a reference point to that point against the electric field.\n\nSo, while all these terms are related to electricity, amps specifically measure electric current.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
