Let me think about this.\n\nI recall that 'Mystery Science Theater 3000,' or MST3K for short, was a cult television show that aired in the 1990s. It featured a guy trapped on a satellite, forced to watch bad movies, and he and his robot friends would riff on the movies, making fun of them.\n\nI think the term \"MiSTies\" is related to the show. I remember seeing that term used online by people who were fans of the show. They would call themselves MiSTies. But maybe I'm wrong.\n\nLet me consider the other options. \"Mysterians\" sounds familiar because in one of the episodes, there was a movie called \"Invasion of the Astro-Monkeys,\" but I don't think that's related to the fan name.\n\n\"Bot Brigade\" might refer to the robots on the show, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, but I don't think that's the name for the fans.\n\n\"Gizmonics\" sounds like it could be related to the gizmos and gadgets on the show, but again, I don't think that's the fan name.\n\nI think the most likely answer is \"MiSTies.\" I've seen that term used in online communities and forums dedicated to the show. Fans refer to themselves as MiSTies.\n\nAnother thing is that the show had a strong online presence even before it went off the air, and fans would communicate through Usenet and other early internet forums. Maybe \"MiSTies\" comes from that era.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's derived from the show's acronym MST3K, where \"MiSTies\" is a play on words.\n\nLet me try to recall if there was an official name given to the fans by the show's creators. I think Joel Hodgson, the creator, and the cast members referred to the fans as MiSTies.\n\nAlso, there was a fan convention called Mistacon, which further solidifies that \"MiSTies\" is the correct term.\n\nSo, based on my memory and a bit of logical deduction, I'm going to go with B. MiSTies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
