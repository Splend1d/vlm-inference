                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about Mill's thoughts on desirability. The question is: \"Mill thinks that if something is desirable, but not desirable as an end, then it must be...\" and it gives options A. desirable as a rule, B. desirable in theory, C. desirable as a means, and D. none of the above.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Mill says about desires and ends. I know that Mill is a utilitarian, and in utilitarianism, actions are evaluated based on their consequences, specifically whether they promote happiness or utility. Mill distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to this question.\n\nThe key here is understanding the difference between something being desirable as an end and desirable as a means. An end is something that is desired for its own sake, while a means is something desired because it leads to an end.\n\nSo, if something is desirable but not as an end, that suggests it's desirable for the sake of something else. That sounds like it's desirable as a means to achieve another end.\n\nLet me think about option A: desirable as a rule. I'm not sure what that means in this context. Maybe desirable because it's a general principle to follow, but that doesn't seem directly related to the distinction between ends and means.\n\nOption B: desirable in theory. This might mean that something is desirable abstractly or conceptually, but not necessarily in practice. That doesn't seem to capture the idea of being desirable not as an end but for some other reason.\n\nOption C: desirable as a means. This aligns with my earlier thought. If something is desirable but not as an end, it must be desirable because it helps achieve another end. So, it's desirable as a means to that end.\n\nOption D: none of the above. Well, if option C makes sense, then this might not be necessary.\n\nLet me see if there's any specific text from Mill that addresses this. In \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill discusses the distinction between higher and lower pleasures, and he also talks about ends and means. He argues that the ultimate end is happiness, and all other things are desirable either as parts of that end or as means to it.\n\nSo, according to Mill, if something is desirable but not as an end in itself, it must be desirable as a means to achieving the end, which is happiness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. desirable as a means.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if there's any scenario where something could be desirable not as an end but not as a means either. Maybe something is desirable theoretically but not practically, but that seems more like option B, which isn't fitting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe something is desirable as a rule, meaning it's generally good to follow, but again, that doesn't directly relate to the ends and means distinction.\n\nSo, I think C is the most appropriate answer. Mill would likely say that if something is desirable but not as an end, then it must be desirable as a means to achieving an end.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
