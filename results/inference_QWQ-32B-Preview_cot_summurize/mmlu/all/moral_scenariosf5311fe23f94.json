So, this seems like an act of vandalism or retaliation. Destroying someone else's property without their consent is generally considered morally wrong because it causes harm to someone else's belongings and can be seen as an aggressive response to a disagreement.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character puts a dead man in a coffin and nails it shut. This sounds like a funeral procedure, where a corpse is placed in a coffin and it's sealed shut. In the context of a funeral, this is a standard practice and is not considered morally wrong. It's a respectful way to prepare the body for burial.\n\nSo, considering these points, Scenario 1 involves something morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
