                    "text": "To find the mass of one molecule of cholesterol, we can use the molecular mass and Avogadro's number. The molecular mass of cholesterol is given as 386 atomic mass units (amu), and Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 molecules per mole.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the molecular mass from amu to grams per mole (g/mol). Since 1 amu is approximately equal to 1 g/mol, the molar mass of cholesterol is 386 g/mol.\n\nNext, we can find the mass of one molecule by dividing the molar mass by Avogadro's number:\n\nMass of one molecule = molar mass / Avogadro's number\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nMass of one molecule = 386 g/mol / 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 molecules/mol\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\nMass of one molecule = 386 / 6.022 \u00d7 10^23 g/molecule\n\nMass of one molecule \u2248 6.41 \u00d7 10^-22 g/molecule\n\nTherefore, the mass of one molecule of cholesterol is approximately 6.41 \u00d7 10^-22 grams.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 6.41 \u00d7 10^-22 g\n"
