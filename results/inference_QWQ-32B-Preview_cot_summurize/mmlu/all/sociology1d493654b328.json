                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this question about W.E.B. Du Bois's views on progress for African Americans after slavery. I remember that Du Bois was a key figure in the civil rights movement and a scholar, so his perspective should be pretty insightful.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that progress depended on a small group of African Americans receiving the same thorough and extensive education as the most talented White Americans. I think Du Bois was a big advocate for education, and he believed in the \"Talented Tenth\" theory, which suggests that a small, educated class of African Americans could lead the way for the rest. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption B talks about using the skills they already had from farming, domestic work, and rural life, rather than learning new skills. Du Bois was from a time when many African Americans were transitioning from slavery to freedom, and a lot of them did have skills in agriculture and domestic work. But I think Du Bois might have seen the need for more diverse skill sets to integrate into society fully.\n\nOption C mentions training as craftspeople and service employees to become immediately self-sufficient. This sounds like vocational training, which was popular at the time, especially with figures like Booker T. Washington promoting it. Du Bois had a complex relationship with Washington's ideas; while he saw some value, he also believed in the importance of higher education.\n\nOption D suggests that African Americans should move to large cities where they would be accepted as equals in government, religion, and education. Du Bois did write about the experiences of African Americans in urban areas, like in his book \"The Philadelphia Negro,\" but I'm not sure if he advocated for mass migration to cities as a solution.\n\nConsidering all this, I think Option A is the most accurate reflection of Du Bois's views. He emphasized the importance of education, particularly higher education, for a select group of African Americans who could then uplift the broader community. His famous quote about the \"Talented Tenth\" supports this idea.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should double-check. Du Bois was co-founder of the NAACP and wrote extensively on race and society. In his work, he often critiqued the focus on vocational education, arguing that it limited African Americans to menial jobs and didn't provide the intellectual development needed for true equality.\n\nIn contrast, Booker T. Washington, another prominent figure of the time, advocated for vocational training to help African Americans gain economic independence through skilled labor. Du Bois disagreed with Washington on this point, believing that a focus on industrial education alone was insufficient and that African Americans should also have access to classical higher education.\n\nSo, given Du Bois's emphasis on higher education and the development of intellectual leadership, Option A seems to align best with his views.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at some of Du Bois's writings to confirm. In \"The Talented Tenth,\" Du Bois argues that historic progress of civilization was made by a few, not by masses. He believed that African Americans needed more than just basic education; they needed the opportunity to develop their talents fully, just like any other group.\n\nHe wrote, \"The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men.\" This directly supports the idea that a small, educated elite would lead the way for the rest of the community.\n\nFurthermore, in \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" Du Bois discusses the concept of \"double consciousness,\" where African Americans have to navigate two worlds: their own racial identity and the white-dominated society. He emphasizes the need for education to help bridge this divide and achieve true equality.\n\nGiven this context, it's clear that Du Bois saw education, particularly for a select group of African Americans, as crucial for progress.\n\nOption B seems more aligned with the ideas of Booker T. Washington, who emphasized practical skills and vocational training based on existing experiences.\n\nOption C also leans towards vocational training, which Du Bois didn't entirely dismiss but saw as insufficient on its own.\n\nOption D about moving to cities isn't directly addressed in Du Bois's major works that I recall. While he did study urban African American communities, I don't think he advocated for mass migration as a solution to racial inequality.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option A is the correct answer. Du Bois believed that progress for African Americans depended on a small group receiving a thorough and extensive education, comparable to that of the most talented White Americans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
