                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"Mutations are errors in DNA that:\" and then gives four options. So, I need to choose the correct statement about mutations.\n\nOption A says, \"are always harmful.\" Hmm, I don't think that's accurate. I've learned that some mutations can be neutral, meaning they don't have any effect, and sometimes they can even be beneficial. For example, some mutations can lead to new traits that might help an organism adapt better to its environment. So, mutations aren't always harmful.\n\nOption B says, \"only occur in the presence of carcinogens.\" Carcinogens are substances that can cause cancer, and they can certainly cause mutations. But mutations can also happen naturally, without any carcinogens present. For instance, errors can occur during DNA replication when cells divide. So, mutations don't only occur in the presence of carcinogens.\n\nOption C says, \"increase tumor growth.\" Well, some mutations can lead to cancer, which involves tumor growth. But not all mutations cause tumors. In fact, most mutations are harmless and don't lead to cancer. So, this can't be the correct answer.\n\nOption D says, \"occur spontaneously at a low rate.\" This sounds right. Mutations can happen naturally, even without any external influence. They occur spontaneously due to errors in DNA replication or repair mechanisms. And the rate at which they occur is usually low, which is a good thing because higher mutation rates could lead to more problems.\n\nSo, based on what I know about mutations, I think option D is the correct answer. Mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, and they can happen for various reasons. Some are caused by external factors like radiation or chemicals, while others happen naturally during cell division. The key point is that they do occur spontaneously, and the rate is typically low to maintain genetic stability.\n\nYes, I'm confident with option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
