                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a custody dispute, and during the trial, the court allowed a clinical pathologist to do blood grouping tests on the child, the complainant, and the defendant. The pathologist testified about his qualifications, the tests they performed, the procedures they followed to ensure accuracy, and finally concluded that the blood tests prove the defendant cannot be the father of the child.\n\nNow, the complainant's attorney is objecting to introducing these blood tests as evidence. We need to figure out what the court will most likely do: sustain the objection or overrule it. And we have four options to choose from.\n\nOption A says the court will sustain the objection because the blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity. Option B says the court will sustain the objection because blood tests haven't been generally recognized by the scientific community. Option C says the court will overrule the objection because the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests. Option D says the court will overrule the objection because the blood tests are an admission.\n\nFirst, let's understand what sustaining or overruling an objection means. If the court sustains the objection, it means the evidence is not allowed to be introduced. If the court overrules the objection, the evidence can be introduced.\n\nIn this case, the pathologist is testifying about blood grouping tests and has concluded that the defendant cannot be the father based on these tests. The complainant's attorney is objecting to this evidence.\n\nLet's consider Option A: sustaining the objection because blood tests are not conclusive evidence of paternity. Well, actually, blood tests can be quite informative in determining paternity, but they are not always definitive on their own. Blood grouping can show incompatibilities that might exclude someone as a possible father, but they can't always confirm paternity. However, in this case, the pathologist is saying that the tests conclusively prove the defendant is not the father.\n\nOption B suggests that the court will sustain the objection because blood tests haven't been generally recognized by the scientific community. This seems unlikely because blood typing has been a standard practice in forensic science for a long time. It's widely accepted and used in various legal contexts.\n\nOption C says the court will overrule the objection because the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests. Judicial notice is when the court accepts certain facts as true without requiring proof because they are widely known or can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. Blood typing is a well-established scientific method, so it's possible that the court could take judicial notice of its general accuracy.\n\nOption D says the court will overrule the objection because the blood tests are an admission. Admissions are statements or actions by a party to the case that are offered against them. In this context, it's not clear how the blood tests would be considered an admission by any party.\n\nGiven that the pathologist is a qualified expert who has testified about the procedures and concluded that the tests show the defendant is not the father, and considering that blood typing is a recognized scientific method, it seems that the court would likely overrule the objection.\n\nBut let's think about why the complainant's attorney is objecting. Maybe they are arguing that blood tests aren't conclusive enough to prove non-paternity or that the tests weren't conducted properly, or perhaps that the pathologist isn't qualified to interpret the results.\n\nHowever, the pathologist has already testified about his qualifications and the safeguards taken to ensure the accuracy of the tests. So, unless there's some specific issue with the way the tests were conducted, it's likely that the court will allow the evidence.\n\nOption A suggests that the court should sustain the objection because blood tests aren't conclusive evidence of paternity. While it's true that blood tests might not be definitive on their own, they can still be relevant and admissible evidence. In this case, the pathologist is stating that the tests conclusively exclude the defendant as the father, which would make them quite relevant.\n\nOption B is probably incorrect because blood typing is well-recognized by the scientific community.\n\nOption C seems plausible because judicial notice can be taken of established scientific methods.\n\nOption D doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely action by the court would be to overrule the objection, probably under the basis that the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests, which is Option C.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether judicial notice is appropriately applied here. Judicial notice is usually for facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute, like the date of a historical event or a scientific principle that is universally accepted.\n\nIn this case, the general accuracy of blood typing methods could be subject to judicial notice, but the specific results of these tests might still need to be proven through testimony and evidence.\n\nBut the question is about admitting the evidence, not necessarily about the correctness of the specific test results. The objection is to introducing the blood tests into evidence, so perhaps the court needs to decide whether such tests are generally reliable and therefore admissible.\n\nIn the context of evidence law, the admissibility of scientific evidence often depends on whether the method is generally accepted in the scientific community, as per the Frye standard, or whether it's reliable and relevant, as per the Daubert standard, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nGiven that blood typing has been in use for many decades and is widely accepted, it's likely that the court would consider it admissible.\n\nTherefore, the court is most likely to overrule the objection, probably under the basis that blood typing is a generally accepted scientific method, and the pathologist's testimony establishes the proper conduct of the tests.\n\nSo, the answer is C. The court will overrule the objection, because the court will take judicial notice of the accuracy of such tests.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
