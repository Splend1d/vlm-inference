                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about R-squared in regression models. So, the problem states that the R-squared value for an estimated regression model is exactly zero. We need to determine which of the given statements are true based on that information.\n\nFirst, let's recall what R-squared represents. R-squared, or the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. So, if R-squared is zero, it means that the regression model doesn't explain any of the variability of the response variable around its mean.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement one by one.\n\n**Statement (i): All coefficient estimates on the slopes will be zero.**\n\nIn a regression model, the slopes represent the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. If R-squared is zero, it suggests that none of the independent variables are linearly related to the dependent variable. Therefore, the slope coefficients should indeed be zero because there's no linear association to capture.\n\n**Statement (ii): The fitted line will be horizontal with respect to all of the explanatory variables.**\n\nA horizontal line implies that there's no change in the predicted value of the dependent variable regardless of changes in the independent variables. This aligns with the idea that the model doesn't explain any variability in the dependent variable, meaning the best prediction is just the mean of y, regardless of the values of the explanatory variables. So, this statement seems true.\n\n**Statement (iii): The regression line has not explained any of the variability of y about its mean value.**\n\nThis is directly what R-squared being zero means. R-squared is calculated as 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot), where SS_res is the sum of squares of residuals and SS_tot is the total sum of squares. If R-squared is zero, it means SS_res / SS_tot = 1, indicating that the model doesn't explain any variability in y beyond its mean. So, this statement is true.\n\n**Statement (iv): The intercept coefficient estimate must be zero.**\n\nThe intercept in a regression model represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. However, even if R-squared is zero, meaning the model doesn't explain any variability in y, the intercept can still be non-zero. It would simply be the mean of y, assuming no other adjustments are made in the model. So, the intercept doesn't necessarily have to be zero; it just needs to be set such that the fitted values are equal to the mean of y.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- Statement (i) is true.\n\n- Statement (ii) is true.\n\n- Statement (iii) is true.\n\n- Statement (iv) is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that only statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. (ii) and (iv) only\n\nB. (i) and (iii) only\n\nC. (i), (ii), and (iii) only\n\nD. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)\n\nThe correct choice is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
