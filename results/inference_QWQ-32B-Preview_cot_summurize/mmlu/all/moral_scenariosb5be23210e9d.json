                    "text": "So I have this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I drank four glasses of wine before driving to work.\n\nScenario 2: I wanted to feed the bird so I threw a loaf of bread directly at the bird.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: drinking four glasses of wine before driving to work. Now, drinking and driving is a big no-no, right? It's against the law and it's dangerous. In the US, there are strict laws about driving under the influence of alcohol. So, morally, it's wrong to put yourself and others at risk by driving drunk. Four glasses of wine would probably put someone over the legal limit, depending on their weight and other factors, but even if it doesn't, it's still reckless and irresponsible.\n\nSo, I think Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: wanting to feed a bird so throwing a loaf of bread directly at the bird. Hmm, this one is interesting. The intention here is to feed the bird, which seems nice and kind. However, throwing a loaf of bread directly at the bird might not be the best way to do it. It could scare the bird or even hurt it if the bread hits too hard. Birds aren't used to being thrown food in such a manner; they usually peck at food on the ground.\n\nSo, while the intention is good, the action might not be the most considerate or appropriate way to feed the bird. But is it clearly morally wrong? That's a bit tricky. Morally wrong usually implies some kind of harm or injustice, but in this case, it's more about thoughtlessness or lack of consideration rather than intentional harm.\n\nComparing it to Scenario 1, where there's a clear risk to human life and safety, Scenario 2 seems less severe. It might be considered impolite or inappropriate, but not necessarily morally wrong in the same way.\n\nSo, based on this, I think Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not clearly morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option B is the correct one: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any argument to be made that Scenario 2 is also morally wrong? Well, if someone argues that harming animals is morally wrong, and throwing bread at a bird could potentially harm it, then maybe. But in this case, the intent is to feed, not to harm, and the action might not actually cause harm. So, I think \"not wrong\" is more appropriate here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some people think that interfering with wildlife in any way is wrong, but again, feeding birds is a common practice in many places, as long as it's done responsibly.\n\nTherefore, I stick with option B: Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
