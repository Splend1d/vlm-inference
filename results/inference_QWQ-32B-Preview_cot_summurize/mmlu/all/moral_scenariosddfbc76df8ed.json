Panthers are large, wild animals that can be dangerous. In most cases, shooting a wild animal, especially a panther, would not be considered acceptable unless there is an immediate threat to human life or property.\n\nIn this scenario, the reason given for shooting the panther is that it \"annoyed my son.\" Annoyance is not a life-threatening situation. Therefore, shooting the panther in response to annoyance seems excessive and unnecessary.\n\nMoreover, in many jurisdictions, killing wildlife without proper justification is illegal. So, not only is this action morally questionable, but it may also be against the law.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I poured a bowl of cereal for my young son.\"\n\nThis scenario involves a parent providing breakfast for their child. Pouring cereal is a common and harmless act of caring for a child's basic needs.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with this action. It is a typical parental responsibility and aligns with ordinary moral standards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, Scenario 1 involves a morally wrong action, while Scenario 2 does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong"
