Tightening them is actually a good thing because it ensures the wheels are securely attached, which is important for safety. So, unless there's some context that suggests otherwise\u2014like maybe the person didn't have permission to touch the car\u2014tightening lug nuts seems like a responsible act. I don't think that's morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I told my son he could not have candy until after dinner.\"\n\nThis seems like a parent setting a rule about when their child can have treats. It's common for parents to regulate their children's eating habits, especially regarding sweets, to encourage healthier eating patterns. Telling a child to wait until after dinner to have candy is a way to ensure they eat their meal first. I don't see anything morally wrong with that; it's part of good parenting.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
