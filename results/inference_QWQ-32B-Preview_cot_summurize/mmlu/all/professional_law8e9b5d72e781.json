It's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a landowner who bought a three-acre tract in 2005, financing it with a $100,000 mortgage from a bank. The mortgage was recorded, which is important because recording gives public notice of the mortgage lien.\n\nThen, in 2006, the landowner subdivided the property into three one-acre lots: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nIn 2006, he sold lot 1 to his friend for $75,000, and in 2007, he sold lot 2 to his brother for $60,000. Both deeds didn't mention the original mortgage.\n\nThe landowner kept lot 3 and lived there.\n\nIn 2009, the landowner defaulted on the mortgage payments, and the bank is preparing to foreclose.\n\nThe question is about the rights and obligations of the parties involved, specifically regarding the foreclosure.\n\nThe jurisdiction has a particular recording statute: \"Any unrecorded conveyance or mortgage is invalid as against a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value without notice who records first.\"\n\nOkay, so this is a race-notice statute, meaning that recorded documents take priority over unrecorded ones, and a subsequent purchaser who records first and has no notice of prior interests is protected.\n\nNow, let's consider the mortgage. The bank has a mortgage on the entire three-acre tract, recorded in 2005.\n\nWhen the landowner sold lots 1 and 2, the deeds didn't mention the mortgage. So, did the mortgage run with the land or not?\n\nIn general, a mortgagee has a lien on the entire property described in the mortgage, including any parts that are later subdivided and sold, unless there's a specific provision in the mortgage that addresses this.\n\nBut in this case, the landowner sold lots 1 and 2 without mentioning the mortgage, which might affect the buyers' rights.\n\nFirst, let's consider the friend who bought lot 1 in 2006.\n\nDid the friend have notice of the mortgage? The deed didn't mention it, but since the mortgage was recorded in 2005, and the friend purchased in 2006, it's possible that the friend should have known about the mortgage upon checking the public records.\n\nHowever, the recording statute says that an unrecorded conveyance or mortgage is invalid against a subsequent bona fide purchaser for value without notice who records first.\n\nSo, if the friend purchased without notice of the mortgage and recorded the deed, then the mortgage wouldn't affect the friend's title.\n\nBut wait, the mortgage was already recorded in 2005, so the friend should have known about it.\n\nSimilarly, the brother who bought lot 2 in 2007 should also have known about the mortgage.\n\nSo, unless the friend and the brother recorded their deeds before the mortgage, which seems unlikely since the mortgage was recorded in 2005, they might not be protected as bona fide purchasers without notice.\n\nTherefore, the mortgage likely still affects lots 1 and 2, even though they were sold separately.\n\nNow, regarding foreclosure, the bank can foreclose on the entire property that's mortgaged, which is the three-acre tract.\n\nBut since lots 1 and 2 have been sold, and assuming the mortgage follows the land, the bank could foreclose on all three lots to satisfy the mortgage debt.\n\nHowever, the friend and the brother might have some rights here.\n\nIf they recorded their deeds after the mortgage, and if they had notice of the mortgage, then the mortgage would encumber their lots, and the bank could foreclose on those lots as well.\n\nAlternatively, if they recorded their deeds without knowledge of the mortgage, and if they qualify as bona fide purchasers without notice, then their interests might be protected.\n\nBut given that the mortgage was recorded in 2005, before their purchases in 2006 and 2007, it's likely that they had notice or should have had notice of the mortgage.\n\nTherefore, the bank can probably foreclose on all three lots to satisfy the mortgage debt.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The bank can foreclose only on lot 3 because ownership to that parcel is retained by the landowner, the original mortgagor.\n\nThis seems incorrect because the mortgage covers the entire three-acre tract, not just lot 3.\n\nB. The bank has the option of foreclosing on parcels 1, 2, or 3 because the mortgage covered the entire three-acre tract.\n\nThis seems plausible because the mortgage encompasses the entire property.\n\nC. The bank must first foreclose on lot 3, and if the proceeds are insufficient, then the mortgagee may foreclose against lots 1 and 2 in the inverse order of their alienation.\n\nThis introduces the concept of inverse order of alienation, which is sometimes relevant in foreclosures involving subdivided properties.\n\nD. The bank can foreclose on lot 3, but not on lots 1 and 2 unless the friend and the brother assumed the mortgage when they purchased their land from the landowner.\n\nThis suggests that the bank cannot foreclose on lots 1 and 2 unless the buyers assumed the mortgage, which might not be the case here.\n\nGiven the analysis above, option B seems the most accurate: the bank can foreclose on any of the parcels because the mortgage covers the entire tract.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the impact of the sales of lots 1 and 2 on the mortgage.\n\nWhen the landowner sold lots 1 and 2 without mentioning the mortgage, he may have warranted that he had good title to the buyers.\n\nIf the mortgage encumbers lots 1 and 2, then the landowner breached that warranty, and the buyers might have claims against him.\n\nBut as far as the bank's rights are concerned, since the mortgage was recorded first, it likely takes priority over the subsequent conveyances.\n\nTherefore, the bank can foreclose on all three lots to satisfy the mortgage debt.\n\nSo, option B seems correct.\n\nWait, but option C mentions inverse order of alienation.\n\nInverse order of alienation is a principle that sometimes applies in foreclosures where the property has been subdivided and sold in pieces.\n\nThe idea is that when foreclosing, the mortgagor must account for the proceeds from previously sold parcels before foreclosing on remaining parcels.\n\nBut in this case, the landowner is the one in default, and the bank is foreclosing.\n\nSo, perhaps inverse order of alienation doesn't directly apply here.\n\nMoreover, the question is about the bank's rights, not the landowner's obligations.\n\nTherefore, option C might not be the best answer.\n\nOption D suggests that the bank can't foreclose on lots 1 and 2 unless the buyers assumed the mortgage, which they didn't.\n\nHowever, assuming the mortgage isn't necessary if the mortgage already encumbers the land.\n\nSo, even if the buyers didn't assume the mortgage, the mortgage still attaches to the land they purchased, provided it was recorded before their purchases.\n\nTherefore, option D seems incorrect.\n\nThus, option B appears to be the most accurate: the bank has the option of foreclosing on parcels 1, 2, or 3 because the mortgage covered the entire three-acre tract.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
