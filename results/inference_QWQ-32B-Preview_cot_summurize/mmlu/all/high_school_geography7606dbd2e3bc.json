I need to figure out which one of these has the highest fertility rates.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"total fertility rates\" mean. Fertility rate refers to the average number of children a woman bears during her reproductive years. It's a measure used in demography to assess the reproductive behavior of a population.\n\nNow, I need to recall or find information about the fertility rates in these continents. I know that fertility rates can vary greatly between different countries, but generally, there are trends at the continental level.\n\nLet me think about Africa first. I've heard that many African countries have higher fertility rates compared to other parts of the world. This is often due to factors like lower access to education and family planning resources, cultural norms that value large families, and higher infant mortality rates that may lead families to have more children as a safeguard.\n\nAsia, on the other hand, is a very diverse continent. It includes countries like China and India, which have large populations but varying fertility rates. China, for instance, has implemented population control policies in the past, which might have lowered its fertility rate. India's fertility rate has been decreasing but is still relatively high compared to some other Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, which have very low fertility rates.\n\nSouth America also shows variation, but overall, I think its fertility rates are lower than Africa's but higher than Europe's. Countries like Brazil and Argentina have made significant progress in family planning and education, which might have led to a decline in fertility rates.\n\nEurope is known for having some of the lowest fertility rates in the world. Many European countries have fertility rates below the replacement level, which is around 2.1 children per woman. This is often attributed to factors like higher education levels, career focus, and the cost of raising children.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like Africa might have the highest total fertility rates among these options. But I should verify this with some data.\n\nI recall that according to the World Bank data, as of 2019, sub-Saharan Africa had an average fertility rate of around 4.6 children per woman, while other regions had lower rates. For example, Asia had an average fertility rate of around 2.4, South America around 2.0, and Europe around 1.6.\n\nSo, based on this information, Africa indeed has the highest total fertility rates among the given options.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Africa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
