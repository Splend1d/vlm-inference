                    "text": "So I'm training a linear regression model for a simple estimation task, and I've noticed that it's overfitting the data. To tackle this, I'm considering adding $\\ell_2$ regularization to penalize large weights. Now, I'm curious about how increasing the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient will affect the bias and variance of my model. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what bias and variance are in the context of machine learning models. Bias refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm. A model with high bias pays little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. On the other hand, variance is the error due to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. A model with high variance pays a lot of attention to the training data and doesn't generalize well to data it hasn't seen before.\n\nOverfitting, like what I'm experiencing, is typically a sign of high variance and low bias. The model is capturing the noise in the training data along with the underlying pattern, which is why it performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n\nNow, $\\ell_2$ regularization, also known as Ridge Regression, adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. The regularization term is added to the loss function, and the coefficient that controls the strength of this penalty is often denoted by $\\lambda$.\n\nSo, when I increase the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient ($\\lambda$), what happens?\n\nLet's think about the impact on the model's complexity. Regularization, in general, is used to prevent overfitting by adding a complexity penalty to the loss function. By increasing $\\lambda$, I'm increasing the penalty for having large coefficients, which should encourage the model to have smaller coefficient values. This, in turn, simplifies the model by shrinking the coefficients towards zero without setting them exactly to zero.\n\nSo, as $\\lambda$ increases:\n\n1. **Model Complexity**: Decreases because the coefficients are being shrunk towards zero, making the model less flexible and less likely to capture noise in the training data.\n\n2. **Bias**: Increases because a simpler model might not capture all the relevant features or the true underlying relationship in the data.\n\n3. **Variance**: Decreases because the model becomes less sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data. It's less likely to overfit.\n\nTherefore, increasing the $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient should lead to an increase in bias and a decrease in variance.\n\nLet me double-check this with an example. Suppose I have a high-degree polynomial regression model that's overfitting the data. By applying $\\ell_2$ regularization and increasing $\\lambda$, I'm effectively reducing the influence of higher-degree terms by shrinking their coefficients. This makes the model behave more like a lower-degree polynomial, which is simpler and less likely to overfit. So, yes, bias would increase because a lower-degree polynomial might not capture all the nuances in the data, but variance would decrease because it's less sensitive to noise.\n\nAnother way to think about it is through the bias-variance tradeoff. In machine learning, there's a tradeoff between bias and variance. A model with high variance and low bias can overfit, while a model with high bias and low variance can underfit. Regularization helps in tuning this tradeoff. By increasing regularization, I'm choosing to increase bias in order to reduce variance, which is exactly what I need when dealing with overfitting.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Increasing $\\ell_2$ regularization coefficient leads to:\n\n  - Bias: Increase\n\n  - Variance: Decrease\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Bias increase; Variance decrease\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
