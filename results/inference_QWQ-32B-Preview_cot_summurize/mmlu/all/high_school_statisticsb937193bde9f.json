                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about candy bars and calories. It says that the average number of calories in Yum-Yum Good candy bars is 210, with a standard deviation of 10. And it tells me that the number of calories per candy bar is normally distributed. I need to find out what percent of candy bars contain more than 225 calories.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall something about normal distributions. I know that in a normal distribution, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean. The mean, in this case, is 210 calories, and the standard deviation is 10 calories.\n\nSo, I need to find the percentage of candy bars that have more than 225 calories. That means I need to find the area under the normal distribution curve to the right of 225 calories.\n\nTo do that, I think I need to convert the calorie value to a z-score. The z-score tells me how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n\nz = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3\n\nWhere:\n\n- X is the value I'm interested in, which is 225 calories.\n\n- \u03bc is the mean, which is 210 calories.\n\n- \u03c3 is the standard deviation, which is 10 calories.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nz = (225 - 210) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5\n\nSo, a candy bar with 225 calories is 1.5 standard deviations above the mean.\n\nNow, I need to find the area under the normal curve to the right of z = 1.5. That will give me the proportion of candy bars with more than 225 calories.\n\nI can use a z-table, which is a table that shows the area to the left of a given z-score in a standard normal distribution.\n\nFirst, I'll look up the area to the left of z = 1.5 in the z-table.\n\nLooking at the z-table, for z = 1.5, the area to the left is approximately 0.9332.\n\nBut I need the area to the right of z = 1.5, which is 1 minus the area to the left.\n\nSo,\n\nArea to the right = 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, I multiply by 100:\n\n0.0668 * 100 = 6.68%\n\nSo, approximately 6.68% of candy bars contain more than 225 calories.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 66.80%\n\nB. 47.70%\n\nC. 43.30%\n\nD. 6.68%\n\nIt looks like option D is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the z-score calculation:\n\nz = (225 - 210) / 10 = 15 / 10 = 1.5\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, using the z-table, the area to the left of z = 1.5 is 0.9332.\n\nArea to the right is 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668, which is 6.68%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nI think option D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
