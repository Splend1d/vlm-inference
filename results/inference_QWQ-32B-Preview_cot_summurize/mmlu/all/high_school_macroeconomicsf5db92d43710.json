                    "text": "So, let's see. The President wants to cut taxes for consumers and increase spending on the military. We need to figure out how this affects real GDP and the price level. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, tax cuts for consumers probably mean that people have more disposable income. So, they might spend more on goods and services. That should boost economic activity, right? So, real GDP might increase.\n\nAt the same time, the government is increasing spending on the military. That's government expenditure going up, which also should stimulate the economy. So, again, that might lead to an increase in real GDP.\n\nNow, what about the price level? If both of these actions increase overall demand in the economy, but the supply doesn't increase at the same rate, then prices might go up. So, the price level could increase.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that sometimes, if the economy is not at full capacity, increasing demand might just lead to more production without much impact on prices. So, maybe it depends on where the economy is currently.\n\nHowever, the question is probably expecting a general answer assuming the economy is at or near full capacity. In that case, increasing demand through tax cuts and government spending might lead to both higher real GDP and higher prices.\n\nLet me look back at the options:\n\nA. GDP increases and the price level decreases.\n\nB. GDP decreases and the price level increases.\n\nC. GDP stays the same and the price level increases.\n\nD. GDP increases and the price level increases.\n\nOption A seems unlikely because if demand increases, prices are more likely to increase, not decrease.\n\nOption B suggests GDP decreases and prices increase, which doesn't make much sense. If both tax cuts and increased government spending are stimulating the economy, GDP should increase, not decrease.\n\nOption C says GDP stays the same and price level increases. Well, if demand increases, and supply can't keep up, prices might rise, but GDP should also increase, at least in the short run.\n\nOption D says GDP increases and price level increases, which aligns with what I was thinking earlier.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the composition of the spending. Tax cuts increase consumer spending, while increased military spending is government spending. Both are components of aggregate demand. So, aggregate demand should increase overall.\n\nIf aggregate demand increases, and assuming short-run aggregate supply is relatively fixed, then both prices and output should increase.\n\nUnless, of course, the economy is already at full capacity, in which case, increasing demand might not lead to much increase in output, but mostly to higher prices.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the current state of the economy. So, perhaps it's safest to assume it's not at full capacity, and both GDP and prices can increase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the increased government spending on the military crowds out some private investment, but that might be a more advanced consideration.\n\nGiven the options, D seems the most plausible: GDP increases and the price level increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
