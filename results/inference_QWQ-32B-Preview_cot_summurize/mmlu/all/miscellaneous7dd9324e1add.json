The options are Earl, Grey Darjeeling, English Breakfast, and Prince of Wales.\n\nFirst off, I know that Earl Grey is a type of tea that's known for its bergamot flavor. Bergamot is a type of citrus fruit, and its oil is used to flavor this tea. So, Earl Grey might be the answer here.\n\nBut wait, the option says \"Earl\" and not \"Earl Grey.\" Maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's just abbreviated. I think it's safe to assume that \"Earl\" refers to Earl Grey tea.\n\nThen there's \"Grey Darjeeling.\" I'm not sure about that. Darjeeling is a type of tea from India, known for its delicate flavor, but I don't think it's specifically known for bergamot.\n\nEnglish Breakfast is a black tea blend, usually strong and robust, but again, not particularly known for bergamot flavor.\n\nPrince of Wales is another tea blend, but I don't recall it being associated with bergamot.\n\nSo, based on what I know, Earl Grey is the tea that's famous for its bergamot flavor. Therefore, I think the answer is A. Earl.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe \"Grey Darjeeling\" is a thing. I've heard of Darjeeling tea, but combined with grey? Maybe it's a variation that I don't know about. But Earl Grey is the most well-known for bergamot, so I'll stick with that.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with A. Earl.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
