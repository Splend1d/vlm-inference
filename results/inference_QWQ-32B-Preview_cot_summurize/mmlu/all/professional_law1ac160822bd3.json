                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's a landlord who owns a big office building and leases it to a tenant for seven years, from August 1, 2001, to July 31, 2008. The tenant agrees to pay $750 per month on the first day of each month. Then, after three years, the tenant assigns the remaining lease period to an attorney, who takes possession right away. Later, in 2005, the attorney assigns his leasehold interest to a doctor. The doctor moves in but doesn't pay rent for two months. The landlord sues the original tenant to recover the unpaid rent. The question is, who should win: the landlord or the tenant?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what assignment means in this context. Assignment is when a party to a contract transfers their rights or interests under the contract to a third party. In this case, the tenant assigned their interests to the attorney, and then the attorney assigned to the doctor.\n\nNow, the lease has a provision that the tenant covenants to pay $750 per month on the first day of each month. The question is, does this obligation survive the assignment?\n\nOption A says the landlord should win because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments. Option D says the tenant should win because the assignment to the attorney constituted a novation, thereby extinguishing his obligation to pay rent.\n\nI need to figure out what happens when a tenant assigns their lease. Does the original tenant remain liable for the rent, or does the assignment transfer all liability to the assignee?\n\nIn general, assignment of a lease transfers the rights and obligations under the lease to the assignee, but it doesn't necessarily release the original tenant from liability unless there's a specific agreement to that effect.\n\nSo, unless the lease has a clause that allows the tenant to be released from obligations upon assignment, the original tenant remains liable for the rent.\n\nLooking back at the lease provisions, it only says that the tenant covenants to pay rent of $750 per month on the first day of each month. There's no mention of assignment or what happens upon assignment.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a specific provision allowing the tenant to be released from liability upon assignment, the original tenant remains liable.\n\nOption D mentions novation. Novation is a legal concept where a new contract is created, and the old one is extinguished. For novation to occur, there must be an agreement among all parties to replace the old contract with a new one.\n\nIn this case, when the tenant assigned to the attorney, and then the attorney assigned to the doctor, it doesn't necessarily mean that the original lease was novated. Unless all parties agreed to a novation, which doesn't seem to be the case here, the original tenant remains liable.\n\nSo, the landlord can sue the original tenant for unpaid rent, even if the rent was supposed to be paid by the assignee (the doctor).\n\nOption B says the landlord should win because he didn't object to the assignments. But whether the landlord objected or not doesn't really affect the liability of the original tenant. The landlord's acceptance of assignments might affect his rights, but in this case, since there's no mention of objection, it probably doesn't change the original tenant's liability.\n\nOption C says the tenant should win because the doctor, as assignee, would only be held liable. But as I understand it, the original tenant remains liable unless there's a specific release from liability in the lease or in the assignment agreement.\n\nSince the lease doesn't mention anything about release upon assignment, the original tenant remains liable.\n\nTherefore, the judgment should be for the landlord, because the tenant's contractual obligation under the lease survived the assignments.\n\nSo, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
