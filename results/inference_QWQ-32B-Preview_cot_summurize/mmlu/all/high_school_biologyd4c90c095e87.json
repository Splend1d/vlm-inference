                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Organisms in which of the following phyla have a true coelom?\" And the options are A. Platyhelminthes, B. Porifera, C. Annelida, and D. Nematoda. I need to figure out which one has a true coelom. Okay, first things first, I should probably know what a coelom is.\n\nFrom what I remember, a coelom is like a body cavity that's completely lined with tissue called mesoderm. It's like a space in the body that holds the internal organs. But I think there are different types of coeloms, so maybe I need to recall the differences between acoelomate, pseudocoelomate, and coelomate animals.\n\nAcoelomate animals don't have a coelom at all. Pseudocoelomate animals have a body cavity that's not fully lined with mesoderm, and coelomate animals have a true coelom that is fully lined with mesoderm. So, the question is asking for a true coelom, which means it should be completely lined with mesoderm.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. Platyhelminthes: These are flatworms, like tapeworms and flukes. I think they are acoelomate, meaning they don't have a coelom. They have a very simple body plan, and their organs are not suspended in a coelom.\n\nB. Porifera: These are sponges. I believe sponges are also acoelomate. They have a very primitive body structure with no true tissues or organs, so no coelom there.\n\nC. Annelida: These are segmented worms, like earthworms and leeches. I think they have a true coelom. In fact, one of the characteristics of annelids is that they have a coelom that is divided into segments, which corresponds to their body segmentation.\n\nD. Nematoda: These are roundworms. I think they are pseudocoelomate, meaning they have a body cavity, but it's not fully lined with mesoderm. So, they don't have a true coelom.\n\nBased on this, it seems like Annelida is the phylum that has a true coelom. But let me double-check.\n\nFirst, Platyhelminthes: flatworms, acoelomate, no coelom. That seems correct.\n\nPorifera: sponges, also acoelomate. Yes.\n\nAnnelida: segmented worms, true coelom. That sounds right.\n\nNematoda: roundworms, pseudocoelomate. Correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. Annelida.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that some people might consider nematodes as having a pseudocoelom, which isn't a true coelom, and platyhelminthes and porifera have no coelom at all. So, annelids are the ones with a true coelom among these options.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll consider if there's any chance that another phylum might have a true coelom that I'm not thinking about. But looking at the options, it's only these four.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recall that other phyla like Mollusca and Arthropoda also have a true coelom. But since they're not in the options, I don't need to worry about them right now.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C. Annelida is the correct answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
