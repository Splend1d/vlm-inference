Hmm, I need to figure out which of these numbers, when I multiply them by 4, gives me 36.\n\nLet me start by understanding what the question is asking. It's basically asking for a number that, when multiplied by 4, results in 36. So, in mathematical terms, it's looking for a number x such that 4 times x equals 36. That is, 4x = 36.\n\nNow, to find x, I can either divide 36 by 4 or think about which number multiplied by 4 gives 36. Let's try dividing 36 by 4. 36 divided by 4 is 9. So, x should be 9.\n\nLet me check if 9 multiplied by 4 really equals 36. 9 times 4 is 36. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, looking at the options, D is 9, which matches what I just calculated. But just to be thorough, let's quickly check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 6. 6 multiplied by 4 is 24, which is not 36.\n\nOption B is 7. 7 multiplied by 4 is 28, which is also not 36.\n\nOption C is 8. 8 multiplied by 4 is 32, which is still not 36.\n\nSo, only option D, which is 9, when multiplied by 4, gives 36.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
