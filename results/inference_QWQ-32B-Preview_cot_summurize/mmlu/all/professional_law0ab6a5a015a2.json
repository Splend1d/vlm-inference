The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the four parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the farmer and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land. The original deed between the farmer and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single- family dwelling units only. The development company immediately subdivided two of the parcels into lots of three, four, and five acres, and began construction of homes thereon. The original deed restrictions were enumerated within the special warranty deeds and were given to the purchasers of the homes in the new development, called phase 1. Two years later, the president sold the remaining parcel, which had not been included in the phase 1 subdivision plan, to a contractor. The contractor, in turn, drafted a subdivision plan for the last 250-acre parcel, dividing it into one-acre lots. The contractor then commenced construction of single-family dwelling units in the new development, to be known as phase 2. There was no mention of the restriction for two-acre minimum lots in the deeds to the purchasers of the new homes in phase 2. Meanwhile, after the farmer's death, his estate isrequired to sell the remaining 250-acre parcel of his farmland. The buyer is an investor, who proposes to construct a two-level shopping center and parking lot on the property. The area surrounding phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010. The investor's shopping center has grown to include 150 stores.

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this real estate law problem. It's a bit complex with a lot of transactions and changes over time. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, in 1998, an aging farmer decides to sell parts of his 1,000-acre land in 250-acre parcels. The president of a development company buys three of these four parcels, meaning he buys 750 acres in total. The original deed between the farmer and the development company has a restriction that any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings only, and this binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nSo, the development company subdivides two of the three parcels they bought into lots of three, four, and five acres, and starts building homes there, calling it phase 1. The deed restrictions are included in the special warranty deeds given to the phase 1 homeowners.\n\nThen, two years later, the president sells the remaining parcel (250 acres) to a contractor, who subdivides it into one-acre lots for single-family dwelling units, calling it phase 2. However, in these deeds, there's no mention of the original two-acre minimum lot restriction.\n\nMeanwhile, the farmer passes away, and his estate sells the last 250-acre parcel to an investor who plans to build a two-level shopping center. The area around phase 1 and phase 2 was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010, and the shopping center has grown to include 150 stores.\n\nNow, one of the lot owners in phase 1 wants to sell his property to two physicians who plan to start a suburban medical practice. The homeowners in phase 1 are suing to prevent this commercial use. The question is, will the court likely hold that:\n\nA. The restrictions are still enforceable, preventing commercial use.\n\nB. The restrictions are no longer enforceable because offering personal services is a conforming use.\n\nC. The restrictions are no longer enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\nD. The restrictions are no longer enforceable because opening a physician's office in a private home wouldn't be considered a commercial enterprise.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what these restrictions are and how they apply.\n\nThe original deed from the farmer to the development company includes a restriction that any further subdivisions must be into minimum two-acre lots for single-family dwellings only, and this binds all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns.\n\nThis seems like a restrictive covenant running with the land, which means it binds not only the original parties but also their successors in title.\n\nNow, the development company subdivided two parcels into larger lots (3,4,5 acres) for homes, which comply with the two-acre minimum. They included the deed restrictions in the special warranty deeds to phase 1 homeowners.\n\nBut when the contractor subdivided the third parcel into one-acre lots (phase 2), they didn't include the two-acre restriction in the deeds to those homeowners.\n\nAlso, the last parcel was sold by the farmer's estate to an investor who built a shopping center after the area was rezoned for commercial and industrial uses.\n\nNow, one of the phase 1 homeowners wants to sell to physicians who want to set up a medical practice, and the other phase 1 homeowners are trying to stop this commercial use based on the original restrictions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the original restrictions still apply and can prevent commercial use.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the enforceability of the original restrictive covenant.\n\nRestrictive covenants are enforceable if they meet certain requirements:\n\n1. They must touch and concern the land.\n\n2. They must be intended to run with the land.\n\n3. There must be privity of estate between the original parties.\n\n4. The subsequent grantees must have notice of the covenant.\n\nIn this case, the covenant is expressly stated to bind \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" and it concerns the use of the land, so it touches and concerns the land. The intention to run with the land is clear.\n\nPrivity of estate exists because the covenant runs with the land and binds subsequent owners.\n\nNotice: The phase 1 homeowners had notice because the restrictions were included in their deeds. However, the phase 2 homeowners didn't have the restrictions mentioned in their deeds.\n\nBut the original covenant was between the farmer and the development company, and it bound their heirs and assigns.\n\nNow, the development company subdivided two parcels into phase 1, including the restrictions in the deeds, and sold the third parcel to the contractor, who subdivided it into phase 2 without mentioning the restrictions.\n\nSo, for phase 2, did the restrictions still apply even if they weren't mentioned in the deeds?\n\nWell, restrictive covenants can bind subsequent grantees even if not mentioned in their deeds, as long as the covenants are properly recorded and notice is constructive.\n\nHowever, in this case, the contractor, who bought from the development company, might have been bound by the original restrictions, but if he didn't include them in the deeds to phase 2 buyers, those buyers might still be bound by the original covenants.\n\nBut, there might be an issue of whether the restrictions were properly notified to phase 2 buyers.\n\nGiven that the area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses in 2010, and a large shopping center has been built nearby, the character of the neighborhood has changed significantly.\n\nIn real estate law, restrictive covenants can be unenforceable if there's a change in the general character of the neighborhood.\n\nThis is known as the \"changed conditions\" doctrine, where if the surrounding area has changed substantially, making the restrictions impractical or impossible to enforce, a court might relieve the land from the restrictions.\n\nIn this case, the rezoning to commercial and industrial, and the development of a large shopping center, suggest a significant change in the neighborhood's character.\n\nMoreover, the phase 2 development has one-acre lots, which violate the original two-acre minimum, and yet, those homes were built and sold without the restrictions mentioned in their deeds.\n\nThis might indicate that the restrictions are no longer being enforced or are unenforceable.\n\nNow, regarding the specific question: can the phase 1 homeowners prevent the sale to the physicians for a medical practice based on the original restrictions?\n\nFirst, we need to see what the original restrictions say. The deed provision states that any further subdivisions shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only.\n\nSo, the restriction is about the size of the lots and their use for single-family dwellings only.\n\nIf the lot in question is in phase 1, which was subdivided into three, four, and five-acre lots, and the deed includes the restrictions, then the original restrictions should still apply to that lot.\n\nHowever, the area has been rezoned for commercial and industrial uses, and a large shopping center has been built nearby.\n\nThis change in zoning and the development of commercial properties might affect the enforceability of the original residential restrictions.\n\nIn addition, the phase 2 development has one-acre lots, which violate the original two-acre minimum, suggesting that the restrictions may have been abandoned or are unenforceable.\n\nNow, the physicians want to use their single-family dwelling lot for a medical practice, which is a commercial use.\n\nIf the original restriction is for single-family dwellings only, then using the property for a medical practice might be considered a commercial use, which violates the residential use restriction.\n\nHowever, there are a few factors to consider:\n\n1. The change in zoning to commercial and industrial.\n\n2. The development of a large shopping center nearby.\n\n3. The fact that phase 2 lots are one-acre, violating the original two-acre restriction.\n\n4. Whether the restriction is for single-family dwellings only, and if commercial uses are prohibited.\n\nGiven these factors, the court might consider that the neighborhood's character has changed significantly since the original restrictions were put in place.\n\nMoreover, the fact that phase 2 lots were developed without adhering to the original restrictions might indicate that the restrictions are no longer enforceable.\n\nIn addition, the rezoning to commercial and industrial suggests that the local government has changed the permitted uses of the land in that area.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a court might hold that the original restrictions are no longer enforceable due to the changed conditions in the neighborhood.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer might be C: the restrictions would no longer be enforceable because of the change in the character of the neighborhood.\n\nOption A suggests that the restrictions are still enforceable, preventing commercial use, but given the significant changes in the area, this might not hold.\n\nOption B says the restrictions are no longer enforceable because offering personal services is a conforming use. This seems unclear; personal services might be allowed in certain residential areas, but it's not directly addressed by the original restrictions.\n\nOption D suggests that opening a physician's office in a private home wouldn't be considered a commercial enterprise, which might not be accurate, as professional offices are generally considered commercial uses.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most plausible, considering the changed conditions in the neighborhood.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the court might consider the specific language of the restrictions and the intentions of the parties.\n\nIf the restrictions specifically prohibit any use other than single-family dwellings, and the medical practice is considered a commercial use, then despite the changed conditions, the restrictions might still be enforceable.\n\nBut given the significant changes in the area, including rezoning and the development of a large shopping center, it's likely that the court would find the restrictions unenforceable due to the changed conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
