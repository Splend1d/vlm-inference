There are a few options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nOption A says that secondary rules are the rules of interpretation of international law, including the law of international responsibility. That sounds important, but I'm not sure if that's specifically what secondary rules refer to.\n\nOption B states that secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, meaning the international obligations of states. This seems plausible because it suggests that secondary rules deal with what happens when primary rules are violated.\n\nOption C limits secondary rules to those that govern exclusively the concept of attribution in the law of international responsibility. Attribution is a key aspect of international responsibility, but I wonder if it's too narrow to be the sole focus of secondary rules.\n\nOption D narrows it down even further to rules that govern exclusively the law of countermeasures. Countermeasures are actions taken in response to breaches of international law, but again, this seems too restrictive.\n\nI think I need to recall the basic structure of the law of international responsibility. I remember that there are primary rules, which are the obligations that states have under international law, such as not to commit aggression or to respect human rights.\n\nThen, there are secondary rules, which come into play when these primary rules are breached. These secondary rules govern the consequences of such breaches, such as responsibilities of the state that committed the breach, possible remedies, and so on.\n\nSo, based on that, option B seems the most comprehensive. It says that secondary rules govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules, which are the international obligations of states. That aligns with my understanding.\n\nOption A mentions rules of interpretation, which are important but seem separate from the concept of secondary rules. Interpretation rules help us understand what the primary and secondary rules mean, but they aren't the same as the secondary rules themselves.\n\nOption C focuses only on attribution, which is indeed a part of the law of international responsibility. Attribution is about determining which conduct can be attributed to a state, making it internationally responsible for that conduct. While important, it's just one aspect of the secondary rules.\n\nOption D narrows it down to countermeasures, which are specific responses to breaches of international law. Again, this is a part of the secondary rules but not the entirety.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option B is the correct answer. Secondary rules are the rules that govern the legal consequences arising from a breach of the primary rules,\u5373the international obligations of states.\n\nTo confirm this, I can look back at some international law materials or textbooks. For example, in the Articles on State Responsibility adopted by the International Law Commission, it distinguishes between primary rules, which establish obligations, and secondary rules, which deal with the consequences of breaches of those obligations.\n\nSo, in summary, secondary rules in the law of international responsibility are indeed the rules that govern what happens when a state breaches its international obligations. This includes aspects like attribution, but also extends to other consequences such as reparations, apologies, and the law of countermeasures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
