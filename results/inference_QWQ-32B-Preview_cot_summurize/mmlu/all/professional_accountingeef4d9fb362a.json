                    "text": "So I have this question about options, and I'm a bit confused about what intrinsic value means in this context. Let's see if I can figure it out.\n\nSmythe Co. invested $200 in a call option for 100 shares of Gin Co. common stock. The market price was $10 per share when they bought the option, and the exercise price is $9 per share. The option expires in three months. I need to find the intrinsic value of the call option at the time of initial investment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a call option is. A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a specified price (the exercise price) within a certain time frame. In this case, Smythe Co. has the right to buy 100 shares of Gin Co. at $9 per share.\n\nNow, intrinsic value is a term used in options to describe how much the option is in the money. For a call option, it's the difference between the current market price of the underlying asset and the exercise price, but only if that difference is positive. If the market price is less than the exercise price, the intrinsic value is zero because there's no advantage in exercising the option.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the market price is $10 per share, and the exercise price is $9 per share. The difference is $1 per share ($10 - $9 = $1). Since this is positive, the intrinsic value per share is $1.\n\nSince the option is for 100 shares, the total intrinsic value would be 100 shares times $1 per share, which equals $100.\n\nWait a minute, but Smythe Co. paid $200 for the option. Does that mean the option was overpriced? Or is there something else I'm missing about options?\n\nI think I need to recall that the price paid for the option ($200) includes both the intrinsic value and the time value. The time value accounts for the possibility that the stock price could go up before the option expires, making the option more valuable.\n\nBut the question is only asking for the intrinsic value at the time of initial investment, so I should focus on the difference between the market price and the exercise price.\n\nLet me double-check the formula for intrinsic value of a call option:\n\nIntrinsic value = Max(0, Market price - Exercise price)\n\nIn this case:\n\nIntrinsic value = Max(0, $10 - $9) = $1 per share\n\nTotal intrinsic value for 100 shares = 100 * $1 = $100\n\nSo, the intrinsic value is $100.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $50\n\nB. $100\n\nC. $200\n\nD. $900\n\nIt seems that $100 is option B.\n\nBut wait, I recall that sometimes intrinsic value can be calculated differently, especially in relation to the par value or other factors. The stock has a par value of $0.50, but in options, we usually consider the market price, not the par value.\n\nIs there a chance that par value affects the intrinsic value? I don't think so, because options are based on the market price of the stock, not its par value.\n\nAlso, the option expired in three months, but since we're looking for the intrinsic value at the time of initial investment, the time to expiration shouldn't affect the intrinsic value calculation.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial calculation, the intrinsic value should be $100.\n\nHowever, I notice that the amount paid for the option is $200, which is more than the intrinsic value. That makes sense because, as I mentioned earlier, the option price includes both intrinsic value and time value.\n\nBut for this question, I only need to find the intrinsic value, which is $100.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe the exercise price is related to the par value, but again, in options, the exercise price is set based on the market price, not the par value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by providing the par value, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the option is American or European style, as that can affect pricing, but for intrinsic value, it shouldn't make a difference.\n\nAlso, the number of shares is 100, so the total intrinsic value would be 100 times the per-share intrinsic value.\n\nLet me calculate it again:\n\nMarket price per share: $10\n\nExercise price per share: $9\n\nIntrinsic value per share: $10 - $9 = $1\n\nTotal intrinsic value for 100 shares: 100 * $1 = $100\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. $100.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be wrong.\n\nOption A: $50 - This could be half of $100, but I don't see a reason to halve the intrinsic value.\n\nOption C: $200 - This is the amount paid for the option, but that includes both intrinsic and time value.\n\nOption D: $900 - This seems way off. $9 per share times 100 shares is $900, which is the total exercise price, but that's not the intrinsic value.\n\nSo, indeed, the correct answer should be B. $100.\n\nI think I've covered all the angles here. Intrinsic value is simply the difference between the market price and the exercise price, positive or zero, multiplied by the number of shares.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
