                    "text": "Let's see. There's this question about forklifts imported into the US from Belgium and how an increase in their price affects the consumer price index (CPI) and the GDP deflator. I need to choose between four options: both increase, only CPI increases, only GDP deflator increases, or neither changes.\n\nFirst, I should understand what CPI and GDP deflator are. The consumer price index measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The GDP deflator, on the other hand, is a measure of the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy.\n\nSo, if the price of forklifts imported from Belgium increases, how does that affect these two indices?\n\nLet's think about CPI first. Forklifts are probably considered durable goods, and they might be included in the market basket of goods that CPI tracks. If the price of forklifts goes up, that would contribute to an increase in the overall CPI, right? Because the cost of one of the items in the basket has increased.\n\nNow, what about the GDP deflator? This measures the prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services. Forklifts imported from Belgium are not domestically produced, so they shouldn't be included in the GDP deflator, right? So, an increase in their price shouldn't affect the GDP deflator.\n\nWait, but I remember that GDP deflator includes prices of all new goods and services produced in the economy, regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign. But, imports are treated differently in the GDP calculations. Actually, in the GDP expenditure approach, imports are subtracted. But for the deflator, which is prices of domestically produced goods, imports shouldn't directly affect it.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to recall the formula for GDP deflator:\n\nGDP deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100\n\nNominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced in a country at current prices, while real GDP is the value at constant prices. So, if the price of imported forklifts increases, but they are not part of domestic production, it shouldn't affect nominal or real GDP, hence the deflator remains unchanged.\n\nOn the other hand, CPI includes a wide range of goods and services that consumers buy, including imported items like forklifts. So, if forklifts are part of the CPI basket, their price increase would raise the overall CPI.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that the consumer price index increases but not the GDP deflator.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. increase the consumer price index and the GDP deflator.\n\nB. increase the consumer price index but not the GDP deflator.\n\nC. increase the GDP deflator but not the consumer price index.\n\nD. have no effect on the consumer price index or the GDP deflator.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct one.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing about how imports affect these indices.\n\nI know that imports are a component in the GDP expenditure approach: GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), where M is imports. An increase in imports (M) decreases GDP. But in this case, it's about the price of imports, not the quantity.\n\nIf the price of imports increases, that would increase the overall price level, but since imports are subtracted in GDP, it's a bit tricky.\n\nHowever, in the context of CPI and GDP deflator, I think my initial reasoning holds: CPI includes prices of imported goods, while GDP deflator reflects the price level of domestically produced goods and services.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
