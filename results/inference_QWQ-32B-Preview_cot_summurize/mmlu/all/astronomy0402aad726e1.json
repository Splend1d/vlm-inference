                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out why the inner planets are made of denser materials than the outer planets. There are a few options here, and I need to think about which one makes the most sense.\n\nOption A says that when the protoplanetary disk was spinning faster, centrifugal forces flung the lighter materials toward the outer parts of the solar nebula. Hmm, centrifugal force does push materials away from the center, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason for the difference in planetary densities.\n\nOption B mentions that in the inner part of the nebula, only metals and rocks could condense because of the high temperatures, while hydrogen compounds, although more abundant, could only condense in the cooler outer regions. That sounds plausible. In the early solar system, temperatures decreased with distance from the Sun. So closer in, only materials with higher melting points could solidify, like metals and rocks, whereas farther out, where it's colder, ices could also form.\n\nOption C says that denser materials were heavier and sank to the center of the nebula. Wait, but in a gaseous nebula, how exactly do materials \"sink\"? I think in reality, the distribution of materials in the protoplanetary disk is more complex than just sinking based on density.\n\nOption D is similar to A, saying that materials segregated into bands, with denser materials settling nearer the Sun and lighter materials in the outer parts. Again, this seems similar to Option A, and I'm not entirely convinced that centrifugal forces alone caused this distribution.\n\nLet me think about the temperature gradient in the protoplanetary disk. I recall that closer to the Sun, it was hotter, and farther out, it was cooler. This temperature variation would affect what materials could condense and form solid particles.\n\nIn the inner, hotter regions, only materials with very high melting points could condense out of the nebular gas. These include metals like iron and nickel, and rocks like silicates. These are denser materials.\n\nIn the outer, cooler regions, lower melting point materials could also condense, such as ices of water, methane, and ammonia. These materials are less dense than metals and rocks.\n\nSo, because of the temperature difference, the inner planets formed from denser materials, while the outer planets formed from a mix of denser and lighter materials, allowing them to be larger in size but less dense.\n\nAlso, regarding the formation process, in the inner solar system, the higher density of materials might have led to more frequent and energetic collisions, helping to form fewer but larger, denser planets.\n\nIn the outer solar system, with more abundant but less dense materials, planets could grow larger in size but with lower densities.\n\nSo, considering all this, Option B seems to be the most accurate explanation. It directly ties the difference in planetary densities to the temperature gradient in the protoplanetary disk, which determined what materials could condense at different distances from the Sun.\n\nI think that makes sense. What do you think?\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
