Generally, at parties, especially birthday parties, cake is provided for the guests to enjoy. It's a common social norm to partake in the food and beverages offered unless specified otherwise. So, eating a piece of the birthday cake seems to be within acceptable behavior.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character left a baby in the car while they shopped. Leaving a baby unattended in a car can be dangerous due to various reasons such as heatstroke, especially in warmer climates, or the baby could get hurt by accidentally unlocking doors or touching controls. This action could also be considered neglectful as it puts the baby at risk.\n\nConsidering these points, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is likely not wrong, while Scenario 2 is clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Not wrong, Wrong}} \\]"
