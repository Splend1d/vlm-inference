                    "text": "So I've got this genetics problem here. It's about an X-linked recessive condition in humans, and I'm told that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, which is one in ten. I need to find out the expected frequency of affected females based on that information. The options are A. 0.01, B. 0.001, C. 0.02, and D. 0.0001.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how X-linked recessive conditions work. Since it's X-linked, the gene is on the X chromosome. Males have one X and one Y chromosome, so if they have the recessive allele on their X, they will express the condition because they don't have another X to potentially have a dominant allele. Females have two X chromosomes, so they need to have the recessive allele on both X chromosomes to express the condition.\n\nLet me denote the recessive allele as \\(a\\) and the dominant allele as \\(A\\). So, for males:\n\n- Affected: \\(X^a Y\\)\n\n- Unaffected: \\(X^A Y\\)\n\nFor females:\n\n- Affected: \\(X^a X^a\\)\n\n- Carrier: \\(X^A X^a\\)\n\n- Unaffected: \\(X^A X^A\\)\n\nI'm given that the frequency of affected males is 0.10. Since males have only one X chromosome, the frequency of the recessive allele \\(a\\) in the population should be equal to the frequency of affected males, right? Because their phenotype directly depends on that one allele.\n\nSo, \\(q = 0.10\\), where \\(q\\) is the frequency of the recessive allele \\(a\\). Consequently, the frequency of the dominant allele \\(A\\) is \\(p = 1 - q = 0.90\\).\n\nNow, for females to be affected, they need to have two recessive alleles, \\(X^a X^a\\). The frequency of homozygous recessive in a population is \\(q^2\\), according to the Hardy-Weinberg principle.\n\nSo, the frequency of affected females should be \\(q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01\\).\n\nWait, but let's double-check if that's entirely accurate in the context of X-linked inheritance. In regular autosomal recessive conditions, yes, the frequency of affected individuals is \\(q^2\\). But here, since it's X-linked, is there any difference?\n\nI think in X-linked recessive conditions, the calculation for females is still \\(q^2\\) for affected individuals, because they need two copies of the recessive allele. Similarly, the frequency of carriers would be \\(2pq\\), but I'm only interested in affected females right now.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\\(q = 0.10\\)\n\n\\(q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01\\)\n\nTherefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01, which corresponds to option A.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider the population frequencies more carefully. Is there any adjustment needed because males and females have different numbers of X chromosomes?\n\nLet me think about the overall frequency of the allele in the population. Since males have one X and females have two, the overall frequency of the allele is weighted by the number of X chromosomes.\n\nThe average frequency of the allele in the population is:\n\n\\(q = \\frac{\\text{number of recessive alleles}}{\\text{total number of alleles}}\\)\n\nIn a diploid population with males being XY and females XX, the total number of X chromosomes is equal to the number of females times 2 plus the number of males times 1. Assuming equal numbers of males and females in the population, the total number of X chromosomes is \\(2F + M\\), where \\(F\\) is the number of females and \\(M\\) is the number of males. If \\(F = M\\), then total X chromosomes is \\(2F + M = 2F + F = 3F\\).\n\nThe number of recessive alleles on X chromosomes would be:\n\n- In males: \\(M \\times q\\) (since each male has one X with probability \\(q\\) of being \\(a\\))\n\n- In females: \\(2F \\times q\\) (since each female has two X chromosomes, each with probability \\(q\\) of being \\(a\\))\n\nSo, total recessive alleles = \\(M \\times q + 2F \\times q = q(M + 2F)\\)\n\nTotal alleles = \\(M + 2F\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(q = \\frac{q(M + 2F)}{M + 2F}\\), which simplifies to \\(q = q\\), which is expected.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps my initial approach is sufficient.\n\nGiven that the frequency of affected males is \\(q = 0.10\\), and the frequency of affected females is \\(q^2 = 0.01\\), which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this considering the X-linked nature.\n\nLet me look up the frequency of X-linked recessive conditions in males and females.\n\nI recall that in X-linked recessive conditions, the frequency of affected males is equal to the frequency of the recessive allele, \\(q\\), because they have only one X chromosome.\n\nFor females, to be affected, they need to have two recessive alleles, so the frequency should be \\(q^2\\), as I initially thought.\n\nBut maybe there's a adjustment needed for the population frequencies.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in a large population with equal numbers of males and females, the frequency of the allele \\(q\\) is determined by both males and females.\n\nLet me try to calculate \\(q\\) more accurately.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the population has equal numbers of males and females.\n\nLet \\(F\\) be the number of females, and \\(M\\) be the number of males, with \\(M = F\\).\n\nTotal number of X chromosomes = \\(2F\\) (from females) + \\(M\\) (from males) = \\(2F + F = 3F\\)\n\nTotal number of recessive alleles = number in females + number in males\n\nEach female has two X chromosomes, each with probability \\(q\\) of being \\(a\\), so per female, expected recessive alleles are \\(2q\\). Total for females: \\(2qF\\)\n\nEach male has one X chromosome, with probability \\(q\\) of being \\(a\\), so total for males: \\(qM = qF\\)\n\nTherefore, total recessive alleles = \\(2qF + qF = 3qF\\)\n\nTotal X chromosomes = \\(3F\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(q = \\frac{3qF}{3F} = q\\), which again confirms that \\(q = 0.10\\)\n\nNow, the frequency of affected females is the frequency of \\(X^a X^a\\), which is \\(q^2\\), assuming random mating and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nSo, \\(q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01\\), which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a more precise calculation, but I think this is sufficient.\n\nLet me consider if there is any other factor that could affect this calculation.\n\nIs the population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? The problem doesn't specify, but for the sake of this exercise, I think we can assume it is, unless told otherwise.\n\nAlso, is there any selection or other evolutionary force acting on this allele? Again, without specific information, I'll assume not.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 0.01, which is option A.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B is 0.001, which would be \\(q^3 = (0.1)^3 = 0.001\\), but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C is 0.02, which is \\(2q = 0.20\\), but that's not relevant here.\n\nOption D is 0.0001, which is \\(q^4 = (0.1)^4 = 0.0001\\), which is too small.\n\nSo, based on the calculation, option A, 0.01, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
