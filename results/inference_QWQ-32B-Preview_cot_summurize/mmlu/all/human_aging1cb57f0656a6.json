                    "text": "So I've got this question here about age and cigarette smoking. It says that age is negatively correlated with cigarette smoking, and I need to figure out what that means from these four options.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what a negative correlation is. I think it means that as one thing increases, the other decreases. So, if age increases, smoking decreases, or something like that.\n\nOption A says that older adults experience more negative effects from smoking than younger adults. Hmm, that seems like it's about the effects of smoking, not about the correlation between age and smoking behavior. So, maybe that's not the right choice.\n\nOption B says that older adults smoke more than younger adults. But wait, if there's a negative correlation, that would mean as age increases, smoking decreases, right? So, this seems opposite to what a negative correlation would suggest.\n\nOption C says that older adults smoke less than younger adults. That aligns with the idea of a negative correlation: as age goes up, smoking goes down.\n\nOption D says that older and younger adults smoke about the same number of cigarettes and both experience negative effects. But again, this doesn't reflect a negative correlation.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option C seems to be the correct answer. Older adults smoke less than younger adults.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. The question is about a negative correlation between age and cigarette smoking. Correlation just tells us about the relationship between two variables, not about cause and effect or the magnitude of smoking.\n\nOption A is about the effects of smoking, which isn't directly related to the correlation described.\n\nOption B suggests a positive correlation, where older adults smoke more, which contradicts the negative correlation mentioned.\n\nOption D suggests no correlation, since both groups smoke about the same amount, which doesn't match the negative correlation.\n\nTherefore, option C is the one that correctly interprets a negative correlation between age and cigarette smoking.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
