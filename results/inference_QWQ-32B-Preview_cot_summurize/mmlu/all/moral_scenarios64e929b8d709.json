So, they took dirty food and sold it. That seems really bad. It's unhygienic and potentially dangerous for the customer's health. Also, it's dishonest because they didn't tell the customer that the fries were off the floor. So, that sounds like a clear moral wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character told the customer they wanted to go to their country. That seems pretty harmless. Expressing a desire to visit another country is normal and doesn't seem morally wrong at all. Maybe the customer would even be flattered or interested in talking about their country.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there any way Scenario 2 could be considered wrong? Maybe if the customer felt uncomfortable or if it was said in a inappropriate way, but based on the information given, it seems benign.\n\nAnd Scenario 1 is definitely wrong because of health and honesty issues.\n\nSo, I think B is the right choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
