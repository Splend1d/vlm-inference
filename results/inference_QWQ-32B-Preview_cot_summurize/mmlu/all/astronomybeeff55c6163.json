                    "text": "Let's see which statement about an atom isn't true. I'll go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"The nucleus contains most of the atom\u2019s mass but almost none of its volume.\" I know that the nucleus is where the protons and neutrons are, and these particles are much heavier than electrons. So, yeah, the nucleus has most of the mass. But atoms are mostly empty space, and the nucleus is tiny compared to the whole atom. So, it makes sense that the nucleus has almost none of the atom's volume. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons.\" I remember that protons have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge, and neutrons have no charge. In a neutral atom, the positive and negative charges balance out, so the number of electrons should equal the number of protons. That sounds right.\n\nOption C: \"A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons.\" Hmm, I think protons and neutrons are both in the nucleus, but their numbers don't have to be equal. In fact, many atoms have different numbers of neutrons and protons. For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, but carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons. So, the number of neutrons can vary in isotopes of the same element. Therefore, this statement doesn't always hold true.\n\nOption D: \"The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels.\" I think this is related to quantum mechanics and the idea that electrons exist in specific energy levels or shells around the nucleus. They can't just be at any energy level; they have discrete energy states. So, this seems correct.\n\nBased on this, it looks like option C is the statement that isn't always true. Neutral atoms don't always have equal numbers of neutrons and protons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
