                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I was playing video games in the house.\n\n2. I let my kids get ice cream for every meal.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each scenario.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: I was playing video games in the house.\n\nIs playing video games in your own house generally considered morally wrong? I don't think so. People often play video games for entertainment, and as long as it's not affecting others negatively or being addictive to the point of harming one's responsibilities, it's usually acceptable.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Maybe in this context, there's something else going on that makes it wrong. Like, perhaps I should be doing something else more important, but I'm choosing to play video games instead. For example, if I have kids to take care of or chores to do, and I'm neglecting those responsibilities by playing games, then it could be seen as wrong.\n\nWait, but in the scenario, it just says \"I was playing video games in the house.\" It doesn't specify whether I have other responsibilities or if playing games is interfering with them. So, based on the information given, it seems like just playing games in the house, without any additional context of neglecting duties, isn't necessarily morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I let my kids get ice cream for every meal.\n\nThis seems different. Let's think about this. Feeding kids ice cream for every meal isn't healthy. Ice cream is full of sugar and doesn't provide the necessary nutrients for growing children. As a parent, it's my responsibility to ensure my children have a balanced and nutritious diet.\n\nBy allowing them to have ice cream for every meal, I'm probably not fulfilling that responsibility. It could lead to health problems, such as obesity and dental issues, not to mention setting bad eating habits for life.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, prioritizing my children's immediate gratification over their long-term health and well-being seems wrong. It's a form of neglect in terms of caring for their physical health.\n\nBut, maybe some people might argue that occasionally treating kids to ice cream is fine, and it's only wrong if it's every meal. Or perhaps in certain cultural contexts, it's acceptable. However, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, prioritizing unhealthy food over nutrition for children is generally considered wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nScenario 1: Playing video games in the house \u2013 not necessarily wrong, unless there are unspecified responsibilities being neglected.\n\nScenario 2: Letting kids have ice cream for every meal \u2013 likely wrong, due to neglecting their nutritional needs.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Option C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which matches our analysis. Scenario 1 is not wrong, and Scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, is there a chance that Scenario 1 could be wrong depending on context? For example, if I'm supposed to be supervising my children and instead I'm playing video games, that would be neglectful and morally wrong. However, since the scenario doesn't specify any such context, it's safest to assume that playing video games in the house isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
