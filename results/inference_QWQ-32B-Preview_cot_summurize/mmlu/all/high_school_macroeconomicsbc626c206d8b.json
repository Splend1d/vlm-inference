                    "text": "Let's dive into business cycles. So, business cycles are like the natural ups and downs that economies go through over time. It's not something that happens every day, but rather these larger patterns that economists look at to understand how the economy is performing overall.\n\nOption A says that business cycles occur infrequently in capitalist economies. Well, \"infrequently\" might not be the best word here. Business cycles do happen, but they're not daily occurrences. In capitalist economies, which are market-driven, business cycles can happen due to various factors like changes in consumer spending, investment, government policies, and more. So, they do occur, but maybe not as infrequently as option A suggests.\n\nOption B talks about reusing resources in production. Hmm, that sounds more like sustainability or circular economy concepts rather than business cycles. Business cycles are more about the fluctuations in economic activity, not specifically about resource reuse. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption C says that business cycles are predictable ups and downs in economic activity. Well, business cycles do involve ups and downs in economic activity, that's for sure. However, the \"predictable\" part might be a bit tricky. Economists can identify patterns and trends, but predicting exact turns in the business cycle is challenging. There are leading, coincident, and lagging indicators that help in understanding where the economy might be headed, but complete predictability is rare. So, while business cycles involve ups and downs, their predictability might be overstated here.\n\nOption D states that each business cycle is comprised of a recession and an expansion. This seems accurate. A business cycle typically includes two main phases: expansion and recession. During expansion, the economy grows, employment increases, and overall economic activity picks up. Then, there's a peak, followed by a downturn or recession, where economic activity slows down, unemployment rises, and sometimes there are declines in GDP. After the trough, the cycle starts again with another expansion.\n\nSo, considering all these options, option D seems to be the most accurate description of business cycles. They are indeed comprised of both recession and expansion phases, which are key characteristics of how economies fluctuate over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
