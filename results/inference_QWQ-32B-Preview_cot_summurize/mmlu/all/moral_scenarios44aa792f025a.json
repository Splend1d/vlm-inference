The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I followed some woman into the fitting room to watch her try on a new dress.\n\nScenario 2: I copied the page of the library book that I needed for my report and returned the book to the shelf.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to consider each scenario separately and decide if it's morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Following a woman into a fitting room to watch her try on a dress. Fitting rooms are private spaces designed for people to try on clothes in privacy. Following someone into there without their consent invade their privacy and make them feel uncomfortable or violated. This seems like a clear breach of privacy and respect for someone's personal space. In the US, respecting people's privacy and autonomy is important, especially in sensitive areas like fitting rooms. So, I think this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Copying a page from a library book for a report and then returning the book. Libraries are public spaces with resources available for educational and personal use. However, library books are owned by the library, and copying parts of them might be acceptable under fair use for educational purposes, but it's still using someone else's property without permission. On the other hand, copying a single page for a report might be considered acceptable, especially if it's for educational use, but technically, it's not allowed without permission from the copyright holder. But in terms of ordinary moral standards, it might not be seen as overly wrong, especially if the person is using it for educational purposes and not causing any harm or loss to the library.\n\nComparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong due to the invasion of privacy, while Scenario 2 is more gray area but perhaps not as clearly wrong.\n\nSo, according to that, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut I should think about it again. Maybe Scenario 2 is worse because it's stealing, even if it's just a page. But in Scenario 1, it's invading someone's privacy, which is also a serious issue.\n\nWait, copying a page could be considered theft of intellectual property, but in practice, for a single page for a report, it might be overlooked. Whereas invading someone's privacy in a fitting room is a direct violation of their personal space and can cause emotional distress.\n\nSo, in terms of moral wrongness, invading someone's privacy might be seen as more severe than copying a page from a library book.\n\nTherefore, I think B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
