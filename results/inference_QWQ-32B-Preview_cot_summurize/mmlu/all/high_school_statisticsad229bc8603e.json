                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability question about dice. So, we've got a fair die, which means each number from 1 to 6 has an equal chance of coming up, right? And it's tossed three times, each time landing on an even number. We need to figure out which statement is true based on that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic probability concepts. A fair die has six faces: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6, and the odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5. So, the probability of getting an even number on a single toss is 3 out of 6, which simplifies to 0.5 or 50%. Same goes for getting an odd number.\n\nNow, the question is about what happens on the next toss after three even numbers in a row. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"By the law of large numbers, the next toss is more likely to be an odd number than another even number.\" Hmm, I think I need to understand the law of large numbers here. The law of large numbers basically states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the results should get closer to the expected value. In this case, for a fair die, the expected proportion of even numbers is 0.5.\n\nBut does that mean that after getting three even numbers, the next toss is more likely to be odd to \"balance it out\"? Actually, no. Each die toss is independent of the others. The die doesn't have a memory of previous tosses. So, even if you've gotten three even numbers in a row, the probability of getting an even or odd on the next toss remains the same, which is 0.5. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B says: \"Based on the properties of conditional probability, the next toss is more likely to be an even number given that three in a row have been even.\" Again, this seems to suggest that the previous outcomes influence the next one. But, with a fair die, each toss is independent. The conditional probability of the next toss being even, given the previous three were even, is still just the probability of getting an even number on a single toss, which is 0.5. So, option B is also incorrect.\n\nOption C is: \"Dice actually do have memories, and thus the number that comes up on the next toss will be influenced by the previous tosses.\" This is clearly false. Dice are inanimate objects and have no memory. Each toss is independent of the others. So, option C is wrong.\n\nOption D states: \"The probability that the next toss will again be even is 0.5.\" This aligns with what I've been thinking. Since each toss is independent, the probability of getting an even number on the next toss should still be 0.5, regardless of the previous outcomes.\n\nSo, based on my understanding, option D is the correct statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
