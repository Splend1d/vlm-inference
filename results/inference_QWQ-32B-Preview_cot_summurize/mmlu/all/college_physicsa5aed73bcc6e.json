                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a grating spectrometer that can just barely resolve two wavelengths: 500 nm and 502 nm. I need to find out the resolving power of the spectrometer, and there are four options: 2, 250, 5,000, and 10,000.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what resolving power means in the context of a spectrometer. Resolving power is a measure of the ability of the instrument to separate two closely spaced wavelengths. There's a formula that relates resolving power to the wavelengths being measured. I think it's something like R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb, where R is the resolving power, \u03bb is the wavelength, and \u03b4\u03bb is the difference in wavelength that can be resolved.\n\nLet me check that. If I have two wavelengths, \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, and they are very close to each other, the resolving power R should be approximately \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb, where \u03bb is the average of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, and \u03b4\u03bb is the difference between them.\n\nSo, in this case, \u03bb1 is 500 nm and \u03bb2 is 502 nm. The difference \u03b4\u03bb is 502 nm - 500 nm = 2 nm.\n\nNow, the average wavelength \u03bb is (500 nm + 502 nm)/2 = 501 nm.\n\nSo, applying the formula, R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb = 501 nm / 2 nm = 250.5.\n\nBut since we're dealing with significant figures and the options are whole numbers, I can round that to 250.\n\nLooking at the options, 250 is one of them. But wait, let me make sure this is the correct formula to use for resolving power in a grating spectrometer.\n\nI recall that for diffraction gratings, the resolving power can also be expressed as R = mN, where m is the order of the spectrum and N is the number of slits in the grating. But in this problem, I don't have information about the order or the number of slits, so that formula might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the two expressions. If R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb and also R = mN, then perhaps \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb = mN. But again, without knowing m or N, that doesn't help me here.\n\nGiven that, I think the first approach is correct: R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb.\n\nSo, R = 501 nm / 2 nm = 250.5, which rounds to 250.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B, which is 250.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a different way to approach this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the resolving power is defined as the ability to distinguish two spectral lines, and in this case, it's given that the spectrometer can just barely resolve 500 nm and 502 nm. So, the smallest \u03b4\u03bb it can resolve is 2 nm at a wavelength of 500 nm.\n\nUsing R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb, again, R = 500 nm / 2 nm = 250.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I used the average wavelength, which is 501 nm, but here I used 500 nm. But the difference is negligible, as 500 nm / 2 nm is 250, and 501 nm / 2 nm is 250.5, which both round to 250.\n\nSo, either way, the resolving power is approximately 250.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option B is 250, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing.\n\nIs there any possibility that the resolving power is defined differently in this context? For example, maybe it's R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb, but using a different value for \u03bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's R = \u03b4\u03bb/\u03bb, but that would give a very small number, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nNo, that can't be right. Resolving power is typically defined as R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb, which gives a dimensionless number indicating how well the instrument can resolve closely spaced wavelengths.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the units. Here, wavelengths are given in nanometers, but since both \u03bb and \u03b4\u03bb are in the same units, they cancel out in the ratio, giving a dimensionless R.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if there's any approximation or specific condition that applies to this formula.\n\nI think in the case of a diffraction grating, the resolving power can be given by R = mN, where m is the order and N is the number of slits. But as I don't have those values, I think using R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb is the most straightforward approach.\n\nMoreover, in many textbooks and resources, resolving power is defined as R = \u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb, which is consistent with what I've used here.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the resolving power is 250, which corresponds to option B.\n\nWait a minute, but let's look at the other options to see if any of them make sense.\n\nOption A is 2, which is \u03b4\u03bb itself, but that doesn't correspond to any resolving power formula I know.\n\nOption C is 5,000, which is 500 nm / 0.1 nm, but there's no basis for that in this problem.\n\nOption D is 10,000, which is even higher and doesn't make sense based on the given wavelengths.\n\nSo, again, option B, 250, is the only one that makes sense based on the calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 250.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{250} \\]"
