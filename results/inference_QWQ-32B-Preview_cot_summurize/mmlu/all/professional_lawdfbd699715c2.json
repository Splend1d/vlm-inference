                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out how the federal court is likely to proceed in this situation. So, there's a woman who sued her former employer in state court, claiming age and sex discrimination under both state and federal laws. Her attorney, wanting to avoid problems with the state court judge who had previously embarrassed him, quickly removed the case to federal court based on federal-question jurisdiction. Now, the employer\u2019s attorney has moved to remand the case back to state court.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what federal-question jurisdiction is. Federal-question jurisdiction allows a federal court to hear a case if it arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. Since the woman is asserting federal discrimination claims, that seems to fit.\n\nBut, there are also state claims involved. I recall that under the doctrine of supplemental jurisdiction, a federal court can hear state claims that are part of the same case or controversy as the federal claims, even though the state claims themselves don't provide federal jurisdiction.\n\nNow, the employer is moving to remand. I need to know under what circumstances a federal court would remand a case back to state court.\n\nOne key factor is whether the case was properly removed in the first place. Removal is permitted only if the federal court would have had original jurisdiction over the case. In other words, if the case could have been filed originally in federal court, then removal is proper.\n\nGiven that there are federal claims, it seems like original jurisdiction would lie in federal court. So, removal appears proper on that basis.\n\nHowever, there might be other considerations. For example, if the federal claims are dismissed early on, the federal court might decide to remand the state claims back to state court. But in this scenario, the federal claims are still part of the case.\n\nAnother factor is the attorney\u2019s motive for removal. The woman\u2019s attorney removed the case to avoid difficulties with the state court judge who had previously embarrassed him. Is the attorney\u2019s motive relevant to the court\u2019s decision on whether to retain or remand the case?\n\nI think judicial impartiality and avoiding the appearance of bias are important principles. If the federal court knows that the state court judge had previously embarrassed the attorney and that this is the reason for removal, might the federal court consider remanding the state claims to state court to avoid any appearance of impropriety?\n\nOn the other hand, federal courts are supposed to decide cases based on legal merits, not on the personalities or past interactions of the attorneys involved.\n\nLet me look at the options provided:\n\nA. Remand the entire case.\n\nB. Remand the state claims but keep the federal claims.\n\nC. Retain the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in having it proceed before a judge who has shown clear hostility toward the woman's attorney.\n\nD. Retain the case, because it was timely removed and the woman alleges federal claims.\n\nOption A suggests remanding the entire case back to state court. But if there are federal claims, wouldn\u2019t the federal court have to retain jurisdiction over those claims?\n\nOption B proposes remanding only the state claims back to state court while keeping the federal claims in federal court. This seems possible, as federal courts can dismiss state claims and leave the federal claims to be adjudicated.\n\nOption C suggests that the federal court retains the case to avoid the risk of bias in the state court. This seems plausible, given the prior embarrassment of the attorney by the state court judge.\n\nOption D states that the federal court retains the case because removal was timely and there are federal claims.\n\nI need to think about which of these is most likely.\n\nFirst, since removal was timely and there are federal claims, the federal court has jurisdiction to hear those claims.\n\nRegarding the state claims, the federal court can choose to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them or remand them back to state court.\n\nThe attorney\u2019s motive for removal might be relevant, but probably not dispositive. The court should focus on whether the case belongs in federal court based on the claims involved.\n\nHowever, considering the potential for bias or appearance of impropriety in the state court, perhaps the federal court would decide to retain the entire case to avoid any issues.\n\nBut, is there any rule or precedent that addresses a situation where an attorney removes a case to avoid a particular state court judge?\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but I recall that recusal is a process where a judge may step aside if there\u2019s a conflict of interest or bias. Perhaps if the state court judge were to be recused, the case could proceed in state court before a different judge.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the federal court would consider transferring the case to another judge or another court to avoid the appearance of bias.\n\nBut in this scenario, the case has already been removed to federal court.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C suggests retaining the case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in the state court. This seems like a possible reason for the federal court to keep the entire case.\n\nHowever, I wonder if federal courts typically consider such reasons when deciding whether to retain or remand cases.\n\nAnother consideration is the efficiency and economy of litigation. If the federal court retains both the federal and state claims, it avoids the parties having to litigate related claims in different courts, which could be more efficient.\n\nOn the other hand, if the federal claims are dismissed later, the state claims would have to be remanded anyway, which could lead to forum shopping and complications.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the federal court would retain the federal claims and remand the state claims, as per option B.\n\nBut option B isn\u2019t entirely accurate because it suggests remanding only the state claims, which could be done, but the federal court has discretion to retain supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims if it deems appropriate.\n\nOption D seems straightforward: retain the case because removal was proper based on federal claims.\n\nHowever, option C adds a layer by considering the potential bias or impropriety in the state court.\n\nI think the most likely course of action for the federal court would be to retain the entire case, both federal and state claims, to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety that might arise from proceeding in the state court before the same judge who had previously embarrassed the attorney.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most appropriate.\n\nBut, I need to consider if there\u2019s any legal basis for the federal court to retain the state claims specifically because of this concern.\n\nI recall that federal courts have the discretion to decline supplemental jurisdiction under certain circumstances, such as when the claims raise novel or complex issues of state law, or when there are other considerations that make it more appropriate for the state courts to hear the state claims.\n\nIn this case, the concern is more about the impartiality of the state court judge rather than the complexity of the state law claims.\n\nPerhaps the federal court could consider that in exercising its discretion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the federal court would retain the federal claims and remand the state claims, as in option B.\n\nBut, given the potential for bias in the state court, retaining both sets of claims might be the better approach to ensure a fair adjudication.\n\nMoreover, federal courts are required to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. If there\u2019s a perception that the state court judge may not be entirely impartial due to past interactions with the attorney, the federal court might decide to retain the entire case to maintain the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nTherefore, option C seems like the most likely course of action.\n\nBut, I should also consider that the federal court\u2019s primary role is to adjudicate federal claims, and state claims are only heard concurrently under supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nPerhaps the federal court would retain the federal claims and remand the state claims, as in option B, to allow the state courts to decide the state law issues, despite the potential bias concern.\n\nHowever, if the federal court is concerned about bias affecting the state claims as well, retaining all claims might be more prudent.\n\nAlternatively, the federal court could retain the federal claims, remand the state claims, and issue an order that the state claims be assigned to a different state court judge to avoid the bias issue.\n\nBut I\u2019m not sure if federal courts have the authority to dictate how state courts handle their cases.\n\nGiven all this, I think the most likely action for the federal court is to retain the entire case to avoid the risk of bias and impropriety in the state court, as per option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
