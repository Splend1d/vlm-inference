Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"the president's nominees must be approved by the Senate before taking office.\" I know that when the president picks someone for a position, like a cabinet member or a judge, the Senate has to confirm that appointment. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"two-thirds of the Senate must approve presidentially negotiated treaties.\" I think I remember that for treaties, the president needs the advice and consent of the Senate, and it requires a two-thirds majority to approve them. So, that sounds right too.\n\nOption C: \"the president can override a congressional veto and pass laws.\" Hmm, this one sounds a bit off. I know that the president can veto laws passed by Congress, and Congress can try to override that veto with a two-thirds vote in both houses. But I don't recall the president having the power to override a congressional veto. In fact, I think the concept of a congressional veto is more about Congress disapproving of executive actions, and the president doesn't have a direct override power in that context. So, maybe this is the false statement.\n\nOption D: \"Congress can override a presidential veto.\" Yeah, as I just thought about in option C, Congress can indeed override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in both houses. That's a fundamental check on the president's power.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems like option C is the one that's not true under the system of checks and balances. The president doesn't have the power to override a congressional veto; rather, Congress can override a presidential veto.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
