                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"If your nominal income rises 4 percent and your real income falls 1 percent, by how much did the price level change? The options are A) 5 percent decrease, B) \u00bc percent increase, C) 3 percent increase, D) 5 percent increase.\"\n\nAlright, first I need to recall the relationship between nominal income, real income, and the price level. I remember that nominal income is the income in current dollars, real income is nominal income adjusted for inflation, and the price level is a measure of the average prices of goods and services in an economy.\n\nThe formula that connects these is:\n\nReal Income = Nominal Income / Price Level\n\nOr, in terms of percentages, the growth rate of real income is approximately equal to the growth rate of nominal income minus the inflation rate.\n\nSo, if I let:\n\n\u0394Nominal Income = 4%\n\n\u0394Real Income = -1%\n\nAnd I need to find \u0394Price Level, which is the inflation rate.\n\nUsing the approximation:\n\n\u0394Real Income \u2248 \u0394Nominal Income - \u0394Price Level\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n-1% \u2248 4% - \u0394Price Level\n\nNow, solving for \u0394Price Level:\n\n\u0394Price Level \u2248 4% - (-1%) = 4% + 1% = 5%\n\nSo, the price level increased by approximately 5%.\n\nLooking back at the options, D) 5 percent increase matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's a more precise way to calculate this. Maybe using the exact formula instead of the approximation.\n\nThe exact relationship is:\n\nReal Income = Nominal Income / Price Level\n\nTaking natural logs on both sides:\n\nln(Real Income) = ln(Nominal Income) - ln(Price Level)\n\nNow, taking differences:\n\n\u0394ln(Real Income) = \u0394ln(Nominal Income) - \u0394ln(Price Level)\n\nAnd since percentage changes are approximately equal to the natural log differences, we can write:\n\n\u0394Real Income / Real Income \u2248 \u0394Nominal Income / Nominal Income - \u0394Price Level / Price Level\n\nBut since we're dealing with percentage changes, and assuming that the income levels are positive, we can simplify this to:\n\n\u0394Real Income \u2248 \u0394Nominal Income - \u0394Price Level\n\nWhich is the same approximation I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the relationship between nominal and real growth rates more formally.\n\nThe Fisher equation relates nominal and real returns or growth rates to inflation. For small percentages, it's often approximated as:\n\nReal Growth = Nominal Growth - Inflation\n\nWhich is what I used.\n\nBut perhaps for more accurate calculation, especially with small percentages, I should consider the exact formula.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nNominal Income new = Nominal Income old * (1 + 0.04)\n\nReal Income new = Real Income old * (1 - 0.01)\n\nSince Real Income = Nominal Income / Price Level, then:\n\nReal Income new = Nominal Income new / Price Level new\n\nSo:\n\nReal Income old * (1 - 0.01) = Nominal Income old * (1 + 0.04) / Price Level new\n\nBut Real Income old = Nominal Income old / Price Level old\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(Nominal Income old / Price Level old) * (0.99) = Nominal Income old * (1.04) / Price Level new\n\nNow, solve for Price Level new / Price Level old:\n\nPrice Level new / Price Level old = (Nominal Income old * 1.04) / (Nominal Income old * 0.99) = 1.04 / 0.99 \u2248 1.0505\n\nSo, the price level increased by approximately 5.05%.\n\nRounding to the nearest percent, it's 5%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D) 5 percent increase.\n\nBut wait, option A is 5 percent decrease, which is the opposite.\n\nMake sure I have the signs correct.\n\nNominal income increases by 4%, real income decreases by 1%. So, inflation must be positive, meaning the price level increases.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nIf nominal income increases more than real income, that means prices are rising.\n\nSo, the price level increased by 5%.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the percentage change in the price level:\n\nPrice Level new / Price Level old = 1.0505, which is a 5.05% increase.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\nMaybe I should check if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose I use the GDP deflator or another price index.\n\nBut the principle remains the same: real income is nominal income adjusted for price level.\n\nSo, I think D is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
