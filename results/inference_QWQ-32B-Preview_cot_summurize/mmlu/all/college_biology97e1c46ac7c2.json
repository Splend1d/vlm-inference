                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about embryonic cleavage. I need to identify which statement is NOT true. Let's go through each option step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.\" Hmm, I recall that yolk is a source of nutrients in eggs, and its distribution can affect how the embryo divides. In eggs with a lot of yolk, like birds, cleavage is more restricted because the yolk gets in the way of cell division. So, in that sense, yolk can inhibit cleavage. But I think it's more accurate to say that a high concentration of yolk can restrict cleavage rather than inhibit it entirely. Maybe this statement is a bit too absolute.\n\nOption B: \"Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage.\" Telolecithal eggs have yolk concentrated at one end, usually the vegetal pole. Meroblastic cleavage is partial cleavage, where only part of the egg divides, often seen in eggs with a lot of yolk, like birds. So, this seems correct.\n\nOption C: \"The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole.\" In telolecithal eggs, the vegetal pole is where the yolk is concentrated. Since yolk can hinder cleavage, I would think that the animal pole, with less yolk, would cleave more readily. Wait, maybe I have this backwards. Let me think again. Actually, in telolecithal eggs, cleavage often begins at the vegetal pole because that's where the cytoplasmic determinants are concentrated, which can influence cell division. So, perhaps the vegetal pole does undergo cleavage more readily. I need to confirm this.\n\nOption D: \"The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.\" Cleavage is a series of rapid cell divisions without significant growth between divisions, resulting in a mass of smaller cells called blastomeres. This seems accurate.\n\nAlright, let's recap:\n\n- Option A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. Maybe too absolute.\n\n- Option B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. Seems correct.\n\n- Option C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than the animal pole. Need to confirm.\n\n- Option D: Rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. Correct.\n\nI think Option A might be the incorrect statement because while yolk can restrict cleavage, it doesn't necessarily inhibit it entirely. Maybe a better way to put it is that yolk can restrict or limit cleavage, but not completely inhibit it.\n\nAlso, about Option C, I recall that in telolecithal eggs, cleavage often starts at the vegetal pole due to the concentration of cytoplasmic determinants there. So, it makes sense that the vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look up some references to confirm this.\n\n[Imagines looking up information]\n\nOkay, according to my notes, in telolecithal eggs, cleavage is often partial and begins at the vegetal pole, where there is more cytoplasm and less yolk interference. So, Option C seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true might be Option A, because yolk can restrict cleavage but doesn't necessarily inhibit it completely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the definitions.\n\nCleavage is the series of cell divisions that occur after fertilization, leading to the formation of blastomeres.\n\nIn eggs with a lot of yolk, like birds, cleavage is meroblastic, meaning only part of the egg divides.\n\nIn eggs with little yolk, like mammals, cleavage is holoblastic, meaning the entire egg divides.\n\nSo, yolk affects the extent of cleavage but doesn't entirely inhibit it.\n\nTherefore, saying that the presence of yolk inhibits cleavage might not be entirely accurate, as cleavage still occurs, just in a restricted manner.\n\nPerhaps a better statement would be \"the presence of yolk restricts cleavage.\"\n\nSo, Option A might be the incorrect statement.\n\nLet me check Option D again. \"The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.\" That seems correct.\n\nOkay, I think Option A is the statement that is NOT true, because yolk affects the extent and pattern of cleavage but doesn't necessarily inhibit it entirely.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
