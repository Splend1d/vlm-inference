                    "text": "This is an interesting contract law scenario involving an offer, consideration, and the concept of an option contract. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have two law students discussing the potential sale of a car. The first student expresses interest in selling his car, and the second student indicates he might be interested in buying it, provided the price is reasonable and he can get a loan from his parents.\n\nThe first student then writes on a piece of paper: \"I will sell you my car for $1,000. In exchange for $1 received this day, I agree that you can have one month from today's date to decide whether to accept this offer.\" He signs the paper and hands it to the second student. The second student gives a $1 bill to the first student and leaves.\n\nOne week later, the second student secures a $1,000 loan from his parents and calls the first student to accept the offer. However, before he can accept, the first student says, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the second student can still accept the first student's offer.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\n\nB. No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\n\nC. Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nD. Yes, based on the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nFirst, let's consider option C: Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nAn option contract is an agreement in which one party pays consideration to another party in exchange for the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a main contract within a specified period. In this case, the first student offers to sell the car for $1,000 and receives $1 from the second student in exchange for keeping the offer open for one month.\n\nFor an option contract to be valid, there must be consideration exchanged, and the offer must be kept open for the specified period. Here, $1 was exchanged, and the offer was to remain open for one month.\n\nIs $1 adequate consideration? In many jurisdictions, nominal consideration is sufficient to support an option contract, as long as there is some value exchanged. Therefore, $1 might be considered adequate consideration for the option.\n\nHowever, option A suggests that $1 is inadequate consideration. If this is the case, then the option contract may not be enforceable, and the second student may not have a valid option to accept.\n\nNext, option B states: No, because the first student's statement was unequivocal notice that he no longer wished to contract with the second student.\n\nThis raises the issue of whether the first student's statement over the phone constitutes a revocation of the offer. In contract law, an offer can be revoked at any time before acceptance, as long as the revocation is communicated to the offeree.\n\nIn this scenario, the first student says, \"I've changed my mind. I do not want to sell my car,\" before the second student can accept the offer. If the option contract is valid, then the first student cannot revoke the offer within the option period.\n\nBut if the option contract is not valid due to inadequate consideration, then the first student could revoke the offer at any time before acceptance.\n\nOption D suggests: Yes, based on the principle of promissory estoppel.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a legal doctrine that prevents a party from going back on a promise that the other party has relied upon to their detriment. In this case, the second student may have relied on the first student's offer by obtaining a loan from his parents.\n\nHowever, promissory estoppel is typically invoked when there is no enforceable contract, but there is a promise that the other party has relied upon. If the option contract is valid, then promissory estoppel may not be necessary.\n\nGiven these considerations, the key issue is whether the $1 constitutes adequate consideration for the option.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, nominal consideration is sufficient, while in others, it may not be. Assuming that $1 is adequate consideration, then the option contract is valid, and the first student cannot revoke the offer within the one-month period.\n\nTherefore, the second student could still accept the offer within the one-month period, despite the first student's change of heart.\n\nHowever, if $1 is considered inadequate consideration, then the option contract may not be enforceable, and the first student could revoke the offer at any time before acceptance.\n\nGiven that the question is multiple choice, and option C suggests that the letter formed a valid option, which would allow the second student to accept the offer despite the first student's revocation, while option A questions the adequacy of the consideration.\n\nOption B suggests that the first student's revocation is effective because it was unequivocal, but if there is a valid option contract, the revocation would not be effective during the option period.\n\nOption D introduces promissory estoppel, which may not be directly applicable if there is a valid option contract.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer likely depends on whether the consideration of $1 is sufficient to create a binding option contract.\n\nGiven that this is a law school scenario, it's possible that the question is testing the understanding of adequate consideration for an option contract.\n\nIn some legal systems, nominal consideration is acceptable, while in others, it may not be.\n\nAssuming that nominal consideration is acceptable, then option C would be correct: Yes, because the first student's letter formed a valid option.\n\nHowever, if nominal consideration is not sufficient, then option A would be correct: No, because $1 is inadequate consideration.\n\nGiven that the scenario takes place between two law students, it's likely that the question is designed to explore the nuances of consideration in option contracts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably C, but it could be A depending on the jurisdiction's view on nominal consideration.\n\nOptions B and D seem less directly applicable in this context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
