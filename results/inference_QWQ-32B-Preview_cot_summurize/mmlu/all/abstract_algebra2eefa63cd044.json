                    "text": "So I have these two statements about the polynomial 4x - 2, and I need to determine whether each one is true or false. The statements are:\n\n1. 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z.\n\n2. 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n\nAnd I have to choose between these options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a polynomial to be irreducible over a certain set. Irreducibility depends on the ring or field over which we're considering the polynomial.\n\nSo, irreducibility over Z means we're considering the polynomial in the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients, Z[x]. Similarly, irreducibility over Q means we're looking at Q[x], the ring of polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nLet's start with statement 1: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z.\n\nA polynomial is irreducible over a ring if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with coefficients in that ring.\n\nSo, for 4x - 2 in Z[x], I need to check if it can be factored into two polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients.\n\nLet's see: 4x - 2 can be factored as 2*(2x - 1). Here, 2 is a constant, but in Z[x], constants are considered units only if they are 1 or -1. Since 2 is not a unit in Z, this factorization shows that 4x - 2 is reducible over Z.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. In Z[x], a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. In this case, 4x - 2 = 2*(2x - 1), where 2 is a unit in Z[x]? Wait, no, 2 is not a unit in Z[x] because its inverse, 1/2, is not an integer.\n\nBut actually, in Z[x], the units are only 1 and -1. So, 2 is not a unit. Therefore, this factorization shows that 4x - 2 is reducible over Z.\n\nSo, statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, statement 2: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n\nIn Q[x], the field of fractions is the rational numbers, and in this context, constants are units if they are non-zero rationals, since every non-zero rational has a multiplicative inverse in Q.\n\nSo, in Q[x], a polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with rational coefficients.\n\nLooking back at 4x - 2, we can factor it as 2*(2x - 1), but in Q[x], 2 is a unit because its inverse, 1/2, is in Q.\n\nTherefore, this factorization doesn't count as a non-trivial factorization in Q[x], because one of the factors is a unit.\n\nHence, 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n\nSo, statement 2 is true.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nStatement 1: False\n\nStatement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
