                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about DFS trees and their properties. So, we have a connected undirected graph G, and T is a DFS tree of G. For each vertex v in T, we have pre(v), which is the preorder number (the order in which vertices are visited in a preorder traversal), and post(v), which is the postorder number.\n\nWe're given an edge (u, v) in G that's not in T, and we know that pre(u) < pre(v). We need to determine which of the three statements must be true:\n\nI. post(u) < post(v)\n\nII. u is an ancestor of v in T.\n\nIII. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.\n\nOkay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since T is a DFS tree of G, it means T is created by performing a depth-first search on G, and T contains all vertices of G connected by the edges that were used during the search.\n\nNow, (u, v) is an edge in G but not in T. That means during the DFS, the edge (u, v) was not used to discover v from u or vice versa. In other words, when the DFS was at u, v was already discovered, or when at v, u was already discovered.\n\nGiven that pre(u) < pre(v), that means u was discovered before v in the DFS traversal.\n\nNow, let's consider what that implies.\n\nIn a DFS tree, edges can be classified into tree edges (which are part of the tree T) and back edges (which connect a vertex to one of its ancestors in T).\n\nSince (u, v) is not in T, it must be a back edge, meaning v is an ancestor of u or u is an ancestor of v, but given pre(u) < pre(v), it's more likely that v is an ancestor of u, but let's verify that.\n\nWait, no. If pre(u) < pre(v), and (u, v) is a back edge, then v must be an ancestor of u. Because back edges go from a descendant back to an ancestor.\n\nSo, that suggests that u is a descendant of v in T.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nI. post(u) < post(v)\n\nWait, if u is a descendant of v, then in postorder traversal, all descendants of v are visited before v itself. So, post(u) should be less than post(v).\n\nWait, no. In postorder, we visit the descendants first, then the root. So, if u is a descendant of v, then post(u) would be before post(v), meaning post(u) < post(v).\n\nBut hold on, in postorder, the root is visited last, so if u is a descendant of v, its post number should be before v's post number.\n\nWait, no. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose T is:\n\nv\n\n|\n\nu\n\n|\n\nw\n\nPreorder: v, u, w\n\nPostorder: w, u, v\n\nSo, post(u) = 2, post(v) = 3, post(w) = 1\n\nHere, u is a descendant of v, and post(u) < post(v).\n\nWait, but in this case, post(u) = 2 < 3 = post(v)\n\nSo, seems like I was correct initially.\n\nSo, statement I seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, the question says (u, v) is an edge in G not in T, and pre(u) < pre(v).\n\nGiven that, and knowing that in DFS trees, back edges connect to ancestors.\n\nSo, u is a descendant of v.\n\nHence, post(u) < post(v)\n\nSo, I is true.\n\nNow, statement II: u is an ancestor of v in T.\n\nWait, but from above, u is a descendant of v, not an ancestor.\n\nSo, II is false.\n\nWait, but the question says: which of the following statements must be true?\n\nSo, II is false, so we can eliminate any options that include II.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. I only\n\nB. II only\n\nC. III only\n\nD. II and III\n\nSince II is false, options B and D are invalid.\n\nNow, let's check statement III.\n\nIII. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.\n\nWait, but from above, u is a descendant of v.\n\nSo, in the tree T, the ancestors of u are v and possibly others above v.\n\nSimilarly, ancestors of v are its own ancestors.\n\nThe lowest common ancestor of u and v would be v, since v is an ancestor of u, and v is also an ancestor of itself.\n\nSo, w = v.\n\nBut statement III says w = u.\n\nBut in this case, w = v, not u.\n\nSo, III is false.\n\nTherefore, only I is true.\n\nHence, the answer should be A. I only.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario where I might be wrong?\n\nSuppose T is:\n\nv\n\n|\n\nu\n\n|\n\nw\n\nAnd (u, v) is a back edge, which it is, since u is descendant of v.\n\npre(u) < pre(v), as per the given condition.\n\npost(u) < post(v), which holds.\n\nAnd w is the LCA of u and v, but w would be v, not u.\n\nSo, III is false.\n\nII is false, as u is not an ancestor of v; v is an ancestor of u.\n\nTherefore, only I is true.\n\nHence, the answer is A. I only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
