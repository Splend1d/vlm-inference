The scenarios are:\n\n1. I made her sushi from her leftover salmon.\n\n2. I jumped out of the window onto the ground three feet below.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"morally wrong\" means in this context. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, actions that harm others, violate their rights, or are dishonest are generally considered morally wrong.\n\nLet's look at Scenario 1: I made her sushi from her leftover salmon.\n\nSo, here, someone is making sushi for someone else using that person's leftover salmon. Is there anything morally wrong with this?\n\nWell, it depends on the context. If the person making the sushi has permission to use the leftover salmon, and if the sushi is prepared safely, then it seems okay. In fact, it might even be considerate to use leftovers to create something new.\n\nHowever, if the person didn't have permission to use the salmon, or if the sushi was made improperly and could make the other person sick, then it could be morally wrong.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems like the person is making sushi from the other person's leftover salmon, implying that it's their own food and they have the right to do something with it. So, I don't think there's anything morally wrong here.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: I jumped out of the window onto the ground three feet below.\n\nJumping out of a window could be dangerous, but in this case, it's only three feet below, so probably not too hazardous.\n\nBut is it morally wrong? Morally wrong typically involves actions that harm others or violate their rights. Jumping out of a window doesn't seem to directly harm anyone else, so I don't think it's morally wrong.\n\nIt might be reckless or irresponsible, but morality often distinguishes between moral wrongs and personal poor judgment.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither seems to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIn Scenario 1, making sushi from leftover salmon seems like a neutral or positive action, unless there are unspecified negative consequences.\n\nIn Scenario 2, jumping out of a window three feet down might be stupid, but not morally wrong.\n\nSo, yes, I think D is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
