I need to think about what each of these is used for.\n\nAn escalator is like a moving staircase you see in malls or subway stations. It's designed to transport people from one level to another. So, it's more for moving people, not materials.\n\nA conveyor is a system that moves materials from one place to another, often in factories or warehouses. It can be a belt, a chain, or even a roller system. Its primary purpose is to handle materials efficiently.\n\nA highway is a main road for traveling between cities or regions. It's used for transporting people and goods, but it's more general-purpose. While it does handle materials, it's not specifically designed for materials handling like a conveyor.\n\nA railroad is a system of tracks used for trains to transport both people and goods over long distances. Again, it's used for materials, but it's more about long-distance transportation rather than handling materials in a localized setting like a factory.\n\nSo, comparing all these, the conveyor seems to be the one that is principally a materials-handling device. Escalators are for people, highways and railroads are more general transportation systems.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
