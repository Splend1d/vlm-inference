                    "text": "Let's see. So, my friend says, \"Every time I plan a vacation, there's always a crisis at home or work so that I can't go.\" But you're assuming that this isn't really true, meaning it's not actually happening every single time, but my friend perceives it that way. So, I need to figure out which psychological concept best illustrates this situation.\n\nOption A is psychological reactance. I think that's when people feel like their freedom is being threatened, and they react against that. Like, if someone tells you you can't do something, and that makes you want to do it even more. But in this case, my friend is experiencing crises that prevent vacation, not someone telling them they can't vacation. So, maybe not A.\n\nOption B is base rate fallacy. That's when people ignore general information or statistics and focus only on specific information. For example, if you know that a disease is rare, but someone tests positive, and the test is not always accurate, the base rate fallacy would be thinking that because the test is positive, they definitely have the disease, ignoring how rare it is. In this vacation scenario, I don't see a direct connection to base rates or general statistics. So, probably not B.\n\nOption C is illusory correlation. That's when people perceive a relationship between two variables that aren't actually related, or they overestimate the strength of a relationship. So, if my friend is seeing a pattern where every time they plan a vacation, there's a crisis, but in reality, it's not as frequent as they think, that sounds a lot like illusory correlation. They're connecting planning a vacation with having a crisis, even if that connection isn't statistically supported.\n\nOption D is fundamental attribution bias. That's when people attribute others' behaviors to their personality traits rather than considering the situation. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a rude person, not considering that maybe they're rushing to the hospital or something. In this case, my friend is talking about their own experiences, not attributing someone else's behavior to their personality. So, I don't think D is the best fit.\n\nComparing all these, option C, illusory correlation, seems to fit best. My friend is perceiving a connection between planning vacations and having crises that isn't necessarily based on actual frequency. Maybe crises happen randomly, but my friend only notices them when they coincide with vacation plans, thereby creating this false association.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Could there be other biases at play here? For example, maybe my friend is more likely to remember instances when a crisis happened after planning a vacation, and forget the times when no crisis occurred. That might be related to confirmation bias, where people pay more attention to information that confirms their beliefs and ignore information that doesn't. However, confirmation bias is not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the availability heuristic, where people estimate the probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. If my friend remembers crises happening around vacation times more vividly, they might think it's more common than it actually is. But again, that's not one of the options.\n\nGiven the choices, illusory correlation seems to be the most appropriate answer. It directly relates to perceiving a relationship between two events that aren't actually correlated, which is what my friend is doing by believing that planning vacations causes crises to occur.\n\nWait, but maybe fundamental attribution bias could be stretched a bit. If my friend is attributing the crises to their decision to plan a vacation, like assuming that something about planning a vacation causes crises, that could be seen as attributing an external event to an internal cause. But that seems like a bit of a reach, and illusory correlation is a more direct fit.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Illusory correlation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
