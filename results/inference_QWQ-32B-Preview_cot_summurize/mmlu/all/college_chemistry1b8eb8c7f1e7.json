                    "text": "So I've got this NMR problem here. It says that the T2 of an NMR line is 15 milliseconds, and I need to calculate its linewidth, ignoring other sources of line broadening. The options are A) 0.0471 Hz, B) 21.2 Hz, C) 42.4 Hz, and D) 66.7 Hz.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what T2 represents in NMR. T2 is the spin-spin relaxation time, which is related to the linewidth of the NMR signal. The linewidth, or the spectral line width, is a measure of how broad the resonance line is in frequency units, usually in Hertz.\n\nThere's a relationship between T2 and the linewidth (FWHM, or full width at half maximum). The formula that connects them is:\n\nlinewidth (Hz) = 1 / (2 * \u03c0 * T2)\n\nSo, given that T2 is 15 milliseconds, which is 15 ms = 15 * 10^-3 seconds, I can plug this into the formula.\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n2 * \u03c0 * T2 = 2 * 3.1416 * 15 * 10^-3\n\nLet's compute 2 * 3.1416 = 6.2832\n\nThen, 6.2832 * 15 = 94.248\n\nNow, multiply by 10^-3 to convert milliseconds to seconds:\n\n94.248 * 10^-3 = 0.094248 seconds\n\nNow, linewidth = 1 / 0.094248 Hz\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1 divided by 0.094248 is approximately 10.61 Hz\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting again:\n\nT2 = 15 ms = 15 * 10^-3 s = 0.015 s\n\nThen, 2 * \u03c0 * T2 = 2 * 3.1416 * 0.015\n\n2 * 3.1416 = 6.2832\n\n6.2832 * 0.015 = 0.094248 s\n\nThen, linewidth = 1 / 0.094248 Hz \u2248 10.61 Hz\n\nBut looking at the options, 10.61 Hz isn't listed. The closest is 21.2 Hz, which is option B.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I missed a factor. Let me check the formula again.\n\nI recall that in some texts, the linewidth is given by 1 / T2, without the 2 * \u03c0. Maybe that's where I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me look this up in my notes.\n\nAh, I found it. The relationship between T2 and the linewidth depends on how the linewidth is defined. Sometimes it's defined in terms of the exponential decay, and sometimes it's related through the Fourier transform.\n\nThe general relationship is that the linewidth (FWHM) is equal to 1 / (\u03c0 * T2).\n\nSo, linewidth = 1 / (\u03c0 * T2)\n\nLet me confirm this.\n\nGiven T2 = 15 ms = 0.015 s\n\nThen, linewidth = 1 / (3.1416 * 0.015) \u2248 1 / 0.047124 \u2248 21.22 Hz\n\nThat matches option B) 21.2 Hz.\n\nI must have misremembered the formula initially. It's important to use the correct relationship between T2 and the linewidth.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B) 21.2 Hz.\n\nLet me just double-check if there are any other considerations. The problem says to ignore other sources of line broadening, so I don't need to worry about things like chemical shift anisotropy, dipolar broadening, or other relaxation mechanisms.\n\nAlso, in NMR, the linewidth can be affected by the instrument's resolution, but since the problem specifies to ignore other sources, I can focus solely on the T2 relaxation time.\n\nTherefore, the linewidth is approximately 21.2 Hz.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{21.2\\ \\text{Hz}} \\]"
