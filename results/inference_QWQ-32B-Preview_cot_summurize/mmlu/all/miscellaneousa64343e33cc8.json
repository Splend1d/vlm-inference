It was one of the most significant slave uprisings in the southern United States and had a profound impact on the debate over slavery leading up to the Civil War.\n\nJohn Brown is known for his raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, which he intended to spark a slave rebellion. Dred Scott was a slave who sued for his freedom in the Dred Scott v. Sandford case, which was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857. Harriet Tubman was an abolitionist and conductor on the Underground Railroad, helping enslaved people escape to freedom in the North.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Nat Turner."
