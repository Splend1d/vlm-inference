                    "text": "Let's tackle this question step by step. So, we have the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) increasing from 0.75 in year 1 to 0.80 in year 2. We need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on this information.\n\nFirst, let's recall what MPC is. MPC is the fraction of additional income that a household spends on consumption. So, if MPC is 0.75, that means for every extra dollar earned, 75 cents are spent on consumption.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A says: In year 1, a $100 billion increase in government spending would have increased real output by a maximum of $75 billion.\n\nHmm, this seems related to the spending multiplier. The spending multiplier tells us how much total output increases in response to an initial increase in spending. The formula for the spending multiplier is 1 / (1 - MPC).\n\nIn year 1, MPC is 0.75, so the multiplier would be 1 / (1 - 0.75) = 1 / 0.25 = 4.\n\nSo, if government spending increases by $100 billion, the total increase in output would be $100 billion times 4, which is $400 billion, not $75 billion. So, option A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B says: From year 1 to year 2, the spending multiplier increased from 4 to 5.\n\nWe already calculated that in year 1, with MPC of 0.75, the multiplier is 4.\n\nIn year 2, MPC is 0.80, so the multiplier would be 1 / (1 - 0.80) = 1 / 0.20 = 5.\n\nSo, yes, the multiplier increased from 4 to 5. This seems correct.\n\nOption C says: A given change in government spending would have had a more powerful effect in year 1 than in year 2.\n\nWait a minute, if the multiplier is higher in year 2 (5 compared to 4 in year 1), that means a given change in government spending would have a bigger impact on output in year 2 than in year 1. So, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: The marginal propensity to save increased from year 1 to year 2.\n\nMarginal propensity to save (MPS) is just 1 - MPC.\n\nIn year 1, MPS = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25.\n\nIn year 2, MPS = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.\n\nSo, MPS decreased from 0.25 to 0.20, which means people are saving less and consuming more in year 2. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, option B seems to be the correct conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
