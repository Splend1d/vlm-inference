It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nWhich of the following reformers expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Martin Luther's views and which other reformer shares similar thoughts. Let me see. First, I need to understand what Luther is saying in his letter.\n\nHe's talking about the reformation of the Christian estate, which I think means reforming the Church. He mentions that he's addressing the Christian nobility of the German nation, so it's clear he's targeting German leaders. He says he's not being arrogant; he's responding to the distress and misery oppressing all Christian estates, especially in Germany.\n\nThen, he talks about how the Romanists (which I believe refers to the Roman Catholic Church) have protected themselves with three walls:\n\n1. That the Temporal Power has no jurisdiction over the Spirituality.\n\n2. That no one may interpret the Scriptures but the Pope.\n\n3. That no one may call a council but the Pope.\n\nSo, Luther is challenging the authority of the Pope in these areas. He's saying that these practices have led to the downfall of Christendom.\n\nHe then discusses what should be addressed in church councils and criticizes the worldly pomp of the head of Christendom, meaning the Pope. He also mentions cardinals and how they're used to consolidate power and wealth for Rome, at the expense of the service of God.\n\nSo, Luther is advocating for reform, questioning the Pope's authority, and criticizing the wealth and power of the Church hierarchy.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the following reformers expressed views similar to Luther's:\n\nA. Ulrich Zwingli\n\nB. Sir Thomas More\n\nC. Erasmus\n\nD. John Wycliffe\n\nI need to recall who these people are and what they stood for.\n\nStarting with Ulrich Zwingli, I think he was a Swiss reformer, contemporary to Luther. He also called for reforms in the Church, so maybe he shares similar views.\n\nSir Thomas More was an English lawyer and writer, known for his work \"Utopia.\" He was a staunch defender of the Catholic Church and eventually executed for refusing to accept Henry VIII as the head of the Church of England. So, he seems to be on the opposite side of reform.\n\nErasmus was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and theologian. He's known for his critical edition of the New Testament and for advocating for church reform from within. He was critical of some Church practices but didn't support radical reform like Luther did.\n\nJohn Wycliffe was an English theologian who is considered a precursor to the Protestant Reformation. He criticized the wealth and power of the Church and advocated for translation of the Bible into vernacular languages.\n\nComparing these figures to Luther:\n\n- Zwingli: Also a reformer, advocated for similar changes, challenged Church authority.\n\n- Thomas More: Defended the Catholic Church against reformers.\n\n- Erasmus: Advocated for moderate reform but didn't support radical changes like Luther.\n\n- Wycliffe: Predecessor to Luther, also called for Church reform and translation of the Bible.\n\nSo, between these options, Zwingli and Wycliffe seem the most similar to Luther in their views.\n\nBut the question is asking for the reformer who expressed views similar to those expressed by Martin Luther in his letter above.\n\nLooking back at the letter, Luther is specifically challenging the Pope's authority, criticizing the Church's wealth and power, and calling for reform.\n\nZwingli also challenged Church authority and called for reform, so that aligns closely.\n\nWycliffe did similar things, but he preceded Luther by quite some time.\n\nErasmus was more of a moderate reformer, and Thomas More was against reform.\n\nSo, among the options given, Ulrich Zwingli seems to be the one who expressed views most similar to Luther's.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Ulrich Zwingli.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIs there any chance that Erasmus might have expressed similar views? Well, Erasmus was critical of some Church practices and advocated for reform, but he didn't go as far as Luther in challenging the Pope's authority or calling for such radical changes.\n\nThomas More was definitely against reform and defended the Catholic Church.\n\nWycliffe, although a precursor, might have similar views, but he's not listed in the options.\n\nSo, yes, Zwingli is the most appropriate choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
