                    "text": "This question is about the admissibility of evidence in a lawsuit involving a slicing machine that caused an injury. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the plaintiff is suing the manufacturer for negligent design because the machine cut off their finger during cleaning. The plaintiff alleges that two wires came into contact, turning the machine on accidentally. The manufacturer wants to present evidence that it was too expensive to design the machine to prevent the wires from touching, but the plaintiff counters with evidence that the manufacturer later redesigned the machine to prevent such contact.\n\nNow, the question is whether this evidence of the redesign is admissible in court.\n\nOption A says no, because the change might be unrelated to this type of accident. That could be a valid point; maybe the redesign was for other safety issues or improvements, not specifically to prevent wire contact.\n\nOption B says no, based on a rule about remedial measures that encourages manufacturers to make products safer. This sounds like it might be referring to a legal principle that evidence of subsequent repairs or improvements isn't admissible to prove negligence or defect, to encourage manufacturers to make improvements without fear of it being used against them in court.\n\nOption C says yes, as evidence that the machine could be designed to prevent wire contact. This seems relevant because it directly addresses the plaintiff's claim that the design was negligent for not preventing the wires from touching.\n\nOption D says yes, as evidence that the manufacturer was negligent because the initial design failed to prevent contact. This is similar to option C but focuses more on proving negligence rather than just the possibility of a better design.\n\nConsidering these options, I think option B is important because it\u6d89\u53ca\u5230 a legal principle that might exclude this evidence. The idea is to encourage manufacturers to make their products safer without worrying that such improvements could be used against them in court to prove that the original design was defective.\n\nHowever, option C suggests that the evidence is admissible because it shows that the machine could have been designed differently to prevent the accident, which is directly relevant to the plaintiff's claim of negligent design.\n\nOption D is also plausible, as it suggests that the redesign indicates the manufacturer recognized a flaw in the original design, implying negligence.\n\nBut, given the legal principle in option B, I need to consider whether this evidence would be excluded under rules about remedial measures.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is not admissible to prove negligence or a defect in the original condition. The purpose is to encourage parties to make improvements without fearing that such actions could be used against them in litigation.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions. For example, such evidence might be admissible for other purposes, like proving the feasibility of a safer design, which aligns with option C.\n\nIn this case, the plaintiff is using the redesign to show that it was possible to design the machine to prevent the wires from contacting each other, which directly relates to the issue of whether the original design was negligent.\n\nTherefore, even though there's a general rule excluding evidence of remedial measures to prove negligence, there might be an exception here because the evidence is being offered to show the feasibility of a safer design.\n\nSo, I think the evidence is admissible, but probably not to prove negligence directly, but rather to show that a safer design was possible, which is relevant to the issue of whether the original design was negligent.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the best answer: yes, as evidence tending to show that the machine could be designed to keep the wires from coming into contact.\n\nOption D is close, but it focuses more on proving negligence, which might be excluded under the remedial measures rule, whereas option C focuses on the possibility of a safer design, which is a slightly different purpose and might be admissible.\n\nOption A might be a consideration, but if the redesign specifically addresses the wire contact issue, it's directly related.\n\nOption B is a general rule, but as I mentioned, there are exceptions, particularly when the evidence is used to show the feasibility of a safer design.\n\nTherefore, I would choose option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
