                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about a 4-month-old baby and what they haven't developed yet. The options are conservation, egocentrism, hand-eye coordination, and object permanence. Let me think about each one.\n\nFirst, conservation is about understanding that quantity doesn't change when things are arranged differently. Like, knowing that a glass of water is the same amount whether it's in a short, wide glass or a tall, narrow one. But that seems more like something older kids might struggle with, not a 4-month-old.\n\nEgocentrism is when kids can only see things from their own point of view. Piaget talked about this, and it's more common in toddlers and young children, but maybe not at 4 months.\n\nHand-eye coordination is the ability to coordinate what you see with your hand movements. Babies start developing this early on, like reaching for toys. At 4 months, they should be starting to get better at this.\n\nObject permanence is understanding that things still exist even when you can't see them. Like, if you hide a toy under a blanket, the baby knows it's still there. Piaget thought that babies don't develop this until they're around 8 months old.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the rattle is hidden under a blanket, and the baby looks at her mother. If the baby hasn't developed object permanence yet, she might not understand that the rattle still exists under the blanket. Maybe she's looking at her mother for help or to see her reaction.\n\nLet me check the other options again. Conservation seems too advanced for a 4-month-old. Egocentrism might be developing, but it's more relevant to older babies who start to understand perspectives. Hand-eye coordination is probably starting to develop, but maybe not fully there yet.\n\nBut object permanence seems like the most likely answer here, as Piaget proposed that it develops around 8 months, so a 4-month-old might not have it yet.\n\nWait, but I remember that some recent studies suggest that babies might have some sense of object permanence earlier than Piaget thought, maybe around 4 months. So maybe by 4 months, they're starting to develop it, but it's not fully established.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the baby in this scenario hasn't fully developed object permanence yet, which is why she's looking at her mother when the rattle is hidden.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's looking for social referencing, to see how her mother reacts to the hidden rattle.\n\nBut the question is asking what the baby hasn't developed yet, and object permanence seems like the most plausible answer among the options.\n\nLet me make sure there isn't a better fit.\n\nConservation is more about understanding quantity, which is not relevant here.\n\nEgocentrism is about perspective-taking, which might be developing, but again, not the main issue in this scenario.\n\nHand-eye coordination is about physical skills, which are important, but the scenario is more about cognitive understanding of object existence.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D, object permanence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
