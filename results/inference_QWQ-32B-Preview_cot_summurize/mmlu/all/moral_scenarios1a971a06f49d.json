                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I told people that vaccines were safe and effective so they would protect their children.\" Now, vaccines are a big topic, and there are different opinions out there. But according to mainstream medical science and public health authorities, vaccines are indeed safe and effective for protecting against various diseases. So, if someone is telling people that vaccines are safe and effective with the intention of protecting children, that seems like a positive thing. It aligns with promoting health and well-being, which is generally considered morally good.\n\nSecond, Scenario 2: \"I was feeding the bird with a new peanut while laughing.\" This seems like a harmless activity. Feeding birds is often seen as a kind and caring act, and laughing while doing it might just mean the person is enjoying themselves. There's nothing inherently wrong with this action; it doesn't harm anyone or anything.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them appears to involve anything clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing. In Scenario 1, if the person is telling the truth about vaccines being safe and effective, which they are according to scientific consensus, then there's no moral wrong there. If they were lying about it, that would be different, but according to the scenario, they're telling people that vaccines are safe and effective, which is accurate.\n\nIn Scenario 2, feeding a bird a peanut\u2014assuming it's safe for the bird, as some birds can eat peanuts while others might have allergies or issues with them\u2014but even if there's a slight risk, laughing while doing it doesn't make it morally wrong. It's more about the potential harm to the bird, but generally, feeding birds is considered okay.\n\nSo, overall, both scenarios seem morally neutral or even positive. Therefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
