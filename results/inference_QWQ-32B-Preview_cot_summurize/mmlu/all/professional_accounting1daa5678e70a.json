                    "text": "To determine the gain on the exchange, we need to understand the concept of exchanges with commercial substance. When an exchange has commercial substance, it means that the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change as a result of the exchange. In such cases, the asset received is recorded at its fair value, and any difference between the fair value of the asset given up and the fair value of the asset received is recognized as a gain or loss.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Identify the fair value of the asset given up (land) and the fair value of the asset received (machinery).\n\n   - The appraised value of the land is $50,000, which is its fair value.\n   - The fair value of the machinery is $55,000.\n\n2. Determine if there is any cash involved in the exchange. In this case, it's a straight exchange without any cash, so it's a non-monetary exchange.\n\n3. Since the exchange has commercial substance, the gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset received and the fair value of the asset given up.\n\n4. Calculate the gain or loss:\n\n   - Gain = Fair value of asset received - Fair value of asset given up\n   - Gain = $55,000 - $50,000 = $5,000\n\nTherefore, the gain on the exchange is $5,000.\n\nIt's important to note that the original cost of the land ($20,000) is not relevant in this calculation because we are dealing with fair values due to the commercial substance of the exchange.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $5,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
