In 1979, a neighbor, owner of a farm abutting the northeast corner of the 10-acre tract, began to use a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm. He used this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The period of prescription in this particular jurisdiction was 20 years. In March 2000, the neighbor decided to sell the farm to a skier. Thereupon, the neighbor and the skier entered into a written real estate sales contract, with closing set for May 1, 2000. On April 1, 2000, the president of the town development association was approached by the skier with the request that a written easement be given over the used area and that an appropriate instrument be delivered to the skier concurrently with the skier's closing with the neighbor. Following the president's meeting with the skier, the town development association held a duly announced meeting and voted unanimously to authorize its trustees to grant such an easement. On April 15, 2000, the landowner died. The landowner's sole descendant and successor in interest was his wife. Upon her husband's death, the wife immediately notified the town development association that if it granted the easement to the skier, the 10-acre tract would revert to her. The skier then brought an appropriate action, joining the neighbor, the wife, and the town development association, seeking a declaratory judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract.

                    "text": "I've got this problem here, and it's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what's going on.\n\nSo, back in 1974, there's a landowner who owned a 10-acre tract of land in fee simple. He conveyed this tract to the town development association with a condition: that a ski lodge and resort area be built there, and the land be used solely for skiing purposes. And there's this reversion clause: if it's not used as a ski resort, the property reverts to the grantor, which is the landowner, or his heirs and assigns.\n\nAlright, so the town development association built a ski lodge, and the land was used as a ski resort for more than 20 years. That seems fine.\n\nNow, there's a neighbor who owns a farm that abuts the northeast corner of this 10-acre tract. Starting in 1979, this neighbor began using a portion of the 10-acre tract for ingress and egress to his farm. He used this access road openly, visibly, and notoriously until 2000. The jurisdiction has a 20-year prescription period.\n\nSo, in March 2000, the neighbor decides to sell the farm to a skier. They enter into a real estate sales contract, with closing set for May 1, 2000.\n\nOn April 1, 2000, the president of the town development association meets with the skier, who requests a written easement over the used area, to be delivered to the skier at the closing with the neighbor.\n\nAfter this meeting, the town development association holds a meeting and votes unanimously to authorize its trustees to grant such an easement.\n\nThen, on April 15, 2000, the landowner (the original grantor) dies, and his wife is the sole heir and successor in interest.\n\nUpon her husband's death, the wife notifies the town development association that if they grant the easement to the skier, the 10-acre tract will revert to her.\n\nThe skier then brings an action, joining the neighbor, the wife, and the town development association, seeking a declaratory judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract.\n\nThe question is: in this action, judgment should be in favor of which party?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\n\nB. The wife, because the easement would violate the negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose.\n\nC. The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\n\nD. The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\n\nAlright, let's analyze this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the concept of prescription, specifically easement by prescription. In many jurisdictions, if someone uses another's land openly, visibly, and notoriously for a statutory period (in this case, 20 years), they can acquire an easement by prescription.\n\nThe neighbor started using the land in 1979 and continued until 2000, which is more than 20 years. So, it seems like the neighbor might have acquired an easement by prescription.\n\nBut, there's a condition in the conveyance to the town development association: the land must be used solely for skiing purposes, and if not, it reverts to the grantor.\n\nNow, the wife is claiming that granting an easement would violate this condition, causing a reversion.\n\nSo, let's think about this.\n\nFirst, was the land used solely for skiing purposes? It seems like it was used as a ski resort for more than 20 years. However, the neighbor was using a portion of the land for ingress and egress to his farm. Is this a violation of the sole skiing purpose condition?\n\nWell, ingress and egress might be considered a separate use, but perhaps it's incidental to the primary use as a ski resort. It's a bit gray.\n\nBut, assuming that the use for ingress and egress is a separate use, it might be considered a violation of the condition, which could trigger the reversion to the grantor's heirs, which is the wife.\n\nHowever, the neighbor has been using the land for 22 years (1979-2000), which is beyond the 20-year prescription period. So, perhaps the neighbor has acquired an easement by prescription, which would be an interest in the land.\n\nNow, the skier is seeking a declaratory judgment that the neighbor has a perpetual easement appurtenant to the 10-acre tract.\n\nAn easement appurtenant benefits the neighboring land (the farm), and burdens the servient tenement (the 10-acre tract).\n\nSo, if the neighbor has acquired an easement by prescription, then even if there's a reversion, the easement might still exist.\n\nBut, if the land reverts to the wife due to the condition being violated, does the easement by prescription survive the reversion?\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLet me consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A: The wife, because the skier could not obtain rights against the town development association by prescription.\n\nWait, the skier is not trying to get rights by prescription; the neighbor is the one who used the land for 22 years. The skier is just the buyer of the neighbor's farm.\n\nSo, this option seems misdirected.\n\nOption B: The wife, because the easement would violate the negative restriction that the landowner originally sought to impose.\n\nThe original conveyance had a condition that the land be used solely for skiing purposes. If granting an easement for ingress and egress to a neighboring farm is considered a violation of that condition, then perhaps the reversion would occur.\n\nOption C: The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\n\nIf the neighbor had indeed acquired an easement by prescription before the reversion, then even if the land reverts, the easement might still exist.\n\nOption D: The skier, because the language of the conveyance to the town development association was too vague to support any claim by the wife.\n\nI don't think the language is vague. It's clear: \"on condition that a ski lodge and resort area be built thereon and the land be used solely for skiing purposes, and in the event that said property is not used as a ski resort, the property shall revert to myself, the grantor, my heirs or assigns.\"\n\nThat seems pretty clear.\n\nSo, between options B and C, which one is correct?\n\nIf the grantor's condition is that the land be used solely for skiing purposes, and the neighbor's use for ingress and egress is considered a separate use, then perhaps that violates the condition, triggering the reversion.\n\nBut, if the neighbor has already acquired an easement by prescription, which is a legally recognized interest in the land, then perhaps that easement persists even after the reversion.\n\nThis is where it gets tricky.\n\nI think I need to consider the priority of these interests.\n\nWas the prescriptive easement acquired before any potential reversion?\n\nThe neighbor started using the land in 1979 and continued until 2000, so by 1999, they had satisfied the 20-year prescription period.\n\nThe landowner died on April 15, 2000, and the wife claims that upon granting the easement, the land would revert to her.\n\nBut, had the condition already been violated before the landowner's death?\n\nThe neighbor had been using the land for ingress and egress since 1979, which is before the landowner's death.\n\nSo, arguably, the condition was already violated before the landowner's death, which might trigger the reversion.\n\nHowever, the town development association had been using the land as a ski resort during this time.\n\nBut, if the condition requires exclusive use for skiing purposes, and there was a separate use for ingress and egress, that might be a violation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ingress and egress use is incidental and permitted.\n\nThis is unclear.\n\nAssuming that the ingress and egress use does violate the condition, then the land would revert to the grantor or his heirs upon the violation.\n\nBut, if the neighbor had already acquired an easement by prescription before the reversion, that easement might still exist even after the reversion.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, prescriptive easements run with the land and are not extinguished by a change in ownership, including reversion.\n\nTherefore, even if the land reverts to the wife, the easement might still be enforceable against her.\n\nAlternatively, if the reversion cuts off any subsequent interests, including the prescriptive easement, then the wife would own the land free of the easement.\n\nThis is a bit nuanced.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is C: The skier, because the neighbor had already obtained an easement by prescription.\n\nThe neighbor had used the land openly, visibly, and notoriously for more than 20 years, which satisfies the prescription period. Therefore, the neighbor had a prescriptive easement appurtenant to their farm.\n\nEven if the land reverts to the wife due to the violation of the condition, the easement might still be enforceable against her, as it was acquired before the reversion.\n\nTherefore, the skier, as the purchaser of the farm, would inherit the easement appurtenant to the farm.\n\nOption B is tempting, but I think the prescriptive easement takes priority in this case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the skier is not claiming prescriptive rights; the neighbor did.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the language of the conveyance is clear.\n\nTherefore, the judgment should be in favor of the skier.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
