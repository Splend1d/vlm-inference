                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about soybeans and their prices in Canada in 2014 and 2015. The average wholesale price in 2014 was $0.24 per pound, and in 2015 it dropped to $0.16 per pound. A retailer bought 20,000 pounds each year, and I need to find the percent change in the retailer\u2019s expenses from 2014 to 2015. The options are A. \u20138%, B. \u201333%, C. \u201350%, and D. 8%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a percent change is. It's a way to measure the difference in value between two periods and express that difference as a percentage of the original value. The formula for percent change is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{\\text{New Value} - \\text{Original Value}}{\\text{Original Value}} \\times 100\\%\n\\]\n\nIn this case, the \"original value\" is the expense in 2014, and the \"new value\" is the expense in 2015. Since the price per pound changed from $0.24 to $0.16, and the retailer bought the same amount each year (20,000 pounds), I can calculate the expenses for each year and then find the percent change.\n\nLet me calculate the expense for 2014:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expense}_{2014} = 20,000 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$0.24/\\text{pound} = \\$4,800\n\\]\n\nNow, the expense for 2015:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Expense}_{2015} = 20,000 \\text{ pounds} \\times \\$0.16/\\text{pound} = \\$3,200\n\\]\n\nNow, plugging these into the percent change formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{\\$3,200 - \\$4,800}{\\$4,800} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{-\\$1,600}{\\$4,800} \\times 100\\% = -\\frac{1,600}{4,800} \\times 100\\% = -\\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% \\approx -33.33\\%\n\\]\n\nLooking at the options, B is \u201333%, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes, percent change can be confusing, especially with decreases.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the price per pound and calculate the percent decrease directly. The price decreased from $0.24 to $0.16. So, the difference in price is $0.24 - $0.16 = $0.08. Then, the percent decrease would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Decrease} = \\left( \\frac{\\$0.08}{\\$0.24} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 100\\% \\approx 33.33\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, this aligns with my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the expenses, the retailer spent $4,800 in 2014 and $3,200 in 2015. The difference is $1,600 less in 2015. To find the percent change:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{-\\$1,600}{\\$4,800} \\right) \\times 100\\% = -33.33\\%\n\\]\n\nIt's consistent. So, the percent change in the retailer\u2019s expenses from 2014 to 2015 is approximately \u201333%.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, A is \u20138%, which is way off. B is \u201333%, which matches my calculation. C is \u201350%, which would be a bigger decrease, but our calculation shows it's about \u201333%. D is 8%, which is a positive change, but since the expenses decreased, it should be negative.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if there's any other factor involved. For example, did the retailer buy the same amount of soybeans in both years? The problem says, \"the retailer purchased 20,000 pounds of soybeans in 2014 and in 2015.\" So, yes, the quantity is the same each year.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the price change affects the expenses proportionally. Since the quantity is constant, the percent change in expenses should be the same as the percent change in price.\n\nGiven that, I can also calculate the percent change in price directly:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percent Change in Price} = \\frac{\\$0.16 - \\$0.24}{\\$0.24} \\times 100\\% = -33.33\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, this matches my earlier calculation.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. The percent change in the retailer\u2019s expenses from 2014 to 2015 is approximately \u201333%, so the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nTo solve this problem, we first calculated the expenses for the retailer in both 2014 and 2015 based on the given wholesale prices and quantity purchased. Then, we used the percent change formula to determine the percentage decrease in expenses from 2014 to 2015. The calculation showed a decrease of approximately 33%, corresponding to option B. This approach ensures understanding of how price changes affect overall expenses when the quantity remains constant."
