                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It's talking about correlation between high school students' GPA and the amount of time they spend studying each week. The question says that about 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by the amount of time spent studying. I need to choose the correct correlation coefficient from the options: A. 0.02, B. 0.15, C. 0.39, D. 0.85.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for 15% of the variability in GPA to be accounted for by study time. I think this has something to do with the coefficient of determination, which is the square of the correlation coefficient. The coefficient of determination, denoted as r\u00b2, tells us the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from the other variable.\n\nSo, if r\u00b2 = 15% = 0.15, then the correlation coefficient r would be the square root of 0.15. Let me calculate that.\n\n\u221a0.15 \u2248 0.3873\n\nThat's approximately 0.39.\n\nLooking back at the options, C. 0.39 seems to be the closest match.\n\nBut wait, correlation coefficients can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of the relationship. In this case, since more study time is likely associated with higher GPA, the correlation should be positive. So, 0.39 makes sense.\n\nLet me double-check. If r = 0.39, then r\u00b2 \u2248 0.1521, which is about 15%. Yes, that matches the information given in the question.\n\nLet's consider the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: 0.02\n\nIf r = 0.02, then r\u00b2 = 0.0004, which is 0.04%. That's much less than 15%.\n\nOption B: 0.15\n\nIf r = 0.15, then r\u00b2 = 0.0225, which is 2.25%. Still much less than 15%.\n\nOption D: 0.85\n\nIf r = 0.85, then r\u00b2 = 0.7225, which is 72.25%. That's way higher than 15%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 0.39.\n\nI think I've got it right. The key was recalling that the coefficient of determination (r\u00b2) represents the proportion of variance accounted for by the relationship between the two variables.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
