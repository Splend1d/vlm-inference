He often claimed to be from Saturn, which aligned with his broader philosophy and artistic vision that incorporated elements of science fiction, ancient Egyptian culture, and Afrofuturism.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Saturn\n\nTo provide some context, Sun Ra (born Herman Poole Blount in 1914) developed a complex mythology around his origins and identity. He maintained that he was from Saturn and had arrived on Earth with a mission to spread peace and enlightenment through his music. This extraterrestrial aspect was not just a gimmick but a central part of his artistic and philosophical worldview.\n\nSun Ra's approach to music and life was highly original and influential, particularly in the free jazz and avant-garde genres. His bands were known for their experimental sounds and often wore futuristic costumes that reinforced his otherworldly image.\n\nIt's worth noting that the other options provided\u2014Atlantis, Mount Olympus, and being born in a saxophone\u2014are not claims that Sun Ra made about his origins. Atlantis is a mythical lost continent, Mount Olympus is the home of the Greek gods in mythology, and being born in a saxophone is not a claim associated with Sun Ra's self-proclaimed biography.\n\nTherefore, among the given choices, C. Saturn is the correct answer, reflecting Sun Ra's own assertions about his extraterrestrial birthplace.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
