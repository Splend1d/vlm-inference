                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the motion of a real object in free fall, considering that it experiences drag force proportional to its speed and that it hits the ground before reaching terminal speed. We need to choose the correct description of its motion from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when an object falls through the air. In the ideal case without air resistance, an object in free fall would accelerate at a constant rate due to gravity, which is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00b2 near the Earth's surface. However, in reality, air resistance (or drag) plays a significant role, especially for objects with larger surface areas or higher velocities.\n\nThe problem states that the drag force is proportional to the object's speed. So, the drag force F_d can be expressed as:\n\nF_d = -b * v\n\nwhere:\n\n- b is a constant that depends on the object's properties and the medium it's falling through.\n\n- v is the object's velocity (positive downward).\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the drag force opposes the direction of motion.\n\nNow, the net force acting on the object is the force of gravity minus the drag force:\n\nF_net = m * g - b * v\n\nwhere:\n\n- m is the mass of the object.\n\n- g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nUsing Newton's second law, F_net = m * a, where a is the acceleration, we get:\n\nm * a = m * g - b * v\n\nDividing both sides by m:\n\na = g - (b/m) * v\n\nThis equation tells us that the acceleration is less than g and decreases as the velocity increases because the drag force increases with speed.\n\nLet's think about what this means for the object's motion:\n\n1. At the beginning of the fall, when the object is released from rest, its initial velocity is zero. Therefore, the drag force is also zero, and the acceleration is maximum and equal to g.\n\n2. As the object starts falling, it gains speed, which increases the drag force opposing its motion.\n\n3. The increasing drag force reduces the net downward acceleration.\n\n4. Since the acceleration is decreasing but still positive (because g > (b/m)*v), the object continues to speed up but at a decreasing rate.\n\n5. The process continues until the object reaches the ground, and it's given that it doesn't reach terminal speed before hitting the ground.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- The object's speed is increasing throughout the fall.\n\n- The object's acceleration is decreasing throughout the fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the object falls with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. It will fall with increasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nB. It will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nC. It will fall with decreasing speed and increasing acceleration.\n\nD. It will fall with decreasing speed and decreasing acceleration.\n\nOption B matches our conclusion.\n\nTo double-check, let's consider what would happen if the object reached terminal speed. At terminal speed, the drag force equals the force of gravity, so the net force is zero, and the acceleration is zero. The object falls at a constant speed. However, the problem states that the object strikes the ground before reaching terminal speed, so we don't need to consider that scenario here.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the differential equation governing the motion:\n\nm * dv/dt = m * g - b * v\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution for velocity as a function of time is:\n\nv(t) = (m * g / b) * (1 - e^(-b*t/m))\n\nwhere:\n\n- t is time.\n\n- e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that:\n\n- As t increases, v(t) increases toward the terminal velocity (m * g / b).\n\n- The acceleration a = dv/dt decreases exponentially over time.\n\nAgain, this supports the conclusion that the object's speed increases and its acceleration decreases during the fall.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
