                    "text": "So here's this scenario: a homeowner slips and falls in his sunroom because there's a puddle of water that came in through leaks in the roof. The manufacturer of the roof provided nondefective materials to an installer, who was a franchisee, not an employee. The leaks happened because the installer was careless during the installation. The installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo on it, and both the truck and the literature supplied by the installer displayed the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer knew about this.\n\nNow, the question is whether there's any basis for the homeowner to claim against the manufacturer.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.\n\nB. No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.\n\nC. Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.\n\nD. Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.\n\nFirst, option A says no liability because a franchisor doesn't have to supervise the franchisee. That sounds plausible, but maybe there's more to it here.\n\nOption B is about product liability\u2014only defects at the time of sale. But in this case, the materials were nondefective, so that might not apply.\n\nOption C says yes, because the installer was a franchisee. Franchisee relationships can imply certain responsibilities, but I'm not sure if that directly leads to liability here.\n\nOption D mentions apparent agency. That's interesting. Apparent agency is when someone appears to be acting on behalf of another, and a reasonable person would think that they have authority to do so.\n\nLet me think about this. The installer is a franchisee, and the truck and literature have the manufacturer's logo. The homeowner might have thought that the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer.\n\nSo, if the installer is considered an apparent agent of the manufacturer, then the manufacturer could be liable for the installer's negligence.\n\nBut wait, franchisee relationships don't automatically create an agency relationship. Franchising is more about licensing a business model and brand, not creating an employer-employee relationship or an agency relationship.\n\nHowever, in some cases, if the franchisor exerts control over the franchisee's operations or holds themselves out as being in control, that could lead to an agency relationship.\n\nHere, the manufacturer knew that the installer was using their logo on the truck and literature. That might suggest that the manufacturer is holding itself out as being involved with the installer's services.\n\nAdditionally, if the manufacturer had provided training or had guidelines for installers, that could also be a factor.\n\nBut in general, franchisees are independent contractors, and franchisors aren't usually liable for their acts.\n\nWait, but apparent agency looks at how things appear to a reasonable person. So, if the homeowner saw the manufacturer's logo on the truck and literature, they might reasonably think that the installer was authorized by the manufacturer, perhaps even an employee or agent.\n\nIf that's the case, then the manufacturer could be liable for the installer's negligence under the principle of apparent agency.\n\nOn the other hand, if there's no reason for the homeowner to believe that the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer, then no liability would attach.\n\nBut given that the installer was a franchisee and was using the manufacturer's logo, it seems plausible that the homeowner could have believed there was a closer relationship between the installer and the manufacturer.\n\nMoreover, the manufacturer was aware of this use of their logo, so they couldn't claim ignorance.\n\nTherefore, it seems like there might be a basis for apparent agency here, which could make the manufacturer liable for the installer's negligence.\n\nOption D seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption C just says yes because the installer was a franchisee, but franchisee relationships don't automatically lead to liability for the franchisor's acts.\n\nOption A says no because franchisors don't have to supervise franchisees, which is true, but doesn't account for the apparent agency aspect.\n\nOption B is about product liability, which doesn't apply here since the materials were nondefective.\n\nSo, I think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) Yes, under the rule of apparent agency."
