The options are the hypothalamus, cerebellum, reticular formation, and thalamus. I think the thalamus might be the right answer, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me see what I remember about these brain parts.\n\nFirst, the hypothalamus. I know that it's involved in regulating bodily functions and hormones. It's like the control center for things like hunger, thirst, and body temperature. So, it seems more about homeostasis than relaying sensory information.\n\nNext, the cerebellum. I recall that it's important for coordinating movement and balance. Like, when you're riding a bike or playing sports, the cerebellum helps with those fine motor skills. Doesn't sound directly related to sensory relay.\n\nThen there's the reticular formation. I think that's part of the brainstem and it's involved in arousal and sleep-wake cycles. It might also play a role in pain modulation. But again, not primarily a relay station for sensory information.\n\nFinally, the thalamus. I believe this is the key structure for relaying sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex. It's often called the \"relay station\" of the brain because it receives sensory information and sends it on to the appropriate area of the cortex for processing.\n\nLet me double-check. Sensory information comes into the thalamus from the peripheral nerves, and then the thalamus directs that information to the correct cortical area. For example, visual information goes from the eyes to the thalamus and then to the visual cortex.\n\nI think the other options don't fit as well. The hypothalamus is more about regulating internal body states, the cerebellum is about motor control, and the reticular formation is involved in arousal and sleep.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with D. thalamus as the primary structure for relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
