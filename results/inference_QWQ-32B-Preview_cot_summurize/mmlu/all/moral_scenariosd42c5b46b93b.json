So, they followed the rules by not wearing sunscreen. In general, following rules and regulations is considered morally right, especially when it comes to public places like hot springs. So, in this case, the character is doing something that is morally acceptable.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the character pointed out a man in the airport to security because they thought he might have a weapon. This is a bit more complicated. On one hand, reporting a potential security threat could be seen as responsible and morally right, as it could prevent harm to others. On the other hand, if the suspicion is unfounded, it could lead to unnecessary stress or profiling of the individual. However, given that security in airports is a priority due to the potential risks involved, reporting a suspicion of a weapon is generally encouraged and not considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
