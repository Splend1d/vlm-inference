Smaller inner circles\n\nD. Smaller outer circles\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"inner circles\" and \"outer circles\" mean in this context. I think \"inner circles\" refer to close relationships, like family and best friends, while \"outer circles\" might include more distant acquaintances, like coworkers or casual friends.\n\nNow, I need to think about how these circles differ between older and younger adults. I know that as people age, their social networks tend to change. Older adults often have smaller social networks compared to younger adults. This is sometimes called the \"contraction hypothesis,\" which suggests that as we age, we become more selective in our social relationships and focus on closer, more meaningful connections.\n\nSo, if older adults have smaller social networks, does that mean their inner circles are smaller or larger? And what about their outer circles?\n\nLet me consider option A: Larger inner circles. If older adults have larger inner circles, that would mean they have more close relationships. But according to the contraction hypothesis, they tend to focus on closer relationships, but not necessarily have more of them. So, maybe not.\n\nOption B: Larger outer circles. This would suggest that older adults have more distant acquaintances. But again, the contraction hypothesis suggests that their social networks shrink, so maybe their outer circles are smaller.\n\nOption C: Smaller inner circles. If older adults have smaller inner circles, that would mean they have fewer close relationships. But actually, research shows that older adults tend to maintain their closest relationships, even if their overall network shrinks.\n\nOption D: Smaller outer circles. This seems plausible because older adults might have fewer distant acquaintances as their social networks contract.\n\nWait, but if their overall network is smaller, both inner and outer circles might be smaller. So, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the difference is in the ratio or the relative sizes of inner versus outer circles.\n\nLet me look up some information about social networks in older adults.\n\nAfter doing a quick search, I find that older adults tend to have smaller but more intimate social networks. They prioritize quality over quantity in their relationships.\n\nSo, their inner circles might be similar in size or even a bit larger in terms of the closeness, but their outer circles are probably smaller because they have fewer distant acquaintances.\n\nBut looking back at the options, it's asking about which circle is larger or smaller in comparison.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the relative sizes of inner and outer circles between older and younger adults.\n\nIf older adults have smaller overall networks but more close relationships, perhaps their inner circles are proportionally larger compared to their outer circles compared to younger adults.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nLet me consider that older adults have smaller outer circles compared to younger adults, while their inner circles might be similar or slightly smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps older adults have smaller outer circles but maintain their inner circles.\n\nSo, compared to younger adults, older adults have smaller outer circles.\n\nThat would make option D correct: Smaller outer circles.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nYounger adults might have larger overall social networks, including both inner and outer circles, but relatively more in the outer circles because they are still building their networks and have more casual relationships.\n\nOlder adults, having had more time to form close relationships, might have more stable inner circles, but fewer outer circle relationships.\n\nSo, in comparison, older adults have smaller outer circles.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Smaller outer circles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
