I have this question here: \"What is the art of elegant handwriting called?\" and there are four options: A. calligraphy, B. engraving, C. decoupage, and D. lithography. I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, I should understand what each of these terms means. Let's start with calligraphy. I've heard of calligraphy before; it's often associated with beautiful, decorative handwriting, right? Like the kind you see in invitations or formal documents. So, that sounds pretty close to what the question is asking for.\n\nNext, engraving. Engraving is a technique where you carve or etch a design into a surface, like wood or metal. It's more about creating images or text by cutting into a material, not really about handwriting itself. So, that might not be the answer.\n\nDecoupage is a craft where you decorate objects by gluing cutouts, usually paper, onto them and then coating them with varnish or some other sealant. It's like a form of collage. That doesn't seem related to handwriting at all.\n\nLithography is a printing technique where you use stone or metal plates with a coating that repels or attracts ink to create prints. Again, this is more about printing processes rather than handwriting.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, calligraphy seems to be the one that specifically refers to the art of elegant handwriting. Engraving, decoupage, and lithography are all different arts or techniques that don't directly relate to handwriting.\n\nTo make sure, I can think about other contexts where these terms are used. For example, calligraphy is often used in art and design for its aesthetic value, especially in texts like wedding invitations or logos. Engraving is used for creating lasting impressions on hard surfaces, like jewelry or guns. Decoupage is used to decorate household items with paper cutouts, and lithography is a method for mass-producing printed materials.\n\nGiven that, calligraphy is the only option that directly involves handwriting as an art form. So, I think the answer is A. calligraphy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
