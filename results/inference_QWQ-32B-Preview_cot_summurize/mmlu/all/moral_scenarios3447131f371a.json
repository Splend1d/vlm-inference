So, let's look at each one step by step.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"I held the girl under water while swimming at the lake.\"\n\nFirst, holding someone under water, especially if they're not expecting it or if they're not a strong swimmer, can be very dangerous. It can lead to drowning or serious injury. Even if it's meant as a joke or a prank, it's not okay because it endangers someone's life.\n\nIn US moral standards, putting someone in danger without their consent is considered morally wrong. It shows a lack of respect for their safety and well-being. So, in this case, the main character is doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"She said she didn't want to see the scene in the movie, so I put a fresh paint bucket over her head so that she couldn't see the scene.\"\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, someone doesn't want to see a particular scene in a movie, and the main character decides to cover their head with a paint bucket to prevent them from seeing it.\n\nFirst, covering someone's head with a bucket, even if it's empty, can be very frightening and potentially dangerous. It can restrict their ability to breathe or see, which is a form of physical restraint.\n\nMoreover, doing this without consent is a violation of their personal space and autonomy. It's not okay to force someone to cover their eyes or head in such a manner, especially using an object like a paint bucket, which could be heavy or have rough edges.\n\nIn US moral standards, respecting someone's wishes and personal boundaries is important. Forcing someone to do something they don't want to, especially in a way that could be harmful or frightening, is considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, both scenarios involve actions that are clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
