We need to find the value of \\(f(f(2))\\).\n\nFirst, let's understand what invertible means. If a function is invertible, it means that there's another function, called its inverse, denoted as \\(f^{-1}(x)\\), that \"undoes\" what \\(f(x)\\) does. So, if you apply \\(f\\) and then \\(f^{-1}\\), or vice versa, you get back to your original input.\n\nGiven that \\(f(2) = 4\\), that means when you input 2 into \\(f\\), you get 4. Similarly, \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\) means that when you input 2 into the inverse function, you get 4. But what does that tell us about \\(f(4)\\)?\n\nWell, since \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), that implies that \\(f(4) = 2\\). Because the inverse function essentially swaps the inputs and outputs of the original function. So, if \\(f\\) maps 4 to 2, then \\(f^{-1}\\) maps 2 back to 4.\n\nNow, we need to find \\(f(f(2))\\). We already know that \\(f(2) = 4\\), so \\(f(f(2)) = f(4)\\). And from above, we've deduced that \\(f(4) = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(f(f(2)) = 2\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 0\n\nThe correct answer should be B. 2.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing.\n\nWe have \\(f(2) = 4\\) and \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), which leads to \\(f(4) = 2\\). So, \\(f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2\\). That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's some property of invertible functions that I should consider here. Let's think about the composition of a function and its inverse. We know that \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\) and \\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\\), for all \\(x\\) in the appropriate domains.\n\nGiven that, and knowing that \\(f(2) = 4\\) and \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), does that give us any additional insights?\n\nWait a minute, if \\(f(2) = 4\\) and \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), and considering that \\(f(f^{-1}(x)) = x\\), then plugging in \\(x = 2\\), we have \\(f(f^{-1}(2)) = 2\\). But \\(f^{-1}(2) = 4\\), so \\(f(4) = 2\\). Which is what we already have.\n\nSimilarly, \\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\\), so \\(f^{-1}(f(2)) = 2\\). But \\(f(2) = 4\\), so \\(f^{-1}(4) = 2\\). That's another piece of information: \\(f^{-1}(4) = 2\\), which implies that \\(f(2) = 4\\), which we already knew.\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Therefore, \\(f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2\\).\n\nI think the answer is indeed 2, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2} \\]"
