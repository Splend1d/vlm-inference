                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. I need to recall some details about VGGNets and AlexNet, and also about data-dependent weight initialization and Batch Normalization.\n\n**Statement 1:** VGGNets have convolutional kernels of smaller width and height than AlexNet's first-layer kernels.\n\nFirst, I know that VGGNets are known for their simplicity and consistency in the architecture, using small convolutional kernels throughout the network. Specifically, VGGNets predominantly use 3x3 convolutional kernels in their layers.\n\nOn the other hand, AlexNet, which was one of the pioneering convolutional neural networks, used larger kernels in its initial layers. If I remember correctly, the first layer of AlexNet used 11x11 kernels.\n\nSo, comparing the kernel sizes:\n\n- VGGNet: 3x3 kernels\n\n- AlexNet: 11x11 kernels in the first layer\n\nTherefore, VGGNets do have smaller convolutional kernels than AlexNet's first-layer kernels. So, Statement 1 seems to be True.\n\n**Statement 2:** Data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization.\n\nNow, I need to think about the timeline of these concepts in deep learning.\n\nBatch Normalization was introduced in 2015 by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in their paper \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.\" This technique was a significant advancement in training deeper networks by normalizing the inputs to each layer.\n\nRegarding weight initialization, there have been several methods over the years, such as Xavier/Glorot initialization and He initialization, which are data-dependent in the sense that they consider the size of the layers for initializing weights.\n\nXavier initialization was proposed in 2010, and He initialization in 2015, around the same time as Batch Normalization.\n\nWait, He initialization is from 2015, the same year as Batch Normalization. So, data-dependent initialization procedures were being developed around the same time as Batch Normalization.\n\nBut was there any data-dependent weight initialization before Batch Normalization?\n\nXavier/Glorot initialization was proposed in 2010, which is before Batch Normalization (2015). This initialization method takes into account the number of input and output units in the weight tensor to maintain the variance of the activations.\n\nSo, yes, data-dependent weight initialization procedures were introduced before Batch Normalization.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also True.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should be A. True, True.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check.\n\nStatement 1: VGGNets have smaller kernels than AlexNet's first layer. Yes, 3x3 vs. 11x11.\n\nStatement 2: Data-dependent weight initialization before Batch Normalization. Yes, Xavier initialization in 2010.\n\nSo, A. True, True seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
