                    "text": " Let's dive into Sarah Fine's \"internal critique\" of Wellman's argument. So, Wellman has this idea about freedom of association and how it relates to a state's right to exclude people from its territory. Fine is critiquing his argument from the inside, meaning she's accepting some of his premises but finding flaws in how he's using them.\n\nFirst off, Wellman claims that we have an absolute right to freedom of association. That means no matter what, we can choose who to associate with, and nothing can override that right. It's like saying you can pick your friends, and no one can tell you otherwise, under any circumstances.\n\nNow, from this absolute right to freedom of association, Wellman argues that a legitimate state has a presumptive right to exclude anyone from its territory. So, if a country is legitimate, it basically has the initial right to keep people out unless there's a really good reason to let them in.\n\nFine is poking holes in this reasoning. She's saying that even if we accept that there's a right to freedom of association, it doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion that states have a presumptive right to exclude immigrants. There might be some steps missing in his argument, or maybe some assumptions that aren't holds water.\n\nOne thing Fine might be questioning is whether the right to freedom of association is truly absolute. Maybe there are situations where this right can be overridden for the greater good or to prevent harm. For example, if someone is associating with a harmful group, perhaps society has an interest in restricting that association to protect others.\n\nAdditionally, Fine might be arguing that even if freedom of association is a right, applying it to states in the way Wellman does is problematic. States are not like individuals; they have different responsibilities and obligations. So, maybe the right to freedom of association doesn't translate in the same way to state actions as it does to individual actions.\n\nAnother angle could be that Fine disputes the connection between freedom of association and the right to exclude. Maybe she thinks that even if a state has a right to choose its members, it doesn't follow that it can exclude anyone it wants. There might be moral or legal limits to exclusion, such as human rights considerations or the need to admit refugees.\n\nFurthermore, Fine might be pointing out that Wellman's argument relies on a particular conception of a state, perhaps one that prioritizes the interests of its current members over the rights of potential immigrants. She could be arguing that this conception is flawed or incomplete, and that a more comprehensive view of state legitimacy would include considerations for admitting immigrants under certain conditions.\n\nIn summary, Sarah Fine's internal critique of Wellman's argument likely involves accepting some of his premises about freedom of association but challenging the validity of his conclusions regarding a state's right to exclude immigrants. She might be questioning the absoluteness of the right to freedom of association, the applicability of this right to states, the connection between association and exclusion, and the overall conception of state legitimacy that Wellman is employing.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{A. we have an absolute right to freedom of association (i.e., one that cannot be outweighed by anything else).}} \\]"
