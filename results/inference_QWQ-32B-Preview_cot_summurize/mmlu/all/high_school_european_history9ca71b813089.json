Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n\u2014Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days. The pattern established at the outset has remained unchanged to this day, and the Spaniards still do nothing save tear the natives to shreds, murder them and inflict upon them untold misery, suffering and distress, tormenting, harrying and persecuting them mercilessly. We shall in due course describe some of the many ingenious methods of torture they have invented and refined for this purpose, but one can get some idea of the effectiveness of their methods from the figures alone. When the Spanish first journeyed there, the indigenous population of the island of Hispaniola stood at some three million; today only two hundred survive. Their reason for killing and destroying such an infinite number of souls is that the Christians have an ultimate aim, which is to acquire gold, and to swell themselves with riches in a very brief time and thus rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits.\n\u2014Bartholomew de las Casas: A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, 1542\nWhich of the following motives for exploration does de las Casas seem to be criticizing in Source 2?\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\nB. Financial gain\nC. Personal glory\nD. Finding new mates\n"

                    "text": "So I have these two sources here, one from Christopher Columbus and the other from Bartholomew de las Casas. They're both talking about the exploration and interaction with the natives in the New World, but their perspectives seem really different.\n\nIn Source 1, Columbus is writing about how the natives would trade their valuable items like cotton and gold for trivial European goods like bows and glasses. He seems concerned about this unfair exchange and even says he gave them many beautiful articles without taking anything in return. His motive appears to be to conciliate them, make them Christians, and get them to be interested in providing the things Spain needed.\n\nOn the other hand, Source 2 is from de las Casas, and it's pretty harsh. He compares the Spanish to ravening wolves and savage lions, attacking the natives mercilessly. He talks about the Spaniards torturing and murdering the natives, leading to a massive decrease in population, from three million to just two hundred on Hispaniola. His account is focused on the cruelty and the greed of the Spaniards, who he says are only interested in acquiring gold quickly to become rich.\n\nSo, the question is asking which motive for exploration de las Casas seems to be criticizing in Source 2. The options are:\n\nA. Converting the natives to Christianity\n\nB. Financial gain\n\nC. Personal glory\n\nD. Finding new mates\n\nLooking at Source 2, de las Casas mentions that the Spaniards have an ultimate aim to acquire gold and swell themselves with riches quickly. He says they want to rise to a high estate disproportionate to their merits, which sounds like they're after wealth and status. So, financial gain seems to be a major motive he's criticizing here.\n\nHe also mentions that the pattern established was to kill and destroy the natives, which suggests that the primary goal wasn't to convert them to Christianity, but rather to exploit them for gold. In fact, he contrasts this with the supposed aim of conversion, implying that the actual actions were contrary to that noble purpose.\n\nThere's no direct mention of personal glory or finding new mates in this source. The focus is on the brutal treatment of the natives for the sake of gold.\n\nSo, based on this, it seems that de las Casas is criticizing the motive of financial gain in Source 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
