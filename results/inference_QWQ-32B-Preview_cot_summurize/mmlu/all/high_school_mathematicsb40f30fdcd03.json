That means I have to plug h(x) into g(x), and then plug that result into f(x). Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll find g(h(x)). Since g(x) = 5x + 3, and I'm plugging h(x) in place of x, it should be g(h(x)) = 5*(h(x)) + 3. Now, h(x) = 1 - x\u00b2, so g(h(x)) = 5*(1 - x\u00b2) + 3.\n\nLet me calculate that: 5 times (1 - x\u00b2) is 5*1 - 5*x\u00b2 = 5 - 5x\u00b2. Then adding 3: 5 - 5x\u00b2 + 3 = 8 - 5x\u00b2. So, g(h(x)) = 8 - 5x\u00b2.\n\nNext, I need to find f(g(h(x))), which is f(8 - 5x\u00b2). Since f(x) = 3x, f(8 - 5x\u00b2) = 3*(8 - 5x\u00b2).\n\nLet's compute that: 3 times 8 is 24, and 3 times -5x\u00b2 is -15x\u00b2. So, f(g(h(x))) = 24 - 15x\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, looking back at the options, option C is \u201315x\u00b2 + 24, which is the same as 24 - 15x\u00b2. So, it seems like the answer is C.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, g(h(x)) = 5*(1 - x\u00b2) + 3 = 5 - 5x\u00b2 + 3 = 8 - 5x\u00b2. That seems correct.\n\nThen, f(g(h(x))) = 3*(8 - 5x\u00b2) = 24 - 15x\u00b2. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as -15x\u00b2 + 24, which matches option C.\n\nI don't see any errors in my steps. So, I think the correct answer is C. \u201315x\u00b2 + 24.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
