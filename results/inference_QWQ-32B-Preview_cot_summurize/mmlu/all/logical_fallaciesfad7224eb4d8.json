It says: \"Arguing that a claim must be true merely because a substantial number of people believe it is called the fallacy of...\" and then it gives options: A. Tu quoque, B. Composition, C. Appeal to the masses, D. Appeal to reason.\n\nOkay, first, I need to remember what each of these fallacies means.\n\nLet's start with option A, tu quoque. I think that's the \"you too\" fallacy, where someone deflects criticism by pointing out that the critic has done the same thing. So, that doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nOption B is composition. I recall that's when someone assumes that what is true of the part is also true of the whole. Like, if one person in a group is smart, the whole group must be smart, which isn't necessarily true. That doesn't match the description in the question.\n\nOption C is appeal to the masses. I think that's when someone argues that something must be true because a lot of people believe it. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing. So, this might be the answer.\n\nOption D is appeal to reason. I'm not sure about this one. I think it might be related to appealing to logic or rationality, but the way it's phrased here seems a bit off. Maybe it's a misnomer or something.\n\nWait, maybe appeal to reason isn't a standard fallacy name. Let me double-check that.\n\nLooking back, the question is about arguing that a claim must be true just because many people believe it. That really sounds like appeal to popularity or appeal to the masses, which is a well-known fallacy.\n\nSo, option C seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me make sure I understand why the other options don't fit.\n\nTu quoque is about deflecting blame by accusing the accuser of the same thing, which isn't related to the number of people believing something.\n\nComposition is about incorrectly extending what's true of parts to the whole, which again, isn't about popularity of belief.\n\nAppeal to reason sounds more like appealing to logical thinking, which isn't a fallacy; in fact, it's the opposite of a fallacy.\n\nTherefore, the fallacy being described in the question is indeed the appeal to the masses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. Appeal to the masses}} \\]"
