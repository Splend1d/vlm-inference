                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about residuals in regression analysis. I need to identify which statement among the options A through D is true. I'll go through each one carefully.\n\nStarting with option A: \"Influential scores have large residuals.\" Hmm, influential points are those that, if removed, would significantly change the regression line. They don't necessarily have large residuals. Residuals measure the vertical distance between the observed point and the regression line, while influence relates to how much a point affects the slope of the line. So, an influential point could have a small residual but still affect the slope greatly, perhaps by being an outlier in the x-direction. Therefore, I think A is not necessarily true.\n\nOption B: \"If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals.\" A good linear model should have residuals that are randomly scattered around zero, with no particular pattern. While it's ideal to have roughly equal numbers of positive and negative residuals, it's not a strict requirement. For example, if you have 10 data points, having 5 positive and 5 negative residuals is balanced, but having 6 positive and 4 negative isn't necessarily bad, as long as there's no systematic pattern. So, B seems too rigid and not entirely accurate.\n\nOption C: \"The mean of the residuals is always zero.\" This one rings a bell. In ordinary least squares regression, one of the properties is that the sum of the residuals is zero, which implies that the mean residual is zero, assuming the intercept is included in the model. This is because the regression line passes through the mean of the data points. So, C seems to be true.\n\nOption D: \"If the correlation is 0, there will be a distinct pattern in the residual plot.\" If the correlation between the variables is 0, that means there's no linear relationship. In that case, the best-fit line would be horizontal, and the residuals would show no particular pattern, just random scatter. So, if the correlation is 0, the residual plot shouldn't show any distinct pattern; it should look random. Therefore, D seems false.\n\nBased on this reasoning, option C appears to be the correct statement about residuals.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
