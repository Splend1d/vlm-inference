                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: we're rolling two fair 6-sided dice, and I need to find the probability that the two numbers rolled sum up to 4. The options are 1/4, 1/12, 1/3, and 1/9. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you roll two dice, there are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes, since each die has 6 faces and the outcomes are independent. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 36.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these outcomes sum up to 4. Let me list out the possible pairs that add up to 4:\n\n- 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, there are three outcomes that result in a sum of 4: (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1).\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 3.\n\nNow, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, that would be 3/36, which simplifies to 1/12.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that. Maybe there are more ways to get a sum of 4. Let's list all possible pairs again:\n\n- Die 1 shows 1: Die 2 needs to show 3 (1+3=4)\n\n- Die 1 shows 2: Die 2 needs to show 2 (2+2=4)\n\n- Die 1 shows 3: Die 2 needs to show 1 (3+1=4)\n\n- Die 1 shows 4: Die 2 would need to show 0, but that's not possible since the lowest is 1.\n\n- Similarly, higher numbers on die 1 wouldn't work because die 2 can't go below 1.\n\nSo, yes, only three possible outcomes sum to 4.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 3/36 = 1/12.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1/12 is option B.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this. Maybe using combinations or something.\n\nThe number of ways to get a sum of 4 can be thought of as the number of integer solutions to the equation x + y = 4, where x and y are each between 1 and 6, inclusive.\n\nSo, solving x + y = 4 with 1 \u2264 x,y \u2264 6.\n\nAs before, the solutions are (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). So, again, three solutions.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use the concept of combinations, but since the dice are distinguishable, it's better to think in terms of ordered pairs.\n\nIf the dice were indistinguishable, then (1,3) and (3,1) would be considered the same, but since they are distinct dice, order matters, so they are different outcomes.\n\nTherefore, 3 favorable outcomes out of 36 possible ones, leading to a probability of 1/12.\n\nI don't see any mistake in this reasoning. So, I think the answer is indeed 1/12, which is option B.\n\nBut why are there other options like 1/4, 1/3, and 1/9? Maybe they correspond to different sums or some miscounting.\n\nFor example, if someone thought that any sum from 2 to 12 is equally likely, which is not true, they might mistake the probability.\n\nActually, the possible sums range from 2 to 12, and not all sums have the same number of ways to achieve them.\n\nFor instance, sum 2 can only be achieved by (1,1), so only one way.\n\nSum 3 can be (1,2) and (2,1), so two ways.\n\nSum 4 is three ways, as above.\n\nSum 5 is four ways: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1).\n\nSum 6 is five ways: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1).\n\nSum 7 is six ways: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1).\n\nThen sums decrease symmetrically:\n\nSum 8: five ways\n\nSum 9: four ways\n\nSum 10: three ways\n\nSum 11: two ways\n\nSum 12: one way\n\nSo, the number of ways to achieve each sum is not uniform, which is why assuming all sums are equally likely would be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability for summing to 4 is indeed 3/36 = 1/12.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{12}} \\]"
