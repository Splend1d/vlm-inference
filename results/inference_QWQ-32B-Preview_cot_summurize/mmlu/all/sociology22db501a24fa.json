                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about white-collar crime. It says, \"White-collar crime is low in visibility because:\" and then gives four options. Let's see.\n\nOption A says, \"it involves only small amounts of money.\" Hmm, I don't think that's right. White-collar crimes often involve large sums of money, like embezzlement or fraud cases where millions can be stolen. So, if anything, the amount of money involved makes them more visible, not less.\n\nOption B says, \"the proletariat can outsmart the bourgeoisie.\" Now, proletariat and bourgeoisie are terms from Marxist theory. Proletariat refers to the working class, and bourgeoisie to the capitalist class. I'm not sure how this relates to white-collar crime visibility. White-collar crimes are typically committed by people in positions of power or trust, which would be more aligned with the bourgeoisie. So, this option seems off.\n\nOption C says, \"the police turn a blind eye to corporate crime.\" That's an interesting point. It's possible that law enforcement might be less likely to pursue cases against corporations or high-ranking individuals due to various reasons, like the complexity of the cases or political influence. However, I think visibility is more about whether the public is aware of the crime, not necessarily whether the police investigate it.\n\nOption D says, \"it goes undetected in the context of everyday business transactions.\" This seems plausible. White-collar crimes often involve complex financial transactions that are hard for the average person to understand or detect. They might occur over long periods and be hidden within legitimate business activities. So, they can be hard to spot unless someone specifically looks for them.\n\nLet me think about this again. The question is about visibility, meaning how noticeable or apparent the crimes are. If option A is wrong because these crimes often involve large amounts, then perhaps the issue is that they're hidden within normal business operations, making them hard to see.\n\nAlso, considering that white-collar crimes are often non-violent and don't involve physical evidence like burglaries or assaults, they might not draw as much public attention or media coverage. People might not hear about them as much unless there's a big scandal.\n\nMoreover, the perpetrators are often respected members of society, which could create a culture where their crimes are overlooked or excused.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, option D seems the most accurate. It directly addresses the issue of detection within normal business activities, which aligns with why white-collar crimes might be low in visibility.\n\nI think I'll go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
