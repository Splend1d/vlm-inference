So, it's about ensuring that the sender can't backtrack or lie about sending a particular message.\n\nOption A is \"Message Nonrepudiation.\" That sounds familiar. Nonrepudiation means that a party involved in a communication cannot deny their participation. Specifically, in the context of messaging, it ensures that the sender cannot deny having sent a message, and the recipient cannot deny having received it. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption B is \"Message Integrity.\" Integrity is about ensuring that the message has not been altered in transit. So, it's more about the message remaining unchanged from when it was sent until it was received. That's important, but it's not directly about preventing the sender from denying having sent the message.\n\nOption C is \"Message Confidentiality.\" Confidentiality is about keeping the message secret and ensuring that only authorized parties can access it. So, it's related to privacy and security, but again, it doesn't directly address the issue of the sender denying having sent the message.\n\nOption D is \"Message Sending.\" That seems too generic. It probably just refers to the act of sending a message, without any specific security properties attached to it.\n\nGiven these explanations, it seems like \"Message Nonrepudiation\" is the principle that prevents the sender from denying having sent a message. So, the correct answer should be A.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's think about why the other options don't fit.\n\n- Integrity is about protecting the message from being tampered with, not about proving who sent it.\n\n- Confidentiality is about keeping the message secret, not about ensuring that the sender can't deny sending it.\n\n- \"Message Sending\" is too broad and doesn't specify any security features.\n\nTherefore, A, Message Nonrepudiation, is indeed the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
