                    "text": "Let's tackle this translation problem step by step. The sentence is \"No senior graduates without a major.\" We need to translate this into predicate logic and choose the best option among the given choices.\n\nFirst, let's break down the sentence:\n\n- \"No senior graduates without a major.\"\n\nThis can be rephrased to make it clearer:\n\n- \"There are no senior graduates who do not have a major.\"\n\nOr, in other words:\n\n- \"All senior graduates have a major.\"\n\nNow, let's define the predicates:\n\n- Let Sx be \"x is a senior.\"\n\n- Let Gx be \"x is a graduate.\"\n\n- Let Mx be \"x has a major.\"\n\nThe sentence is about senior graduates without a major, so we need to relate these predicates accordingly.\n\nThe original sentence is \"No senior graduates without a major.\" This means that if someone is a senior graduate, then they must have a major. In other words, there are no senior graduates who lack a major.\n\nIn predicate logic, \"no A are B\" can be translated as \"for all x, if x is A, then x is not B.\" But in this case, it's a bit more complex because it's \"no senior graduates without a major.\"\n\nLet's consider the structure:\n\n- Senior graduates without a major: these are individuals who are seniors and graduates but do not have a major.\n\nSo, the sentence is saying that there are no such individuals.\n\nIn logic, \"there are no x such that P(x)\" can be written as \"for all x, not P(x).\"\n\nTherefore, \"no senior graduates without a major\" can be written as:\n\n\"For all x, if x is a senior graduate without a major, then it is not the case.\"\n\nBut more accurately:\n\n\"For all x, if x is a senior and a graduate and does not have a major, then it is false.\"\n\nOr simply:\n\n\"There does not exist an x such that x is a senior and a graduate and does not have a major.\"\n\nIn predicate logic:\n\n~(\u2203x)(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2227 ~Mx)\n\nThis can be rewritten using the universal quantifier:\n\n(\u2200x) ~(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2227 ~Mx)\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly matches this. So, perhaps we need to simplify or rearrange the expression.\n\nLet's consider the implications.\n\nThe statement \"no senior graduates without a major\" can be rephrased as \"all senior graduates have a major.\"\n\nSo:\n\n\"All senior graduates have a major.\"\n\nIn logic:\n\n(\u2200x)(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2283 Mx)\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the given options directly.\n\nWait a minute, the options provided are:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 ~Gx)\n\nB. ~(\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Gx)\n\nC. (\u2200x)( ~Sx \u2283 ~Gx)\n\nD. (\u2200x) ~(Sx \u2283 ~Gx)\n\nHmm, none of these directly match what I have so far.\n\nMaybe I need to look at the sentence differently.\n\n\" No senior graduates without a major.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as \"there are no seniors who are graduates and do not have a major.\"\n\nSo:\n\n~(\u2203x)(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2227 ~Mx)\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nBut to match it with the given options, perhaps I need to manipulate this expression.\n\nLet's try to express it in terms of conditionals.\n\nWe know that P \u2283 Q is equivalent to ~P \u2228 Q.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nOur target expression is:\n\n(\u2200x) ~(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2227 ~Mx)\n\nThis can be rewritten using De Morgan's law:\n\n(\u2200x)(~Sx \u2228 ~Gx \u2228 Mx)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n(\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 (~Gx \u2228 Mx))\n\nThis seems a bit closer, but still not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that \"no senior graduates without a major\" means that if someone is a senior graduate, then they must have a major.\n\nSo:\n\n(\u2200x)(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2283 Mx)\n\nBut this is not among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the translation is about seniors and graduates in a different way.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one:\n\nA. (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 ~Gx)\n\nThis means \"forall x, if x is a senior, then x is not a graduate.\" Which translates to \"no seniors are graduates.\" But that's not what the original sentence says.\n\nB. ~(\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Gx)\n\nThis is \"not (forall x, if x is a senior, then x is a graduate),\" which is equivalent to \"there exists an x such that x is a senior and x is not a graduate.\" In other words, \"not all seniors are graduates.\" Again, not matching the original sentence.\n\nC. (\u2200x)( ~Sx \u2283 ~Gx)\n\nThis means \"forall x, if x is not a senior, then x is not a graduate.\" Which is equivalent to \"all graduates are seniors.\" Not matching the original sentence.\n\nD. (\u2200x) ~(Sx \u2283 ~Gx)\n\nThis is \"forall x, not (if x is a senior, then x is not a graduate).\" Which is equivalent to \"forall x, x is a senior and x is a graduate.\" Meaning \"all seniors are graduates.\" Still not matching the original sentence.\n\nNone of these options seem to correctly capture \"no senior graduates without a major.\"\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the translation or the options are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is about seniors who graduate, and the condition is that they have a major.\n\nIn that case, \"all senior graduates have a major\" would be the correct interpretation.\n\nBut given the options, it seems like there might be a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"graduates without a major\" is being considered, but still, the options don't align with the standard translations.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that least misrepresents the original sentence.\n\nOption D is \"forall x, not (if x is a senior, then x is not a graduate),\" which effectively means \"all seniors are graduates.\" This is not exactly what the original says, but it's closer than the others.\n\nOption A says \"all seniors are not graduates,\" which directly contradicts the original.\n\nOption B says \"not all seniors are graduates,\" which also doesn't match.\n\nOption C says \"all non-seniors are not graduates,\" meaning \"all graduates are seniors,\" which again doesn't match.\n\nSo, perhaps Option D is the least worst choice, but it's still not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the options, and the correct translation should have been (\u2200x)(Sx \u2227 Gx \u2283 Mx), which isn't listed.\n\nGiven the available options, I would select Option D as the closest, although it's not an accurate translation of the original sentence.\n\nThis is a bit confusing, and it's possible that the question has an error or the options are misstated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
