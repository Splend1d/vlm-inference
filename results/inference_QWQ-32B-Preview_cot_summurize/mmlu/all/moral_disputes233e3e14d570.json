                    "text": "So I'm trying to understand Wellman's response to the objection about freedom of movement in the context of open borders. The question is presenting four options, and I need to figure out which one correctly represents part of his response.\n\nOption A says that he would say this begs the question because the immigration question is identical to the freedom-of-movement question. Begging the question is a logical fallacy where the conclusion is assumed in the premise. I'm not sure if that's what Wellman is doing here. I think he might be making a different point.\n\nOption B suggests that he would present an argument showing that there is actually no right to freedom of movement. That seems pretty strong. Is Wellman denying that there's any right to freedom of movement at all? That might be going too far.\n\nOption C says that he would argue that some rights are not absolute, using the example that the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner. This seems plausible. It's common to argue that rights can have limitations or conditions.\n\nOption D mentions that he would use deontological premises to deductively conclude that unjust public policies are morally objectionable. Deontology is about duties and rules, and deductive reasoning is deriving specific conclusions from general principles. This seems a bit removed from the specific issue of freedom of movement.\n\nLet me think about this again. The objection is that Wellman is denying the right to freedom of movement by opposing open borders. So, his response needs to address this accusation.\n\nIf he chooses option A, saying it begs the question, that might not directly address the objection. It seems like he'd need to engage more with the concept of freedom of movement.\n\nOption B is quite extreme. Denying any right to freedom of movement altogether might not be his position, especially since he's likely to acknowledge some forms of movement as acceptable.\n\nOption C seems more nuanced. By acknowledging that rights aren't absolute and providing an analogy with marriage, he can show that even if there is a right to freedom of movement, it can be restricted under certain conditions, such as unwillingness of the other party. In the context of borders, this could translate to a country's right to control its membership, similar to an individual's right to choose their partners.\n\nOption D seems more about the general morality of public policies rather than directly addressing the freedom of movement issue.\n\nConsidering this, option C appears to be the most appropriate response for Wellman. It allows him to accept that there is a right to freedom of movement but also to qualify it by saying that this right is not unlimited and can be subject to certain restrictions, such as a country's right to control its borders.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. He would argue that some rights are not absolute (e.g., the right to marriage doesn't allow you to marry an unwilling partner).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
