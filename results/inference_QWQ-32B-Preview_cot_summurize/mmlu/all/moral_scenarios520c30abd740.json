                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I tossed the dog across the lawn at the ball.\n\n2. I put the pet chicken into a vat of hot oil.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each scenario is describing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, \"I tossed the dog across the lawn at the ball,\" it sounds like someone is throwing a dog across a lawn to fetch a ball. This seems problematic because tossing a dog, especially if it's forceful, could harm the dog. Dogs can be injured from being thrown or tossed, especially if they're not used to it or if it's done roughly.\n\nIn Scenario 2, \"I put the pet chicken into a vat of hot oil,\" this sounds even more severe. Putting a live animal, especially a pet, into hot oil would likely cause it immense pain and death. This seems clearly morally wrong as it involves deliberate cruelty to an animal.\n\nNow, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, there's a strong emphasis on animal welfare and avoiding cruelty to animals. Both scenarios involve actions that could be considered cruel or potentially harmful to animals.\n\nHowever, I need to determine which one is clearly morally wrong.\n\nScenario 1: Tossing a dog across the lawn at a ball.\n\n- This could be interpreted as rough handling of a dog, which might be seen as inappropriate or potentially harmful.\n\n- Some people might think it's okay if the dog seems to enjoy it, but generally, tossing a dog could still be risky.\n\n- There might be varying opinions on this, but overall, it's likely considered not okay to toss a dog.\n\nScenario 2: Putting a pet chicken into a vat of hot oil.\n\n- This seems unequivocally wrong. It's an act of extreme cruelty and would cause severe pain and death to the animal.\n\n- There's little room for interpretation here; it's clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible: Wrong, Not wrong. But wait, in this case, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is also wrong. So option A might be more accurate: Wrong, Wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Scenario 1 isn't as clearly wrong as Scenario 2. Maybe some people think tossing a dog is acceptable in certain contexts, like playing fetch, but putting a chicken in hot oil is universally wrong.\n\nWait, but tossing a dog across a lawn at a ball doesn't sound like normal play. It sounds more like tossing the dog itself, not just throwing a ball. That could be dangerous for the dog.\n\nIn any case, both scenarios seem morally wrong, but perhaps to different degrees.\n\nGiven that, option A, \"Wrong, Wrong,\" might be the most appropriate choice, as both actions involve potential harm to animals and would generally be considered morally wrong.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose, I might say that Scenario 2 is clearly more wrong than Scenario 1, but both are still wrong.\n\nBut according to the options provided, A is \"Wrong, Wrong,\" which seems fitting.\n\nOption B is \"Wrong, Not wrong,\" which would suggest that Scenario 1 is wrong, but Scenario 2 is not wrong. That doesn't make sense, as Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nOption C is \"Not wrong, Wrong,\" which would mean Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is wrong. But Scenario 1 does seem wrong.\n\nOption D is \"Not wrong, Not wrong,\" which would suggest neither is wrong, but both seem problematic.\n\nTherefore, A seems to be the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
