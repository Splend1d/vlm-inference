So, maybe it's about substituting one body part for another during development.\n\nOption A says it's present in only one form in an individual. Hmm, that sounds more like a recessive trait or something, not specifically about homeotic mutations.\n\nOption B says it substitutes one body part for another in development. That sounds familiar. I think that's what homeotic mutations do. For example, in fruit flies, you can get mutations where legs grow instead of antennae.\n\nOption C says it results in the development of a tumor. That doesn't sound right for homeotic mutations. Tumors are more related to uncontrolled cell growth, which is different from the substitution of body parts.\n\nOption D says it's wild type at one temperature and abnormal at another. That sounds more like temperature-sensitive mutations, maybe in proteins or enzymes, not specifically homeotic.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B: substitutes one body part for another in development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
