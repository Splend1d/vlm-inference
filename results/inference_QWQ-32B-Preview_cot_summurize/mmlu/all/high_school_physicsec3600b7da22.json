                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a cylinder with a movable piston. The gas inside is at a pressure of 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pascal, volume of 20 cm\u00b3, and temperature of 273 Kelvin. Then, the piston is moved downward slowly, allowing heat to escape and keeping the temperature constant. Finally, the volume is reduced to 5 cm\u00b3, and I need to find the resulting pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. There's a gas in a cylinder with a piston that can move. They're moving the piston downward, which decreases the volume. Normally, if you decrease the volume of a gas while keeping the temperature constant, the pressure should increase, right? That makes sense because the molecules are crowded into a smaller space, so they hit the walls more frequently.\n\nNow, they mention that heat is allowed to escape to keep the temperature constant. So, it's a isothermal process, meaning the temperature stays the same throughout. In thermodynamics, when you have a process at constant temperature, it's called isothermal.\n\nSo, for an ideal gas, we have the ideal gas law: PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nSince the temperature is constant, and assuming the amount of gas (n) doesn't change, then PV should be constant. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nActually, for an isothermal process in an ideal gas, PV = constant. So, P1V1 = P2V2.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the initial pressure and volume to find the final pressure when the volume is reduced to 5 cm\u00b3.\n\nBut first, I need to make sure that units are consistent. The initial volume is 20 cm\u00b3, and the final volume is 5 cm\u00b3. But the pressure is given in Pascal, which is N/m\u00b2. So, I need to convert the volumes from cm\u00b3 to m\u00b3.\n\n1 cm\u00b3 = 1 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3.\n\nSo, initial volume V1 = 20 cm\u00b3 = 20 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3 = 2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3.\n\nFinal volume V2 = 5 cm\u00b3 = 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3.\n\nInitial pressure P1 = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nSo, using P1V1 = P2V2,\n\n(1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa)(2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3) = P2 (5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3).\n\nNow, solving for P2:\n\nP2 = (1 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10^-5) / (5 \u00d7 10^-6) Pa.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\nNumerator: 1 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10^-5 = 2 \u00d7 10^0 = 2 Pa\u00b7m\u00b3.\n\nDenominator: 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3.\n\nSo, P2 = 2 / (5 \u00d7 10^-6) Pa = 2 \u00d7 (1 / 5) \u00d7 10^6 Pa = 0.4 \u00d7 10^6 Pa = 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nNumerator: 1 \u00d7 10^5 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 10^-5 = 2 \u00d7 10^0 = 2.\n\nDenominator: 5 \u00d7 10^-6.\n\nSo, 2 / (5 \u00d7 10^-6) = 2 / 5 \u00d7 10^6 = 0.4 \u00d7 10^6 = 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the resulting pressure is 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.25 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nB. 2 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nC. 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nD. 8 \u00d7 10^5 Pa\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other factor I might have missed. They mentioned that heat is allowed to escape to maintain constant temperature. That sounds like an isothermal process, so PV should indeed be constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the units more carefully. I converted cm\u00b3 to m\u00b3 by multiplying by 10^-6, which is correct since 1 m\u00b3 = 10^6 cm\u00b3.\n\nSo, initial volume: 20 cm\u00b3 = 20 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3 = 2 \u00d7 10^-5 m\u00b3.\n\nFinal volume: 5 cm\u00b3 = 5 \u00d7 10^-6 m\u00b3.\n\nPressure is already in Pascal, which is consistent.\n\nSo, P1V1 = P2V2:\n\n(1 \u00d7 10^5)(2 \u00d7 10^-5) = P2 (5 \u00d7 10^-6)\n\n2 \u00d7 10^0 = P2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-6\n\n2 = P2 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 10^-6\n\nP2 = 2 / (5 \u00d7 10^-6) = 0.4 \u00d7 10^6 = 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the ratio of volumes.\n\nSince PV = constant, P2 / P1 = V1 / V2.\n\nSo, P2 = P1 \u00d7 (V1 / V2)\n\nP2 = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa \u00d7 (20 cm\u00b3 / 5 cm\u00b3) = 1 \u00d7 10^5 Pa \u00d7 4 = 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa.\n\nSame answer.\n\nSo, I think C. 4 \u00d7 10^5 Pa is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
