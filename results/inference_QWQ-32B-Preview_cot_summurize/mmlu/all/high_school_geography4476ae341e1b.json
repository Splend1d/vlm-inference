Washington\n\nC. 3 degrees south\n\nD. 479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what an absolute location is. I remember that in geography, there are two main ways to describe a location: relative and absolute. Relative location is about describing where something is in relation to something else, like \"next to the park\" or \"10 miles east of Pittsburgh.\" Absolute location, on the other hand, is a precise, fixed position that doesn't change, no matter what else is around it.\n\nUsually, absolute locations are expressed using coordinates, like latitude and longitude, which pinpoint exactly where something is on the Earth's surface. So, for example, if someone says \"3 degrees south,\" that sounds like a latitude coordinate, which would be an absolute location.\n\nBut let's look at each option more closely.\n\nOption A: \"10 miles east of Pittsburgh.\" This sounds like a relative location because it's describing the position based on its distance and direction from Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is a reference point, and the location is defined in relation to it.\n\nOption B: \"Washington.\" This is just a name of a place, but without more context, it's not clear if it's Washington state or Washington D.C., or even another place called Washington. But in general, naming a place doesn't specify its exact location; you need more information to pinpoint it absolutely.\n\nOption C: \"3 degrees south.\" This seems promising because it mentions a specific degree of latitude. Latitude lines run east to west and measure the distance north or south of the Equator. So, \"3 degrees south\" would be a specific parallel around the Earth, 3 degrees below the Equator. This is part of an absolute location because it gives a precise north-south coordinate.\n\nOption D: \"479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana.\" This is a typical street address. It includes a specific building number on a particular street in a city and state. This is also an absolute location because it specifies exactly where something is, although it's expressed in a local addressing system rather than geographic coordinates.\n\nNow, between options C and D, both seem like absolute locations, but perhaps the question is expecting the one that uses geographic coordinates. Option C gives a latitude, but it's only half of the coordinate pair; you'd usually need both latitude and longitude to pinpoint an exact spot. However, among the given options, it's the one that most directly provides a geographic coordinate.\n\nOption D, the street address, is also an absolute location, but it's expressed in a different system. Depending on the context, maybe the question is looking for geographic coordinates, in which case option C would be the best answer.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider that \"3 degrees south\" could be part of a coordinate pair, and perhaps the question expects the answer that is most clearly an absolute location using geographic coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the difference between geographic coordinates and addresses. In that case, option D would be the absolute location because it's a specific address, whereas option C is only a latitude without longitude, which doesn't specify an exact point.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should look back at the question to see if there's any additional context that I'm missing.\n\nThe question is: \"Which of the following items below is an absolute location?\" and then it lists the four options. There doesn't seem to be any additional context.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider which of these options provides the most precise and unambiguous location.\n\nOption A is relative, based on distance from Pittsburgh.\n\nOption B is just a name, which isn't specific enough.\n\nOption C is a latitude, which is part of an absolute location but not complete on its own.\n\nOption D is a full street address, which is a specific, fixed location.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most appropriate answer because it's an absolute location expressed as a precise address.\n\nBut, to be thorough, maybe I should consider if \"3 degrees south\" could be considered an absolute location on its own.\n\nIn geography, latitude alone isn't enough to pinpoint a location because you need both latitude and longitude. For example, all points along the line of 3 degrees south latitude share the same latitude but have different longitudes, so they are spread out around the Earth.\n\nTherefore, \"3 degrees south\" alone doesn't specify an exact location; it's a line around the Earth. So, in that sense, it's not an absolute location by itself.\n\nIn contrast, a street address like \"479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana\" is a specific, unique location that can be pinpointed on a map.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D: \"479 Elm Street, Muncie, Indiana.\"\n\nJust to make sure, let's quickly review why the other options aren't absolute locations.\n\nOption A: \"10 miles east of Pittsburgh\" is relative because it depends on the reference point of Pittsburgh.\n\nOption B: \"Washington\" is too vague because there are multiple places with that name.\n\nOption C: \"3 degrees south\" is only half of a coordinate pair needed to specify an exact location.\n\nThus, option D is the only one that provides a precise, absolute location.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
