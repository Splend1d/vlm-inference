                    "text": "The correct answer is D. because the Moon's rotational and orbital periods are equal.\n\nLet me explain this in more detail. The Moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit around the Earth, and interestingly, it also takes about the same amount of time to rotate once on its axis. This synchronization means that the Moon always presents the same face towards the Earth. This phenomenon is known as tidal locking.\n\nTo understand why this happens, we need to consider the gravitational interaction between the Earth and the Moon. The Earth's gravity exerts a torque on the Moon, which over time has slowed down the Moon's rotation until its rotational period matched its orbital period. This process is called tidal locking.\n\nOption A, \"because the Moon has a nearly circular orbit around the Earth,\" is not the correct reason. While it's true that the Moon's orbit is nearly circular, the shape of the orbit isn't directly related to why we always see the same face of the Moon.\n\nOption B, \"because the Moon does not rotate,\" is incorrect. The Moon does rotate; it just rotates at a speed that matches its orbital period around the Earth.\n\nOption C, \"because the other face points toward us only at new moon when we can't see the Moon,\" is also incorrect. During a new moon, the side of the Moon that is facing the Earth is not illuminated by the Sun, so we don't see the Moon. However, it's not that the other face points towards us only at new moon; rather, due to tidal locking, the same face is always facing Earth, regardless of the phase.\n\nSo, to summarize, the reason we always see the same face of the Moon is because its rotational period is equal to its orbital period, a result of tidal locking due to the Earth's gravitational influence.\n\n"
