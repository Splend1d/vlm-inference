                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about consequentialist theories. It's asking which theory explains right action in terms of the net balance of pleasure or lack of pain produced by that action. The options are hedonistic utilitarianism, perfectionist consequentialism, rule consequentialism, and then a statement saying that consequentialist theories don't mention pain at all.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what consequentialist theories are. Consequentialism is an ethical theory that argues the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined solely by its consequences. So, the end justifies the means, in a way.\n\nNow, hedonistic utilitarianism is a type of consequentialism that focuses on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. Utilitarianism, as I remember, was proposed by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. They believed that the best action is the one that maximizes utility, which they often defined in terms of pleasure and absence of pain. So, this seems like a strong candidate for the answer.\n\nPerfectionist consequentialism, on the other hand, is a type of consequentialism that emphasizes the perfection or flourishing of individuals or society. It's not solely focused on pleasure and pain but on achieving a state of perfection or the greatest good in a broader sense. So, while it's still consequentialist, it's not specifically about pleasure and pain.\n\nRule consequentialism is another variant that evaluates rules based on their consequences rather than individual actions. It's about following rules that, when generally obeyed, lead to better overall outcomes. Again, it's not specifically focused on pleasure and pain.\n\nThe last option says that consequentialist theories don't mention pain at all, which I know is not true because utilitarianism, at least, does consider pain as something to be minimized.\n\nSo, going back to hedonistic utilitarianism, it seems to fit the description in the question. It's a consequentialist theory that judges actions based on the net balance of pleasure over pain they produce.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that none of the other options fit better. Perfectionist consequentialism is more about overall flourishing, not just pleasure and pain. Rule consequentialism looks at the rules' consequences, not directly at the pleasure or pain from individual actions. And the last option is clearly incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. hedonistic utilitarianism.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
