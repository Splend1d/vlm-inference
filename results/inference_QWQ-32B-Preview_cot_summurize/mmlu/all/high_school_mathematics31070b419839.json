                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have the mean of 7 numbers being 15, and when an 8th number is added, the mean decreases to 12. We need to find out what that 8th number is.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a mean is. The mean is the average of a set of numbers, which is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by how many numbers there are.\n\nSo, for the first part, the mean of 7 numbers is 15. That means:\n\n(mean) = (sum of the numbers) / (how many numbers)\n\nSo, 15 = (sum of 7 numbers) / 7\n\nTo find the sum of these 7 numbers, I can rearrange this equation:\n\nSum of 7 numbers = 15 * 7\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n15 * 7 = 105\n\nSo, the sum of the original 7 numbers is 105.\n\nNow, when an 8th number is added, the mean decreases to 12. Let's call this 8th number \"x.\"\n\nSo now, we have 8 numbers in total, and their mean is 12.\n\nUsing the same formula:\n\nMean = (sum of the numbers) / (how many numbers)\n\nSo, 12 = (sum of original 7 numbers + x) / 8\n\nWe already know the sum of the original 7 numbers is 105, so:\n\n12 = (105 + x) / 8\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.\n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 8 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n12 * 8 = 105 + x\n\nCalculate 12 * 8:\n\n12 * 8 = 96\n\nSo, 96 = 105 + x\n\nNow, subtract 105 from both sides to solve for x:\n\n96 - 105 = x\n\nCalculate that:\n\n96 - 105 = -9\n\nSo, x = -9\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\n12 = (105 + x) / 8\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n96 = 105 + x\n\nSubtract 105 from both sides:\n\nx = 96 - 105\n\nx = -9\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me verify if this makes sense.\n\nIf the mean of 7 numbers is 15, and we add an 8th number that's -9, the new mean should be 12.\n\nLet me calculate the sum again.\n\nOriginal sum: 105\n\nAdd x = -9:\n\n105 + (-9) = 96\n\nNow, mean with 8 numbers: 96 / 8 = 12\n\nYes, that matches the given information.\n\nSo, the 8th number is -9.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \u201312\nB. \u20139\nC. 0\nD. 8\n\nThe correct answer is B. \u20139\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
