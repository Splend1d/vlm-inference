                    "text": "To determine which event most likely increases real GDP, we need to understand the components of GDP and how changes in economic variables affect them. Real GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in an economy, adjusted for inflation. It's typically measured using the expenditure approach, which sums up consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. An increase in the real rate of interest**\n\nThe real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation. An increase in the real interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, which can discourage investment and consumer spending. Higher interest rates can lead to decreased investment in physical capital and reduced consumption, particularly for big-ticket items like houses and cars that often require loans. Therefore, an increase in the real rate of interest is likely to decrease real GDP.\n\n**B. An increase in taxes**\n\nAn increase in taxes reduces disposable income for households and businesses. With less disposable income, households may spend less on consumption, and businesses may have less funds available for investment. Both of these reductions can lead to a decrease in real GDP.\n\n**C. A decrease in net exports**\n\nNet exports are calculated as exports minus imports. A decrease in net exports could be due to either a decrease in exports or an increase in imports. A decrease in exports means that fewer goods and services are being sold to foreign buyers, which reduces domestic production. An increase in imports means that more goods and services are being purchased from abroad, which also reduces domestic production as consumers and businesses buy foreign goods instead of domestic ones. Therefore, a decrease in net exports is likely to decrease real GDP.\n\n**D. An increase in government spending**\n\nGovernment spending is a direct component of GDP. An increase in government spending, such as on infrastructure, education, or healthcare, directly increases the total demand for goods and services in the economy. This can stimulate economic activity, leading to increased production and, consequently, an increase in real GDP.\n\nConsidering all these points, the event that most likely increases real GDP is an increase in government spending.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
