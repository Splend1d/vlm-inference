                    "text": "The Yiddish word \"meshuga\" means \"crazy.\" So, the correct answer is A. crazy.\n\nYiddish is a language that combines elements of German, Hebrew, and Slavic languages, and it was historically spoken by Ashkenazi Jews in Central and Eastern Europe. The term \"meshuga\" comes from the Hebrew word \"meshuga,\" which indeed means \"crazy\" or \"insane.\" In Yiddish, it's often used colloquially to describe someone who is acting in an irrational or eccentric manner.\n\nHere's a bit more context:\n\n- **A. Crazy**: This is the correct translation. For example, you might hear someone say, \"Er iz a meshuga,\" meaning \"He is crazy.\"\n\n- **B. Sacred**: This is not correct. The word for \"sacred\" in Yiddish is something different, like \"heilige\" or \"kadosh.\"\n\n- **C. Stingy**: This is also incorrect. The Yiddish word for \"stingy\" is \"krentshaft\" or \"krentsh,\" which is quite different from \"meshuga.\"\n\n- **D. Sweet**: Again, not accurate. \"Sweet\" in Yiddish is \"zweet\" or \"suess.\"\n\nSo, remember, \"meshuga\" is all about being crazy or eccentric!"
