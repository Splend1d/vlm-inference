                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about DNA: \"In a double-stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines : pyrimidines is:\n\nA. variable.\n\nB. determined by the base sequence in RNA.\n\nC. genetically determined.\n\nD. always 1:1.\"\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is in double-stranded DNA. First, I should remember what purines and pyrimidines are. Purines are bases with a double-ring structure, and in DNA, they are adenine (A) and guanine (G). Pyrimidines have a single-ring structure and in DNA, they are cytosine (C) and thymine (T).\n\nIn DNA, base pairing is specific: adenine pairs with thymine, and guanine pairs with cytosine. So, in a double-stranded DNA molecule, each A is paired with a T, and each G is paired with a C.\n\nNow, let's think about the ratios. If I have a certain number of A's, I must have an equal number of T's, and similarly, the number of G's must equal the number of C's.\n\nSo, the total number of purines (A + G) should equal the total number of pyrimidines (T + C), because A = T and G = C.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines should always be 1:1 in double-stranded DNA.\n\nWait a minute, is that always true? Let me double-check.\n\nIf I have a sequence where A = 10, G = 20, then T must be 10, and C must be 20. So, purines are A + G = 10 + 20 = 30, and pyrimidines are T + C = 10 + 20 = 30. So, the ratio is 30:30, which is 1:1.\n\nSimilarly, if A = 5, G = 15, then T = 5, C = 15, purines = 20, pyrimidines = 20, ratio 1:1.\n\nIt seems consistent.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any exceptions. For example, in single-stranded DNA, maybe the ratio could vary, but the question is about double-stranded DNA.\n\nAlso, the question mentions \"double-stranded molecule of DNA,\" so I can assume it's referring to double-stranded DNA.\n\nOption A says \"variable.\" But based on my reasoning, it seems fixed at 1:1.\n\nOption B says \"determined by the base sequence in RNA.\" Wait, what? RNA is transcribed from DNA, but in double-stranded DNA, the purine/pyrimidine ratio should be independent of the RNA sequence, right? Unless there's some specific relationship I'm missing, but I don't think so.\n\nOption C says \"genetically determined.\" Hmm, well, the base sequence is genetically determined, but the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in double-stranded DNA is always 1:1, as far as I can tell, regardless of the specific sequence.\n\nOption D says \"always 1:1,\" which aligns with my understanding.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D. Always 1:1.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider unusual base pairings or modified bases. For example, in some cases, there might be mismatches or modified bases, but in standard double-stranded DNA, base pairing is specific: A-T and G-C.\n\nTherefore, unless there are mutations or damaged areas, the ratio should remain 1:1.\n\nI think it's safe to go with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
