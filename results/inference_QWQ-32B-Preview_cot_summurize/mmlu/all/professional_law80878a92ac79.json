                    "text": "Let's see. I've got this scenario here about mortgages and foreclosures, and I need to figure out how much the friend should get from the sale of the property. Okay, so let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a homeowner who gave a mortgage to his friend for a $100,000 loan. Then, he gave another mortgage to an investor for $80,000. After that, the friend recorded his mortgage. Then, the homeowner gave a mortgage to a bank for $50,000, and later the investor and the bank recorded their mortgages.\n\nNow, the homeowner couldn't pay back the mortgages, so there's a foreclosure proceeding involving the friend, the investor, and the bank. The property sold for $160,000, and I need to determine how much of that goes to the friend.\n\nThe recording statute in this jurisdiction says that unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\n\nAlright, so recording is important here because it affects the priority of the mortgages.\n\nLet me recall that in jurisdictions with a race-notice recording statute (which this seems to be, since it mentions subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice), the first to record their mortgage generally has priority, provided they are without notice of prior unrecorded instruments.\n\nBut in this case, the friend recorded first, then the investor, and then the bank. So, according to recording statutes, the friend should have first priority since he recorded first, followed by the investor, and then the bank.\n\nHowever, I need to make sure that none of the parties had notice of prior unrecorded mortgages.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- The friend recorded first, so he shouldn't have any notice of prior mortgages.\n\n- The investor recorded after the friend, so if the investor had notice of the friend's mortgage, his recording might not give him priority.\n\n- The bank recorded after the investor, so similarly, if the bank had notice of previous mortgages, it could affect priority.\n\nBut in race-notice statutes, if a subsequent purchaser records without notice of prior unrecorded interests, they get priority over those prior unrecorded interests.\n\nIn this scenario, it seems that the friend recorded first, so anyone recording after should have notice of his mortgage.\n\nWait, but the friend recorded his mortgage after the homeowner gave the mortgage to the investor, but before the investor recorded.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to think about the order more carefully.\n\n1. Homeowner gives friend a mortgage for $100,000.\n\n2. Homeowner gives investor a mortgage for $80,000.\n\n3. Friend records his mortgage.\n\n4. Homeowner gives bank a mortgage for $50,000.\n\n5. Investor records his mortgage.\n\n6. Bank records his mortgage.\n\nNow, in a race-notice jurisdiction, the priority is determined by the recording date, provided the party recording didn't have notice of prior unrecorded interests.\n\nSince the friend recorded first, he should have first priority, assuming he had no notice of the investor's mortgage when he recorded.\n\nBut the friend recorded after the investor's mortgage was given, but before the investor recorded.\n\nWait, the investor gave the mortgage to the homeowner for $80,000 after the friend's mortgage, but the friend recorded before the investor recorded.\n\nSo, when the friend recorded, was he aware of the investor's mortgage?\n\nIf the friend recorded first, and the investor recorded later, then the investor would have notice of the friend's recorded mortgage.\n\nBut in this case, the friend recorded before the investor recorded, so the investor should have notice of the friend's mortgage when he records his own.\n\nBut the question is about the friend's priority.\n\nGiven that the friend recorded first, he should have first priority, and the investor and bank would have subsequent priorities.\n\nTherefore, in the foreclosure proceeding, the friend should be paid first from the sale proceeds.\n\nThe property sold for $160,000, and there are three mortgages: friend ($100,000), investor ($80,000), and bank ($50,000).\n\nBut the sale proceeds are $160,000.\n\nSo, the friend has first priority for $100,000.\n\nThen, the investor has second priority for $80,000.\n\nFinally, the bank has third priority for $50,000.\n\nBut the sale proceeds are $160,000.\n\nSo, first, the friend gets $100,000.\n\nThat leaves $60,000 ($160,000 - $100,000).\n\nThen, the investor gets $60,000, since that's all that's left, even though he's entitled to $80,000.\n\nTherefore, the investor gets $60,000, and the bank gets nothing because there's no money left after the friend and investor are paid.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for how much the friend should get, which is $100,000.\n\nBut look at the options:\n\nA. $0.00\n\nB. $30,000.00\n\nC. $80,000.00\n\nD. $100,000.00\n\nSo, according to my reasoning, the answer should be D. $100,000.00.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any reason why the friend wouldn't get his full $100,000?\n\nIn foreclosure proceedings, senior mortgages get paid first, up to the amount of their lien, and any remaining proceeds are distributed to junior mortgages, in order of priority, subject to the availability of funds.\n\nIn this case, the friend is first in priority, so he gets his full $100,000.\n\nThen, the investor, who is second in priority, gets the remaining $60,000.\n\nThe bank, being third in priority, gets nothing because there's no money left.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. $100,000.00.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider if there's any issue with the recording statute.\n\nThe statute says that unless recorded, all written instruments affecting title to land are void as to subsequent purchasers who paid value and without notice.\n\nIn this case, the friend recorded first, so he's protected against any subsequent purchasers who didn't have notice of his mortgage.\n\nThe investor recorded after the friend, so the investor had notice of the friend's mortgage.\n\nSimilarly, the bank recorded after both, so they had notice of both prior mortgages.\n\nTherefore, the friend's mortgage has first priority, and he should be paid first.\n\nThus, the answer is D. $100,000.00.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. $100,000.00"
