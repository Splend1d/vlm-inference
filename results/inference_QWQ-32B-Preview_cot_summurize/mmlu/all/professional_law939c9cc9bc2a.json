                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these options isn't a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant. So, I need to recall the general rules about warrantless arrests.\n\nFirst off, I know that arrests can be made without a warrant in certain situations, especially when there's an immediate need to apprehend someone to prevent further crime or harm. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it.\" Hmm, I think in some jurisdictions, officers can make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors, but there are usually conditions attached. Maybe it depends on whether the misdemeanor was committed in the officer's presence or not. I need to remember if that's a universal rule.\n\nOption B states: \"An officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it.\" This sounds familiar. I believe that for felonies, officers can make warrantless arrests if they have probable cause to believe that the person committed the crime, even if it wasn't necessarily in their presence. So, this seems like a valid circumstance.\n\nOption C says: \"An officer may arrest for a felony committed in his presence.\" That also makes sense. If an officer witnesses a felony being committed, they can arrest the perpetrator without a warrant. That's pretty straightforward.\n\nOption D is: \"An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is a breach of peace and committed in arresting party's presence.\" This seems similar to option A, but with the added condition that the misdemeanor is a breach of peace and occurs in the officer's presence. I think this is also a valid circumstance for a warrantless arrest.\n\nNow, comparing these options, I need to see which one doesn't fit. Option B talks about probable cause for a felony, option C is about felonies in the officer's presence, and option D is about misdemeanors that are breaches of peace in the officer's presence.\n\nOption A is a bit different because it doesn't specify that the misdemeanor has to be committed in the officer's presence. It just says that a misdemeanor has occurred, and the officer believes the person committed it. I think this might be the key difference.\n\nI recall that for misdemeanors, warrantless arrests are generally allowed only if the offense is committed in the officer's presence. If the misdemeanor isn't committed in the officer's presence, they might need a warrant to make the arrest. So, if option A doesn't require that the misdemeanor be committed in the officer's presence, that might be the circumstance that isn't allowed for a warrantless arrest.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A says, \"A misdemeanor has occurred, and an officer must believe that the person he has arrested committed it.\" It doesn't mention anything about the misdemeanor being committed in the officer's presence. So, if an officer has reason to believe someone committed a misdemeanor not in their presence, they might not be able to make a warrantless arrest.\n\nIn contrast, option B allows for warrantless arrests for felonies based on probable cause, even if not in the officer's presence. Option C is specific to felonies in the officer's presence, and option D is for certain misdemeanors in the officer's presence.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the one that isn't a valid circumstance for a warrantless arrest because it doesn't require that the misdemeanor be committed in the officer's presence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
