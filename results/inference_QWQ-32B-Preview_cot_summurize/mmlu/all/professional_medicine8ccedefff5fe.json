She says her heart is \"racing\" and she is coughing up a small amount of bloodstreaked sputum. Medical history is significant for hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. An intravenous catheter is placed. Vital signs are temperature 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse 132/min, respirations 32/min, and blood pressure 135/78 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via nasal cannula shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination discloses an irregularly irregular rhythm, an indistinct point of maximal impulse, and a loud S1. A grade 3/6, low-pitched, diastolic, rumbling murmur is audible at the apex; a distinct snapping sound precedes the murmur. Fetal heart rate is 144/min.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out what's going on with this patient. She's 31, pregnant for the third time, and currently at 32 weeks gestation. She's been admitted because she's been having trouble breathing and wheezing for a week, and now her heart is racing, and she's coughing up a bit of blood-tinged sputum. She has a history of hypothyroidism and takes levothyroxine for that.\n\nFirst, let's look at her vital signs. Temperature is normal at 36.9\u00b0C, but her pulse is pretty fast at 132 beats per minute, and her respirations are also elevated at 32 per minute. Her blood pressure is 135/78 mm Hg, which is a bit on the higher side, especially with her pulse being so high. On pulse oximetry with 100% oxygen via nasal cannula, her oxygen saturation is 92%, which isn't great\u2014normally, we'd expect it to be closer to 95% or higher.\n\nWhen the doctor listens to her lungs, there are decreased breath sounds at the bases, and some expiratory crackles bilaterally. That could suggest fluid in the lungs, maybe pulmonary edema. The cardiac exam reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm, which might indicate atrial fibrillation, and an indistinct point of maximal impulse, which could mean the heart is enlarged. There's a loud S1 heart sound, and a grade 3/6 low-pitched diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex, with a distinct snapping sound before the murmur.\n\nAlso, the fetal heart rate is 144 beats per minute, which seems normal.\n\nSo, considering all this, I need to think about what could be causing her symptoms and the heart findings.\n\nGiven that she's pregnant, and pregnancy can put extra strain on the heart, especially if there are pre-existing heart conditions. Her history of hypothyroidism is also important, as thyroid issues can affect heart function.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Chronic mitral regurgitation secondary to rheumatic heart disease.\n\nB. Coarctation of the aorta.\n\nC. Congenital aortic stenosis.\n\nD. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation.\n\nLet's consider each one.\n\nOption A: Chronic mitral regurgitation due to rheumatic heart disease. Mitral regurgitation would cause blood to leak back into the left atrium from the left ventricle during systole. This could lead to volume overload in the left atrium and possibly pulmonary congestion, which could explain the dyspnea and pulmonary crackles. However, the murmur described is a diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex, which is more typical of mitral stenosis, not mitral regurgitation. So this doesn't quite fit.\n\nOption B: Coarctation of the aorta. This is a narrowing of the aorta, usually in the thoracic region. It can cause hypertension in the upper body and reduced blood flow to the lower body. Symptoms might include hypertension, headache, leg claudication, and diminished pulses in the lower extremities. It doesn't typically present with dyspnea and pulmonary crackles, so this seems less likely.\n\nOption C: Congenital aortic stenosis. This is a narrowing of the aortic valve present from birth. It can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and eventually heart failure if severe. Symptoms might include chest pain, syncope, and dyspnea on exertion. The murmur of aortic stenosis is typically a harsh systolic murmur, not a diastolic rumbling one, so this doesn't match the description.\n\nOption D: Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation. Mitral stenosis is narrowing of the mitral valve, which obstructs blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. This can lead to increased pressure in the left atrium, pulmonary congestion, and edema. The classic murmur is a diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex, which matches the description here. The snapping sound before the murmur could be the opening snap of the mitral valve, which is often heard in mitral stenosis.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a common complication of mitral stenosis, especially in women and in pregnancy, as hormonal changes and increased blood volume can predispose to arrhythmias.\n\nGiven that she has an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation, and the presence of a diastolic murmur and opening snap, mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation seems the most likely diagnosis.\n\nMoreover, her symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, coughing up blood-tinged sputum, and the pulmonary findings like decreased breath sounds and expiratory crackles are consistent with pulmonary edema, which can occur in mitral stenosis, especially if there's atrial fibrillation leading to rapid heart rates and decreased cardiac output.\n\nAlso, her tachycardia (heart rate of 132 bpm) and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 32 bpm) are compensatory mechanisms in response to reduced oxygenation and possible heart failure.\n\nTherefore, among the options provided, D. Mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation, is the most likely cause of her findings.\n\nIt's also worth noting that pregnancy can exacerbate existing heart conditions, and mitral stenosis is known to be a condition that can pose significant risks during pregnancy if not managed properly.\n\nI think this is the best answer based on the symptoms and physical examination findings provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
