                    "text": "Let's see which statement is not true. I need to think about each option carefully.\n\nOption A says that the Earth and Venus are in a 1:1 orbital resonance, meaning for every one orbit Earth makes around the Sun, Venus makes one orbit as well. Hmm, I know that orbital resonance is when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of small integers.\n\nBut I think Earth and Venus have different orbital periods. Earth takes about 365 days to orbit the Sun, while Venus takes about 225 days. So, their orbital periods aren't the same. Let me check the actual resonance between them.\n\nI recall that Earth and Venus have a 13:8 resonance, meaning Earth orbits the Sun 13 times while Venus orbits it 8 times, and this creates a beautiful pattern when viewed from above the solar system. So, a 1:1 resonance doesn't seem right for Earth and Venus.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misremembering. Let me think again. If Earth takes 365 days and Venus takes 225 days, then the ratio of their orbital periods is 365/225, which simplifies to about 1.61, or roughly 5/3. But 5/3 is not exactly the resonance I thought of. Maybe I need to look it up, but since I can't right now, I'll keep thinking.\n\nI think the 13:8 resonance might be related to their conjunctions or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe option A is not true, but I need to consider the other options as well.\n\nOption B states that Neptune and Pluto are in a 3:2 orbital resonance, meaning for every 3 orbits Neptune makes, Pluto makes 2 orbits. I know this is a well-documented fact. Pluto's orbit is in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune's, which means for every 3 times Neptune orbits the Sun, Pluto orbits twice. This resonance is what keeps their orbits stable and prevents them from colliding. So, this seems to be true.\n\nOption C says that the Kirkwood Gaps in the asteroid belt are due to resonances with Jupiter. I know that the asteroid belt has gaps at certain distances from the Sun, known as Kirkwood gaps, which are caused by orbital resonances with Jupiter. For example, the 3:1 resonance at 2.5 AU, where asteroids orbit the Sun three times for every one Jupiter orbit, leading to gravitational perturbations that clear out those regions. So, this seems correct as well.\n\nOption D states that Neptune and Pluto won't collide because of their orbital resonance. Given that their 3:2 resonance ensures that they never reach the points of closest approach at the same time, their orbits are synchronized in a way that prevents collisions. So, this also seems to be true.\n\nGiven that, option A seems to be the one that's not true, since Earth and Venus are not in a 1:1 orbital resonance. They have different orbital periods and a different resonance relationship.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident about the Earth-Venus resonance. Maybe I should double-check.\n\nI recall that the time between successive closest approaches, or conjunctions, of Venus and Earth is about 584 days, and that over a period of eight years, Earth and Venus have a sort of resonance where they align a certain number of times.\n\nBut specifically, a 1:1 resonance would imply that their orbital periods are the same, which they're not. Earth takes about 365 days, and Venus takes about 225 days, so their periods are different.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is not true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
