The options are fan pages, street activities, grassroots marketing, and viral campaigns. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nFan pages: These are usually social media pages created by fans of a brand, product, or personality. They're places where fans can share their thoughts, experiences, and opinions. So, it's more about fan engagement rather than spreading messages about product issues.\n\nStreet activities: This sounds like physical, real-world marketing tactics, maybe like flash mobs, sticker campaigns, or handing out free samples on the street. It's more about in-person interaction and visibility rather than online peer-to-peer communication.\n\nGrassroots marketing: This is a marketing strategy that aims to create a buzz for a product or service by generating enthusiasm among a target audience. It often involves local communities and can be both online and offline. However, it's more about building a ground-level movement rather than specifically focusing on peer-to-peer communication about product issues.\n\nViral campaigns: These are marketing strategies designed to spread quickly and widely online, often through social media sharing, emails, or other digital channels. The goal is to have the message propagate exponentially as more people share it with their networks.\n\nGiven that the question is about spreading a message about a product issue or service through online peer-to-peer communication, viral campaigns seem to fit best. Viral campaigns rely on people sharing the message with their peers online, which aligns with the description.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any overlap with grassroots marketing? Grassroots marketing can involve online peer-to-peer communication, but it's broader and can include offline activities as well. Viral campaigns are more specifically focused on online sharing and going viral.\n\nAlso, fan pages are more about fan communities and may not necessarily be used to spread messages about product issues, unless the brand encourages it, but even then, it's not the primary function.\n\nStreet activities are primarily offline, so they don't fit the \"online peer-to-peer communication\" part of the question.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is D. Viral campaigns.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
