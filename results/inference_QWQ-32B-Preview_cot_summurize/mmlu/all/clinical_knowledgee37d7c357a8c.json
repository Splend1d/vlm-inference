                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about calculating the amount of dopamine a 65 kg person would receive in an hour, given that the prescription rate is 4 micrograms per kilogram per minute. The options are 156 mg, 15.6 mg, 1.56 mg, and 15,600 mg. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the units and what's being asked. The rate is 4 micrograms per kilogram per minute, and the person weighs 65 kg. I need to find out how many milligrams they'll receive in an hour.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the dose per minute.\n\nThe rate is 4 micrograms per kilogram per minute. So for a 65 kg person, the dose per minute would be:\n\n4 \u03bcg/kg/min * 65 kg = 260 \u03bcg/min\n\nStep 2: Calculate the dose per hour.\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, I need to multiply the dose per minute by 60 to get the hourly dose.\n\n260 \u03bcg/min * 60 min/hour = 15,600 \u03bcg/hour\n\nStep 3: Convert micrograms to milligrams.\n\nThere are 1,000 micrograms in a milligram. So, to convert 15,600 \u03bcg to mg:\n\n15,600 \u03bcg / 1,000 = 15.6 mg\n\nSo, the person would receive 15.6 mg of dopamine in an hour.\n\nLooking back at the options, option B is 15.6 mg, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, the dose per minute: 4 \u03bcg/kg/min * 65 kg = 260 \u03bcg/min. That seems correct.\n\nThen, dose per hour: 260 \u03bcg/min * 60 min/hour = 15,600 \u03bcg/hour. That also seems right.\n\nFinally, converting to milligrams: 15,600 \u03bcg / 1,000 = 15.6 mg. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the units to ensure I'm converting properly.\n\nStarting with \u03bcg/kg/min, multiplying by kg gives \u03bcg/min.\n\nThen, multiplying by minutes in an hour gives \u03bcg/hour.\n\nFinally, converting \u03bcg to mg by dividing by 1,000.\n\nAll right, I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{15.6\\ \\text{mg}}."
