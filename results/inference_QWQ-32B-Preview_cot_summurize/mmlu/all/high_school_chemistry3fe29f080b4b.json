                    "text": "To determine which molecules are best represented by multiple resonance structures, we need to analyze the Lewis structures of each molecule and see if there are multiple valid ways to draw the structure by moving electrons around, while keeping the positions of the atoms the same. This is known as resonance.\n\nLet's look at each molecule one by one:\n\n1. **CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)**\n\n   - Carbon is the central atom bonded to two oxygen atoms.\n   - Each oxygen forms a double bond with carbon.\n   - The Lewis structure is O=C=O.\n   - There are no alternative ways to arrange the double bonds; both oxygens are identical in this structure.\n   - Therefore, CO2 does not have resonance structures.\n\n2. **CO32- (Carbonate Ion)**\n\n   - Carbon is the central atom bonded to three oxygen atoms with a total charge of -2.\n   - One oxygen has a double bond and two have single bonds, with each single-bonded oxygen having an extra lone pair to account for the charge.\n   - However, any one of the three oxygens can have the double bond, leading to three equivalent resonance structures.\n   - Therefore, CO32- has resonance structures.\n\n3. **NO2- (Nitrite Ion)**\n\n   - Nitrogen is the central atom bonded to two oxygen atoms with a total charge of -1.\n   - There are two possible structures: one with a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to the other, and another with the double bond to the other oxygen.\n   - These two structures are resonance forms.\n   - Therefore, NO2- has resonance structures.\n\n4. **NO3- (Nitrate Ion)**\n\n   - Nitrogen is the central atom bonded to three oxygen atoms with a total charge of -1.\n   - Similar to carbonate, one oxygen has a double bond and two have single bonds, but any one of the three oxygens can have the double bond.\n   - This results in three resonance structures.\n   - Therefore, NO3- has resonance structures.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecules that are best represented by multiple resonance structures are CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. CO2 and CO32- \u2192 CO2 does not have resonance structures.\n\nB. NO2- and NO3- \u2192 Correct, but missing CO32-.\n\nC. CO32- and NO3- \u2192 Correct, but missing NO2-.\n\nD. CO32-, NO2- and NO3- \u2192 This includes all molecules that have resonance structures.\n\nHowever, the question is phrased as \"which molecules are best represented by multiple resonance structures?\" and option D includes all three that have resonance structures.\n\nBut wait, NO2- has two resonance structures, while CO32- and NO3- have three each. So, in terms of \"multiple,\" all three have more than one resonance structure.\n\nBut perhaps the question is testing if students know that CO2 does not have resonance structures, while the others do.\n\nGiven the options, D seems to be the most comprehensive, but let's check if there's any misinterpretation.\n\nUpon re-examining, CO2 does not have resonance structures, as its Lewis structure is fixed with double bonds to both oxygens, and there's no other valid way to arrange the electrons while keeping the atoms in the same positions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be the one that includes only the molecules with multiple resonance structures, which are CO32-, NO2-, and NO3-.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
