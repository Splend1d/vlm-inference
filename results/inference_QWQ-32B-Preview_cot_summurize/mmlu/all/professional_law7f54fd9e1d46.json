                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this housing code case. So, there's a city code that limits dwelling units to members of a single family, and the definition of \"family\" is pretty specific. It includes the head of the household, their spouse, their children (as long as those children don't have their own kids living with them), and the parents of the head or their spouse.\n\nIn this scenario, a resident lives with her son and his two children. So, her son is her child, which seems allowed, but her son's children\u2014her grandchildren\u2014are also living there, and apparently, that's against the code because the children of the nominal head's children can't live there if they have their own kids.\n\nWait, no, the code says that married or unmarried children of the head or the head's spouse can live there, provided that such children have no children of their own residing with them. So, if the head's children have their own children living with them, those grandchildren can't be in the household.\n\nSo, in this case, the resident's son has two children living with them, which means that the grandchildren are not allowed under the code. The city issued a violation notice, and when the resident didn't comply, they brought criminal charges.\n\nNow, the resident is challenging the constitutionality of this code provision. We need to figure out how a court is likely to rule on this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what constitutional grounds she might be challenging the code on. One possibility is that it violates due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. Another might be that it's not a valid exercise of the state's police power because it doesn't have a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.\n\nLet's consider the police power angle first. Cities have the power to regulate for the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their citizens. So, if this housing code is intended to limit traffic congestion and noise in the neighborhood, that could be seen as a legitimate goal within the police power.\n\nBut is the restriction on who can live together really related to traffic and noise? Maybe larger families produce more traffic and noise, but is there a direct connection? It seems a bit tenuous. Maybe the city thinks that by limiting the number of people in a household, they can control the number of cars and the amount of noise generated by each household.\n\nHowever, there might be better ways to directly address traffic and noise, like implementing traffic management systems or noise ordinances, rather than restricting who can live together in a household.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the city is trying to prevent overcrowding, which could be a valid concern related to safety and health. But again, the way the code is written seems to target certain family relationships rather than just the number of people in a household.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is overbroad or not narrowly tailored to serve the intended purpose.\n\nNow, considering the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees certain liberties that cannot be deprived without due process of law, including the right to live with one's family members.\n\nThere is a constitutional right to live with one's children and grandchildren, especially in the context of family relationships. The Supreme Court has recognized the right to familial association as a fundamental right.\n\nIf the city is interfering with that right by preventing grandparents from living with their grandchildren, even if they are part of the same family unit, that could be a due process violation.\n\nIn this case, the resident wants to live with her son and his children, which seems like a natural family unit. The code is preventing that by saying that if the head's children have their own children, those grandchildren can't live in the same household.\n\nThis seems like it's interfering with the family structure in an arbitrary way.\n\nMoreover, the code might be seen as discriminating based on family relationships, which could raise equal protection concerns.\n\nBut since the question is about the due process clause, perhaps that's the main issue here.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Constitutional, on the grounds that the housing provision bears a rational relationship to permissible state objectives.\n\nB. Constitutional, under the state police power.\n\nC. Unconstitutional, as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nD. Unconstitutional, as having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the state.\n\nOptions A and B seem similar in that they both argue the code is constitutional, but for different reasons. Option A focuses on the rational relationship test, while Option B refers to the police power.\n\nOption C argues unconstitutionality based on due process, and Option D suggests that the code has no substantial relation to public health, safety, etc.\n\nGiven that the code is likely to be subject to rational basis review, since it's an economic regulation (housing), the court would uphold it if it has a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest.\n\nThe city's interest in limiting traffic congestion and noise could be considered legitimate, but as I thought earlier, the connection between limiting who can live together based on family relationships and reducing traffic and noise might be tenuous.\n\nHowever, courts are generally deferential in rational basis review, so they might find that there is some rational connection, no matter how weak.\n\nOn the other hand, if the code is interfering with fundamental rights, like the right to familial association, then perhaps a higher level of scrutiny should apply.\n\nBut in many cases, economic regulations are subject to rational basis review, even if they affect certain aspects of family life.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not targeting fundamental rights directly, since the resident is still allowed to live with her son, just not with her son's children.\n\nBut the grandchildren are still family members, and preventing them from living with their grandmother might be seen as an undue interference with family relationships.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at the Supreme Court case law, in cases like Moore v. East Cleveland, the Court has struck down housing regulations that unduly restricted the rights of family members to live together.\n\nIn Moore, the city had an ordinance that limited the number of unrelated adults who could live together, and the Court found that it violated the due process rights of the family to live together.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the code is restricting who can live together based on family relationships, which could be seen as interfering with fundamental rights.\n\nTherefore, the court might find that the code is unconstitutional under the due process clause.\n\nOption C seems plausible.\n\nOption D also suggests unconstitutionality, but based on the code having no substantial relation to public health, safety, etc.\n\nThis seems similar to the rational basis test, where the court would determine if the regulation is substantially related to an important government interest.\n\nBut under rational basis review, the court only requires a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest.\n\nSo, perhaps Option D is too strong, as even a minimal relationship might be enough to satisfy rational basis review.\n\nTherefore, Option C might be a better choice, as it specifically addresses the due process concern.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the code is targeting family relationships in a way that affects who can live together suggests a due process issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the court will most likely declare the provision unconstitutional as violative of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
