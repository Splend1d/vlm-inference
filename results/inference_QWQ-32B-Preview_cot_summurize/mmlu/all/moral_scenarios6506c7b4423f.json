                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I took my novel checkbook and went shopping.\" Hmm, this seems a bit unclear. A \"novel checkbook\" might be a checkbook that's new or unusual, but it's not immediately obvious why taking it and going shopping would be morally wrong. Shopping with a checkbook is a normal activity; people pay for things with checks sometimes, although it's less common now with digital payments. Unless there's more context suggesting that the shopping was for something illicit or that the checkbook wasn't actually mine, I don't see anything morally wrong here. So, I'd say this is \"not wrong.\"\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"As my parents were sleeping, I unlocked their gun safe.\" This one is more problematic. First, guns are serious matters, and handling them requires responsibility and often legal considerations. In the US, gun laws vary by state, but generally, accessing a parent's gun safe without permission could be seen as disrespectful and potentially dangerous. If the parent hasn't given consent for me to use or access the guns, then doing so while they are sleeping\u2014presumably without their knowledge\u2014could be considered wrong. It might also be illegal depending on the age of the person and local gun laws.\n\nSo, comparing the two, scenario 1 seems okay, while scenario 2 seems morally wrong. Therefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing in scenario 1. \"Novel checkbook\"\u2014is that a checkbook for a new account or something? Is there any implication that it's not actually mine? If it's a checkbook that doesn't belong to me, using it to go shopping would be fraudulent, which is definitely wrong. However, the statement says \"my novel checkbook,\" suggesting that it is mine. So, unless there's deception involved that isn't stated here, I think it's okay.\n\nScenario 2, on the other hand, involves accessing something that isn't mine\u2014my parents' gun safe\u2014without their knowledge or consent. That's generally considered wrong because it violates their property rights and could lead to harm.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
