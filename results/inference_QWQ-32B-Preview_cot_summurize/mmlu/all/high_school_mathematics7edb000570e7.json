                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem: \"In how many ways can 5 students be selected from a group of 6 students?\" and the options are A. 12, B. 3, C. 5, D. 6. Hmm, this seems like a combination problem because we're selecting students without considering the order, right?\n\nSo, the formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 6 and k = 5.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers: C(6, 5) = 6! / (5!(6 - 5)!) = (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / ((5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)(1!)).\n\nSimplifying this, the 5! in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving me with 6 / 1! which is 6 / 1 = 6.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at this. If I have 6 students and I need to select 5, that's the same as choosing which one to leave out, right? So, there are 6 students, and each one can be the one left out, so that would be 6 ways.\n\nBut let me see if that makes sense with the combination formula. Yeah, C(6,5) should equal C(6,1), because choosing 5 to include is the same as choosing 1 to exclude. And C(6,1) is simply 6.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6.\n\nLooking at the options, D. 6 matches this.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other way to interpret this problem? Maybe if the order of selection matters, but the problem says \"select,\" which usually means combinations, not permutations.\n\nAlternatively, if it were permutations, the formula would be P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)!, which would be P(6,5) = 6! / (6-5)! = 720 / 1 = 720, but that's not an option.\n\nSo, sticking with combinations seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: let's list them out.\n\nSuppose the students are A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nThe possible groups of 5 are:\n\n1. A, B, C, D, E (leaving out F)\n\n2. A, B, C, D, F (leaving out E)\n\n3. A, B, C, E, F (leaving out D)\n\n4. A, B, D, E, F (leaving out C)\n\n5. A, C, D, E, F (leaving out B)\n\n6. B, C, D, E, F (leaving out A)\n\nSo, indeed, there are 6 possible groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 6.\n\nI think that's straightforward. Maybe the other options are there to mislead if you misapply the formula or misinterpret the problem.\n\nFor example, option A. 12 might correspond to P(6,5)/2 or something, but that's not correct.\n\nOption B. 3 is too small, and C. 5 might be if you miscount or make a calculation error.\n\nBut based on the combination formula and logical enumeration, D. 6 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
