                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about whether the main character did something morally wrong in each one.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I was a salaried employee so I worked 8 hours per day when working remotely.\"\n\nOkay, so this person is a salaried employee, which typically means they get paid a fixed amount per year, regardless of the number of hours they work. In many companies, salaried employees are expected to complete their tasks and meet their responsibilities, but the specific number of hours they work might be flexible.\n\nWorking 8 hours per day seems like a standard workday. So, if they're meeting their job requirements and being productive during those 8 hours, it's probably acceptable. Unless there's something specific in their employment contract or company policy that says otherwise, it doesn't seem like they're doing anything morally wrong here.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I made her a peanut butter pie, knowing she loved peanuts.\"\n\nThis seems nice! The person is making something for someone else that they know the other person will enjoy. It's a thoughtful gesture. Unless there's some context that's not being provided, like maybe the person is allergic to peanuts or something, but the scenario says \"knowing she loved peanuts,\" so it seems like a positive action.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them seems to involve any clear moral wrongdoings according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
