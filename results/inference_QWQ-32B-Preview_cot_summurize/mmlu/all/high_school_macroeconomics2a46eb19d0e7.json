                    "text": "So Kevin, Lisa, and Bob all have things they want and things they can make or provide. Kevin has turnips and wants shoes, Lisa has sheet metal and wants turnips, and Bob has shoes and wants sheet metal. It seems like they can all help each other out by trading what they have for what they want.\n\nNow, the question is about which function of money would cater most directly to this situation. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Store of value - This means that money can hold value over time, so you can save it and use it later. But in this scenario, it's more about exchanging goods right away, not saving for the future.\n\nB. Unit of account - This is about using money to measure the value of goods and services. So, it helps in pricing things, but again, in this direct trading scenario, they might not need a common unit of measurement yet.\n\nC. Medium of exchange - This is where money is used to make transactions easier by replacing barter. In barter, you directly trade one good for another, which is what these people are trying to do. But sometimes, barter can be inefficient, especially if what you want isn't what the other person is offering.\n\nD. Means of deferred payment - This is about using money to pay for things at a later time, like credit. But in this case, they seem to want immediate exchange.\n\nSo, in this situation, the main issue is that their desires don't directly match for a barter exchange. Kevin wants shoes, but Lisa wants turnips, and Bob wants sheet metal. It's a bit of a mismatch. This is where money as a medium of exchange can help because it allows for more flexible trading. Instead of needing to find someone who wants exactly what you have and has exactly what you want, you can sell what you have for money and then use that money to buy what you want from someone else.\n\nFor example, Kevin can sell his turnips to Lisa for money, then use that money to buy shoes from Bob. Bob can then use that money to buy sheet metal from Lisa. This way, everyone gets what they want without having to directly barter for it.\n\nSo, the function of money that caters most directly to this situation is the medium of exchange.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
