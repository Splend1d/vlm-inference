Decades are commonly used to organize and categorize periods of time, especially in historical, social, and cultural contexts. For example, the 1920s, often referred to as the \"Roaring Twenties,\" was a decade marked by significant cultural, technological, and political changes.\n\nWhile \"decade\" specifically refers to a period of 10 years, other terms are used for longer periods. For instance:\n\n- A lustrum is a period of 5 years.\n\n- A century is a period of 100 years.\n\n- A millennium is a period of 1,000 years.\n\nIt's worth noting that in some contexts, the term \"decade\" might be used more flexibly, but in standard usage, it denotes a 10-year span."
