So, I need to see which score shows up the most times.\n\nLet's list them out and count each one:\n\n- 50: appears once\n\n- 60: appears twice\n\n- 70: appears twice\n\n- 80: appears twice\n\n- 90: appears three times\n\nOkay, so 90 appears three times, which is more than any other score. So, the mode should be 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there are any other scores that appear three times. Let's see:\n\n- 50: 1\n\n- 60: 2\n\n- 70: 2\n\n- 80: 2\n\n- 90: 3\n\nNo, only 90 appears three times. So, the mode is 90.\n\nBut looking at the options, option C is 90, which matches my conclusion.\n\nHowever, I notice that there are other options: A. 74, B. 75, D. 40. These don't appear in the list at all. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the mean, median, or something else. But no, it specifically says \"mode.\"\n\nLet me double-check the definition of mode. Yes, it's the value that appears most frequently.\n\nIn this case, 90 appears most frequently, so the mode is 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way that there are multiple modes, but in this set, 90 appears more times than any other number.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. 90.\n\nBut why are there other options like 74 and 75? Maybe they are trying to mislead me.\n\nWait, perhaps they want me to calculate the median or the mean and mistake it for the mode.\n\nLet me calculate the median to be sure.\n\nFirst, arrange the scores in order: 50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 80, 80, 90, 90, 90.\n\nSince there are 10 scores, the median would be the average of the 5th and 6th values.\n\nThe 5th value is 70, the 6th is 80. So, the median would be (70 + 80)/2 = 75.\n\nSo, the median is 75, which is option B.\n\nBut the question asks for the mode, not the median.\n\nMaybe some students might confuse mode with median and choose 75.\n\nSimilarly, option A is 74, which is close to the median but not exact.\n\nOption D is 40, which isn't in the list at all.\n\nSo, it seems like the question is trying to see if I know the difference between mode and median.\n\nBut since the mode is indeed 90, I should choose C. 90.\n\nWait a minute, but in some cases, if there are multiple modes, the set is called multimodal.\n\nIn this set, 90 appears three times, and the others appear twice. So, it's unimodal with mode 90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 90.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
