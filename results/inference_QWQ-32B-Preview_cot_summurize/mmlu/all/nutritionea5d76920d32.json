                    "text": "Long-chain fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential nutrients that play a crucial role in the development and function of the brain and eyes. During pregnancy and infancy, when these organs are rapidly developing, supplementation with EPA and DHA can have significant benefits. Let's explore each option to determine which areas are likely to benefit from such supplementation.\n\n**Option A: Visual performance**\n\nDHA is a major structural component of the retina in the eye. It is involved in the development and function of photoreceptors, which are critical for vision. Studies have shown that infants who receive adequate DHA have better visual acuity and faster visual processing speeds compared to those who do not. Therefore, supplementation with EPA and DHA during pregnancy and infancy is likely to benefit visual performance.\n\n**Option B: Motor performance**\n\nMotor skills involve the coordination of muscles and the nervous system to produce movement. While DHA is primarily associated with brain and eye development, it also plays a role in neural functioning that affects motor skills. Some studies suggest that higher DHA levels in mothers during pregnancy and in infants are associated with improved motor development. However, the evidence in this area is not as robust as that for visual performance and cognitive functions.\n\n**Option C: Behaviour disorders**\n\nBehaviour disorders in children can have\u591a\u79cd\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9057\u4f20\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8425\u517b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002DHA is known to be important for brain development and function, and some research suggests that adequate levels of DHA may help reduce the risk of behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the relationship between DHA supplementation and behavior disorders is not yet fully established, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n**Option D: Memory**\n\nDHA is a key component of neuronal membranes and is involved in synaptic function, which is crucial for learning and memory. Studies have shown that infants who receive sufficient DHA have better cognitive development and memory skills compared to those who do not. Therefore, supplementation with EPA and DHA during pregnancy and infancy is likely to benefit memory.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the available evidence, supplementation with long-chain fatty acids EPA and DHA during pregnancy and infancy is likely to benefit visual performance and memory. While there is some evidence suggesting benefits for motor performance and behavior disorders, the evidence is not as strong in these areas. Therefore, the most confident answers are A (Visual performance) and D (Memory).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A \\text{ and } D} \\]"
