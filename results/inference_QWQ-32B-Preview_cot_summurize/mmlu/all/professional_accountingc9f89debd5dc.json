                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, a CPA, which is a Certified Public Accountant, has been hired to do some calculations on an investment's rate of return using a specific formula that was agreed upon. Then, the CPA needs to check if the percentage they calculate matches the one listed in a particular schedule. After doing this work, the CPA has to write a report about it, following the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nNow, the question is asking what should be included in that report. There are four options:\n\nA. An opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures.\n\nB. A separate paragraph describing the effectiveness of the internal controls.\n\nC. A disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\nD. A disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement entails. In an AUP engagement, the CPA performs specific procedures that are agreed upon by all parties involved, and then reports on the factual findings of those procedures without providing an opinion or assurance on the overall financial statements or the procedures themselves.\n\nSo, in this case, the CPA is just applying a formula to calculate the rate of return and verifying if it matches the schedule. They're not expressing an opinion on whether the procedures are fair or the internal controls are effective.\n\nOption A suggests that the report should contain an opinion about the fairness of the agreed-upon procedures. But in an AUP engagement, the CPA is not supposed to provide an opinion on the fairness of the procedures; they just execute them as agreed.\n\nOption B proposes including a separate paragraph on the effectiveness of internal controls. Again, in an AUP engagement, the focus is on performing the specific procedures and reporting the results. Evaluating internal controls is typically part of a different type of engagement, like an internal control audit.\n\nOption C mentions a disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures. This seems more aligned with an AUP engagement. Since the procedures are agreed upon by the parties involved, the CPA is usually disclaimer their responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures. They're just performing what was agreed upon, and it's up to the engaging parties to determine whether those procedures are appropriate for their needs.\n\nOption D suggests a disclaimer of opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements. While this might be relevant in other types of engagements, in an AUP engagement, the CPA is not expressing an opinion on the fair presentation of the financial statements. They're only reporting on the specific procedures performed.\n\nGiven this understanding, option C seems to be the most appropriate choice. The report should include a disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of the procedures, as the CPA is merely carrying out the agreed-upon procedures without opining on their adequacy or the overall fairness of the financial statements.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about why the other options are less suitable:\n\n- Option A: The CPA isn't providing an opinion on the fairness of the procedures; that's determined by the parties involved.\n\n- Option B: Internal control effectiveness isn't typically addressed in an AUP engagement focused on specific calculations.\n\n- Option D: Disclaiming opinion on fair presentation is more relevant to audit or review engagements, not AUP engagements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. A disclaimer of responsibility for the sufficiency of those procedures.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
