                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Hume's attack on natural law. So, the options are:\n\nA. We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong.\n\nB. Natural law is backward-looking.\n\nC. There is no such thing as a social contract.\n\nD. Natural law fails to protect the state against attacks.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what Hume's stance was on natural law. I know that David Hume was a Scottish philosopher who lived in the 18th century, and he's famous for his empirical approach to knowledge and his skepticism about certain kinds of reasoning.\n\nNatural law, as I understand it, is the idea that there are moral principles that are inherent in nature and can be discovered through reason. These principles are supposed to provide a basis for ethical behavior and legal systems.\n\nNow, Hume is known for his moral skepticism, which suggests that he might have some issues with the objectivity of moral knowledge. So, option A seems plausible. He might argue that we can't know for sure what's morally right or wrong because moral judgments are based on feelings or sentiments rather than objective facts.\n\nOption B says that natural law is backward-looking. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Maybe it refers to natural law being based on past events or historical practices. But I don't recall Hume specifically critiquing natural law for being backward-looking. So, this one seems less likely.\n\nOption C mentions the absence of a social contract. Now, Hume did write about politics and justice, and he had some thoughts on the social contract theory, which was popularized by thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. However, I don't think his attack on natural law was specifically targeted at the idea of a social contract. So, perhaps this isn't the primary focus of his critique.\n\nOption D suggests that natural law fails to protect the state against attacks. I'm not sure if Hume saw natural law primarily in terms of its protective\u4f5c\u7528 for the state. His criticisms might be more philosophical and less focused on practical political protections.\n\nLet me think again. Hume is well-known for his separation of facts and values, or what he called \"is-ought\" problem. He argued that you cannot derive an \"ought\" from an \"is,\" meaning that moral conclusions cannot be logically derived from purely factual premises. This seems closely related to option A, which questions the objective knowledge of moral right and wrong.\n\nFurthermore, Hume is famous for his assertion that reason is the slave of the passions. In other words, our actions are motivated by feelings and desires, not by reason alone. This would suggest that moral judgments are more about our emotions and less about objective truths, which again aligns with option A.\n\nOn the other hand, natural law theorists like Thomas Aquinas and John Locke believed that moral truths are objective and can be discovered through reason. So, if Hume is skeptical about the objectivity of moral knowledge, he would likely criticize natural law for presuming such objectivity without justification.\n\nOption B, about natural law being backward-looking, doesn't ring a bell in terms of Hume's criticisms. Maybe other philosophers have made that point, but I don't think it's central to Hume's attack.\n\nOption C, regarding the social contract, is interesting because Hume did discuss the origins of government and justice. However, his critique of natural law isn't primarily about the existence or non-existence of a social contract. So, while he may have had opinions on social contracts, it's not directly related to his attack on natural law.\n\nOption D seems too specific. Natural law is more about providing a moral foundation for laws and actions, but Hume might not have focused on its protective functions for the state.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best answer is A: We cannot objectively know what is morally right or wrong. This aligns with Hume's moral skepticism and his separation of facts and values.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other angle. Maybe Hume had multiple criticisms of natural law, but given the options, A seems the most directly related to his philosophical position.\n\nSo, I'll go with A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
