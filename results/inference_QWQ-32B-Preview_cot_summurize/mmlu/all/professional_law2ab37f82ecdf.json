While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, \"You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. \" Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?\n\nA. Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\nB. Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.\nC. No, because the confession was voluntary.\nD. No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.\n"

                    "text": "This is a complex case involving issues of coercion, entrapment, and the voluntariness of a confession. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the defendant is already incarcerated for another crime when federal agents decide to investigate a separate murder. They plant an informant in the prison to befriend the defendant and try to extract information about the murder. The informant poses as an organized crime figure and befriends the defendant.\n\nThe defendant is being threatened by other inmates due to a rumor that he killed a child. The informant offers to protect the defendant but insists that the defendant tell the truth about what really happened if he wants help. The defendant, believing that this protection is contingent on confessing, admits to killing his stepdaughter.\n\nNow, the defendant is moving to suppress this confession, arguing that it was coerced. So, we need to consider whether this confession was voluntary or if it was the product of coercion.\n\nOption A suggests that the motion should be granted because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\n\nOption B says yes, the motion should be granted because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.\n\nOption C says no, the motion should not be granted because the confession was voluntary.\n\nOption D says no, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.\n\nLet's look at the legal standards here. In the United States, confessions must be voluntary to be admissible in court. The test for voluntariness generally considers the totality of the circumstances, including the defendant's character, background, and mental condition, as well as the conduct of the law enforcement officials.\n\nCoercion can take many forms, not just physical force. Psychological pressure can also render a confession involuntary if it overbears the defendant's will.\n\nIn this case, the informant is posing as a friend who can provide protection in a prison setting, which is a high-stress environment. The defendant is being threatened by other inmates due to a rumor about him killing a child. The informant offers protection but conditions it on the defendant telling the truth about the murder.\n\nSo, the defendant feels that he needs this protection to survive in prison, and he believes that confessing is the only way to get that protection.\n\nThis seems like a situation where the defendant is under duress. The protection offered by the informant is essential for the defendant's safety, and the informant is using that need to elicit a confession.\n\nIn legal terms, this could be seen as coercion because the defendant's will was overborne by the informant's manipulation of the situation. The defendant felt he had no choice but to confess to get the protection he needed.\n\nOption A highlights the threat of physical violence and the absence of protection as coercive factors. This seems relevant because the defendant was being threatened by other inmates, and the informant was the only one offering protection in exchange for the truth.\n\nOption B mentions that the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into confessing. While deception by law enforcement can be a factor, courts have generally allowed some level of deception in interrogations, as long as it doesn't rise to the level of coercion.\n\nOption C says the confession was voluntary, but given the circumstances, it's hard to see how that's the case. The defendant was under duress, feeling threatened by other inmates and relying on the informant for protection.\n\nOption D suggests that under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive. However, considering the specific circumstances here, it does seem that the informant's actions were coercive.\n\nIn similar cases, courts have sometimes found that confessions obtained through manipulation and the creation of a coercive environment are involuntary and should be suppressed.\n\nFor example, in Frazier v. Cupp (1969), the Supreme Court held that a confession obtained through deception was voluntary, but in other cases, like Haynes v. Washington (1963), the Court found a confession involuntary when it was obtained through prolonged interrogation and threats.\n\nIn this scenario, the informant is essentially holding protection ransom for a confession, which seems like a form of coercion.\n\nMoreover, the defendant was already in a vulnerable position as a prisoner, and the informant exploited that vulnerability.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the defendant's motion to suppress should be granted because the confession was coerced.\n\nSo, the answer would be A: Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.\n\nOption B is also tempting, but it seems that coercion is a more direct reason than just being tricked into confessing.\n\nOptions C and D fail to recognize the coercive nature of the informant's actions in this particular context.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
