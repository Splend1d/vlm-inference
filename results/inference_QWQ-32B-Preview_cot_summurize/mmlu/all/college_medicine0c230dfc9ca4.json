Let me see if I can recall why that is.\n\nSo, during embryonic development, the body starts to form from three primary germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Each of these layers gives rise to different structures and organs in the body.\n\nThe ectoderm, which is the outermost layer, develops into the skin, hair, nails, and the nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord.\n\nThe mesoderm, which is the middle layer, gives rise to muscles, bones, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. It also forms the urogenital system, including the kidneys and reproductive organs.\n\nThen there's the endoderm, the innermost layer, which develops into the lining of the digestive tract and the respiratory tract. So, that would include the esophagus, stomach, intestines, lungs, and associated structures.\n\nWait a minute, but I'm not entirely sure about the respiratory tract. Does it also develop from the endoderm? Let me think about this.\n\nI know that the lungs are part of the respiratory system, and I believe they do develop from the endoderm, specifically from the foregut region. The trachea and bronchi also originate from the endoderm.\n\nSo, if both the digestive tract and the respiratory tract develop from the endoderm, then the answer should be A. I only.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any part of the digestive tract or respiratory tract that develops from another germ layer?\n\nI recall that some muscles in the digestive tract, like the muscularis externa, develop from the mesoderm. But the lining, which I think is the mucosa, comes from the endoderm.\n\nSimilarly, in the respiratory tract, the bronchial trees and alveoli are endodermal in origin, but the smooth muscles and cartilage come from the mesoderm.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the lining of these tracts, which should be the endoderm.\n\nSo, I think A. I only is the correct answer.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider the other options.\n\nOption B is II only, which is mesoderm. We've established that some components of both tracts come from the mesoderm, but the lining is endodermal.\n\nOption C is III only, which is ectoderm. The ectoderm forms the skin and nervous system, not the linings of the digestive or respiratory tracts.\n\nOption D is I and II, meaning endoderm and mesoderm. While both germ layers contribute to the digestive and respiratory tracts, the lining specifically comes from the endoderm.\n\nTherefore, A. I only seems to be the correct answer.\n\nIt's always good to review this stuff, as it can get a bit confusing with all the different layers and the organs they give rise to.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
