                    "text": "Let's see what this problem is asking. So, we have an expression: 7 multiplied by 2, which is 7 x 2. We need to find out which option correctly uses this expression to find a total.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"the total number of points if a player made 7 shots and each shot was worth 2 points.\" Okay, so if a player made 7 shots and each shot is worth 2 points, then the total points would be 7 times 2, which is 14. That makes sense because each shot contributes 2 points, and there are 7 of them. So, this seems like a correct application of the expression 7 x 2.\n\nNow, option B: \"the total number of basketballs if 7 basketballs were old and 2 basketballs were new.\" Here, we have 7 old basketballs and 2 new basketballs. To find the total number of basketballs, we should add them together: 7 plus 2 equals 9. Not multiplying, so this doesn't match the expression 7 x 2.\n\nOption C: \"the total number of points if one player had 7 points and a different player had 2 points.\" Again, to find the total points, we need to add the points together: 7 plus 2 equals 9. Not multiplying, so this isn't using the expression 7 x 2.\n\nLastly, option D: \"the total number of basketballs used if there were 7 basketballs and 2 of the basketballs were not used.\" If there are 7 basketballs in total and 2 were not used, then the number used would be 7 minus 2, which is 5. Again, not multiplication.\n\nSo, looking back, only option A involves multiplying 7 by 2 to find a total. The other options involve addition or subtraction. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. Is there any scenario where 7 x 2 could apply to the other options?\n\nFor option B, maybe if there were 7 types of basketballs and each type had 2 basketballs, but that's not what it says. It says 7 were old and 2 were new, which are separate categories to be added.\n\nOption C is about points from two different players: 7 and 2, which again should be added.\n\nOption D is about total basketballs minus the unused ones, which is subtraction.\n\nSo, no, only option A correctly uses the expression 7 x 2 to find the total points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
