                    "text": "Let's see. I need to identify which of the given reactions are reduction half-reactions. So, first things first, I need to remember what a reduction half-reaction is. Reduction is when a species gains electrons, right? So, in a half-reaction, if something is gaining electrons, that's reduction.\n\nOkay, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption 1: Cu\u00b2\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Cu\u207a\n\nHere, Cu\u00b2\u207a is gaining an electron to become Cu\u207a. So, that's gaining electrons, which means it's being reduced. So, this seems like a reduction half-reaction.\n\nOption 2: Cu\u207a + e\u207b \u2192 Cu\u2070\n\nSimilarly, Cu\u207a is gaining an electron to become Cu\u2070. Again, gaining electrons, so this is also a reduction half-reaction.\n\nOption 3: Fe\u00b2\u207a \u2192 Fe\u00b3\u207a + e\u207b\n\nIn this case, Fe\u00b2\u207a is losing an electron to become Fe\u00b3\u207a. Losing electrons means it's being oxidized, not reduced. So, this is an oxidation half-reaction.\n\nSo, based on this, options 1 and 2 are reduction half-reactions, while option 3 is an oxidation half-reaction.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 1 only because copper(II) ions are reduced\n\nWait, but option 1 is Cu\u00b2\u207a gaining an electron to become Cu\u207a, which is reduction, but option 2 is also reduction. So, this answer seems incomplete.\n\nB. 3 only because the iron is reduced\n\nNo, option 3 is oxidation, not reduction. Iron is being oxidized here.\n\nC. 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions\n\nThis seems correct. Both options 1 and 2 involve reduction of copper ions.\n\nD. 1 and 3 because they do not have insoluble ions\n\nI don't think solubility is relevant here. The question is about whether the reactions are reduction half-reactions or not, not about the solubility of the ions.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. 1 and 2 because they both reduce copper ions.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any reason why option 3 might be considered a reduction? No, because it's clearly showing Fe\u00b2\u207a losing an electron to become Fe\u00b3\u207a, which is oxidation.\n\nAlso, in option 1 and 2, both involve copper ions gaining electrons, which is reduction.\n\nSo, yes, C seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
