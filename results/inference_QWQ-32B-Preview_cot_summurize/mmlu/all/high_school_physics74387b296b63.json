                    "text": "So I've got this problem here with two particles, A and B, that are isolated and 4 meters apart. Particle A has a net charge of 2Q, and particle B has a net charge of Q. I need to find the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. The options are 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, or 1:2.\n\nFirst, I remember that electric forces between two charges follow Coulomb's law, which states that the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The formula is:\n\n\\[ F = k \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( F \\) is the magnitude of the force between the charges,\n\n- \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant,\n\n- \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the magnitudes of the charges,\n\n- \\( r \\) is the distance between the charges.\n\nIn this case, both particles are experiencing forces due to each other's charges. According to Newton's third law, the force that A exerts on B is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that B exerts on A. So, the magnitude of the force on A due to B should be equal to the magnitude of the force on B due to A.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B. If both forces are equal in magnitude, then the ratio should be 1:1.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Let's try calculating the forces explicitly.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- Charge of A: \\( q_A = 2Q \\)\n\n- Charge of B: \\( q_B = Q \\)\n\n- Distance between A and B: \\( r = 4 \\) m\n\nThe force on A due to B is:\n\n\\[ F_{B \\text{ on } A} = k \\frac{|q_A q_B|}{r^2} = k \\frac{(2Q)(Q)}{4^2} = k \\frac{2Q^2}{16} = k \\frac{Q^2}{8} \\]\n\nSimilarly, the force on B due to A is:\n\n\\[ F_{A \\text{ on } B} = k \\frac{|q_A q_B|}{r^2} = k \\frac{(2Q)(Q)}{16} = k \\frac{2Q^2}{16} = k \\frac{Q^2}{8} \\]\n\nSo, both forces have the same magnitude, \\( k \\frac{Q^2}{8} \\).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{F_{B \\text{ on } A}}{F_{A \\text{ on } B}} = \\frac{k \\frac{Q^2}{8}}{k \\frac{Q^2}{8}} = 1 \\]\n\nSo, the ratio is 1:1.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe the question is considering the charges are different, so the forces should be different. Wait, no, according to Newton's third law, the forces should be equal and opposite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about what is being asked. Maybe it's not just the magnitude of the force between them, but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the net force on each particle, considering that they might have other forces acting on them. But the problem states that the particles are isolated, so presumably, the only force acting on each is the electric force due to the other particle.\n\nSo, in that case, the net force on A is just \\( F_{B \\text{ on } A} \\), and the net force on B is \\( F_{A \\text{ on } B} \\), which are equal in magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the ratio should be 1:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is 1:1, which seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I might be missing. For example, if the particles have different masses, does that affect the force? Well, force is related to acceleration via \\( F = ma \\), but in this case, we're only asked about the electric forces, not the accelerations or masses.\n\nSo, I don't think the masses are relevant here.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the direction of the forces. But since the question is asking for the magnitude of the forces, direction doesn't matter.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions that the particles are isolated, so there are no other external forces acting on them besides the electric force between A and B.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the magnitudes of the electric forces should indeed be 1:1.\n\nI think the answer is C. 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
