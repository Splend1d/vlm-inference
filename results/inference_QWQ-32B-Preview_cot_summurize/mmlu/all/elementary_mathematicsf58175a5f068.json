Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should probably simplify the left side of the equation. I have 12 minus 9, which is 3, and then plus c. So, 12 - 9 is 3, and then plus c equals 12. So, it's 3 + c = 12.\n\nNow, I need to find out what c is. To isolate c, I can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. So, 3 + c - 3 = 12 - 3. That simplifies to c = 9.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. If c is 9, then plugging it back into the original equation: 12 - 9 + 9. That's 12 - 9 is 3, plus 9 is 12. Yeah, that equals 12. So, c = 9 works.\n\nLet me just double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A is 0. If c = 0, then 12 - 9 + 0 = 3, which is not equal to 12.\n\nOption B is 3. If c = 3, then 12 - 9 + 3 = 6, which is not equal to 12.\n\nOption D is 12. If c = 12, then 12 - 9 + 12 = 15, which is not equal to 12.\n\nSo, only c = 9 makes the equation true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c=9} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c=9} \\]"
