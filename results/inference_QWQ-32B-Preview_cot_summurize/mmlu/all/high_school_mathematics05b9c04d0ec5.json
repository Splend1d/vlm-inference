The expression given is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k + 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nFirst, I notice that there are fractions involved, specifically two terms with denominators of 2. The other terms are integers or simple multiples of k. To simplify this, it might be helpful to combine like terms, but because of the fractions, I should probably find a common denominator to combine all the terms easily.\n\nWait, actually, since two of the three terms have the same denominator, maybe I can combine those first.\n\nSo, let's group the terms with denominator 2 together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3}{2} + \\frac{3k + 1}{2} + 3k + 1\n\\]\n\nNow, since they have the same denominator, I can combine the numerators:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(k - 3) + (3k + 1)}{2} + 3k + 1\n\\]\n\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\n(k - 3) + (3k + 1) = k + 3k - 3 + 1 = 4k - 2\n\\]\n\nSo now the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4k - 2}{2} + 3k + 1\n\\]\n\nI can simplify the fraction by dividing both terms in the numerator by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4k}{2} - \\frac{2}{2} = 2k - 1\n\\]\n\nSo now the expression is:\n\n\\[\n2k - 1 + 3k + 1\n\\]\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n2k + 3k - 1 + 1 = 5k + 0 = 5k\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the expression is \\(5k\\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\(3k + 1\\)\n\nB. \\(5k\\)\n\nC. \\(3k\\)\n\nD. \\(1\\)\n\nThe correct answer is B. \\(5k\\).\n\nI should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original expression:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3}{2} + 3k + 1 + \\frac{3k + 1}{2}\n\\]\n\nGrouping the fractions:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - 3 + 3k + 1}{2} + 3k + 1 = \\frac{4k - 2}{2} + 3k + 1 = 2k - 1 + 3k + 1 = 5k\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. No mistakes spotted.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5k} \\]\n"
