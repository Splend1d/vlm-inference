                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: At a college, approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school. There are 750 seniors at the college, and I need to figure out how many of them would be expected to attend graduate school. The options are A. 75 seniors, B. 107 seniors, C. 300 seniors, and D. 400 seniors.\n\nAlright, first things first. The problem says \"approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school.\" That sounds like a ratio or a fraction. So, 2 out of 5 can be written as the fraction 2/5.\n\nNow, there are 750 seniors in total. To find out how many of these seniors are expected to attend graduate school, I need to find 2/5 of 750.\n\nLet me write that down: (2/5) * 750.\n\nI can calculate this in a few different ways. One way is to first divide 750 by 5, and then multiply the result by 2.\n\nSo, 750 divided by 5 is 150. Then, 150 multiplied by 2 is 300.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, according to this, 300 seniors are expected to attend graduate school.\n\nBut let me double-check that I'm doing this correctly. Maybe there's another way to approach it.\n\nAnother way could be to convert the fraction 2/5 into a decimal. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So, 0.4 times 750 should give me the same answer.\n\nLet's see: 0.4 * 750.\n\nWell, 0.4 times 700 is 280, and 0.4 times 50 is 20. So, 280 plus 20 is 300.\n\nOkay, that matches my first calculation. So, it's looking like 300 seniors are expected to attend graduate school.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. 75 seniors\n\nB. 107 seniors\n\nC. 300 seniors\n\nD. 400 seniors\n\nOption C is 300 seniors, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nThe problem says \"approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school.\" It's giving a ratio based on previous data, and it's asking for an expectation based on that ratio.\n\nSo, using the ratio to find the expected number seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, someone might think that \"2 out of 5\" means 40%, and then calculate 40% of 750.\n\nWait, that's actually what I did when I converted 2/5 to 0.4 and then multiplied by 750.\n\nSo, that's consistent again.\n\nAlternatively, someone might\u8bef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f2\u9664\u4ee55\u7b49\u4e8e0.4\uff0c\u7136\u540e750\u4e58\u4ee50.4\u7b49\u4e8e300\u3002\n\n\u55ef\uff0c\u548c\u6211\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n\n\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u6709\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u8bd5\u56fe\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u8bbex\u4e3a\u53bb\u7814\u7a76\u751f\u9662\u7684 seniors \u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48 x / 750 = 2 / 5\u3002\n\n\u7136\u540e\u89e3\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42x\u3002\n\n\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u4e58\uff0c5x = 2 * 750\uff0c\u6240\u4ee55x = 1500\uff0c\u7136\u540ex = 1500 / 5 = 300\u3002\n\n\u53c8\u5f97\u5230\u4e86300\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n\u770b\u6765\u4e0d\u7ba1\u7528\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u90fd\u662f300\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u9009\u9879\u91cc\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u53ef\u80fd\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u9009\u9879\u3002\n\n\u9009\u9879A\u662f75\uff0c\u90a3\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\uff1b\u9009\u9879B\u662f107\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u592a\u63a5\u8fd1\uff1b\u9009\u9879C\u662f300\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\uff1b\u9009\u9879D\u662f400\uff0c\u90a3\u6bd4300\u8981\u591a100\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4eba\u7b97\u9519\u4f1a\u9009\u8fd9\u4e2a\u3002\n\n\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6709\u4eba\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f5 out of 2\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u9519\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\u6839\u636e\u9898\u610f\uff0c\u662f2 out of 5\uff0c\u5f88\u6e05\u695a\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u5e94\u8be5\u662fC. 300 seniors\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
