The prosecution alleges that on December 17, the husband murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinyicholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. Further allegations claim that the husband's principal motive was to collect his wife's $500,000 life insurance policy under which he was the named beneficiary. The defense called the physician who signed the wife's death certificate as its first witness. The defendant's attorney asked her, \"Is it not true that the cause of death was a heart attack?\" The physician answered in the negative and stated that the cause of death was unknown. The husband's attorney then assailed her testimony as a recent fabrication and asked her if she had not stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack. The prosecution immediately objected to this question. The trial judge should rule that this question is\n\nA. objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.\nB. objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\nC. unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\nD. unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\n"

It's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, in this case, a husband is being charged with murdering his wife by giving her a fatal dose of succinylcholine while she was asleep. The prosecution says he did this to collect on her $500,000 life insurance policy, where he's the beneficiary. The defense is calling a physician who signed the wife's death certificate as their first witness.\n\nThe defense attorney asks the physician, \"Is it not true that the cause of death was a heart attack?\" The physician says no, and that the cause of death was unknown. Then, the defense attorney suggests that the physician's current testimony is a recent fabrication and asks if she had stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack.\n\nThe prosecution objects to this question, and now the trial judge has to decide whether to allow it or not. The options are:\n\nA. Objectionable, because a party may not impeach its own witness.\n\nB. Objectionable, because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\n\nC. Unobjectionable, because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nD. Unobjectionable, because the physician's testimony at a proceeding that occurred shortly after the death would be more reliable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. The defense is trying to impeach their own witness, which seems unusual because typically, impeachment is used to challenge the credibility of the other side's witnesses. But apparently, there are circumstances where a party can impeach their own witness.\n\nOption A says it's objectionable because a party may not impeach its own witness. But option C says it's unobjectionable because a party may impeach its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement. So, these two options are directly opposed.\n\nOption D suggests that the question is unobjectionable because the earlier statement was made shortly after the death, implying it's more reliable. But the prosecution is objecting, so the judge needs to decide if this is a valid line of questioning.\n\nOption B says it's objectionable because no proper foundation was laid. Laying a foundation is important in impeachment, especially when trying to introduce prior inconsistent statements.\n\nLet me think about the rules of evidence regarding impeachment. Generally, impeachment involves attacking the credibility of a witness, and one way to do that is by showing that the witness has made prior inconsistent statements.\n\nBut here, it's the defense's own witness, and they're trying to impead her. Is that allowed? I think there are rules that permit a party to impead their own witness under certain circumstances, especially if the witness's testimony is unfavorable or has shifted since previous statements.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a party is allowed to impead their own witness, but there might be restrictions or requirements, like laying a proper foundation.\n\nSo, in this case, the defense attorney is suggesting that the physician's current testimony is a recent fabrication, and is trying to introduce a prior statement where she said the cause of death was a heart attack.\n\nTo impead a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, generally, you need to lay a foundation by establishing that the witness made a different statement earlier, and that the circumstances suggest that the current testimony might not be reliable.\n\nHere, the defense attorney is trying to do that, but the prosecution is objecting.\n\nOption A says it's objectionable because a party can't impead its own witness. But I think that's not entirely accurate, as there are situations where a party can impead their own witness, especially if the witness's testimony is adverse or has changed.\n\nOption C says it's unobjectionable because a party may impead its own witness by a prior inconsistent statement. That seems plausible, but I need to consider whether the foundation has been properly laid.\n\nOption D suggests that the question is unobjectionable because the earlier statement was made shortly after the death, implying it's more reliable. But I'm not sure if that directly relates to the admissibility of the prior statement for impeachment purposes.\n\nOption B says it's objectionable because no proper foundation was laid. Maybe that's the key here. Perhaps the defense attorney needs to establish that the physician made this prior statement at the coroner's inquest, and that it was under circumstances where she had an opportunity to observe and form an opinion.\n\nLooking back at the scenario, the defense attorney has already asked if it's true that the cause of death was a heart attack, and the physician said no, the cause of death was unknown. Then, the attorney suggests that this is a recent fabrication and asks if she had stated at the coroner's inquest that the cause of death was a heart attack.\n\nIt seems like the attorney is trying to show that the physician previously stated the cause of death was a heart attack, but now is saying it's unknown, suggesting that the current testimony is not trustworthy.\n\nFor this to be allowed, the attorney probably needs to lay a foundation by establishing that the physician made this prior statement. Maybe they need to provide more details about the coroner's inquest and when it was held, to show that the prior statement was made before the current testimony.\n\nAlso, perhaps the attorney needs to show that the physician had an opportunity to observe or bases her prior statement on certain evidence.\n\nGiven that, option B seems plausible\u2014 that the question is objectionable because the attorney hasn't laid a proper foundation for introducing the prior inconsistent statement.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the fact that it was at a coroner's inquest, which is presumably a formal proceeding, is sufficient to establish the foundation.\n\nI'm a bit unsure here.\n\nLet me consider the purposes of impeachment. Impeaching a witness is about challenging their credibility, and using prior inconsistent statements is one way to do that. However, if it's the party's own witness, they might be limited in how they can impead them, to prevent them from introducing harmful evidence through their own witnesses.\n\nIn some legal systems, a party can impead their own witness, but only with the court's permission, and perhaps only if the witness is adverse or hostile.\n\nIn this case, the physician seems to be testifying for the defense, but her testimony that the cause of death is unknown might not be as helpful to the defense as a determination of heart attack would be. Maybe the defense was hoping for a heart attack cause of death to counter the prosecution's murder allegation.\n\nSo, perhaps the physician's testimony that the cause of death is unknown is less favorable to the defense than a heart attack determination.\n\nTherefore, the defense might want to impead their own witness to suggest that her current testimony is not reliable, and that her prior statement of heart attack is more accurate.\n\nBut is this allowed? And if so, are there specific requirements?\n\nI recall that in some jurisdictions, a party can impead their own witness if the witness becomes adverse or hostile during the testimony. Maybe that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the defense can impead their own witness with prior inconsistent statements, but only with the court's permission, and provided that they lay an appropriate foundation.\n\nGiven that, option B seems like a possible answer\u2014 that the question is objectionable because no proper foundation was laid.\n\nBut perhaps the attorney has already laid some foundation by suggesting that the current testimony is a recent fabrication, and by referring to the coroner's inquest.\n\nI'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption D suggests that the question is unobjectionable because the prior statement was made shortly after the death, implying it's more reliable. But I think the issue here is not about the reliability of the prior statement, but about whether it's appropriate to introduce it for impeachment purposes.\n\nMoreover, the prosecution is objecting, so the judge needs to decide whether this line of questioning is permissible under the rules of evidence.\n\nGiven all this, I think option B is the most accurate\u2014 the question is objectionable because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\n\nTo properly impead a witness with a prior inconsistent statement, the attorney typically needs to:\n\n1. Establish that the witness made a prior statement.\n\n2. Show that the prior statement is inconsistent with their current testimony.\n\n3. Provide the necessary details about when, where, and under what circumstances the prior statement was made.\n\nIn this case, the attorney has mentioned the coroner's inquest, which is a specific proceeding, so perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nHowever, maybe more foundation is needed, such as establishing that the coroner's inquest was held shortly after the death, that the physician had an opportunity to examine the body or review the relevant records at that time, and that her statement was made under oath or under similar formal circumstances.\n\nWithout that additional information, the prosecution might object that the prior statement is not reliable or that the witness didn't have the same information or basis for her statement at the inquest as she does now.\n\nTherefore, the judge might sustain the prosecution's objection on the grounds that the defense attorney hasn't laid a proper foundation for impeading their own witness with the prior inconsistent statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the judge could allow it, considering that the prior statement was made at a coroner's inquest, which is a serious proceeding, and that the statement was likely made before the current trial, suggesting that the current testimony might be influenced by other factors.\n\nBut given that the prosecution is objecting, and considering the general rules of evidence, I think the most appropriate answer is option B\u2014 the question is objectionable because the husband's attorney did not lay a proper foundation.\n\nOptions A and C deal with whether a party can impead their own witness, which seems permissible under certain circumstances, but the key issue here is the foundation for introducing the prior inconsistent statement.\n\nOption D focuses on the reliability of the prior statement, which might be a consideration, but it's not directly addressing the foundational requirements for impeachment.\n\nTherefore, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
