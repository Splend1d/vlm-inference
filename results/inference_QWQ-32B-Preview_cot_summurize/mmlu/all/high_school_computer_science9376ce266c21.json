I need to figure out what [-3] refers to in this list.\n\nFirst, I remember that in Python, lists can be indexed both positively and negatively. Positive indices start from the beginning of the list, with 0 being the first element, 1 the second, and so on. Negative indices start from the end of the list, with -1 being the last element, -2 the second last, and so forth.\n\nSo, in this list: ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1], let's assign both positive and negative indices to each element to make it clearer.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n- Index 0: 'a'\n\n- Index 1: 'Chemistry'\n\n- Index 2: 0\n\n- Index 3: 1\n\nStarting from the end:\n\n- Index -1: 1\n\n- Index -2: 0\n\n- Index -3: 'Chemistry'\n\n- Index -4: 'a'\n\nSo, when I look for [-3], it should be 'Chemistry'.\n\nLet me double-check by counting backwards from the end:\n\n- The last element is 1, which is [-1].\n\n- The second last is 0, which is [-2].\n\n- The third last is 'Chemistry', which is [-3].\n\nYes, that matches what I had earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's see what the other negative indices would refer to:\n\n- [-4] would be 'a', which is the same as [0].\n\n- [-5] would try to access beyond the start of the list and would cause an IndexError, but since we're only going up to [-3], we should be fine.\n\nSo, in conclusion, ['a', 'Chemistry', 0, 1][-3] is 'Chemistry', which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
