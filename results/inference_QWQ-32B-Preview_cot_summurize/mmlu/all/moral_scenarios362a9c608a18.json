Wearing black to a funeral is actually a common practice in many cultures, including in the US, as it is traditionally a color associated with mourning and respect for the deceased and their family. So, in this context, wearing black seems appropriate and respectful. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, this action does not seem morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character's daughter is insecure about her looks and feels she is too homely, so the parent agrees with her. This seems problematic. As a parent, it's important to support and build up your child's self-esteem, especially during times when they are feeling insecure. Agreeing with her negative self-assessment could reinforce those negative feelings and potentially harm her self-image. A more morally appropriate action might be to reassure her, point out her positive qualities, and help her build confidence. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, agreeing with her negative self-assessment seems morally wrong.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
