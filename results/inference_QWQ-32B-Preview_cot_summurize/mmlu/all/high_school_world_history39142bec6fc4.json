Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. . . . The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n\u2014Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nThe reasons given in the above passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to which other classical empires?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the fall of the Roman Empire, and it's asking which other classical empires could have fallen for similar reasons. The passage talks about a few key points: the natural decline due to over-growth, prosperity leading to decay, the multiplication of causes of destruction with conquest, the legions becoming corrupt and oppressive, and finally, being overwhelmed by barbarians.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what these reasons are and see which other empires might have experienced something similar.\n\n1. **Immoderate greatness and decline:** This suggests that the empire became too big to manage effectively. Maybe it stretched resources too thin.\n\n2. **Prosperity leading to decay:** When an empire becomes wealthy, maybe the people become complacent or corrupt.\n\n3. **Multiplication of causes of destruction with extent of conquest:** The more they conquered, the more problems they might have created for themselves.\n\n4. **Corrupt legions oppressing the people and violating authority:** Internal decay within the military, losing discipline and respect for authority.\n\n5. **Overwhelmed by barbarians:** External threats capitalizing on internal weakness.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Tang and Ottoman\n\n- The Tang Dynasty was a period of Chinese history known for its cultural and political achievements. It did eventually decline and fall, but I'm not entirely sure about the specific reasons.\n\n- The Ottoman Empire is more of a medieval and early modern empire, lasting until the 20th century. It's not exactly a classical empire.\n\nB. Ming and Aztec\n\n- The Ming Dynasty in China is another period of Chinese history, coming after the Yuan Dynasty. It's also not strictly a classical empire.\n\n- The Aztec Empire was in Mesoamerica and had its own set of challenges, including the arrival of Europeans.\n\nC. Han and Gupta\n\n- The Han Dynasty in China is considered a classical empire, known for its advancements and stability.\n\n- The Gupta Empire in India is also considered a classical empire, often referred to as India's \"classical age.\"\n\nD. Qin and Etruscan\n\n- The Qin Dynasty in China was the first imperial dynasty, known for its legalist approach and centralization.\n\n- The Etruscan civilization was in ancient Italy and predates the Roman Republic.\n\nGiven that the question refers to \"classical empires,\" options C and D seem more appropriate, as they include empires from the classical period.\n\nNow, focusing on C: Han and Gupta.\n\n- **Han Dynasty:** The Han Dynasty did face some of the same issues as the Roman Empire. It became quite large and prosperous, which might have led to internal decay. There were issues with corruption, especially towards the end of the dynasty. The military also faced problems, including rebellions and external pressures from nomadic groups like the Xiongnu.\n\n- **Gupta Empire:** Similarly, the Gupta Empire is known for its cultural and political achievements. However, towards the end, it faced invasions from foreign powers, such as the Hephthalites, which might have contributed to its decline.\n\nComparing these with the Roman Empire, we see similarities in terms of internal decay, military issues, and external pressures.\n\nOption A includes the Tang Dynasty, which came after the Han, and the Ottoman Empire, which is more medieval/modern.\n\nOption B has the Ming Dynasty and Aztec Empire, again not strictly classical.\n\nOption D has the Qin Dynasty, which was indeed classical, but the Etruscan civilization, while classical, wasn't an empire in the same sense.\n\nTherefore, option C seems the most appropriate, as both the Han and Gupta Empires were classical empires that possibly faced similar issues to the Roman Empire, such as internal decay, military problems, and external pressures leading to their decline.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
