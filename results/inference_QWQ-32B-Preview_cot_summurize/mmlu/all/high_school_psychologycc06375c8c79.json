His therapist is telling him that his thinking is irrational and faulty. I need to figure out which therapy approach the therapist is using based on that.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these therapy types is about.\n\nA. Psychoanalysis: This is like the original therapy approach developed by Freud. It focuses on uncovering repressed thoughts and feelings, often through techniques like free association and dream analysis. It's more about exploring the unconscious mind and past experiences.\n\nB. Systematic desensitization: This is a type of behavior therapy used to help people overcome phobias or anxieties. It involves gradually exposing the person to the thing they fear while teaching them relaxation techniques.\n\nC. Flooding: This is another behavior therapy technique, but it's more intense. It involves exposing the person to their feared object or situation all at once, in a very intense way, to help them get used to it quickly.\n\nD. Rational Emotive Therapy: This was developed by Albert Ellis and is one of the early forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy. It focuses on identifying and challenging irrational beliefs and changing them to more rational ones.\n\nOkay, so in Stephen's case, his therapist is pointing out that his thinking is irrational. That sounds a lot like rational emotive therapy. In this approach, therapists help clients recognize their irrational beliefs and replace them with more rational ones to improve their emotional well-being.\n\nLet me think about the other options to make sure. Psychoanalysis seems too focused on unconscious processes and past experiences, which doesn't align with the therapist addressing his current thinking. Systematic desensitization and flooding are both behavior therapies for phobias and anxieties, but Stephen's issue seems more about his beliefs and attitudes towards himself and relationships.\n\nSo, it makes the most sense that the therapist is employing rational emotive therapy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
