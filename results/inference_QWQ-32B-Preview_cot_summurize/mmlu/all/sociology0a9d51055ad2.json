                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which policy the New Labour government didn't pursue. So, first things first, I should probably recall what the New Labour government was known for in terms of education policies.\n\nI remember that under Tony Blair's leadership, New Labour introduced a lot of changes in education. One of the key things was giving more autonomy to schools, right? So, maybe option B, parental choice of school, was something they supported. I think they wanted to empower parents to choose the best school for their children, which would create competition among schools and hopefully improve standards overall.\n\nOption A is about setting and streaming pupils by ability. I think in the past, there was a lot of streaming in British schools, where students were divided into different groups based on their academic abilities. But I'm not sure if New Labour continued this practice or not. Maybe they tried to move away from it, promoting more inclusive teaching methods.\n\nOption C mentions supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing. LEAs are Local Education Authorities, right? I think New Labour introduced measures to intervene in underperforming schools, perhaps replacing LEAs in some cases with special advisors or something like that. So, supporting failing LEAs might not align with their approach.\n\nOption D is about state regulation and control of the curriculum. I believe New Labour placed a strong emphasis on standards and accountability, which probably involved more regulation and control over what was being taught in schools.\n\nHmm, let's think again. If New Labour was big on giving parents choice and schools more autonomy, but also on state regulation and control, maybe the policy they didn't pursue was supporting failing LEAs. Instead, they probably sought to reform or replace them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they didn't pursue setting and streaming pupils by ability, as there was a shift towards more inclusive education practices.\n\nWait, I recall that New Labour introduced the concept of specialist schools, which allowed schools to have a particular focus, like science or arts, and parents could choose schools based on their preferences. So, parental choice was definitely a part of their agenda.\n\nAlso, they introduced the national curriculum, which is a clear example of state regulation and control over what is taught in schools.\n\nRegarding LEAs, I think New Labour introduced measures like education action zones, where the government could intervene in areas with poor educational performance, sometimes bypassing LEAs.\n\nSo, perhaps supporting failing LEAs wasn't a policy they pursued; instead, they took action to improve or replace them.\n\nOn the other hand, setting and streaming by ability might have been continued, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at some key education reforms under New Labour.\n\nFirst, they introduced the national curriculum, which standardized what was taught in schools across different subjects and age groups. That's definitely state regulation and control of the curriculum, so option D was pursued by them.\n\nThey also introduced league tables, which published school performance data, allowing parents to compare schools. This supported parental choice, so option B was pursued.\n\nIn terms of school autonomy, they allowed schools to become academies, which had more freedom from LEAs and direct funding from central government. So, again, supporting parental choice and school autonomy.\n\nRegarding LEAs, as I mentioned earlier, they introduced education action zones to intervene in underperforming areas, which suggests that they didn't simply support failing LEAs but rather took active steps to address the issues.\n\nAs for setting and streaming by ability, I think New Labour's approach was to promote inclusive education and reduce streaming, especially in early years. There was a shift towards mixed-ability teaching to give all students access to the same curriculum.\n\nIn fact, I recall that the government encouraged schools to adopt more inclusive practices and reduce selection by ability.\n\nTherefore, option A, setting and streaming pupils by ability, might be the policy that New Labour did not pursue.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Option A: Not pursued, as they moved towards more inclusive education practices.\n\n- Option B: Pursued, through promoting parental choice and school autonomy.\n\n- Option C: Not pursued; instead, they intervened in failing LEAs.\n\n- Option D: Pursued, through the national curriculum and standardization.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Setting and streaming pupils by ability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
