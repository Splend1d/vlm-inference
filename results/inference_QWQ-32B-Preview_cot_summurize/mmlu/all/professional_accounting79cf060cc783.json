                    "text": "Let's dive into this auditor scenario. So, the auditor is selecting prenumbered purchase orders to test the entity's internal control activities, specifically focusing on whether purchases of office equipment are properly approved before ordering. To do this, the auditor is using a random number selection method to pick which purchase orders to inspect.\n\nNow, in this process, if a random number corresponds to a voided purchase order, the auditor needs to decide whether to replace it with another purchase order or not. The question is asking under which condition the auditor would ordinarily replace the voided purchase order with another one.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Represents office equipment ordered and never received.\n\nB. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nC. Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor.\n\nD. Has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file.\n\nFirst, I need to understand why a purchase order might be voided and what implications that has for the audit.\n\nA voided purchase order could mean different things:\n\n1. The order was never intended to be processed, perhaps it was a mistake.\n\n2. The order was canceled before it was executed.\n\n3. The order was placed, but the equipment was never received, maybe due to some issue with the vendor.\n\n4. It could have been electronically deleted from the system.\n\nThe auditor's goal is to test the internal control related to proper approval before ordering office equipment. So, the focus is on whether the purchase orders that were issued for office equipment were properly approved.\n\nNow, if a purchase order is voided, it means it's not a valid document, right? So, in general, voided documents might not be relevant for testing the controls over approved purchases because they weren't actually executed.\n\nHowever, depending on why they were voided, they might still provide some insight into the control environment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Represents office equipment ordered and never received.\n\nIf the purchase order was for office equipment that was ordered but never received, it might indicate an issue in the ordering process or with the vendor. From an audit perspective, it's important to understand why the equipment wasn't received. Maybe there was a problem with approval, or perhaps the order was placed incorrectly. In this case, reviewing this voided purchase order could provide insights into the effectiveness of the approval process. Therefore, the auditor might want to include it in the sample to investigate the reason for non-receipt.\n\nB. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business.\n\nIf the purchase order was properly voided as part of standard business practices, it suggests that the entity has a process for voiding unnecessary or erroneous purchase orders. This could be a normal part of operations, and such voided purchase orders might not necessarily indicate any control deficiencies. In this case, replacing the voided purchase order with another one might be appropriate because the voided one doesn't represent a transaction that was intended to occur.\n\nC. Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor.\n\nHere, the purchase order was issued for office equipment, but it was canceled before the vendor processed it. This means that no transaction took place, and the purchase order was voided before any action was taken by the vendor. From an audit perspective, this might not be relevant for testing the approval process because the order was never executed. Therefore, replacing this voided purchase order with another one would be appropriate.\n\nD. Has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file.\n\nIf the purchase order has been electronically deleted, it raises questions about the completeness of the purchase order records. Deletes could potentially hide unauthorized transactions or errors. From an audit perspective, this could be a red flag, and the auditor might want to investigate why the purchase order was deleted. Therefore, including this voided purchase order in the sample for testing might be necessary to ensure that there are no underlying issues with the control environment.\n\nConsidering the above points, the auditor would ordinarily replace the voided purchase order with another one in cases where the voided purchase order does not provide relevant information for testing the approval process or where it's part of normal business practices.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Represents office equipment ordered and never received. \u2013 Auditor might want to investigate why it was never received, so may not replace it.\n\nB. Has been properly voided in the normal course of business. \u2013 Likely to replace it, as it doesn't represent a transaction that was intended to occur.\n\nC. Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor. \u2013 Similarly, since it was canceled before processing, it may not be relevant for testing approval controls, so likely to replace it.\n\nD. Has been electronically deleted from the purchase order file. \u2013 This could be a cause for concern, and the auditor might want to investigate further, so may not replace it.\n\nAmong these, options B and C seem similar in that they involve voided purchase orders that do not represent executed transactions. Therefore, the auditor would likely replace them with another purchase order.\n\nHowever, option B specifies that the purchase order has been \"properly voided in the normal course of business,\" which suggests that it was voided according to established procedures, whereas option C specifies that the order was canceled before being processed by the vendor.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be a more general case of voiding in the normal course of business, which could include scenarios like option C.\n\nBut to be precise, option C provides more specific information about the nature of the voided purchase order, indicating that it was canceled before processing.\n\nConsidering the context of testing approval controls for ordering office equipment, if a purchase order was canceled before being processed by the vendor, it might not be necessary to include it in the sample, as it doesn't represent a transaction that was approved and executed.\n\nTherefore, the auditor would ordinarily replace the voided purchase order with another one in this case.\n\nOption B also suggests replacing the voided purchase order, but option C is more specific.\n\nBetween B and C, option C seems to be a specific instance of option B, where the voiding is part of normal business practices because the order was canceled before processing.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is likely option C: Represents office equipment ordered and canceled before being processed by the vendor.\n\nThis aligns with the idea that if a purchase order was canceled before it was processed by the vendor, it doesn't represent a transaction that was approved and executed, and thus, it's appropriate to replace it with another purchase order for testing purposes.\n\nOption A, where the purchase order represents office equipment ordered but never received, might be more relevant for the auditor to investigate, as it could indicate issues with the ordering process or vendor reliability.\n\nOption D, where the purchase order has been electronically deleted, could be a red flag indicating potential manipulation or errors in the system, so the auditor might want to include it in the sample to investigate further.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
