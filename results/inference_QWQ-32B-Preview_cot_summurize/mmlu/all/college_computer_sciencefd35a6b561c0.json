                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a disk unit that uses a bit string to indicate whether tracks are occupied or vacant. It says that '0' denotes vacant and '1' denotes occupied. There's a 32-bit segment of this string with the hexadecimal value D4FE2003. I need to find the percentage of occupied tracks for the corresponding part of the disk, and choose the nearest percent from the options given: A. 12%, B. 25%, C. 38%, D. 44%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a hexadecimal value is and how it relates to binary, since the occupancy is represented in binary bits. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system, and each hexadecimal digit corresponds to four binary digits (bits). So, a 32-bit binary string can be represented by eight hexadecimal digits because 32 divided by 4 is 8.\n\nThe given hexadecimal value is D4FE2003. To find out how many tracks are occupied, I need to count the number of '1's in the binary representation of this hexadecimal value.\n\nLet me convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent:\n\nD -> 1101\n\n4 -> 0100\n\nF -> 1111\n\nE -> 1110\n\n2 -> 0010\n\n0 -> 0000\n\n0 -> 0000\n\n3 -> 0011\n\nSo, the complete 32-bit binary string is:\n\n1101 0100 1111 1110 0010 0000 0000 0011\n\nNow, I need to count the number of '1's in this string.\n\nLet's count them one by one:\n\n1101 -> 3 ones\n\n0100 -> 1 one\n\n1111 -> 4 ones\n\n1110 -> 3 ones\n\n0010 -> 1 one\n\n0000 -> 0 ones\n\n0000 -> 0 ones\n\n0011 -> 2 ones\n\nTotal number of ones = 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 14\n\nSo, there are 14 '1's in the 32-bit string, which means 14 tracks are occupied.\n\nTo find the percentage of occupied tracks, I'll use the formula:\n\nPercentage = (Number of occupied tracks / Total number of tracks) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPercentage = (14 / 32) * 100\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n14 divided by 32 is 0.4375\n\nMultiply by 100: 0.4375 * 100 = 43.75%\n\nNow, rounding to the nearest percent, 43.75% is closer to 44% than to 43%.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. 44%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the binary conversion from hexadecimal:\n\nD -> 1101 correct\n\n4 -> 0100 correct\n\nF -> 1111 correct\n\nE -> 1110 correct\n\n2 -> 0010 correct\n\n0 -> 0000 correct\n\n0 -> 0000 correct\n\n3 -> 0011 correct\n\nTotal bits: 32, correct.\n\nCounting the number of '1's:\n\n1101: 3\n\n0100: 1\n\n1111: 4\n\n1110: 3\n\n0010: 1\n\n0000: 0\n\n0000: 0\n\n0011: 2\n\nSum: 3+1+4+3+1+0+0+2=14, correct.\n\nPercentage: (14/32)*100 = 43.75%, which rounds to 44%, correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
