                    "text": "Let's see what's going on here. So, this husband and wife have been going to the same hotel for 20 years during the first week of July, and they always stay in the most luxurious suite. On March 1, the husband sent a letter to the hotel reserving the suite for this year's trip. The hotel sent back a confirmation notice saying that they have reserved the suite for them for $25,000 per week.\n\nBut when they arrived on July 1, the hotel told them that they had rented the suite to another couple and couldn't honor their reservation. The manager was apologetic and offered them another suite that was pretty nice but not as luxurious, for $20,000 per week. The husband and wife were upset and decided to stay at another hotel instead, paying $25,000 for their most luxurious suite.\n\nNow, they're thinking about suing the first hotel for breaching the contract. We need to figure out what's most likely to happen in this situation.\n\nFirst, let's think about whether there was a valid contract between the husband and wife and the hotel. The husband sent a letter reserving the suite, and the hotel sent back a confirmation notice accepting the reservation and specifying the cost. That sounds like a valid contract to me.\n\nSo, the hotel breached the contract by giving their suite to someone else. Now, the question is, what damages can the husband and wife claim?\n\nOption A says they will prevail because the hotel knew about their 20-year history of staying in the most luxurious suite. While that might be relevant to show the hotel's knowledge of their preferences, I don't think it directly affects the legal outcome in terms of breach of contract.\n\nOption B says they will prevail because the substitute accommodations offered by the hotel were not comparable to the suite they reserved. Hmm, that seems plausible. If the hotel couldn't provide the suite they reserved, they should have offered something comparable, and if they didn't, that could be considered a material breach.\n\nOption C says they won't prevail because the hotel offered substitute accommodations at a $5,000 savings. But wait, the substitute was $20,000, and the original was $25,000, so they were offering a suite for $5,000 less. But the problem is that the suite wasn't comparable in luxury. So, saving money might not be enough if the quality is significantly different.\n\nOption D says they won't prevail because they didn't suffer any legal damages since they rented a comparable suite at another hotel for the same price. But is that really true? They had a contract with the first hotel, and now they had to find another hotel at the same price. Maybe they preferred the first hotel for some reason, or there are other factors.\n\nLet me think about damages in contract law. When a party breaches a contract, the other party can seek damages to put them in the same position they would have been in if the contract had been performed.\n\nIn this case, the husband and wife wanted the luxurious suite at the first hotel. The hotel breached by giving it to someone else. They then went to another hotel and paid the same amount for a similar suite. So, on the surface, it seems like they didn't lose any money because they paid the same amount.\n\nBut perhaps there are other considerations. Maybe the first hotel's suite was uniquely important to them, or maybe there are other costs associated with switching hotels. Also, perhaps they expected a certain level of service or amenities that the second hotel didn't provide.\n\nLooking back at option B, it seems like the key issue is that the substitute offered by the hotel wasn't comparable. If the hotel had offered a comparable suite, maybe they wouldn't have sued. But since the suite was less luxurious, even if it was cheaper, it might not have met their expectations or needs.\n\nMoreover, when a breaching party offers a substitute performance that isn't equivalent, the non-breaching party may reject it and seek damages for the breach.\n\nIn this scenario, the husband and wife rejected the substitute accommodation because it wasn't comparable, and they had a valid reason to do so.\n\nTherefore, it seems like they should be able to sue for damages resulting from the hotel's breach.\n\nNow, what damages could they claim? They paid $25,000 at another hotel, the same as the original reservation. So, perhaps they don't have any out-of-pocket loss. But maybe they can claim the difference between what they paid and the value of the accommodation they would have received if the hotel had honored the original reservation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they can claim consequential damages if there were other costs associated with switching hotels.\n\nBut based on the information given, it seems like they didn't incur any additional costs; they just had to stay at a different hotel for the same price.\n\nGiven that, maybe the court wouldn't find that they suffered any actual damages, and thus they wouldn't prevail in their lawsuit.\n\nWait, but option D says they won't prevail because they sustained no legal damages in renting a comparable suite at another hotel for the same rental. That seems to align with what I'm thinking.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because they did go through the inconvenience of finding another hotel and moving their plans. Maybe that could be considered damages, but in law, nominal damages might be awarded in such cases.\n\nBut I think the key here is that they didn't suffer any financial loss; they paid the same amount as they would have at the first hotel.\n\nTherefore, most likely, they won't prevail in their lawsuit because they didn't sustain any legal damages.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
