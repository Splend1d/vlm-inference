Price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good. It's calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nGenerally, goods that have many substitutes, are not necessities, and consume a large portion of the consumer's budget tend to have more elastic demand. On the other hand, goods that are necessities, have few or no substitutes, and\u5360\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u6c42\u5f39\u6027\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Water: Water is a basic necessity for life. Most people need it regardless of its price, especially for drinking and sanitation. While there might be substitutes like bottled water or other beverages, tap water is often the primary source and is difficult to replace entirely. Therefore, the demand for water is likely to be inelastic.\n\nB. Bread: Bread is a staple food in many cultures and is considered a necessity by many. However, it has some substitutes like other grains or breakfast cereals. The necessity of bread varies across different regions and dietary habits. In some places, it might be more elastic than in others.\n\nC. Salt: Salt is another essential commodity used in cooking and preserving food. It's a basic ingredient in many dishes and has few substitutes. While there might be alternatives like herbs and spices to flavor food, salt is unique in its ability to preserve food. Therefore, the demand for salt is likely to be inelastic.\n\nD. Pork: Pork is a type of meat and is considered a luxury or discretionary good in some economies, especially in comparison to basic staples like water and salt. It has substitutes such as other meats (beef, chicken, fish) and vegetarian options. The demand for pork is likely to be more elastic because consumers can switch to alternative protein sources if the price increases.\n\nConsidering these factors, pork (option D) is likely to have the most elastic demand among the options provided because it is a discretionary good with several substitutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
