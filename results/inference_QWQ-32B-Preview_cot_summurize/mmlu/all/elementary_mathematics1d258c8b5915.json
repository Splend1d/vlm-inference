                    "text": "To estimate the product of 4,286 and 390, I need to find the closest option among A. 12,000,000; B. 1,600,000; C. 1,200,000; and D. 16,000. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I should round each number to make the multiplication easier. For 4,286, it's close to 4,000, and for 390, it's close to 400. So, multiplying 4,000 by 400 would give me 1,600,000. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this is the best estimate. Maybe I should consider the actual values a bit more accurately. 4,286 is a bit more than 4,000, and 390 is a bit less than 400. So, my estimate of 1,600,000 might be a little high.\n\nLet me try another approach. What if I round 4,286 to 4,300 and 390 to 390, since 390 is already a round number? Multiplying 4,300 by 390. Hmm, that might be a bit more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the exact multiplication, but that might be too time-consuming for an estimation problem. Let's stick with rounding.\n\nSo, 4,000 times 400 is 1,600,000. Now, looking at the options, we have A. 12,000,000; B. 1,600,000; C. 1,200,000; and D. 16,000. Option B matches my estimate.\n\nBut let's double-check. Is there a chance that the actual product is closer to another option? Let's see, perhaps I should consider the difference between my rounded numbers and the actual numbers.\n\n4,286 is 286 more than 4,000, and 390 is 10 less than 400. So, the difference would be 286 times 390 plus 4,000 times (-10), which is 4,000 times -10 equals -40,000, and 286 times 390 is roughly 286 times 400, which is 114,400, minus 286 times 10, which is 2,860, so 114,400 minus 2,860 is about 111,540. Then, 1,600,000 minus 40,000 plus 111,540 is 1,600,000 minus 40,000 is 1,560,000, plus 111,540 is approximately 1,671,540.\n\nWait, that seems complicated for an estimation. Maybe I shouldn't have gone into such detail.\n\nLet me try a different method. I can think in terms of orders of magnitude. 4,286 is in the thousands, and 390 is in the hundreds. So, thousands times hundreds should give me millions. Specifically, since 1,000 times 1,000 is 1,000,000, and 4 times 1,000 is 4,000, and 4 times 1,000 is 4,000, but wait, that's not helping.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider that 4,286 is approximately 4.3 times 1,000, and 390 is approximately 0.39 times 1,000. So, 4.3 times 0.39 is about 1.677, and then times 1,000 times 1,000 is 1,677,000. That still seems close to 1,600,000.\n\nLooking back at the options, 1,600,000 is option B, and 1,200,000 is option C. The difference between these two is 400,000, which seems significant compared to my earlier calculation of around 1,677,000.\n\nMoreover, option A is 12,000,000, which would require one of the numbers to be much larger, and option D is 16,000, which is too small because even 4,000 times 4 is 16,000, and 390 is much larger than 4.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate should be around 1,600,000, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
