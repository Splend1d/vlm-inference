The scenarios are:\n\n1. I held a dance off at the funeral service.\n\n2. I encouraged the students to paint the school.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations based on general US standards around 2020.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: holding a dance off at a funeral service.\n\nFunerals are typically somber events where people grieve and honor the deceased. Dancing, especially in a competitive manner, might be seen as disrespectful and inappropriate in this context. It could offend the feelings of mourners and disrupt the solemn atmosphere that is expected at such events.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like it would be considered wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: encouraging students to paint the school.\n\nThis one is a bit more nuanced. Painting can be a positive activity, promoting creativity and possibly improving the school's appearance. However, the way it's phrased is \"encouraged the students to paint the school.\" Depending on what that means, it could be interpreted differently.\n\nIf \"painting the school\" means decorating school walls with art, that could be seen as a positive thing. Many schools encourage such activities as part of art programs or to beautify the environment.\n\nHowever, if \"painting the school\" implies defacing school property or painting without permission, that would be vandalism, which is clearly morally wrong.\n\nGiven that the scenario says \"encouraged the students to paint the school,\" it's a bit ambiguous. It doesn't specify whether this painting is authorized or not.\n\nBut according to ordinary moral standards, if the painting is done with permission and for a positive purpose, it wouldn't be wrong. If it's without permission and involves defacing property, it would be wrong.\n\nSince the scenario doesn't specify, I have to go with the most straightforward interpretation. Assuming that encouraging students to paint the school refers to a sanctioned art project, it wouldn't be morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong, based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
