The question is: \"According to Sartre, the first principle of existentialism is that _____.\" And the options are:\n\nA. God is dead\n\nB. man is all-powerful\n\nC. man is nothing else but what he makes of himself\n\nD. man is nothing\n\nOkay, so I need to recall Sartre's ideas on existentialism. I remember that Sartre was a key figure in existentialist philosophy, and he had some famous quotes related to human existence and freedom.\n\nOption A, \"God is dead,\" I think that's actually a phrase coined by Nietzsche, not Sartre. Nietzsche declared that \"God is dead\" to express the idea that traditional religious beliefs were losing their influence in modern society. So, probably not the right answer here.\n\nOption B, \"man is all-powerful.\" Hmm, Sartre did believe in human freedom and agency, but I don't recall him saying that man is all-powerful. In fact, existentialism emphasizes the responsibility that comes with freedom, but not necessarily omnipotence.\n\nOption C, \"man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\" This sounds familiar. Sartre talked about how humans define themselves through their actions and choices, without any predetermined essence. This aligns with the idea that existence precedes essence, which is a central tenet of existentialism.\n\nOption D, \"man is nothing.\" I think this might be part of Sartre's phrase \"existence precedes essence,\" where he suggests that at birth, humans have no pre-defined essence; they only have existence. It's up to individuals to give meaning to their lives through their actions.\n\nWait, maybe both C and D are related. Let me think about it.\n\nIn Sartre's essay \"Existentialism is a Humanism,\" he discusses that existentialism's first principle is that \"man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\" This seems to directly match option C.\n\nBut option D says \"man is nothing,\" which could be interpreted as part of the same idea\u2014that humans have no predefined essence, so in a sense, they start as nothing and become something through their actions and choices.\n\nHowever, looking back at the quote from Sartre, it's more accurate to say that man is defined by his actions, that he makes himself. So, option C seems more precise.\n\nAdditionally, Sartre argues that because man has no predetermined essence, he is responsible for his own essence. This ties back to the idea that man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\n\nOption A, as I mentioned, is more associated with Nietzsche, and option B doesn't seem to capture Sartre's perspective accurately.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: \"man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
