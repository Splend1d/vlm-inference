Protist.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which of these options is considered part of the nekton.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what nekton refers to. I think nekton are the group of aquatic animals that can swim actively in the water column, right? So, they're not just drifting along with the currents like plankton do. Plankton are passively moving with the water, whereas nekton can control their movement.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Whale - Whales are large marine mammals that swim through the ocean. They definitely can move actively in the water, so I think they would be considered nekton.\n\nB. Barnacle - Barnacles are interesting because they start out as planktonic larvae, but as they mature, they attach themselves to surfaces and become sessile, meaning they don't move around. So, in their adult form, they're more like flora or fixed structures in the ocean, not actively swimming. So, probably not nekton.\n\nC. Cyanobacterium - Cyanobacteria are single-celled organisms, often referred to as blue-green algae, although they're not actually algae. They can be part of the plankton, especially the phytoplankton, which are the plant-like plankton that perform photosynthesis. But I don't think they actively swim; they mostly drift with the water currents. So, likely not nekton.\n\nD. Protist - Protists are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that don't fit into the other kingdoms like plants, animals, or fungi. They can include things like algae and protozoa. Some protists are motile, meaning they can move on their own, but many are planktonic and drift with the currents. So, unless specified that they're actively swimming, I wouldn't classify them as nekton.\n\nBased on this, it seems like the whale is the only organism in the list that actively swims and can control its movement in the water column, which fits the definition of nekton.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check what nekton exactly includes. I recall that nekton consists of fish, marine mammals like whales and dolphins, and larger crustaceans like shrimp and crabs that can swim actively. So, yeah, whales definitely qualify.\n\nBarnacles, as I thought, are more of a benthic organism, attached to surfaces, so they're not nekton.\n\nCyanobacteria are typically planktonic, and protists can be either planktonic or motile, but generally not considered nekton.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. Whale.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
