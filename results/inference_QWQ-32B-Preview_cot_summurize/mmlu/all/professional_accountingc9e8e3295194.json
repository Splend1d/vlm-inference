                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about what an external auditor should consider when assessing an internal auditor's competence. So, the options are:\n\nA. The reporting status of the internal auditor within the organization.\n\nB. The educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor.\n\nC. Whether policies prohibit the internal auditor from auditing areas where relatives are employed.\n\nD. Whether the board of directors, audit committee, or owner-manager oversees employment decisions related to the internal auditor.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what competence means in this context. Competence, when it comes to internal auditors, generally refers to their ability to perform their duties effectively, which includes having the right skills, knowledge, and experience. So, an external auditor would want to make sure that the internal auditor is capable of doing their job properly, especially since the external auditor might rely on some of the internal auditor's work.\n\nOption A is about the reporting status of the internal auditor. This could mean where in the organizational hierarchy the internal auditor reports. For example, does he report directly to the board, the audit committee, or maybe to the CFO? The reporting lines can affect the independence and objectivity of the internal auditor. While independence is important, the question is specifically about competence, which is more about capability and skills. So, reporting status might influence independence but not necessarily competence directly. Maybe not the best choice here.\n\nOption B talks about the educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor. This seems directly related to competence. Educational background can indicate the theoretical knowledge they have, and professional experience shows how they've applied that knowledge in real-world situations. So, this seems like a solid factor to consider when assessing competence.\n\nOption C is about whether there are policies that prevent internal auditors from auditing areas where their relatives are employed. This seems more related to independence and objectivity, as having a family member in a certain area could create a conflict of interest. While it's important for an internal auditor to be independent, this is more about their personal relationships rather than their professional capabilities. So, it might not directly relate to competence.\n\nOption D is about who oversees employment decisions related to the internal auditor, such as the board of directors, audit committee, or owner-manager. This could influence the internal auditor's independence and the perceived objectivity of their work. However, again, it's more about the governance and oversight of the internal audit function rather than the internal auditor's personal competence.\n\nComparing all these options, option B stands out as the most directly related to competence, as it deals with the internal auditor's education and experience, which are key factors in determining their ability to perform their duties effectively.\n\nBut let's double-check. Maybe there's a way that other options could indirectly affect competence. For example, if the internal auditor reports to a high level in the organization, like the board, maybe that indicates that the organization values the internal audit function and provides better resources, including hiring more competent internal auditors. However, this is somewhat speculative, and it's not as direct as looking at the individual's education and experience.\n\nSimilarly, option C's policies on conflicts of interest might ensure that the internal auditor is not assigned to areas where their judgment could be impaired, but again, this is more about maintaining independence rather than ensuring competence.\n\nOption D, regarding who oversees employment decisions, could indicate the level of\u91cd\u89c6 placed on the internal audit function. If the board or audit committee is involved in hiring and firing decisions, that might suggest that the organization values the internal audit function and hires competent individuals. But again, this is indirect, and it's not as precise as looking at the individual's qualifications.\n\nTherefore, I believe that option B is the most appropriate answer. The external auditor should obtain updated information about the educational level and professional experiences of the internal auditor when assessing their competence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
