                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the mass of a starting material that remains after a certain time in a first-order reaction. The specific rate constant \\( k \\) is given as 86 h\\(^{-1}\\), and we have a 0.0500 g sample that reacts over 58 seconds. Our goal is to find out how much of this sample remains after that time.\n\nFirst, let's recall the integrated rate law for a first-order reaction. The integrated rate law relates the concentration of a reactant at time \\( t \\) to its initial concentration and the rate constant \\( k \\). For a first-order reaction, the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0} \\right) = -kt\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\([A]_t\\) is the concentration of the reactant at time \\( t \\),\n- \\([A]_0\\) is the initial concentration of the reactant,\n- \\( k \\) is the rate constant,\n- \\( t \\) is the time.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are dealing with masses instead of concentrations. Since the reaction is first-order and assuming the volume remains constant, the concentration is directly proportional to the mass. Therefore, we can modify the equation to work with masses:\n\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{m_0} \\right) = -kt\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( m_t \\) is the mass of the reactant at time \\( t \\),\n- \\( m_0 \\) is the initial mass of the reactant.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( m_0 = 0.0500 \\) g,\n- \\( k = 86 \\) h\\(^{-1}\\),\n- \\( t = 58 \\) s.\n\nBefore plugging in the values, we need to ensure that the units are consistent. The rate constant \\( k \\) is given in hours\\(^{-1}\\), while the time \\( t \\) is in seconds. We need to convert either \\( k \\) to seconds\\(^{-1}\\) or \\( t \\) to hours.\n\nLet's convert \\( t \\) from seconds to hours.\n\nThere are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ hour} = 60 \\times 60 = 3600 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, to convert 58 seconds to hours:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{58}{3600} \\text{ hours} \\approx 0.01611 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the integrated rate law equation:\n\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} \\right) = - (86 \\text{ h}^{-1}) \\times (0.01611 \\text{ h})\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the right-hand side:\n\n\\[\n-86 \\times 0.01611 \\approx -1.38546\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{m_t}{0.0500} \\right) \\approx -1.38546\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( m_t \\), we need to exponentiate both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m_t}{0.0500} = e^{-1.38546}\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\( e^{-1.38546} \\):\n\n\\[\ne^{-1.38546} \\approx 0.25\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m_t}{0.0500} = 0.25\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( m_t \\):\n\n\\[\nm_t = 0.25 \\times 0.0500 = 0.0125 \\text{ g}\n\\]\n\nSo, the mass of the starting material that remains after 58 seconds is approximately 0.0125 g.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.0500 g\n\nB. 0.0250 g\n\nC. 0.0125 g\n\nD. 0.00625 g\n\nThe correct answer is C. 0.0125 g.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
