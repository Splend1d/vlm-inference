                    "text": "To solve this problem, we can use the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity. When a rock is dropped off a cliff, it starts from rest and accelerates downward due to gravity until it hits the ground.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial velocity, \\( u = 0 \\) m/s (since it's dropped)\n- Final velocity, \\( v = 30 \\) m/s\n- Acceleration due to gravity, \\( g = 9.8 \\) m/s\u00b2 (we'll use this standard value, but if a different value is provided in the problem, use that instead)\n\nWe need to find the height of the cliff, which is the distance the rock falls, \\( s \\).\n\nWe can use the equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement:\n\n\\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = g \\), since the rock is falling downward under gravity.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[ (30)^2 = (0)^2 + 2 \\times 9.8 \\times s \\]\n\n\\[ 900 = 0 + 19.6s \\]\n\n\\[ 900 = 19.6s \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{900}{19.6} \\]\n\n\\[ s \\approx 45.92 \\] meters\n\nRounding to the nearest whole number, \\( s \\approx 46 \\) meters. However, since the options provided are in multiples of 15 meters, it seems there might be a discrepancy.\n\nLet's double-check the calculation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use another equation of motion to verify:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{v - u}{a} \\times t \\]\n\nBut we don't know the time, \\( t \\), so this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps we can use the equation:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{v^2 - u^2}{2a} \\]\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the kinematic equation:\n\n\\[ s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\n\nBut again, without time, this might not help directly.\n\nLet's try to find the time first.\n\nUsing \\( v = u + at \\):\n\n\\[ 30 = 0 + 9.8t \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{30}{9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ t \\approx 3.06 \\] seconds\n\nNow, plug this time back into the displacement equation:\n\n\\[ s = ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 0 \\times 3.06 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9.8 \\times (3.06)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ s = 0 + 4.9 \\times 9.3636 \\]\n\n\\[ s \\approx 45.88 \\] meters\n\nAgain, we get approximately 45.88 meters, which rounds to 46 meters.\n\nHowever, the options provided are:\n\nA. 20 m\nB. 30 m\nC. 45 m\nD. 60 m\n\nGiven that 45.88 m is closest to 45 m, perhaps the answer is C. 45 m.\n\nBut let's consider if we can use a different approach or if there's a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider \\( g = 10 \\) m/s\u00b2 for simplicity:\n\n\\[ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \\]\n\n\\[ 30^2 = 0 + 2 \\times 10 \\times s \\]\n\n\\[ 900 = 20s \\]\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{900}{20} = 45 \\] meters\n\nThis matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the height of the cliff is 45 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45 \\text{ m}} \\]\n\n**Option C**"
