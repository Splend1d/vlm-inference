                    "text": "So, Jacques, Hedwig, and Reyes are looking to start a business and they want to raise capital by selling equity shares to the public. They're trying to decide which business structure to choose from the options: LLC, PC, Corporation, or LLP. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these business structures entails and which one allows for selling equity shares to the public.\n\n1. **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**: An LLC offers personal asset protection and flexibility in management. It can be member-managed or manager-managed. LLCs are popular for small businesses because they offer pass-through taxation, meaning the company's income is taxed directly to the owners rather than at the company level. However, LLCs typically do not issue shares of stock; instead, ownership is based on membership interests.\n\n2. **PC (Professional Corporation)**: This is a type of corporation designed for licensed professionals, like doctors, lawyers, or accountants. It provides limited liability protection and allows professionals to practice together under one entity. Like other corporations, PC can issue shares, but there might be restrictions based on the profession and state laws.\n\n3. **Corporation**: A corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners, who are shareholders. Corporations can issue shares of stock to raise capital, which can be sold to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) if certain requirements are met. Corporations offer limited liability protection, and their ownership is easily transferable through the sale of shares.\n\n4. **LLP (Limited Liability Partnership)**: An LLP is a type of partnership that provides limited liability protection to its partners. It's commonly used by professionals who require limited liability but prefer the flexibility and tax structure of a partnership. LLPs do not issue shares; ownership is based on partnership interests.\n\nGiven that Jacques, Hedwig, and Reyes want to raise capital by selling equity shares to the public, the structure that allows for this is a Corporation. Specifically, they would need to form a corporation and then conduct an initial public offering (IPO) to sell shares to the public.\n\nLLCs and LLPs typically do not issue shares, so those options are not suitable for their goal. A PC could issue shares, but it's restricted to certain professions, and it might not be the most appropriate choice unless they are licensed professionals.\n\nTherefore, the best option for them to raise capital by selling equity shares to the public is to form a Corporation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
