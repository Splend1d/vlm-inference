Are a form of food intolerance\n\nC. Usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure\n\nD. Are uncomfortable but generally of little medical concern\n\nFirst, I need to understand what food allergies are. I know that food allergies are when your immune system reacts to certain foods as if they're harmful, even if they're not. So, it's different from food intolerance, which is more about having difficulty digesting certain foods.\n\nOption B says that food allergies are a form of food intolerance. But I think that's not correct because, as I just said, allergies involve the immune system, while intolerance is about digestion.\n\nOption A mentions that allergies are avoidable if allergic agents don't exceed specified limits. Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I think even a small amount of an allergen can cause a reaction in some people, especially those with severe allergies like peanut allergy. So, maybe this isn't accurate.\n\nOption C says that allergies usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure. That sounds familiar. I think the first time you're exposed to an allergen, your immune system learns to recognize it, and then upon subsequent exposures, it mounts an immune response. So, maybe this is correct.\n\nOption D says that allergies are uncomfortable but generally of little medical concern. I don't think that's right because food allergies can be serious and even life-threatening in some cases, like with anaphylaxis.\n\nSo, based on what I know, option C seems to be the most accurate. Allergies typically develop after initial exposure to the allergen, which sensitizes the immune system.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nOption A: I recall that for some allergies, there are thresholds\u2014levels below which the allergen won't cause a reaction. But for many people, especially those with severe allergies, even trace amounts can be problematic. So, it's not always about exceeding specified limits.\n\nOption B: Definitely not, as allergies and intolerance are different things.\n\nOption C: Yeah, this makes sense. You need to be sensitized first before having an allergic reaction.\n\nOption D: This is misleading because allergies can be medically significant and dangerous.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: Usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
