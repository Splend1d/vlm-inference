She's recording their ideas on a large sheet of chart paper, and while doing so, she's focusing on some early literacy skills. We need to choose the most appropriate focus for these young children from the given options.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age of the children. Three-year-olds are very early in their literacy development. They are just beginning to understand that letters represent sounds and that words are made up of these letters. They might be starting to recognize some letters and maybe even some simple words, but their reading and writing skills are still nascent.\n\nOption A is \"Paraphrasing ideas.\" Paraphrasing involves restating someone else's ideas in your own words. While this is an important skill, it's probably a bit advanced for 3-year-olds. At this age, children are still learning to express their own thoughts clearly, and paraphrasing requires a higher level of language comprehension and expression.\n\nOption B is \"Spelling words correctly.\" Correct spelling is certainly important, but for 3-year-olds, it's not the most appropriate focus. At this stage, children are just beginning to understand that letters make sounds and that these sounds combine to make words. Expecting them to spell words correctly would be too challenging and might even discourage them from trying to write or express themselves.\n\nOption C is \"Expressing speech in print.\" This seems more suitable for 3-year-olds. Expressing speech in print means translating spoken words into written form. This is a fundamental literacy skill that involves understanding that what we say can be written down and read later. For young children, this could be as simple as drawing pictures and scribbling, which are early forms of writing. As they grow, their scribbles might start to look like letters, and eventually, they'll write actual words.\n\nOption D is \"Capitalizing proper nouns.\" Capitalization is an aspect of writing, but it's a more advanced concept for 3-year-olds. Understanding when to capitalize letters, especially proper nouns like names, requires a grasp of grammar rules, which is beyond the capabilities of most 3-year-olds.\n\nConsidering all this, the most appropriate focus for 3-year-old students in this scenario would be \"Expressing speech in print.\" This aligns with their developmental stage and helps lay the foundation for future literacy skills.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
