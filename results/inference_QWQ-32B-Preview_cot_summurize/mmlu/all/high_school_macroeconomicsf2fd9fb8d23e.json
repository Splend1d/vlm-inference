                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"The tax multiplier increases in magnitude when...\" and gives four options: A. the MPS increases, B. the spending multiplier falls, C. the MPC increases, D. government spending increases.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the tax multiplier is. I remember that the tax multiplier shows how much income changes in response to a change in taxes. In macroeconomics, taxes affect disposable income, which in turn affects consumption and overall economic activity.\n\nThe formula for the tax multiplier is usually given as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = -\\frac{MPC}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nWhere MPC is the marginal propensity to consume, which is the fraction of additional income that is spent on consumption.\n\nSo, the tax multiplier is negative because an increase in taxes leads to a decrease in disposable income, which leads to a decrease in consumption and, therefore, a decrease in overall income.\n\nNow, the question is about the magnitude of the tax multiplier increasing. Magnitude means the size of the number, regardless of its sign. So, if the tax multiplier becomes more negative, its magnitude increases.\n\nLooking at the formula, if MPC increases, the numerator increases, and the denominator decreases (since 1 - MPC gets smaller), which would make the entire fraction larger in magnitude (more negative).\n\nLet's test this. Suppose MPC is 0.8:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = -\\frac{0.8}{1 - 0.8} = -\\frac{0.8}{0.2} = -4 \\]\n\nNow, if MPC increases to 0.9:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tax Multiplier} = -\\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.9} = -\\frac{0.9}{0.1} = -9 \\]\n\nSo, as MPC increases, the tax multiplier becomes more negative, meaning its magnitude increases.\n\nOption C says \"the MPC increases,\" which aligns with what I just found.\n\nNow, let's quickly check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A: \"the MPS increases.\" MPS is the marginal propensity to save, which is 1 - MPC. If MPS increases, MPC decreases because more income is being saved and less is being spent. From the formula, if MPC decreases, the numerator gets smaller, and the denominator gets larger, making the tax multiplier less negative in magnitude. So, this is the opposite of what the question is asking.\n\nOption B: \"the spending multiplier falls.\" The spending multiplier is usually given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 - MPC} \\]\n\nSo, if MPC increases, the spending multiplier increases because the denominator gets smaller. Therefore, if the spending multiplier falls, MPC must be decreasing. Again, this would decrease the magnitude of the tax multiplier, opposite to what's being asked.\n\nOption D: \"government spending increases.\" Government spending affects the spending multiplier, but it doesn't directly affect the tax multiplier's magnitude based on the formula I recall. So, this seems unrelated to the magnitude of the tax multiplier.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C, \"the MPC increases.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]\n\n"
