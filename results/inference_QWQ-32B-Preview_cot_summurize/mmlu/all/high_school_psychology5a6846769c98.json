                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which parenting style likely contributed to Carlotta being a well-adjusted and socially competent adolescent. The options are minimal supervision, permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative. I think I need to understand what each of these styles entails and how they might affect a child's development.\n\nFirst, minimal supervision sounds like parents who don't really keep track of what their child is doing or provide much guidance. That probably wouldn't lead to a well-adjusted teenager, right? Kids need some structure and guidance to learn social skills and manage their behavior.\n\nPermissive parenting seems like parents who don't set many rules or boundaries but are still involved in their child's life. They might be loving but lenient. I imagine that could lead to some issues with discipline and understanding limits, which might not foster the best social competence.\n\nAuthoritarian parenting is where parents are very strict and demanding, but maybe not so warm or responsive. This style might produce children who are good at following rules but perhaps lack social skills or the ability to think for themselves.\n\nThen there's authoritative parenting, which seems like a balance between being demanding and responsive. Parents set clear expectations and rules but also encourage open communication and consider their child's feelings. This style is often associated with positive outcomes in children's social and emotional development.\n\nGiven that Carlotta is well-adjusted and socially competent, I think the authoritative parenting style makes the most sense. It provides the structure and guidance she needs while also allowing her to develop independence and social skills.\n\nSo, I'm going to go with D. Authoritative.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
