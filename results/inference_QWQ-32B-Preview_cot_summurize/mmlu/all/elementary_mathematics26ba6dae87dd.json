                    "text": "So I need to figure out how many more books the Mills Library has compared to the Springvale Library. The numbers are pretty big, so I think estimating would be a good approach. The options are all in rounds numbers, like 100,000, 80,000, 10,000, and 8,000 books.\n\nFirst, I should look at the numbers given:\n\n- Mills Library: 1,007,199 books\n\n- Springvale Library: 907,082 books\n\nI need to find the difference between these two numbers. But since the question is asking for the best estimate, I don't need to calculate the exact difference; instead, I can round the numbers to make the calculation easier.\n\nLet's see, 1,007,199 is close to 1,000,000, and 907,082 is close to 900,000. If I subtract 900,000 from 1,000,000, I get 100,000. So, option A is 100,000 books.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check if rounding to the nearest hundred thousand is the best way. Let me look at the actual numbers more closely.\n\nMills Library has 1,007,199 books. If I round this to the nearest hundred thousand, it's 1,000,000.\n\nSpringvale Library has 907,082 books. Rounding this to the nearest hundred thousand would be 900,000.\n\nSo, 1,000,000 minus 900,000 is 100,000. That seems straightforward, and option A is 100,000 books.\n\nBut let's see if there's a more accurate way to estimate without doing the exact calculation.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at the differences in each place value. Starting from the left:\n\n- Millions place: 1 - 0 = 1\n\n- Hundred thousands place: 0 - 9, but since 1 is in the millions place, it's actually 10 - 9 = 1\n\n- Ten thousands place: 0 - 0 = 0\n\n- Thousands place: 7 - 7 = 0\n\n- Hundreds place: 1 - 0 = 1\n\n- Tens place: 9 - 8 = 1\n\n- Ones place: 9 - 2 = 7\n\nBut this seems too detailed and might not help with estimation.\n\nAlternatively, I can subtract the two numbers directly to find the exact difference and then see which option is closest.\n\nSo, let's do that:\n\n1,007,199\n\nminus 907,082\n\nLet's subtract:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n9 - 2 = 7\n\n9 - 8 = 1\n\n1 - 0 = 1\n\n7 - 7 = 0\n\n0 - 0 = 0\n\n0 - 0 = 0\n\n1 - 9: Since 1 is less than 9, I need to borrow from the left. The 1 in the millions place becomes 0, and the 0 in the hundred thousands place becomes 10. Then, 10 - 9 = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1,007,199\n\nminus 907,082\n\nequals 100,117 books.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 100,000 books\n\nB. 80,000 books\n\nC. 10,000 books\n\nD. 8,000 books\n\nThe exact difference is 100,117, which is very close to 100,000. So, option A seems to be the best estimate.\n\nBut let's double-check if another option could be closer.\n\nOption B is 80,000, which is significantly less than 100,000.\n\nOption C is 10,000, even smaller.\n\nOption D is 8,000, way smaller.\n\nSo, none of the other options are close to the actual difference.\n\nTherefore, the best estimate is indeed 100,000 books, which is option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
