I need to figure out which one of these has an absolute value that's bigger than 5.\n\nFirst off, I need to remember what absolute value means. Absolute value is basically the distance of a number from zero on the number line, without considering which direction from zero the number lies. So, it's always going to be a non-negative value. For example, the absolute value of both 5 and -5 is 5, because they're both 5 units away from zero.\n\nOkay, so I need to find which of these numbers is more than 5 units away from zero.\n\nLet's look at option A: -6. The absolute value of -6 is 6, because it's 6 units away from zero. 6 is greater than 5, so this could be a possible answer.\n\nOption B: -5. The absolute value of -5 is 5. That's exactly 5, but the question is asking for greater than 5. So, 5 is not greater than 5, it's equal to 5. Therefore, this doesn't satisfy the condition.\n\nOption C: 0. The absolute value of 0 is 0, which is less than 5. So, this doesn't meet the criteria.\n\nOption D: 5. The absolute value of 5 is 5, which again is equal to 5, not greater than 5.\n\nSo, based on this, only option A, which is -6, has an absolute value greater than 5.\n\nWait a minute, is there a chance that more than one option could satisfy this condition? Let's double-check.\n\nLooking back, -6 has an absolute value of 6, which is greater than 5. -5 has an absolute value of 5, which is not greater than 5. 0 has an absolute value of 0, which is less than 5. 5 has an absolute value of 5, which is equal to 5.\n\nSo, indeed, only -6 meets the condition of having an absolute value greater than 5.\n\nI think that's pretty straightforward. Absolute value is all about the distance from zero, regardless of direction, so positive and negative numbers can both have the same absolute value.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider if there's any trick here. The question is pretty straightforward, and it seems like there aren't any tricks involved. It's directly asking for the number with an absolute value greater than 5, and -6 is the only one that fits that criterion among the given options.\n\nSo, my final answer is A. -6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
