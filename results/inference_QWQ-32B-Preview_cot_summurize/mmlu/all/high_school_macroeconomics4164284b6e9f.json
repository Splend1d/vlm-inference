                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about supply-side economics. So, supply-side economics is all about stimulating production and supply in an economy, usually by providing incentives for businesses and investors. The idea is that by making it easier and more profitable for companies to produce goods and services, the overall economy will benefit through increased growth and jobs.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Increased government spending.\n\nThis is more aligned with Keynesian economics, which focuses on demand-side management. Keynesians believe that boosting government spending can stimulate demand and pull an economy out of a recession. However, supply-siders might not agree because they think that increased government spending can lead to higher taxes in the future or increased inflation, which could hinder economic growth.\n\nB. Higher tariffs on imported goods.\n\nTariffs are taxes on imported goods, and they can protect domestic industries from foreign competition. Some supply-siders might see this as a way to boost domestic production, but others might argue that tariffs can lead to trade wars and reduce efficiency by protecting inefficient domestic industries. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nC. Lower taxes on household income.\n\nThis seems like it could be attractive to supply-siders, but let's think about it. Lowering taxes on household income increases disposable income, which should boost consumer spending. That sounds more like a demand-side approach again, similar to Keynesian economics. While increased consumer spending is good, supply-siders might argue that it doesn't directly address the supply side of the economy, which is about production and investment.\n\nD. A tax credit on capital investment.\n\nThis one sounds really interesting from a supply-side perspective. A tax credit on capital investment means that businesses get a reduction in their tax liability when they invest in capital assets like machinery, equipment, or buildings. This directly incentivizes businesses to invest and expand their productive capacity, which is exactly what supply-side economics is all about.\n\nBy making capital investment more attractive through tax credits, businesses are encouraged to increase their production capabilities, which can lead to higher output, more jobs, and economic growth. This aligns well with the supply-side philosophy of focusing on production and investment as the drivers of economic health.\n\nComparing all the options, D seems to be the most directly aligned with supply-side economics principles. While lower taxes on household income might have some indirect benefits for supply, the direct impact on production and investment is stronger with a tax credit on capital investment.\n\nSo, my answer would be D. a tax credit on capital investment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
