The character asks their roommate to take the dog out to defecate. This seems like a reasonable request. Taking care of a dog often involves managing its waste, and asking a roommate for help with this task doesn't appear to be morally wrong. It's a common responsibility shared among roommates who agree to look after pets.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character secretly cuts the strings of someone's parachute. This action is potentially life-threatening and demonstrates a severe lack of concern for that person's safety. Such an act would generally be considered morally wrong because it endangers another person's life without their knowledge or consent.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nSo the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
