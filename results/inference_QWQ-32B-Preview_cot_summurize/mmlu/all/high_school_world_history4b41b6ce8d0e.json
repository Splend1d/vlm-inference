                    "text": "So I've got this passage from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam from the late third century C.E., and it's all about Kerdir and his role in promoting the Zoroastrian religion under different Sassanid kings. It talks about how Kerdir was given more authority and how he established fires and magi, which I guess are important in Zoroastrianism. Also, it mentions that other religions like Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism were \"smitten,\" which probably means they were suppressed or discouraged.\n\nNow, the question is about Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia, and it's asking which option best explains their presence there. Let's look at each choice:\n\nA. Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism inspired further followers.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit contradictory. If the Persians were trying to convert people away from Buddhism, why would that inspire further followers? Maybe I'm misunderstanding this option. Perhaps it's suggesting that the opposition to Buddhism made some people more attracted to it as a form of rebellion or something, but that doesn't seem likely. Maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nB. Buddhism's apocalyptic message swayed converts in Persia.\n\nI don't recall Buddhism having a strong apocalyptic message. Buddhism generally focuses on personal enlightenment and the cycle of rebirth, rather than end-times scenarios. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nC. Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India.\n\nThis makes sense because Persia was located along the Silk Road and other trade routes that connected Europe and the Mediterranean with India and China. So, it's likely that Buddhist traders and travelers passed through Persia and perhaps even settled there, bringing their religion with them.\n\nD. Buddhists were granted limited toleration by Zoroastrians.\n\nThe inscription seems to indicate that other religions were \"smitten,\" which suggests suppression rather than toleration. So, this option might not fit well with the information provided.\n\nConsidering these options, C seems the most plausible. Persia's position along trade routes would have exposed the region to various religions, including Buddhism, and allowed Buddhist communities to establish themselves. The other options don't align as well with what I know about Buddhism and the Sassanid Empire's religious policies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
