                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about the paradox of well-being. So, the paradox of well-being refers to a situation where we find high levels of happiness in groups of people who, based on conventional wisdom, shouldn't be very happy. The options given are:\n\nA. Unhappy people\n\nB. Older adults\n\nC. People with very low SES (socioeconomic status)\n\nD. Terminally ill people\n\nLet me think about each one.\n\nOption A, unhappy people: That seems contradictory. If people are unhappy, how can they have high levels of happiness? That doesn't make sense. So, probably not A.\n\nOption B, older adults: Now, older adults might have high levels of happiness despite facing challenges like health issues or retirement. There is some research that suggests that happiness can increase with age, so maybe B is a possible answer.\n\nOption C, people with very low SES: People with low socioeconomic status often face a lot of challenges like poverty, limited access to resources, and stress. However, there is research that shows that happiness can be relatively high in such populations, perhaps due to strong social support networks or different priorities. So, C could also be a possible answer.\n\nOption D, terminally ill people: This is another group that one might not expect to have high levels of happiness. Yet, there are stories and research indicating that some terminally ill individuals can find peace, acceptance, and even happiness in their situations. So, D is also a possible answer.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the paradox of well-being, which likely refers to a specific finding or phenomenon. I need to recall if there's a particular group among these that this paradox especially applies to.\n\nI think the paradox of well-being is most famously associated with older adults and how they can maintain or even increase their happiness despite aging and associated challenges. There's a concept called the \"happiness U-bend,\" where happiness tends to decrease in early adulthood and then rise again in later adulthood, forming a U-shape when plotted against age.\n\nAlso, research has shown that older adults often have better emotional regulation, more positive affect, and lower levels of negative emotions compared to younger adults. They may also have a more positive outlook on life and prioritize meaningful relationships and experiences over other goals.\n\nSimilarly, people with low SES might exhibit resilience and find happiness in non-material aspects of life, but the paradox seems more prominently associated with older adults.\n\nAs for terminally ill people, while they can find happiness, it might be more exceptional and not as widely studied or accepted as a general trend.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B. Older adults.\n\nBut to make sure, let me check if there's a specific paradox related to one of these options.\n\nI recall that the \"paradox of well-being\" might specifically refer to the finding that older adults report higher well-being than younger adults, despite facing more health problems and other age-related challenges. This is counterintuitive because one might expect that more health issues would lead to lower well-being. Hence, it's a paradox.\n\nAdditionally, research has shown that older adults tend to have more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions compared to younger adults. They also often report greater life satisfaction.\n\nSo, given this information, it seems that the paradox of well-being refers to the high levels of happiness and well-being reported by older adults despite their challenges.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Older adults.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
