Remaining a member of the community\n\nD. Both a and c\n\nFirst, I need to think about what I know about drug use in Asia and see which of these characteristics might apply.\n\nStarting with option A, strong family support. In many Asian cultures, family is very important and there's often a strong emphasis on collective well-being rather than individualism. So, it's possible that family support is a significant factor in dealing with drug addiction in Asia. But I'm not sure if this is universally true across all Asian countries.\n\nOption B says low failure rate for rehabilitation centers. I don't have specific statistics on rehabilitation success rates in Asia, but I do know that drug addiction is a significant problem in many Asian countries, and rehabilitation can be challenging anywhere in the world. So, I'm skeptical about this option.\n\nOption C, remaining a member of the community. Again, in many Asian societies, there's a strong sense of community and social cohesion. It's possible that even with drug addiction, individuals may still be accepted and supported by their communities, at least to some extent.\n\nOption D combines A and C, suggesting that both strong family support and remaining a member of the community are characteristics of injecting drug users in Asia.\n\nTo make an informed choice, I should consider the social and cultural contexts of Asia.\n\nFirst, Asia is a vast and diverse continent with many different cultures, economies, and social structures. What might be true in one country may not hold in another. However, there are some general trends that might apply across the region.\n\nFamily is highly valued in many Asian cultures. Filial piety and the importance of family ties are strong influences in societies like China, Japan, South Korea, and in many Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, it's plausible that family support is a significant factor in the lives of injecting drug users in Asia.\n\nRegarding remaining a member of the community, again, in collectivist societies, there may be more tolerance and support for individuals struggling with addiction, as opposed to individualist societies where personal responsibility is emphasized more heavily.\n\nOn the other hand, the stigma associated with drug use can also be significant in some Asian cultures, which might lead to ostracism or discrimination against drug users. So, it's a bit of a balancing act.\n\nOption B, about low failure rates in rehabilitation centers, is harder to assess without specific data. Rehabilitation success rates can vary widely depending on the quality of care, the approach used, and the support systems in place post-rehabilitation.\n\nGiven that, and considering the emphasis on family and community in many Asian cultures, I would lean towards option D, both a and c, as being characteristics of injecting drug users in Asia.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is a generalization, and realities on the ground can vary significantly. Some countries may have stronger family support systems than others, and the level of community acceptance can also differ.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the cultural tendencies in many Asian societies, it seems reasonable to select option D, both strong family support and remaining a member of the community, as characteristics of injecting drug users in Asia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
