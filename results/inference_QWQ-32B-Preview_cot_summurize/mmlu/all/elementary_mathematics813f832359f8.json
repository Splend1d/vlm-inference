                    "text": "So Carl baked a total of 18 pies last year. Out of those, he baked 6 pies for his family and some pies for each of the 4 school fund-raisers. The question is asking for the number of pies, p, he baked for each fund-raiser.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Total pies baked are 18. Out of these, 6 were for his family, and the rest were for 4 school fund-raisers, with each fund-raiser getting p pies.\n\nSo, the total pies for fund-raisers would be 4 times p, since there are 4 fund-raisers.\n\nNow, the total pies should be the sum of pies for family and pies for fund-raisers.\n\nSo, 6 (family) + 4p (fund-raisers) = 18 (total pies).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6 \u00d7 p \u2013 18 = 4\n\nB. 18 \u2013 6 \u00d7 p = 4\n\nC. 4 + 6 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nD. 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18\n\nHmm, option D looks like what I have: 6 + 4p = 18.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\n6 pies for family plus 4 times p pies for each fund-raiser equals total 18 pies. Yes, that matches.\n\nLet me see if the other options make sense.\n\nOption A: 6 times p minus 18 equals 4. That would be 6p - 18 = 4. Does that make sense? Not really, because 6p would be 6 times p, which isn't related directly to the total pies.\n\nOption B: 18 minus 6 times p equals 4. So, 18 - 6p = 4. Again, this doesn't align with the relationship we established.\n\nOption C: 4 plus 6 times p equals 18. That would be 4 + 6p = 18. But according to our earlier reasoning, it should be 6 + 4p = 18, because 6 pies for family plus 4p for fund-raisers equals total 18 pies.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nTotal pies = family pies + fund-raiser pies\n\nFamily pies = 6\n\nFund-raiser pies = 4 * p\n\nSo, 6 + 4p = 18.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I solve for p in this equation:\n\n6 + 4p = 18\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n\n4p = 12\n\nThen divide both sides by 4:\n\np = 3\n\nSo, Carl baked 3 pies for each fund-raiser.\n\nBut the question is not asking for the value of p, but for the number sentence that can be used to find p.\n\nFrom the options given, option D: 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18, matches the equation I came up with.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps if I rearrange the equation.\n\nFor example, 18 - 6 = 4p\n\nWhich simplifies to 12 = 4p, then p = 3.\n\nBut this isn't one of the options.\n\nOr, 4p = 18 - 6\n\nBut again, not an option.\n\nOption D seems to be the correct one.\n\nWait, maybe option C is 4 + 6p = 18, which is different from what we have.\n\nOur equation is 6 + 4p = 18.\n\nSo, option D is correct.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if p = 3 satisfies the equation.\n\n6 + 4*(3) = 6 + 12 = 18, which matches the total.\n\nIf I plug p = 3 into other options:\n\nOption A: 6*3 - 18 = 18 - 18 = 0, not equal to 4.\n\nOption B: 18 - 6*3 = 18 - 18 = 0, not equal to 4.\n\nOption C: 4 + 6*3 = 4 + 18 = 22, not equal to 18.\n\nOnly option D gives the correct total.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. 6 + 4 \u00d7 p = 18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
