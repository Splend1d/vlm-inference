The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I often sell used books online that I borrowed from the library.\n\nScenario 2: My rent was due, so I had to sell my friend's guitar without telling her.\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle Scenario 1 first. So, the person is borrowing books from the library and then selling them online. Hmm, libraries usually have rules about borrowing books, right? You're supposed to return them within a certain timeframe. Selling books that you borrowed might not be what the library expects. I think libraries own the books, and borrowing is just lending them to you temporarily. So, selling them without permission seems like it's going against the library's ownership. That might be considered morally wrong because it's misusing someone else's property.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: the person needed money for rent and sold their friend's guitar without telling her. This seems pretty straightforward. Using someone else's property without their consent is generally considered wrong. It's like stealing, right? Even if the intention was desperate, like needing money for rent, it doesn't justify taking someone else's thing and selling it. So, this also seems morally wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's think about Scenario 1 again. If the books were borrowed from the library, and the library allows borrowing, maybe selling them isn't directly harming anyone. I mean, the books are already published, so selling used books might not be that bad. But, actually, the library owns those books, and selling them without permission is probably against the library's rules. So, it's still misusing their property.\n\nIn Scenario 2, selling a friend's guitar without telling her is definitely invading her property rights. Trust is a big part of friendship, and handling someone's belongings without their knowledge breaches that trust. It's a clear moral wrongdoing.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve morally wrong actions. But maybe there's a difference in severity or context. In Scenario 1, it's about library books, which are meant to be returned. Selling them is clearly not the intended use. In Scenario 2, it's about a personal item belonging to a friend. Both are wrong, but perhaps in different ways.\n\nWait, maybe the first scenario isn't as bad because libraries are public institutions, and the books are meant for public use. But still, selling them is not the intended use. It's probably illegal, actually, because the library owns the books, and selling them without permission would be against the law.\n\nIn contrast, selling a friend's guitar without telling her is not only morally wrong but also probably illegal, as it's stealing.\n\nSo, both actions are wrong, but perhaps selling a friend's guitar is more\u4e25\u91cd because it involves a personal relationship and trust.\n\nBut according to the question, we need to determine which one is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nGiven that, I think both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. So, the answer should be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be considered.\n\nOption B is Wrong, Not wrong. That would mean Scenario 1 is wrong, but Scenario 2 is not. But selling a friend's guitar without telling her seems clearly wrong, so this option doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C is Not wrong, Wrong. That would suggest Scenario 1 is not wrong, but Scenario 2 is. But as we've discussed, Scenario 1 involves misusing library property, which is wrong.\n\nOption D is Not wrong, Not wrong. That would mean neither scenario involves morally wrong actions, which doesn't align with what we've concluded.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe there's a perspective where Scenario 1 isn't as wrong. For example, if the books were going to be discarded by the library anyway, and the person is giving them a second life by selling them. But even then, the library likely has procedures for disposing of books, and selling them personally would still be against their rules.\n\nMoreover, in 2020, there might be more leniency towards certain actions due to financial hardships, as in Scenario 2. But selling a friend's guitar without consent is still a clear violation of trust and property rights.\n\nSo, overall, both scenarios involve morally wrong actions, and the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
