                    "text": "So this is a case about a 22-year-old woman who has been experiencing urticaria, which is hives, for the first time. It's coming and going over the past week, and the history and physical exam don't show any other issues. We need to choose the most appropriate course of action from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's understand what urticaria is. Urticaria, or hives, is a common skin condition characterized by red, itchy, raised welts on the skin. It's often caused by an allergic reaction, but it can also be triggered by other factors like infections, heat, cold, stress, or physical irritation.\n\nSince this is her first episode and it's been resolving on its own, it might be acute urticaria, which typically lasts for less than six weeks. Acute urticaria is usually self-limiting and doesn't require extensive investigation unless there are underlying serious conditions or if it persists.\n\nOption A suggests determining the serum IgE concentration. IgE is an immunoglobulin that plays a key role in allergic reactions. Measuring serum IgE could help identify an allergic component, but in acute urticaria without other symptoms or signs of severe allergy, this might not be necessary immediately. It's more relevant in chronic cases or when there's suspicion of a specific allergy.\n\nOption B is to determine the total eosinophil count. Eosinophils are white blood cells that increase in response to allergies and parasitic infections. Checking eosinophil count could be useful if there's a suspicion of parasitic infection or in chronic urticaria to look for underlying causes. But for acute, self-limiting urticaria, this might be unnecessary.\n\nOption C is to refer her to an allergist. Allergists are specialists in allergies and immunology. Referral to a specialist might be appropriate if the urticaria is chronic, severe, or if there are other associated symptoms suggesting a systemic issue. However, for a first-time, acute episode that's resolving on its own, referral might be premature.\n\nOption D is to treat the symptoms. This seems like the most appropriate initial approach. For acute urticaria, symptomatic treatment with antihistamines is usually sufficient. Antihistamines help relieve itching and reduce the appearance of hives. If symptoms are mild, over-the-counter antihistamines might be enough. If they're more severe or not responding to initial treatment, then further evaluation might be needed.\n\nGiven that this is her first episode and there are no other abnormalities, starting with symptomatic treatment seems reasonable. If the urticaria persists beyond six weeks or if there are recurrent episodes, then further investigation, including possibly measuring IgE or eosinophil counts, or referral to a specialist, might be considered.\n\nSo, I think the most appropriate course of action is Option D: Treat the symptoms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
