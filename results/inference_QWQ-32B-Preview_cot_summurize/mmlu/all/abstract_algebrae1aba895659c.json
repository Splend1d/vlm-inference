An extension field of a field F is a field E that contains F as a subfield. So, for Q to be an extension field of Z_2, Z_2 must be a subfield of Q.\n\nZ_2 is the field with two elements, 0 and 1, with addition and multiplication modulo 2. Q is the field of rational numbers.\n\nNow, is Z_2 a subfield of Q? Well, Z_2 can be embedded into Q by mapping 0 to 0 and 1 to 1. Since the operations in Z_2 (addition and multiplication modulo 2) are consistent with the operations in Q when restricted to these elements, we can consider Z_2 as a subfield of Q.\n\nTherefore, Q is indeed an extension field of Z_2. So, Statement 1 is True.\n\n**Statement 2:** Every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.\n\nThis sounds familiar. It reminds me of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, but that's specifically for polynomials over the complex numbers. Here, it's a more general statement about polynomials over any field.\n\nIs it true that for any field F, and any non-constant polynomial with coefficients in F, there exists an extension field E of F where the polynomial has a root?\n\nYes, this is a standard result in field theory. The idea is that if a polynomial doesn't have a root in F, you can construct an extension field where it does have a root, by adjoining a root to F.\n\nIn fact, this process can be repeated until the polynomial splits completely into linear factors. This leads to the concept of splitting fields.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is also True.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A. True, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
