So, there's a new drug that's been tested in a lab against HIV, and now they're testing it on real people who have HIV. There are 200 people with confirmed HIV infections, and 100 of them were chosen by lottery to get the drug. The drug is given to them in a cup of orange juice, and the other 100 get just orange juice. No one knows who gets the drug or not, which sounds like a blind study. Then, after some time, they check the number of CD4+ T cells in all the subjects.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to recall what each type of study is:\n\nA. Case-control study: This is where you have a group of people with a disease (cases) and a group without the disease (controls), and you look back to see what might have caused the disease. For example, looking at people who have cancer and people who don't, and seeing if they smoked or not.\n\nB. Case report: This is just a detailed report about one patient or a very small number of patients with a particular condition. Like, a doctor writing about a unique patient they treated.\n\nC. Cohort study: This is where you take two groups of people, one with a certain exposure (like taking a drug) and one without, and then follow them over time to see if there's a difference in outcomes. It's like watching two groups and seeing how they develop.\n\nD. Cross-sectional study: This is where you take a population at one point in time and measure various things to see relationships between variables. It's a snapshot in time.\n\nNow, looking back at the study described:\n\n- They have a population of 200 HIV-positive patients.\n\n- They randomly selected 100 to receive the drug and 100 to receive placebo (orange juice without the drug).\n\n- Neither the patients nor the doctors know who gets what, which makes it a double-blind study.\n\n- They measure CD4+ T cells at the end of the study period for all subjects.\n\nSo, they're comparing two groups over time to see if the drug affects CD4+ T cell counts. That sounds a lot like a cohort study, where you have an exposed group (getting the drug) and an unexposed group (getting placebo), and you follow them to see if there's a difference in outcome.\n\nCase-control studies look back to see what might have caused the disease, which isn't what's happening here. They already have people with HIV, and they're testing a treatment.\n\nA case report is just about one patient, so that doesn't fit.\n\nA cross-sectional study would be taking a snapshot at one point in time, but here, they're following people over time.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C, a cohort study.\n\nBut wait, I remember that some people define cohort studies as starting with exposed and unexposed groups and following them forward, which matches this scenario. In this study, they're actively assigning the exposure (the drug) to one group and not to the other, and then measuring the outcome.\n\nAlso, it has elements of a randomized controlled trial, which is a type of cohort study, I believe. In randomized controlled trials, participants are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups, which is what happened here.\n\nSo, yeah, I think C, cohort study, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
