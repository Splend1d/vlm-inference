                    "text": "I'm going through some ethics questions for my philosophy class, and I've come across this one about Nussbaum's view on the first stage of ethical inquiry, specifically regarding terms for virtues. The options are:\n\nA. as descriptive as possible.\n\nB. those that are conventionally used.\n\nC. neutral between competing specifications of the virtue.\n\nD. none of the above.\n\nI need to figure out which one Nussbaum would agree with. I remember that Nussbaum is a contemporary philosopher who works on ancient ethics, particularly Aristotle, and she emphasizes the importance of capabilities and the role of emotions in ethics.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Nussbaum says about the first stage of ethical inquiry. I think she discusses the importance of starting with a broad and inclusive approach to understand virtues. She might argue that in the initial stage, we should use terms that don't favor any particular conception of the virtue, to keep the inquiry open and comprehensive.\n\nOption A suggests that terms should be as descriptive as possible. That sounds promising because descriptive terms can provide clear meanings and help avoid confusion. However, I wonder if being purely descriptive might limit the richness of the virtue terms, which often carry connotations and associations beyond their literal meanings.\n\nOption B proposes using conventionally used terms. This seems reasonable because conventional terms are familiar and widely understood. But Nussbaum might be critical of this approach if conventional terms are tied to specific, perhaps problematic, cultural or historical contexts that could bias the inquiry.\n\nOption C suggests that terms should be neutral between competing specifications of the virtue. This resonates with what I think Nussbaum would advocate. In the first stage of ethical inquiry, it's important to consider various perspectives and avoid privileging any one conception over others. Using neutral terms allows for a more inclusive and open discussion.\n\nOption D, none of the above, is always a possibility, but given that option C seems aligned with Nussbaum's likely approach, I doubt that's the case here.\n\nLet me think more deeply about Nussbaum's methodology. She often emphasizes the importance of philosophical anthropology, looking at what it means to be a human being with certain capabilities and vulnerabilities. In her work on capabilities, she argues for a list of central capabilities that are essential for a good human life.\n\nIn the context of virtues, she might argue that virtues are dispositions that enable us to exercise our capabilities well. Therefore, in the first stage of ethical inquiry, we should use terms that capture the broad functions or capacities that virtues serve, without committing to any particular detailed specification.\n\nFor example, consider the virtue of courage. There are different specifications of courage: military courage, moral courage, intellectual courage, etc. In the first stage, Nussbaum might suggest using a term that encompasses all these aspects without favoring one over the others.\n\nTherefore, using neutral terms that don't privilege any specific conception of the virtue would be most appropriate. This aligns with option C.\n\nMoreover, Nussbaum is known for her emphasis on objectivity and universality in ethics, while also being sensitive to cultural differences. Using neutral terms would help achieve a balance between these goals, ensuring that the inquiry is open to diverse perspectives but still grounded in universal human capabilities.\n\nIn contrast, option A, being purely descriptive, might not capture the normative dimensions of virtues. Virtues aren't just descriptive traits; they are also normative ideals that guide our actions and character.\n\nOption B, using conventionally used terms, might be problematic if those conventions are biased or incomplete. Nussbaum, being critical of certain conventional views, might prefer a more neutral approach.\n\nTherefore, I believe that Nussbaum would agree that at the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms for the virtues should be neutral between competing specifications of the virtue, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
