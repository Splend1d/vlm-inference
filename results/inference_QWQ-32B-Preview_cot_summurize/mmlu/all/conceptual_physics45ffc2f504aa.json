                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what causes chain reactions in a fission reactor. The options are kinetic energy, energy conversion, mass conversion, and ejected neutrons. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst off, I know that in a fission reactor, atoms split, right? That's fission. When an atom splits, it releases energy, and that's how the reactor generates power. But for it to be a chain reaction, one event has to trigger another, and so on.\n\nI think ejected neutrons might be key here. When a heavy nucleus like uranium-235 captures a neutron, it becomes unstable and splits into two lighter nuclei. During this process, it also releases more neutrons. These neutrons can then go on to cause other uranium-235 atoms to split, releasing more neutrons, and so on. That sounds like a chain reaction.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure. Kinetic energy is about the energy of moving objects. While neutrons do have kinetic energy when they collide with the nucleus, I think the key here is that they are neutrons being ejected, not just the energy they carry.\n\nEnergy conversion is definitely happening in a reactor, from nuclear energy to heat and then to electricity, but that's more about the overall process, not specifically what's causing the chain reaction.\n\nMass conversion\u2014maybe related to E=mc\u00b2, where mass is converted to energy? That does happen in nuclear reactions, but again, it's not directly causing the chain reaction. It's a result of the reaction, I think.\n\nSo, coming back to ejected neutrons, that seems to be the most direct cause of the chain reaction in a fission reactor. One neutron causes a nucleus to split, which releases more neutrons, causing more splits, and so on.\n\nI think the answer is D. Ejected neutrons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
