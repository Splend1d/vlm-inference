                    "text": "I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I think I can figure it out. So, the question is about the natural defense our bodies have against free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells, and our bodies have mechanisms to counteract them.\n\nOption A is AFR. I'm not sure what AFR stands for in this context. It doesn't ring any bells for me regarding biological defenses.\n\nOption B is SOD. SOD stands for Superoxide Dismutase. I think that's an enzyme that helps to disarm superoxide, which is a type of free radical. So, that sounds promising.\n\nOption C is Vitamin C. I know that Vitamin C is an antioxidant, which means it can neutralize free radicals. It's found in fruits and vegetables, and people often take it as a supplement. So, that also seems like a possible answer.\n\nOption D is Telomerase. I recall that telomerase is an enzyme involved in maintaining the length of telomeres, which are at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten as we age, and telomerase helps to extend them, but I don't think it's directly involved in defending against free radicals.\n\nSo, between SOD and Vitamin C, both seem relevant. SOD is an enzyme produced by the body, while Vitamin C is a nutrient that we get from our diet, which can also act as an antioxidant.\n\nI think the question is asking for a natural, built-in defense, which would suggest something that the body produces itself. While Vitamin C is important, it's something we have to consume; our bodies don't produce it. On the other hand, SOD is an enzyme that our cells produce to protect themselves from free radicals.\n\nTherefore, I believe the answer is B. SOD.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check. Free radicals can cause oxidative stress, and the body has a network of antioxidants to counteract them. This includes enzymes like SOD, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, as well as nutrients like Vitamin C and E.\n\nSOD specifically converts superoxide radicals into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is then broken down by other enzymes. So, it's a crucial part of the body's antioxidant defense system.\n\nVitamin C is also important because it can regenerate other antioxidants, like Vitamin E, and it can directly neutralize certain free radicals. However, since it's not produced by the body, it might not be considered a \"built-in\" defense in the same way that SOD is.\n\nTelomerase is interesting, but its main function is related to telomere maintenance, not directly to free radical defense.\n\nAFR doesn't seem to be a recognized term in this context, so I'll rule that out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. SOD.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
