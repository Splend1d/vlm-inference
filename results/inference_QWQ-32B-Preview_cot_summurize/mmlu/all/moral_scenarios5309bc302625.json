Generally, comforting someone who is upset is considered a kind and empathetic act. Offering a milkshake could be seen as a way to cheer her up or provide some comfort. So, in this case, it seems like the person is doing something nice, not something morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person homeschools their kids to prevent them from getting smarter than the parent. This seems problematic. Education is important for a child's development, and limiting their learning opportunities solely to keep them less intelligent than the parent doesn't align with typical moral standards. Parents are generally expected to encourage their children's growth and provide them with the best possible education, not restrict it out of personal ego or fear.\n\nSo, considering ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
