                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out the best way to serve the defendants in this lawsuit. The student is suing her university and the athletic director for eliminating funding for the women's varsity volleyball team, and she's doing this in federal court in State B. I need to determine the correct method of service according to federal rules.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in federal court, the rules for service of process are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 4. So, I need to look at FRCP 4 to understand how to serve these defendants properly.\n\nLooking at FRCP 4, it outlines different methods for serving summons and complaints on defendants. It depends on whether the defendant is an individual or an organization, and also on their location.\n\nIn this case, there are two defendants: the university, which is a nonprofit corporation incorporated in State B, and the athletic director, who is a citizen of State B.\n\nLet's start with the university. Since it's a corporation, and it's incorporated in State B, I need to see how corporations are served under FRCP 4.\n\nFRCP 4(h)(1)(A) says that to serve a domestic corporation, you serve the state\u2019s law for service of process in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction. So, for a domestic corporation in State B, I would typically look to State B's rules for serving a corporation in a similar lawsuit.\n\nHowever, since this is a federal court, and federal courts have their own rules, I need to make sure that I'm following the federal rules rather than solely relying on state rules.\n\nWait, but FRCP 4(h)(1)(A) specifically refers to state law for service on domestic corporations. So, in this case, I would need to follow State B's rules for serving a corporation in a general jurisdiction court.\n\nBut let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. Service as required by State B's rules of civil procedure.\n\nThis seems to align with FRCP 4(h)(1)(A), so this could be a correct method.\n\nBut let's consider the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B suggests service by a process server leaving copies of the summons and complaint with secretaries in the offices of the athletic director and the university president.\n\nFRCP 4 generally allows for service on an individual by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the individual personally or by leaving copies at the individual's usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion.\n\nBut for organizations, like the university, FRCP 4(j)(1) allows service on the organization by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or another agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\n\nSo, serving the university president might be acceptable, but serving a secretary might not necessarily qualify, unless the secretary is authorized to receive process.\n\nTherefore, option B might not be the best method.\n\nOption C proposes serving by email.\n\nFRCP 4 does not specifically mention email as a method of service. Traditional methods include personal delivery or mailing as permitted by the rules.\n\nFRCP 4(f)(1) allows for service by filing a copy of the summons and complaint with the court and then mailing a copy to the defendant's last known address. But this is not the same as emailing.\n\nAdditionally, some courts may allow email service under certain circumstances, but it's not a standard method under FRCP 4.\n\nTherefore, option C seems inappropriate.\n\nOption D suggests that the student herself serves the athletic director and the university president.\n\nFRCP 4(c)(2)(B) states that unless otherwise ordered, the plaintiff or the plaintiff\u2019s attorney must serve the summons and complaint.\n\nSo, the plaintiff can serve the defendants, but often, it's more common to have a third party, like a process server, do the service.\n\nHowever, there's no prohibition against the plaintiff serving the defendants herself, so this could be acceptable.\n\nBut again, considering the other options, especially option A, which aligns with the federal rule referencing state law for service on domestic corporations, option D might not be the best method.\n\nWait, but for the athletic director, who is an individual, FRCP 4(e)(2) allows for service by following state law for serving an individual or by following the circumstances for serving an individual under FRCP 4(e)(1), which includes personal delivery or leaving copies at the individual's dwelling or usual place of abode.\n\nSo, for the athletic director, service might be acceptable by leaving copies with someone of suitable age and discretion at their place of abode, but not necessarily at their office.\n\nBut in option B, it's specified that the process server leaves copies with secretaries in their offices.\n\nThis might not meet the requirements for serving an individual under FRCP 4.\n\nTherefore, option B seems problematic.\n\nOption C, as previously mentioned, is not a standard method under FRCP 4.\n\nOption D could be acceptable, but it's not the most professional method, and there might be better options.\n\nGiven that, option A, which is to follow State B's rules of civil procedure for serving a domestic corporation, seems to be the most appropriate method.\n\nAdditionally, for the athletic director, since he is an individual and a citizen of State B, FRCP 4(e)(1) allows for service in the manner prescribed by state law for serving a summons in an action brought in the courts of general jurisdiction in that state.\n\nTherefore, for both defendants, following State B's rules of civil procedure would be appropriate.\n\nHence, option A is likely the best method of service.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other federal rules that might apply differently.\n\nFRCP 4(k)(1)(A) provides that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant who is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located.\n\nSince the university is incorporated in State B and the athletic director is a citizen of State B, and the lawsuit is filed in federal court in State B, personal jurisdiction is likely established.\n\nTherefore, following State B's rules for service on domestic corporations and individuals would be appropriate.\n\nMoreover, FRCP 4(h)(1)(A) specifically directs that service on a domestic corporation be made as required by state law.\n\nThus, option A is in line with federal rules.\n\nIn conclusion, the best method of serving the defendants in this case is to follow the requirements of State B's rules of civil procedure for serving a domestic corporation and an individual in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
