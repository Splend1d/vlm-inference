The question is: \"Older adults are able to improve their memories and reduce their anxiety about declining memory when...\" and then it gives four options.\n\nOption A says: \"They learn about memory and aging and learn some techniques.\" That sounds promising. Understanding how memory works and how it changes with age might help older adults manage their expectations and perhaps use strategies that suit their current abilities.\n\nOption B is: \"They simply learn a number of memory improvement techniques.\" This seems similar to option A, but it doesn't mention learning about memory and aging. Maybe learning techniques isn't enough unless they also understand the context of how memory changes with age.\n\nOption C states: \"They learn that many aspects of memory do not decline and some even get better.\" This could be reassuring for older adults who are anxious about their memory. Knowing that not all memory functions decline with age might reduce anxiety and perhaps even motivate them to engage more with memory improvement activities.\n\nOption D is: \"Older adults cannot do either of these.\" That seems too pessimistic and probably incorrect, as there is research showing that older adults can learn and adapt.\n\nThinking about this, I recall that education and awareness can play a big role in how people perceive their own abilities, especially as they age. If older adults are taught about normal age-related changes in memory, they might be less anxious about forgetting things, understanding that it's a common part of aging.\n\nMoreover, learning specific memory techniques could help them compensate for any declines by using strategies that make up for weaker memory functions. For example, using mnemonic devices, keeping to routines, or using lists and reminders.\n\nBut option C seems important too because it highlights that not all memory functions decline with age. For instance, crystallized intelligence, which is the ability to use knowledge and experience, often improves with age. So, older adults might have better vocabulary and general knowledge, which can support memory in certain areas.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is a combination of A and C. Learning about memory and aging would include understanding both the aspects that decline and those that remain stable or improve. This comprehensive approach would likely be most effective in improving memory and reducing anxiety.\n\nBut since I have to choose one option, I need to decide which one is most crucial.\n\nOption A seems broad and inclusive, as learning about memory and aging would probably cover the information in option C, that some aspects of memory don't decline. So, if they learn about memory and aging, they would likely learn that some memory functions remain intact or even improve.\n\nOption B is more narrow, focusing only on techniques, which might not address the anxiety related to memory decline unless they also understand the reasons behind memory changes.\n\nTherefore, I think option A is the best answer because it encompasses both understanding memory and aging and learning techniques to improve memory. This dual approach would likely be most effective in improving memory performance and reducing anxiety about memory decline.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
