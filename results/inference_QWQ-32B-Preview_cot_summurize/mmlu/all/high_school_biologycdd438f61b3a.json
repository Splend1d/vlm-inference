                    "text": "This question is about mutations in mRNA and their potential effects. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what each option represents:\n\nA. A deletion of a single nucleotide: This would cause a frameshift mutation because the reading frame of the codons downstream of the deletion would be altered.\n\nB. A deletion of a nucleotide triplet: Since codons are triplets, deleting a whole codon would remove one amino acid from the protein but wouldn't cause a frameshift.\n\nC. A single nucleotide substitution in the first position of a codon: This could change the amino acid specified by the codon, depending on the genetic code.\n\nD. A single nucleotide substitution in the third position of a codon: This might not change the amino acid due to the wobble phenomenon in codon-anticodon pairing.\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these changes would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect.\n\nOption A: A deletion of a single nucleotide leads to a frameshift mutation. This means that every codon after the deletion will be misread, potentially changing every amino acid in the rest of the protein. This is likely to have a severe effect on the protein's function.\n\nOption B: Deleting a whole codon removes one amino acid but doesn't disrupt the reading frame for the rest of the mRNA. This could still affect the protein's function, but perhaps not as drastically as a frameshift.\n\nOption C: Substituting a nucleotide in the first position of a codon can lead to a different amino acid being incorporated, depending on the genetic code. This could be a missense mutation, which might or might not affect the protein function, depending on the amino acid change.\n\nOption D: Substituting a nucleotide in the third position might not change the amino acid due to the wobble base pairing. Even if it does change the amino acid, it's often a similar one, so the effect might be minimal.\n\nComparing these, option A seems to have the most significant potential for harm because it alters the entire reading frame downstream of the mutation.\n\nHowever, let's consider that the question specifies \"following the start codon.\" The start codon is usually AUG, which codes for methionine. If the mutation occurs right after the start codon, it might affect a critical part of the protein.\n\nBut in general, frameshift mutations are very detrimental because they can change the entire primary structure of the protein, leading to loss of function or even complete non-function.\n\nOption B, deleting a whole codon, removes one amino acid but preserves the reading frame. This could be less disruptive, especially if the removed amino acid isn't critical.\n\nOption C, substituting a nucleotide in the first position of a codon, could lead to a different amino acid being incorporated. If that amino acid is crucial for the protein's function, it could be harmful. However, not all amino acid changes are equally detrimental.\n\nOption D, substituting in the third position, is often the least harmful because of the redundancy in the genetic code.\n\nTherefore, among these options, a deletion of a single nucleotide (option A) would most likely have the greatest deleterious effect due to the frameshift it causes.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. Sometimes, mutations in regulatory regions or in parts of the protein that aren't critical might not have as big an effect. However, the question is about changes following the start codon in mRNA, which is the coding sequence.\n\nSo, in the coding sequence, a frameshift mutation is generally the most severe because it alters the entire amino acid sequence following the mutation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
