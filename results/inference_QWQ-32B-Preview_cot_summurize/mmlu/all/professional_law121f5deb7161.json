                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a construction contract, and I need to figure out if the builder is likely to prevail in suing the company for an extra $1 million due to a steel price increase. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's an original contract for constructing a new corporate headquarters for a fixed price of $100 million, with structural steel included as a $6 million item. Then, before work starts, a tornado damages the biggest structural steel supplier, causing steel prices to increase by 20%. So, the builder informs the company about this price hike.\n\nNext, the parties orally agree to increase the project price to $101 million to account for the higher steel costs. The builder proceeds with construction and finishes on time. The company pays $100 million but refuses to pay the additional $1 million. Now, the builder is suing for that extra $1 million, and I need to determine if the builder is likely to win.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA. No, because the modification was never reduced to a writing signed by the party to be charged.\n\nB. No, because there was no consideration for the modification of the contract.\n\nC. Yes, because the company\u2019s promise was supported by consideration.\n\nD. Yes, because the modification was fair and equitable in view of the unanticipated increase in the price of structural steel.\n\nOkay, so this seems to be about contract modifications and whether they're enforceable, especially considering issues like consideration and the Statute of Frauds.\n\nLet me start by recalling that for a contract modification to be enforceable, it generally needs to satisfy the same requirements as the original contract, meaning there should be offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, depending on the jurisdiction and the type of contract, the modification might need to be in writing if it falls under the Statute of Frauds.\n\nIn this case, the original contract was in writing for a $100 million construction project, which definitely falls under the Statute of Frauds, as it's a contract that cannot be performed within one year or involves the transfer of real estate.\n\nNow, the modification is an oral agreement to increase the price to $101 million due to the steel price increase. So, option A suggests that the modification isn't enforceable because it wasn't in writing signed by the party to be charged, which in this case is the company.\n\nOption B says no, because there was no consideration for the modification. Option C says yes, because the company\u2019s promise was supported by consideration. And option D says yes, because the modification was fair and equitable given the unanticipated increase in steel prices.\n\nLet's think about consideration first. Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties to a contract. In this scenario, the builder is agreeing to provide additional value by covering the increased cost of steel, and the company is agreeing to pay an extra $1 million. So, it seems like there is consideration on both sides: the builder is providing materials at a higher cost, and the company is agreeing to pay more for those materials.\n\nBut, was this consideration sufficient? The builder is already contracted to provide the steel at $6 million, but due to the price increase, it's now costing more. By agreeing to pay an extra $1 million, the company is essentially agreeing to cover part of that increased cost. So, the consideration seems to be the company's promise to pay the additional amount in exchange for the builder covering the rest of the increased steel costs.\n\nNow, regarding the Statute of Frauds, since the original contract is in writing and for a large sum, any modifications might also need to be in writing to be enforceable. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as when the party to be charged has already partially performed based on the oral modification.\n\nIn this case, the builder proceeded with construction and delivered the project on time, relying on the oral agreement to pay the extra $1 million. So, there's partial performance, which might take the modification out of the Statute of Frauds requirement for writing.\n\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions recognize the doctrine of promissory estoppel, where a party relies on a promise to their detriment, and the court enforces the promise even without a formal writing.\n\nGiven that, option A might not necessarily hold true because of the partial performance by the builder.\n\nOption B questions whether there was consideration for the modification. As I thought earlier, there seems to be consideration since the company is promising to pay extra in exchange for the builder covering the increased steel costs.\n\nOption C says yes, because the company\u2019s promise was supported by consideration, which aligns with my earlier thinking.\n\nOption D suggests that the modification was fair and equitable given the unanticipated increase in steel prices. While this might be true, fairness isn't necessarily a legal standard for enforcing contract modifications. However, in some cases, courts might consider equity and fairness, especially if there's been a significant unforeseen event that makes the original contract terms unfair.\n\nIn this scenario, the steel price increase was due to external circumstances (tornado damage to the supplier), which seems like a valid reason for adjusting the contract price.\n\nBut, from a purely legal standpoint, the key issues are whether the modification was supported by consideration and whether it needs to be in writing.\n\nGiven that there seems to be consideration and that the builder has partially performed based on the oral agreement, it's possible that the modification is enforceable despite not being in writing.\n\nTherefore, options C and D seem more plausible than A and B.\n\nHowever, I need to choose the most likely correct answer.\n\nConsidering that option C directly addresses the consideration issue, which is crucial for contract modifications, and option D touches on the fairness aspect, which might be relevant but isn't the primary legal basis for enforcing the modification.\n\nTherefore, I think option C is the strongest argument for why the builder is likely to prevail.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Yes, because the company\u2019s promise was supported by consideration.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
