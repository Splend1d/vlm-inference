                    "text": "To determine the empirical formula of the compound, we need to find the simplest whole number ratio of the atoms of each element in the compound. The compound is known to consist of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). We are given the total mass of the compound and the masses of carbon and hydrogen. First, we need to find the mass of oxygen in the compound.\n\nThe total mass of the compound is 29.05 g. The mass of carbon is 18.02 g, and the mass of hydrogen is 3.03 g. Therefore, the mass of oxygen can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{mass of oxygen} = \\text{total mass} - (\\text{mass of carbon} + \\text{mass of hydrogen}) = 29.05 \\, \\text{g} - (18.02 \\, \\text{g} + 3.03 \\, \\text{g}) = 29.05 \\, \\text{g} - 21.05 \\, \\text{g} = 8.00 \\, \\text{g}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to convert these masses into moles. We do this by dividing each mass by the atomic mass of the respective element. The atomic masses are approximately:\n\n- Carbon: 12.01 g/mol\n\n- Hydrogen: 1.01 g/mol\n\n- Oxygen: 16.00 g/mol\n\nNow, calculate the moles of each element:\n\n\\[\n\\text{moles of carbon} = \\frac{18.02 \\, \\text{g}}{12.01 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 1.50 \\, \\text{mol}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{moles of hydrogen} = \\frac{3.03 \\, \\text{g}}{1.01 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 3.00 \\, \\text{mol}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{moles of oxygen} = \\frac{8.00 \\, \\text{g}}{16.00 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.50 \\, \\text{mol}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the simplest whole number ratio of these moles. To do this, divide each number of moles by the smallest number of moles among the three elements. The smallest number of moles is that of oxygen, which is 0.50 mol.\n\n\\[\n\\text{ratio of carbon} = \\frac{1.50 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.50 \\, \\text{mol}} = 3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{ratio of hydrogen} = \\frac{3.00 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.50 \\, \\text{mol}} = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{ratio of oxygen} = \\frac{0.50 \\, \\text{mol}}{0.50 \\, \\text{mol}} = 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the empirical formula of the compound is C3H6O.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. C2H4O\n\nB. C3H6O\n\nC. C2H6O3\n\nD. C3H8O2\n\nThe correct answer is B. C3H6O.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
