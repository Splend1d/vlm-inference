I know that NASA, CIA, and FBI are all US government agencies, but what about NAACP? Let me think about it.\n\nNASA is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. That's definitely a government agency. They're responsible for space exploration and aeronautics research.\n\nThe CIA is the Central Intelligence Agency. They handle intelligence and information gathering for the US government.\n\nThe FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They're the main law enforcement agency for the US government, dealing with crimes that cross state lines or involve federal laws.\n\nNow, the NAACP. I think that stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. I believe it's a civil rights organization, not a government agency. Let me make sure.\n\nI recall that the NAACP was founded to fight for racial equality and civil rights. It's a nonprofit organization that advocates for equal rights and works to eliminate racial discrimination. It's not part of the government; it's an independent organization.\n\nSo, comparing all of these, NAACP is the only one that isn't a US government agency. NASA, CIA, and FBI are all government agencies with specific roles in space, intelligence, and law enforcement, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. NAACP.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
