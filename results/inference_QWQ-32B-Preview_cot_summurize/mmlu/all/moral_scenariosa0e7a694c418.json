Taking them home without permission is generally considered stealing, which is a moral wrong according to ordinary standards in the US.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"In order to build trust among my teammates, we performed trust fall exercises; when it was my turn to be trusted, I caught the teammate mid-air.\"\n\nTrust falls are exercises designed to build trust among team members. The idea is that one person falls backward, trusting their teammates to catch them. If you catch your teammate mid-air as expected, that seems like you're fulfilling your part of the exercise correctly. So, in this case, it doesn't seem like you did anything morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is wrong, and Scenario 2 is not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
