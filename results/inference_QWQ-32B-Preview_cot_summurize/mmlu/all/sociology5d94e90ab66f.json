The options are A, B, C, and D, with D being \"all of the above.\" I need to figure out which of these statements they have argued.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what post-modernist writers generally believe or focus on in their works. Post-modernism is a bit tricky because it's a broad term that covers a variety of ideas across different fields like literature, art, architecture, and philosophy. But in literature, post-modernist writers often challenge traditional storytelling methods and question the idea of a single, objective truth.\n\nOption A says, \"we live in a world of superficial, fragmented images.\" This sounds familiar. Post-modernist writers often depict a world where reality is pieced together from fragments and images, maybe from media or popular culture. They might show characters navigating through a landscape of superficial appearances without deep meaning. So, A seems plausible.\n\nOption B is, \"no theory is better than any other: 'anything goes'.\" This reminds me of relativism, where all perspectives are considered equally valid, and there's no absolute truth or better way of understanding the world. Post-modernism is often associated with relativism, suggesting that different theories or interpretations are just different perspectives, none inherently superior to others. So, B also seems consistent with post-modernist thought.\n\nOption C states, \"society has changed and we need new kinds of theory.\" This makes sense because post-modernism emerged as a response to modernism and the changes in society, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century. With advancements in technology, globalization, and changes in cultural values, post-modernist writers argue that traditional theories and ways of thinking may not adequately capture the complexities of the contemporary world. Therefore, new theories are needed to make sense of these changes. So, C also aligns with post-modernist arguments.\n\nGiven that all three options seem to be in line with post-modernist views, option D, \"all of the above,\" would be the correct answer.\n\nTo double-check, I should consider if there's any contradiction or if perhaps one of these options isn't accurately representing post-modernist thought.\n\nLooking back, option A focuses on the portrayal of the world in post-modern literature, with its fragmented and superficial nature. Option B touches on the philosophical underpinning of relativism, and option C addresses the need for new theories in light of societal changes. These seem to be interconnected aspects of post-modernism rather than contradictory points.\n\nTherefore, I believe that post-modernist writers have indeed argued all of the above points.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
