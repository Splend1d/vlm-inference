We have the objective function:\n\n\\[ f(w) = \\frac{1}{2} \\|Xw - y\\|_2^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\|w\\|_2^2 \\]\n\nAnd we need to find its gradient with respect to \\( w \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall that the gradient of a function gives us the direction of steepest ascent, and in optimization, we often set it to zero to find minima.\n\nSo, our goal is to compute \\( \\nabla_w f(w) \\).\n\nThe function \\( f(w) \\) consists of two parts: the squared loss term and the regularization term.\n\nLet's compute the gradient of each part separately and then sum them up.\n\n**1. Gradient of the squared loss term: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\|Xw - y\\|_2^2 \\)**\n\nThe squared loss term is \\( \\frac{1}{2} (Xw - y)^T (Xw - y) \\).\n\nTo find its gradient with respect to \\( w \\), we can use the chain rule.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \\( z = Xw - y \\), then \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{2} z^T z \\).\n\nThe gradient of \\( f(z) \\) with respect to \\( z \\) is \\( z \\), and the gradient of \\( z \\) with respect to \\( w \\) is \\( X \\).\n\nTherefore, the gradient of the squared loss term with respect to \\( w \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\nabla_w \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\|Xw - y\\|_2^2 \\right) = X^T (Xw - y) \\]\n\n**2. Gradient of the regularization term: \\( \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda \\|w\\|_2^2 \\)**\n\nThe regularization term is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda w^T w \\).\n\nThe gradient of this term with respect to \\( w \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\nabla_w \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda \\|w\\|_2^2 \\right) = \\lambda w \\]\n\n**3. Combining both gradients:**\n\nNow, we sum up the gradients of both terms to get the overall gradient:\n\n\\[ \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T (Xw - y) + \\lambda w \\]\n\nLet\u2019s simplify this expression:\n\n\\[ \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\]\n\nSo, the gradient is:\n\n\\[ \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\]\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. \\( \\nabla_w f(w) = (X^T X + \\lambda I)w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\)\n\nB. \\( \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda \\)\n\nC. \\( \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\)\n\nD. \\( \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + (\\lambda + 1) w \\)\n\nComparing our result with these options, we can see that option C matches our derivation:\n\n\\[ \\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\]\n\nHowever, let's double-check if there are any mistakes.\n\nWait a minute, in option A, it has \\( (X^T X + \\lambda I)w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\).\n\nLet's expand \\( (X^T X + \\lambda I)w \\):\n\n\\[ (X^T X + \\lambda I)w = X^T X w + \\lambda w \\]\n\nSo, option A becomes:\n\n\\[ X^T X w + \\lambda w - X^T y + \\lambda w = X^T X w - X^T y + 2\\lambda w \\]\n\nThat's different from our result.\n\nOption B has \\( X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda \\), which adds a constant \\(\\lambda\\) instead of \\(\\lambda w\\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption C matches our derivation.\n\nOption D has \\( X^T X w - X^T y + (\\lambda + 1) w \\), which is similar to our result but has an extra \\( w \\).\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my derivation.\n\nLet me re-examine the gradient of the regularization term.\n\nThe regularization term is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda w^T w \\), and its gradient with respect to \\( w \\) should indeed be \\( \\lambda w \\).\n\nSo, our overall gradient should be:\n\n\\[ X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\]\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A has \\( (X^T X + \\lambda I)w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\), which simplifies to \\( X^T X w + \\lambda w - X^T y + \\lambda w = X^T X w - X^T y + 2\\lambda w \\), which is different.\n\nOption C seems correct, but let's see why option A might be considered.\n\nPerhaps there's a different way to write the gradient that makes option A correct.\n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the notation.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\gamma \\) are used interchangeably in the problem statement.\n\nIn the initial problem, it's \\( \\gamma \\), but in the question, it's \\( \\lambda \\). Assuming they are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options.\n\nGiven our derivation, option C is correct.\n\nHowever, in ridge regression, the gradient is often written as \\( X^T X w - X^T y + \\lambda w \\), which aligns with option C.\n\nBut option A seems to include an extra \\( \\lambda w \\), making it \\( X^T X w - X^T y + 2\\lambda w \\), which is not matching.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
