Simon and Garfunkel, D. Tom and Jerry. Hmm, I need to figure out which one among these isn't a duo from a TV cartoon.\n\nFirst off, I know that Chip and Dale are characters from the Chip 'n Dale cartoon shows, which are animated cartoons. They're rodents, right? Chip is the brown one and Dale is the white one. They often appear in cartoons, especially those involving Donald Duck and other Disney characters. So, they're definitely a TV cartoon duo.\n\nNext, Beavis and Butt-head. That's an easy one. Beavis and Butt-head is a cartoon show created by Mike Judge. It's about two high school dropout teenagers who comment on various videos and stuff. It's definitely a TV cartoon duo.\n\nNow, Simon and Garfunkel. Hmm, I think Simon and Garfunkel are a musical duo, right? Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are famous singers and songwriters. They're not cartoon characters; they're real people known for their music. So, this seems like the odd one out.\n\nLastly, Tom and Jerry. Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon show about a cat and a mouse. Tom is the cat, and Jerry is the mouse, and they're always chasing each other. It's been around for decades and is very famous. So, definitely a TV cartoon duo.\n\nPutting it all together, it looks like\u9009\u9879 C, Simon and Garfunkel, is the one that's not a TV cartoon duo. They're a real-life musical duo, not cartoon characters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
