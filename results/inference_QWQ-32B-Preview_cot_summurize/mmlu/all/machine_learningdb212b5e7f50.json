                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** L2 regularization of linear models tends to make models more sparse than L1 regularization.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall what L1 and L2 regularization do in the context of linear models. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regression, adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. L2 regularization, or Ridge regression, adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.\n\nI remember that L1 regularization has a tendency to produce sparse models because it can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero. On the other hand, L2 regularization typically doesn't set coefficients to zero; it just shrinks them towards zero. So, if L1 regularization can lead to sparsity, and L2 doesn't usually do that, then Statement 1 seems incorrect. It should be the other way around: L1 regularization tends to make models more sparse than L2 regularization.\n\n**Statement 2:** Residual connections can be found in ResNets and Transformers.\n\nNow, let's think about residual connections. I know that Residual Networks (ResNets) are a type of convolutional neural network where residual connections, or skip connections, are used to help with training deep networks. These connections allow the gradient to be directly backpropagated to earlier layers, which helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem.\n\nAs for Transformers, I recall that they are a type of architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms and are widely used in natural language processing tasks. Transformers also employ residual connections between layers, similar to ResNets, to facilitate training of deep networks.\n\nSo, it seems that residual connections are indeed present in both ResNets and Transformers. Therefore, Statement 2 is correct.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Statement 1 is false.\n\n- Statement 2 is true.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. True, True\n\nB. False, False\n\nC. True, False\n\nD. False, True\n\nThe correct choice should be D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
