                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this situation between a homeowner and a roofer. The homeowner says the roof leaks and thinks the tiles are cracked. He offers to pay $5,000 if the roofer replaces the old tiles with new ones. The roofer says, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\" Then, the homeowner says it's okay and to let him know soon. Three days later, the roofer shows up with his truck, unloads materials and equipment, and the homeowner changes his mind, saying he decided to repair the roof himself.\n\nNow, the roofer is suing the homeowner for breach of contract. We need to figure out which theory would best support the roofer's case.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed to do the job.\n\nB. A bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\"\n\nC. The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased the materials and equipment needed for the job.\n\nD. The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between bilateral and unilateral contracts.\n\nA bilateral contract is where both parties promise to do something. For example, one party promises to pay and the other promises to perform a service.\n\nA unilateral contract is where one party promises to pay in exchange for the other party's performance of an act. So, the acceptance comes from performing the act, not from a promise.\n\nIn this scenario, the homeowner is offering to pay $5,000 if the roofer replaces the tiles. This sounds like the roofer has to perform the act of replacing the tiles to get paid. So, it seems like a unilateral contract.\n\nOption A says a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer purchased materials. But purchasing materials is an act, not a promise. So, that doesn't sound right for a bilateral contract.\n\nOption B says a bilateral contract was formed when the roofer said, \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\" Here, the roofer is indicating willingness but conditional on clearing his schedule. It's not a firm promise to perform yet.\n\nOption C says the homeowner offered a unilateral contract, and it became irrevocable when the roofer purchased materials. In unilateral contracts, the offer can usually be revoked at any time before performance begins. So, did the roofer begin performance by purchasing materials?\n\nOption D says the homeowner offered a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested intent to accept by beginning performance through unloading materials.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this.\n\nIn contract law, for a unilateral contract, the acceptance is through the performance of the act. So, the roofer would accept the offer by starting to replace the tiles.\n\nBut here, the roofer unloaded materials and equipment, which is a step towards performing the act. Is that enough to constitute beginning performance?\n\nAlso, in some jurisdictions, there's a concept called \"detrimental reliance\" or \"promissory estoppel,\" where if one party relies on the other's promise and incurs costs based on that reliance, there might be liability even without a formal contract. But that's not directly mentioned in the options.\n\nLooking back at the options, C and D both mention unilateral contracts, which seems appropriate given the facts.\n\nOption C says the offer became irrevocable when the roofer purchased materials. In general, in unilateral contracts, the offer can be revoked anytime before performance begins. Once performance begins, the offer is irrevocable to the extent of the performance done.\n\nSo, if the roofer purchased materials, that might be considered part of the performance, making the offer irrevocable.\n\nOption D says the roofer manifested intent to accept when he began performance by unloading materials and equipment.\n\nUnloading materials and equipment could be considered the beginning of performance. So, under this theory, by starting to perform, the roofer has accepted the offer, and the homeowner is bound by the contract.\n\nComparing C and D, both seem plausible, but D seems more directly aligned with the concept of acceptance in unilateral contracts.\n\nIn unilateral contracts, acceptance is through performance, so unloading materials could be seen as a manifestation of intent to accept the offer.\n\nOption C focuses on the purchase of materials making the offer irrevocable, but it's less clear whether purchasing materials alone constitutes performance that makes the offer irrevocable.\n\nTherefore, option D seems like the better theory for the roofer's recovery.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's more to consider.\n\nLet's think about the initial exchange.\n\nHomeowner: \"My roof leaks. I think the old tiles are cracked. If you will replace them with all new tiles, I will pay you $5,000.\"\n\nRoofer: \"Sure, if I can clear my busy schedule.\"\n\nHomeowner: \"That's all right, but let me know soon.\"\n\nSo, the homeowner is making an offer, and the roofer is conditionally accepting, subject to clearing his schedule.\n\nThen, three days later, the roofer shows up to perform the job, but the homeowner backs out.\n\nIn this scenario, it's possible to argue that a contract was formed when the roofer indicated his willingness, even conditional, and the homeowner accepted that condition by saying \"that's all right, but let me know soon.\"\n\nHowever, considering the nature of the agreement, it seems more aligned with a unilateral contract where the roofer has to perform the act of replacing the tiles to get paid.\n\nTherefore, option D seems most appropriate because it acknowledges the unilateral nature of the contract and ties acceptance to the beginning of performance.\n\nSo, the roofer manifested intent to accept the offer by starting to perform the act (unloading materials and equipment), and the homeowner cannot revoke the offer at that point.\n\nTherefore, the roofer has a basis for claiming breach of contract.\n\nI think D is the best answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD) The homeowner made an offer that proposed a unilateral contract, and the roofer manifested an intent to accept the offer when he began performance by unloading the materials and equipment at the homeowner's house."
