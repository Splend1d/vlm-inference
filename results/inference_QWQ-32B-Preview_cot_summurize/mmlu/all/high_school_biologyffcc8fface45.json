                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about natural selection. So, we have four statements, and we need to pick the one that best represents an inference of natural selection. Let's look at each one carefully.\n\nOption A says: \"Subsequent generations of a population should have greater proportions of individuals that possess traits better suited for success.\" Hmm, this sounds familiar. Natural selection is all about how organisms with traits that are advantageous in their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. So, over time, those beneficial traits become more common in the population. That seems like a direct inference of natural selection.\n\nOption B says: \"An individual organism undergoes evolution over the course of its lifetime.\" Evolution is typically about changes in populations over generations, not about an individual changing during its own lifetime. In fact, natural selection acts on variations within a population, and those that are better adapted are more likely to pass on their genes. So, this doesn't sound like a correct inference of natural selection.\n\nOption C: \"Habitats do not generally have unlimited resources.\" This is more related to the concept of resource limitation, which can lead to competition among organisms. While this is a foundational idea in ecology and can drive natural selection, it's not directly an inference of natural selection itself. It's more of a\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6 that can lead to natural selection occurring.\n\nOption D: \"Natural populations tend to reproduce to their full biological potential.\" This is similar to Malthusian ideas about population growth, where populations have the potential to increase exponentially. Again, this is more of a background assumption that can lead to natural selection, because if there are more offspring than resources can support, there will be competition, and natural selection can act on the variations among those offspring.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Option A seems to be the most direct inference of natural selection. It's talking about how traits that are better suited for success become more prevalent in subsequent generations, which is exactly what natural selection predicts.\n\nLet me double-check. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population because they affect the survival and reproduction of the organisms that possess them. So, over time, we'd expect to see an increase in the frequency of advantageous traits in the population. That matches Option A perfectly.\n\nOption B is incorrect because evolution occurs in populations over generations, not in individual organisms during their lifetimes. Option C and D are more about the conditions that can lead to natural selection, but they aren't direct inferences of the process itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
