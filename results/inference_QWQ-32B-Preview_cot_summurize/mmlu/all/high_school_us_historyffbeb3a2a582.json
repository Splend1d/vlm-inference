                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Sugar Act of 1764. So, the Sugar Act was a significant piece of legislation passed by the British Parliament in 1764, and it had a big impact on the American colonies. The quote provided gives us some context about the purposes behind the act. It talks about improving revenue, extending and securing navigation and commerce between Great Britain and the colonies, and raising revenue in the colonies to help cover the expenses of defending and protecting them.\n\nNow, the question is asking about the major shift in British policy toward the colonies represented by the Sugar Act. Specifically, it's the first time the British did something new among the options provided. Let's look at each option to see which one fits.\n\nOption A says: \"attempted to control colonial exports.\" Hmm, the Sugar Act was primarily about regulating and taxing imports into the colonies, especially sugar and related products from non-British colonies. It didn't directly control colonial exports; it was more about what the colonies were importing. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption B: \"offered the colonists the opportunity to address Parliament with grievances.\" The Sugar Act doesn't seem to provide any such opportunity. In fact, it was imposed on the colonies without their direct input or representation in Parliament. This was one of the reasons it led to resentment among the colonists, who famously stated that they shouldn't be taxed without representation. So, this doesn't sound right either.\n\nOption C: \"required the colonies to import English goods exclusively.\" This sounds a bit like the concept of mercantilism and the navigation laws, which did impose restrictions on colonial trade to benefit England. However, the Sugar Act was more about taxing certain imports, particularly sugar from the French West Indies, rather than requiring exclusive importation from England. So, while there was an element of directing trade towards British interests, it wasn't strictly about importing English goods exclusively.\n\nOption D: \"levied taxes aimed at raising revenue rather than regulating trade.\" Ah, this seems promising. The key word here is \"revenue.\" The quote mentions that \"a revenue be raised... for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and securing the same.\" So, the primary purpose was to generate income for the British Crown to help pay for the costs associated with protecting the colonies, particularly in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War.\n\nPreviously, British taxes imposed on the colonies, such as the Molasses Act of 1733, were more about regulating trade than raising revenue. The Molasses Act, for example, placed a tax on molasses imported from non-British colonies to encourage the colonies to buy from British West Indian colonies. The main goal was to regulate trade patterns, not necessarily to collect money.\n\nThe Sugar Act of 1764, however, was different. While it did regulate trade by placing duties on certain imports, its explicit purpose was to raise revenue for the British government. This was a significant shift because it was the first time a tax was imposed solely for the purpose of raising money from the colonies for the Crown's expenses, rather than to regulate trade.\n\nThis shift was important because it challenged the colonial understanding of the role of taxation and representation. The colonists had traditionally accepted regulatory taxes, or \"external taxes,\" that controlled trade but resisted \"internal taxes,\" like direct levies on goods consumed within the colonies, because they believed only their own legislatures had the right to impose such taxes.\n\nSo, in summary, the Sugar Act represented a major policy shift because it was the first time the British levied taxes on the colonies specifically for raising revenue rather than for regulating trade. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
