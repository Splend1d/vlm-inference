                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"Which of the following characteristics would allow you to distinguish a prokaryotic cell from an animal cell? A. Ribosomes, B. Cell membrane, C. Chloroplasts, D. Cell wall.\" Hmm, I need to figure out which one of these features is different between prokaryotic and animal cells.\n\nFirst off, let's remember what prokaryotic cells and animal cells are. Prokaryotic cells are the cells of bacteria and archaea. They're simpler and don't have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Animal cells, on the other hand, are eukaryotic cells found in animals, and they have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.\n\nOption A is ribosomes. I know that both prokaryotic and animal cells have ribosomes; they're the sites of protein synthesis. So, ribosomes are present in both types of cells, which means this isn't the distinguishing feature.\n\nOption B is the cell membrane. Again, both prokaryotic and animal cells have cell membranes. The cell membrane is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell and regulating what goes in and out. So, this is also not a distinguishing characteristic.\n\nOption C is chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and some other eukaryotic organisms, like algae, where photosynthesis takes place. Animal cells don't have chloroplasts because they don't perform photosynthesis. Now, prokaryotic cells also don't have chloroplasts; if they perform photosynthesis, they have different structures like photosynthetic membranes. So, neither prokaryotic nor animal cells have chloroplasts, which means this isn't a distinguishing feature between them.\n\nOption D is the cell wall. Let's think about this. Prokaryotic cells typically have a cell wall made of peptidoglycan, which provides structural support and shape to the cell. Animal cells, however, do not have cell walls; they only have cell membranes. This seems like a key difference between prokaryotic and animal cells.\n\nWait a minute, but I recall that plant cells have cell walls too, made of cellulose. So, cell walls are present in some eukaryotic cells, like plants, but not in animal cells. Prokaryotic cells also have cell walls, but they're made of different materials. So, the presence of a cell wall can help distinguish prokaryotic cells from animal cells, since animal cells lack cell walls.\n\nLet me double-check. Prokaryotic cells: usually have cell walls made of peptidoglycan. Animal cells: no cell walls. Plant cells: have cell walls made of cellulose. So, if a cell has a cell wall, it could be either a prokaryotic cell or a plant cell, but definitely not an animal cell.\n\nTherefore, the characteristic that allows distinction between a prokaryotic cell and an animal cell is the cell wall. So, the answer should be D. Cell wall.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's recap:\n\n- Ribosomes: present in both.\n\n- Cell membrane: present in both.\n\n- Chloroplasts: absent in both.\n\n- Cell wall: present in prokaryotic cells, absent in animal cells.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is D. Cell wall.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
