                    "text": "I'm trying to understand which condition would make a slippery-slope argument fallacious. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, what is a slippery-slope argument? It's when someone argues that a particular action or decision will lead to a chain of negative events, often ending in some catastrophic outcome. For example, \"If we allow students to redo this test, next they'll want to redo all their tests, then they'll expect to pass without effort, and eventually, the whole education system will collapse.\"\n\nNow, the question is asking about conditions that would make such an argument fallacious. Fallacious means that there's a mistake in reasoning.\n\nOption A says: \"The envisioned results of the action or practice under consideration turn out not to be bad.\" So, if the outcomes aren't actually negative, does that make the slippery-slope argument fallacious?\n\nWell, in a slippery-slope argument, the negative outcomes are predicted, but if those outcomes aren't bad, or don't happen, that suggests the argument was flawed. So, yes, that could make the argument fallacious.\n\nOption B says: \"The central idea of the argument\u2014that the action or practice under consideration will lead us down a path to disaster\u2014turns out not to be plausible.\" So, if the chain of events isn't likely to happen, that would also make the argument fallacious.\n\nThat makes sense too. If the sequence of events isn't plausible, then the argument is not logically sound.\n\nOption C says both A and B are correct, meaning either condition would make the argument fallacious.\n\nOption D says neither A nor B is correct, meaning neither condition would make the argument fallacious.\n\nGiven that both A and B seem to identify problems with the slippery-slope argument, I think C is the right answer.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Is there a scenario where even if the envisioned results aren't bad, the argument could still be valid?\n\nHmm. Maybe if the argument is about the principle of the action rather than the outcome. For example, allowing students to redo a test sets a precedent that could undermine academic integrity, even if the immediate outcomes aren't bad. In that case, the argument might still hold, even if the envisioned results aren't bad.\n\nWait, but that's still a slippery-slope argument. The problem with slippery-slope arguments is that they often exaggerate the likelihood of the chain reaction or the severity of the outcomes.\n\nSo, if the outcomes aren't bad, or the chain of events isn't plausible, then the argument is indeed fallacious.\n\nTherefore, I believe C is the correct answer: both A and B are correct; either condition would make the argument fallacious.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
