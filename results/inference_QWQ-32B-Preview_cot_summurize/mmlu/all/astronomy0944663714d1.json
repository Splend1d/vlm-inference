                    "text": "Pluto is the dwarf planet in our solar system that's farthest from the Sun. Because it's so distant, its orbit around the Sun takes a really long time compared to Earth's year. So, to figure out how long it takes Pluto to complete one orbit, we need to consider its average distance from the Sun and use some basic principles of orbital mechanics.\n\nFirst, it's important to recall that the time a planet takes to orbit the Sun is related to its average distance from the Sun. This relationship is described by Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion, which states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. In simpler terms, the farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer it takes to complete one orbit.\n\nEarth, for example, is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the Sun on average, and it takes one year to orbit the Sun. Pluto, on the other hand, is much farther away. Its average distance from the Sun is about 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers), which is roughly 40 times farther than Earth's distance from the Sun.\n\nGiven that Pluto is so much farther away, its orbital period should be significantly longer than Earth's. To get a rough estimate, we can use the fact that the orbital period scales with the 3/2 power of the average distance. So, if Pluto is about 40 times farther from the Sun than Earth, its orbital period should be approximately 40 raised to the 3/2 power times longer than Earth's year.\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n40^(3/2) = (40^(1/2))^3 = (sqrt(40))^3 \u2248 (6.32)^3 \u2248 250.\n\nSo, roughly, Pluto's orbital period should be about 250 times longer than Earth's year. Since Earth's year is about 365 days, Pluto's orbital period would be around 250 * 365 \u2248 91,250 days. To convert that into years, we divide by 365: 91,250 / 365 \u2248 250 years.\n\nHowever, to be more precise, we should use the actual average distance of Pluto from the Sun and the gravitational constant in the formula for orbital period. The formula for the orbital period T is:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt(a^3 / \u03bc)\n\nwhere:\n\n- T is the orbital period,\n\n- a is the semi-major axis of the orbit,\n\n- \u03bc is the standard gravitational parameter, which for the Sun is approximately 1.32712440018\u00d710^20 m^3 s^{-2}.\n\nPluto's semi-major axis is about 5.90638 \u00d7 10^12 meters.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nT = 2\u03c0 * sqrt((5.90638 \u00d7 10^12)^3 / (1.32712440018\u00d710^20))\n\nFirst, calculate a^3:\n\n(5.90638 \u00d7 10^12)^3 = 2.057 \u00d7 10^39 m^3\n\nNow, divide by \u03bc:\n\n2.057 \u00d7 10^39 / 1.32712440018\u00d710^20 \u2248 1.55 \u00d7 10^19 s^2\n\nThen, take the square root:\n\nsqrt(1.55 \u00d7 10^19) \u2248 1.245 \u00d7 10^10 seconds\n\nFinally, multiply by 2\u03c0:\n\nT \u2248 2 * 3.1416 * 1.245 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 7.82 \u00d7 10^10 seconds\n\nNow, convert seconds to years:\n\nThere are approximately 3.154 \u00d7 10^7 seconds in a year (365.25 days/year * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute).\n\nSo, T \u2248 7.82 \u00d7 10^10 / 3.154 \u00d7 10^7 \u2248 2479 years\n\nWait, that can't be right. That's much longer than our initial estimate. I must have made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the values:\n\n- Semi-major axis of Pluto: 5.90638 \u00d7 10^12 meters\n\n- Gravitational parameter of the Sun, \u03bc: 1.32712440018\u00d710^20 m^3 s^{-2}\n\nCalculating a^3:\n\n5.90638 \u00d7 10^12)^3 = 2.057 \u00d7 10^39 m^3\n\nThen, a^3 / \u03bc = 2.057 \u00d7 10^39 / 1.32712440018\u00d710^20 \u2248 1.55 \u00d7 10^19 s^2\n\nsqrt(1.55 \u00d7 10^19) \u2248 1.245 \u00d7 10^10 seconds\n\nNow, T = 2\u03c0 * 1.245 \u00d7 10^10 \u2248 7.82 \u00d7 10^10 seconds\n\nConvert to years:\n\n7.82 \u00d7 10^10 / (365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60) \u2248 7.82 \u00d7 10^10 / 3.154 \u00d7 10^7 \u2248 2479 years\n\nHmm, that can't be correct because I know Pluto's orbital period is around 248 years, not 2479 years. I must have messed up the units somewhere.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7c73\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u5929\u6587\u5355\u4f4d\uff08AU\uff09\u4f1a\u66f4\u65b9\u4fbf\u3002\n\n1 AU = 1.495978707 \u00d7 10^11 meters\n\nPluto's semi-major axis is about 39.48 AU.\n\nSo, a = 39.48 AU\n\nIn Kepler's Third Law, when using AU for distance and years for time, the formula simplifies to:\n\nT^2 = a^3\n\nSo, T = sqrt(a^3)\n\nPlugging in a = 39.48 AU:\n\nT = sqrt((39.48)^3) = sqrt(61,500) \u2248 248 years\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, Pluto's orbital period is approximately 248 Earth years.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 150 years\n\nB. 200 years\n\nC. 250 years\n\nD. 300 years\n\nThe closest answer is C. 250 years.\n\nTherefore, the approximate time it takes Pluto to orbit the Sun once is 250 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
