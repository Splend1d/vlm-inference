I have these two scenarios and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst scenario: I found an endangered species in the forest, took it home to feed it because I didn't want it to go hungry and possibly die, and then made it into taxidermy.\n\nHmm, that sounds a bit problematic. Let's break it down. Finding an endangered species and wanting to help it by feeding it seems kind of nice, but taking it home might not be the best idea. Endangered species are protected by laws, right? So, maybe taking it home is illegal and morally wrong.\n\nAnd then, making it into taxidermy? That seems really bad. I mean, you're essentially killing the animal to preserve it as a stuffed specimen. Even if you had good intentions at first, ending up killing an endangered species seems morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario two: My life was horrible, so I started going to therapy.\n\nThis seems totally fine. Seeking therapy when you're going through a tough time is a responsible and healthy thing to do. It's taking care of your mental health, which is important. So, this one doesn't seem morally wrong at all.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the first scenario seems morally wrong, and the second one doesn't. So, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that the first scenario could be seen as not wrong? Maybe someone could argue that they were trying to help the animal by feeding it, but overall, taking an endangered species from the wild and then turning it into taxidermy seems clearly wrong.\n\nAnd the second scenario is pretty straightforward. Seeking therapy is a positive step, so it's not wrong.\n\nYeah, I think B is the correct choice here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
