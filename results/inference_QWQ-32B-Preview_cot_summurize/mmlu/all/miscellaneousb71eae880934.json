The sun was gone, but he had left his footprints in the sky. It was the time for sitting on porches beside the road. It was the time to hear things and talk. These sitters had been tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences all day long. Mules and other brutes had occupied their skins. But now, the sun and the bossman were gone, so the skins felt powerful and human. They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment. Which of the following is the best way of describing the last three sentences of the passage (\"They became . . . in judgment\") ?\n\nA. The sentences emphasize the weariness the sitters feel after a long day's work.\nB. The sentences are used to paint a picture of the way in which the sitters wish they spent their evenings.\nC.

                    "text": "I'm going to analyze this passage from Zora Neale Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God.\" The passage describes a scene at sundown when people gather on porches to talk and listen. It's a transformative moment where the sitters, who have been like \"tongueless, earless, eyeless conveniences\" all day, now feel powerful and human again.\n\nLet's break down the last three sentences: \"They became lords of sounds and lesser things. They passed nations through their mouths. They sat in judgment.\"\n\nFirst, \"lords of sounds and lesser things\" suggests that these sitters now have control over conversation and perhaps even over their environment. \"Sounds\" likely refer to their voices and the words they speak, which now carry weight and authority.\n\nNext, \"they passed nations through their mouths\" is a vivid expression implying that their words have the power to discuss and influence vast topics, perhaps even matters of great importance or far-reaching issues.\n\nFinally, \"they sat in judgment\" directly indicates that they are now in a position to evaluate and critique, to make decisions or opinions about things and people.\n\nOverall, these sentences seem to be describing a shift in the sitters' perception of themselves and their capabilities. After a day of feeling constrained and diminished, perhaps by their work or social roles, the evening brings a sense of freedom and empowerment.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The sentences emphasize the weariness the sitters feel after a long day's work.\n\nThis seems contrary to the passage. The sitters are described as feeling \"powerful and human\" now that the sun and bossman are gone, suggesting a release from weariness rather than an emphasis on it.\n\nB. The sentences are used to paint a picture of the way in which the sitters wish they spent their evenings.\n\nThis might be a possible interpretation, but the text seems to be describing how they actually spend their evenings, not how they wish to. It portrays the evenings as a time when they regain their humanity and authority.\n\nC. The sentences are a vivid way of describing the ease and authority the sitters feel during the evening.\n\nThis aligns well with the analysis above. The sitters feel empowered and authoritative in the evenings, able to control conversation and pass judgment.\n\nD. The sentences highlight the contrast between the feelings of the sitters and the feelings of the bossman.\n\nThere is a contrast presented in the passage, but it's primarily between how the sitters feel during the day versus the evening. The bossman is mentioned but not in a way that suggests his feelings are being highlighted here.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the best description of those last three sentences. They indeed paint a vivid picture of the sitters experiencing ease and authority in the evenings.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
