Institutional\n\nInstitutional racism occurs when policies, practices, and procedures within institutions systematically disadvantage minority groups compared to the majority group. This can manifest in various areas such as education, employment, healthcare, and housing. For example, schools in minority communities may receive less funding, leading to lower quality education; job opportunities may be limited due to discriminatory hiring practices; medical care may be inadequate due to biases in treatment and resource allocation; and housing may be substandard or unavailable in certain areas due to redlining or other discriminatory housing policies. These systemic inequalities perpetuate disparities and limit the opportunities and quality of life for members of minority groups."
