                    "text": "I think the answer is D, all of the above, because each statement seems to capture different aspects of the Vietnam War.\n\nFirst, option A says the war deeply divided the United States and fostered cynicism toward the American government. That rings true because during the war, there were massive protests and public debates about whether the U.S. should be involved. The war was broadcasted on TV, bringing the horrors of combat into people's living rooms, which I think contributed to public skepticism about the government's handling of the conflict.\n\nOption B mentions that the war was an example of the doctrine of containment, aimed at preventing South Vietnam from falling to communists. Containment was a key strategy in the Cold War to prevent the spread of communism. The U.S. got involved in Vietnam to support South Vietnam against the communist North, so this seems accurate too.\n\nOption C talks about how even a great power like the U.S. may not prevail unless there's a clear objective and national will. The Vietnam War is often cited as a example where the U.S., despite its military superiority, couldn't achieve its goals because the objectives were unclear and there was lack of public support over time.\n\nSo, since all three statements seem to be valid points about the Vietnam War, I think D, all of the above, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
