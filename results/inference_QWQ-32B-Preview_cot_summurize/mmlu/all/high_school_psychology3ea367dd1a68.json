                    "text": "Let's think about this question. It's about how objects appear in daylight based on how they reflect light. The options are black, white, dull, or ultraviolet.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what happens when light hits an object. I think that objects have colors because they absorb some wavelengths of light and reflect others. For example, a red object looks red because it reflects red wavelengths and absorbs others.\n\nSo, if an object reflects all wavelengths of light, what color should it appear? I think if something reflects all wavelengths, it should look white. That makes sense because white light is a combination of all colors.\n\nWait, but I've also heard that black objects absorb all wavelengths and reflect none. So, black would be the opposite of reflecting all wavelengths.\n\nWhat about dull? Dull might mean not shiny or not reflecting light evenly. Maybe it reflects light, but in a diffuse way. But the question is about reflecting all wavelengths, not about how it reflects them.\n\nUltraviolet is a type of light that we can't see, so if an object reflects ultraviolet, we wouldn't see that with our eyes.\n\nSo, considering that, the best answer seems to be white, because reflecting all wavelengths would combine to appear white to our eyes.\n\nBut let me double-check. In daylight, which contains all wavelengths of visible light, if an object reflects all of them, our eyes should perceive it as white.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is B. white.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
