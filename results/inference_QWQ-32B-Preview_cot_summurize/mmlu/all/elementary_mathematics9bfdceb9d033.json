                    "text": "So I have this problem about whales migrating, and I need to figure out how much farther humpback whales would have traveled compared to gray whales if the humpbacks kept going at the same rate for 32 days. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the daily travel rate for both types of whales. That way, I can see how far each would go in the same amount of time and then compare them.\n\nStarting with the humpback whales:\n\n- They traveled 2,240 miles in 28 days.\n\nTo find their daily travel rate, I'll divide the total miles by the number of days:\n\n\\( \\text{Humpback daily rate} = \\frac{2,240 \\text{ miles}}{28 \\text{ days}} \\)\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n\\( 2,240 \\div 28 = 80 \\text{ miles per day} \\)\n\nSo, humpback whales travel 80 miles each day.\n\nNow, for the gray whales:\n\n- They traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days.\n\nSimilarly, their daily travel rate is:\n\n\\( \\text{Gray whale daily rate} = \\frac{2,368 \\text{ miles}}{32 \\text{ days}} \\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\( 2,368 \\div 32 = 74 \\text{ miles per day} \\)\n\nSo, gray whales travel 74 miles each day.\n\nNow, the question is asking, if the humpback whales had traveled at the same rate for 32 days, how many more miles would they have traveled than the gray whales?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how far the humpbacks would travel in 32 days at their daily rate of 80 miles.\n\n\\( \\text{Humpback distance in 32 days} = 80 \\text{ miles/day} \\times 32 \\text{ days} \\)\n\n\\( 80 \\times 32 = 2,560 \\text{ miles} \\)\n\nNext, the gray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days, as given.\n\nSo, to find out how many more miles the humpbacks would have traveled compared to the gray whales, I subtract the gray whales' distance from the humpbacks' distance:\n\n\\( 2,560 \\text{ miles} - 2,368 \\text{ miles} = 192 \\text{ miles} \\)\n\nTherefore, the humpback whales would have traveled 192 more miles than the gray whales if both had traveled for 32 days at their respective rates.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 128\n\nB. 192\n\nC. 280\n\nD. 408\n\nThe correct answer is B. 192.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, humpback whales: 2,240 miles in 28 days.\n\nDaily rate: 2,240 \u00f7 28 = 80 miles/day.\n\nGray whales: 2,368 miles in 32 days.\n\nDaily rate: 2,368 \u00f7 32 = 74 miles/day.\n\nIf humpbacks travel for 32 days at 80 miles/day: 80 \u00d7 32 = 2,560 miles.\n\nGray whales traveled 2,368 miles in 32 days.\n\nDifference: 2,560 - 2,368 = 192 miles.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nLet's see: instead of calculating daily rates, perhaps there's a ratio or proportion that could be used.\n\nBut I think the method I used is straightforward and accurate for this scenario.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. 192.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
