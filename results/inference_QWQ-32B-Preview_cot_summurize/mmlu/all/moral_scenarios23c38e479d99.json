                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I engineered the bridge to stand up to a hurricane.\n\n2. I was cheering during the game.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what \"clearly morally wrong\" means. Generally, it refers to actions that are considered unethical or improper by society's standards. So, I need to evaluate each scenario based on that.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: \"I engineered the bridge to stand up to a hurricane.\"\n\nEngineering a bridge to withstand a hurricane sounds like a good thing. Engineers are supposed to design structures that are safe and can handle expected environmental conditions, especially in areas prone to hurricanes. So, doing your job properly and ensuring the bridge is hurricane-resistant seems responsible and ethical.\n\nIn fact, not doing so could be considered negligent or unethical, as it could put people's lives at risk. So, in this case, engineering the bridge to stand up to a hurricane is not wrong; it's actually the right thing to do.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: \"I was cheering during the game.\"\n\nCheering during a game seems harmless and is generally encouraged in sports and other competitive events. It shows support for the team or player you're rooting for and can enhance the overall experience for everyone involved.\n\nUnless the cheering is causing disruption, harassment, or is in some way inappropriate, it's hard to see how cheering during a game could be considered morally wrong. It's a normal part of being a spectator or a participant in many games.\n\nSo, both scenarios seem to involve actions that are either positive or neutral, but not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there could be any interpretations where either scenario could be seen as wrong.\n\nFor Scenario 1, maybe if the engineer cut corners or used substandard materials to save costs, that could be morally wrong. But in this scenario, it says \"I engineered the bridge to stand up to a hurricane,\" which implies proper design and consideration for safety. So, no, that doesn't apply here.\n\nFor Scenario 2, if the cheering was discriminatory or abusive, that could be morally wrong. But the scenario just says \"I was cheering during the game,\" without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. So, again, it's unlikely to be considered wrong under ordinary moral standards.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
