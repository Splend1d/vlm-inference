The options are A. 79%, B. 98%, C. 33%, and D. 57%. I don't remember the exact percentage, but I think it has something to do with the Watergate scandal.\n\nLet me think about this. Nixon resigned in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal, which was a political scandal involving his administration's cover-up of illegal activities. I believe there were public opinion polls at the time that showed how people felt about him.\n\nI recall that the scandal was big news, and there was a lot of pressure on Nixon to step down. I think public opinion was quite against him by the time he resigned. But I'm not sure about the exact percentage.\n\nMaybe I should look back at some history books or find some reliable sources online to get the accurate percentage. But since this is a question, perhaps I can eliminate some options.\n\nOption B says 98%. That seems too high. It's unlikely that almost everyone wanted him removed. Even in a scandal, there are usually some people who support the president.\n\nOption C is 33%. That seems too low. If only 33% wanted him removed, that's just a third of the population, which seems too small given the significance of the Watergate scandal.\n\nOption D is 57%. That's just over half. It's possible, but I feel like public opinion was more strongly against Nixon.\n\nOption A is 79%. That seems high, but given the circumstances of the scandal, it's possible that a large majority wanted him removed.\n\nI think between these options, 79% makes the most sense. It indicates a strong majority against Nixon, but not unanimous opposition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that public opinion might have been more divided than I remember. Perhaps there were people who believed in giving the president the benefit of the doubt or who were loyal to his party.\n\nBut considering the gravity of the Watergate scandal and the eventual resignation, I think a high percentage like 79% is plausible.\n\nMaybe I can try to recall if there were any specific events or milestones in the scandal that might have influenced public opinion.\n\nFor example, there were the famous Saturday Night Massacre, the release of the Nixon tapes, and the impeachment proceedings in Congress. These events probably increased public awareness and disapproval of Nixon's actions.\n\nSo, by the time he resigned, it's likely that a large portion of the public wanted him to step down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps international affairs or other domestic issues were distracting the public, but I don't think that was the case. Watergate was the main story for a long time.\n\nI remember that Congress was moving towards impeachment, and the House had already drawn up articles of impeachment.\n\nIf Congress was ready to impeach him, it's likely that public opinion was also strongly against him.\n\nSo, considering all that, I'm going to go with A. 79%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
