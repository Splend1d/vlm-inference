                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about accounting for research and development costs that have no alternative future use. So, I need to choose the correct method from these options.\n\nOption A says to charge all costs to expense when incurred. That sounds like recognizing the costs immediately as they happen, which might make sense for certain types of expenses.\n\nOption B is to capitalize all costs when incurred. Capitalizing means recording the costs as assets on the balance sheet instead of expenses on the income statement. This is typically done for costs that provide future economic benefits.\n\nOption C suggests capitalizing costs specified by management and charging others to expense. This seems a bit subjective because it depends on management's specifications, which might not be uniformly applied or transparent.\n\nOption D proposes accumulating all costs in a separate component of stockholders' equity until the existence of future benefits can be determined. This seems like deferring the recognition of these costs until more information is available.\n\nNow, I need to think about the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for research and development costs. I recall that research and development activities are uncertain and may not lead to future economic benefits. Therefore, accounting for these costs needs to reflect that uncertainty.\n\nUnder GAAP, research costs are generally required to be expensed as they are incurred because the future economic benefits are uncertain. Development costs, on the other hand, may be capitalized if certain criteria are met, such as the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset, its ability to be used or sold, and the ability to measure its costs reliably.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"research and development costs with no alternative future use.\" This suggests that these costs are not expected to provide future economic benefits beyond their initial purpose, if any.\n\nGiven that, it seems appropriate to expense these costs as they are incurred, which aligns with option A.\n\nOption B, capitalizing all costs, might not be suitable because if there are no alternative future uses, the costs shouldn't be capitalized as assets. Capitalizing costs implies that they will provide future economic benefits, which contradicts the premise.\n\nOption C introduces management's specifications, which isn't a standard accounting practice. It's important to have consistent and principled approaches rather than relying on management's discretion.\n\nOption D suggests accumulating costs in stockholders' equity, which is not a typical treatment for expenses. Usually, expenses reduce equity through retained earnings, but accumulating costs in a separate component of equity seems unusual and not in line with standard accounting practices.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is option A: charging all costs to expense when incurred. This approach reflects the uncertainty and lack of future economic benefits associated with these research and development costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
