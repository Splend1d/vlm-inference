The expression given is:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 380\n\nLet's calculate this step by step.\n\nFirst, break down the multiplication into smaller parts to make it easier:\n\n380 can be thought of as 300 + 80.\n\nSo, 2,817 \u00d7 380 = 2,817 \u00d7 (300 + 80) = (2,817 \u00d7 300) + (2,817 \u00d7 80)\n\nNow, calculate each part separately.\n\nFirst, calculate 2,817 \u00d7 300:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 300 = 2,817 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100 = (2,817 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 100\n\nCalculate 2,817 \u00d7 3:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 3 = (2,000 \u00d7 3) + (800 \u00d7 3) + (17 \u00d7 3) = 6,000 + 2,400 + 51 = 8,451\n\nNow, multiply by 100:\n\n8,451 \u00d7 100 = 845,100\n\nSo, 2,817 \u00d7 300 = 845,100\n\nNext, calculate 2,817 \u00d7 80:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 80 = 2,817 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 10 = (2,817 \u00d7 8) \u00d7 10\n\nCalculate 2,817 \u00d7 8:\n\n2,817 \u00d7 8 = (2,000 \u00d7 8) + (800 \u00d7 8) + (17 \u00d7 8) = 16,000 + 6,400 + 136 = 22,536\n\nNow, multiply by 10:\n\n22,536 \u00d7 10 = 225,360\n\nSo, 2,817 \u00d7 80 = 225,360\n\nNow, add the two results together:\n\n845,100 + 225,360 = ?\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\nFirst, add the thousands:\n\n100 + 360 = 460\n\nThen, add the thousands:\n\n5,100 + 5,360 = 10,460\n\nWait, maybe it's better to align them properly:\n\n```\n\n845,100\n\n+225,360\n\n------\n\n```\n\nAdding the units:\n\n0 + 0 = 0\n\nTens:\n\n0 + 60 = 60\n\nHundreds:\n\n100 + 300 = 400\n\nThousands:\n\n5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000\n\nTen thousands:\n\n40,000 + 20,000 = 60,000\n\nHundred thousands:\n\n800,000 + 200,000 = 1,000,000\n\nNow, sum them up:\n\n1,000,000 + 60,000 + 10,000 + 400 + 60 + 0 = 1,070,460\n\nSo, 845,100 + 225,360 = 1,070,460\n\nTherefore, the total number of gallons of water the homes in West Valley use on average each day is 1,070,460 gallons.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 860,460 gallons\n\nB. 870,460 gallons\n\nC. 1,060,460 gallons\n\nD. 1,070,460 gallons\n\nThe correct answer is D. 1,070,460 gallons.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
