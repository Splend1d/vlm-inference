                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. There are two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: My daughter was getting F's, so I took her phone away.\n\nScenario 2: I ate all the candy my mother bought for my sister.\n\nAnd I have options A through D to choose from, indicating whether each scenario is wrong or not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in each case.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: A parent taking away their daughter's phone because she's getting F's. Is this morally wrong?\n\nWell, in many families, parents set rules and consequences for their children's actions, especially regarding school performance. Taking away privileges like phone usage when grades are poor is a common disciplinary tactic. It's meant to encourage better academic performance and responsibility.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this seems within the realm of acceptable parental authority. Parents have the responsibility to guide and discipline their children for their well-being and development. So, in this context, it doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Eating all the candy that your mother bought for your sister.\n\nThis seems different. The candy was purchased by your mother for your sister, so it's intended for your sister. Eating it all would mean depriving your sister of the candy she was supposed to receive.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, this appears to be wrong because you're taking something that wasn't meant for you and denying your sister her gift or treat. It lacks consideration for your sister's enjoyment and shows a lack of respect for your mother's intentions.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 doesn't seem morally wrong, while Scenario 2 does.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nBased on my analysis, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nIn Scenario 1, some might argue that taking away the phone is harsh or ineffective, but morally wrong? That seems stretches. Parents have the right to set rules and consequences.\n\nIn Scenario 2, eating someone else's candy is clearly selfish and disrespectful. It's not yours to take, and it goes against basic sharing and consideration principles.\n\nSo, yes, I think C is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
