                    "text": "So I've got this question here: Let G denote the set of all n x n non-singular matrices with rational numbers as entries. Then under multiplication, G is a... and it gives options: A. subgroup, B. finite abelian group, C. infinite, non-abelian group, D. infinite, abelian.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what G is. G is the set of all n x n matrices where the entries are rational numbers, and these matrices are non-singular, which means they have inverses. So, G is the set of invertible n x n matrices with rational entries.\n\nNow, it's asking about the properties of G under multiplication. So, I need to think about how these matrices behave when multiplied together.\n\nFirst, is G a subgroup? Well, subgroup of what? Because to be a subgroup, G has to be a subset of some larger group, and it has to be closed under the group operation and inverses.\n\nWait, actually, in this context, it's probably assuming that G is a subgroup of the general linear group GL(n, Q), which is the group of all invertible n x n matrices with rational entries under multiplication. So, G is GL(n, Q). So, G is itself a group, so it's a subgroup of itself. But maybe that's too trivial. Maybe it's expecting a different answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering G as a subgroup of the group of all n x n matrices under addition, but that doesn't make sense because addition wouldn't preserve invertibility. So, probably, G is a subgroup of GL(n, Q), which is already G, so that seems circular.\n\nMaybe option A is not the best answer in this context.\n\nOption B is finite abelian group. Is G finite? Well, the entries are rational numbers, which are infinite in number. So, for each entry in the n x n matrix, there are infinitely many choices of rational numbers. Therefore, G is infinite, so option B is not correct.\n\nOption C is infinite, non-abelian group. Option D is infinite, abelian.\n\nSo, I need to determine whether G is abelian or not.\n\nIn other words, is matrix multiplication commutative for these matrices?\n\nWell, in general, matrix multiplication is not commutative. There are matrices A and B such that AB \u2260 BA.\n\nSo, unless n = 1, in which case n x n matrices are just rational numbers and multiplication is commutative, but for n \u2265 2, matrix multiplication is not commutative.\n\nTherefore, G is non-abelian for n \u2265 2.\n\nBut the question says \"all n x n matrices,\" which presumably includes n = 1.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider n = 1 as a special case.\n\nFor n = 1, G is just the set of non-zero rational numbers under multiplication, which is abelian.\n\nBut the question says \"all n x n matrices,\" so probably n is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nBut in that case, G would include both abelian and non-abelian cases depending on n.\n\nWait, but probably n is fixed here, since it's \"n x n matrices.\" So, n is a fixed integer greater than or equal to 1.\n\nSo, if n = 1, G is the non-zero rationals under multiplication, which is abelian.\n\nFor n \u2265 2, G is non-abelian.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify n, so maybe it's assuming n \u2265 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is always infinite, and whether it's abelian or not depends on n.\n\nBut looking at the options, only option C mentions infinite and non-abelian, and option D mentions infinite and abelian.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer depends on n.\n\nBut since n is part of the definition, and not specified further, maybe it's expecting a general answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering n \u2265 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C, infinite non-abelian group, assuming n \u2265 2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D, infinite abelian, but only for n = 1.\n\nBut in that case, it's not generally abelian for n \u2265 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is a subgroup, but that seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps option A is subgroup, but of what?\n\nMaybe it's expecting to say that G is a subgroup of GL(n, R), the general linear group over the reals.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G is a subgroup of the group of all n x n matrices under addition, but that doesn't make sense because G consists of invertible matrices, and addition doesn't preserve invertibility.\n\nWait, no, G is a subgroup of GL(n, Q), which is already G, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's considering G as a subgroup of M(n, Q), the set of all n x n matrices with rational entries, under multiplication, where multiplication is defined only when the matrices are invertible.\n\nBut that seems forced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering G as a subgroup of M(n, Q) under addition, but again, that doesn't make sense because G is the invertible matrices, which don't form a subgroup under addition.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider the properties one by one.\n\nFirst, is G infinite?\n\nWell, since the entries are rational numbers, and there are infinitely many rational numbers, and an n x n matrix has n\u00b2 entries, there are infinitely many possible matrices in G.\n\nTherefore, G is infinite.\n\nSo, options B and C are possible, but option A and D also include infinite groups.\n\nWait, option A is just \"subgroup,\" which could be finite or infinite, I suppose.\n\nBut probably, since G is infinite, it's expecting to identify it as an infinite group.\n\nSo, between options C and D, I need to decide whether G is abelian or non-abelian.\n\nAs I thought earlier, for n \u2265 2, matrix multiplication is not commutative, so G is non-abelian.\n\nFor n = 1, G is abelian.\n\nBut since n is part of the definition and not specified further, maybe the answer depends on n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes n \u2265 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, infinite non-abelian group, with the understanding that for n = 1, it's abelian, but for n \u2265 2, it's non-abelian.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D, infinite abelian, but only for n = 1.\n\nBut in that case, it's not generally abelian for n \u2265 2.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is a subgroup of GL(n, Q), which is already G, so that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is an infinite, non-abelian group for n \u2265 2.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C.\n\nBut I feel like I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is an infinite group, and it's abelian if n = 1, and non-abelian otherwise.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify n, maybe it's expecting a more general answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, infinite non-abelian group, with the implication that for n = 1, it's abelian, but for n \u2265 2, it's non-abelian.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that G is a subgroup of GL(n, R), the general linear group over the reals.\n\nIn that case, G would be a subgroup of GL(n, R), and since GL(n, R) is non-abelian for n \u2265 2, G would also be non-abelian for n \u2265 2.\n\nBut again, for n = 1, it's abelian.\n\nBut perhaps the question is considering G as a subgroup of GL(n, R), and hence option A is correct.\n\nBut option A just says \"subgroup,\" without specifying of what, which seems incomplete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering G as a group in its own right, in which case it's an infinite, non-abelian group for n \u2265 2.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D, infinite abelian, but only for n = 1.\n\nBut again, n is part of the definition.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C, infinite non-abelian group, with the understanding that for n = 1, it's abelian, but for n \u2265 2, it's non-abelian.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is a subgroup of GL(n, Q), which is already G, so that seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that G is an infinite, non-abelian group.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final
