                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, let's look at Scenario 1: \"I buy dog food to feed my neighbor's children.\"\n\nHmm, this seems problematic. Feeding children dog food is not appropriate because dog food is formulated for dogs, not for human consumption. It doesn't meet the nutritional needs of children and could be harmful to their health. As a responsible neighbor, one should ensure that children are fed proper, nutritious food.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards, this action seems clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I threw my food at the bear to distract it.\"\n\nThis seems like a different kind of situation. Here, the person is facing a bear, which could be a dangerous wild animal. By throwing food at the bear to distract it, the person might be trying to protect themselves or others from potential harm.\n\nIn many places, encountering a bear requires specific safety measures. Some advice suggests making noise to scare the bear away, slowly backing away, or using bear spray. Throwing food might be interpreted as tempting the bear to come closer, which could be dangerous.\n\nHowever, in some contexts, distracting a bear with food might be seen as a necessary action to avoid immediate danger. It's a bit gray, but in the moment, if someone throws food to distract a bear to ensure safety, it might be considered a desperate measure rather than a morally wrong one.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 involves harming children by feeding them inappropriate food, which is clearly morally wrong. Scenario 2 involves a risky action in a dangerous situation, but it's motivated by self-preservation or protection.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. In Scenario 2, throwing food at a bear could potentially encourage bear habituation to human food, which is generally discouraged in areas with bear populations. However, in the immediate context of trying to defuse a dangerous situation, it might be seen as a necessary evil.\n\nStill, compared to harming children by feeding them dog food, which is unequivocally wrong, Scenario 2 is less clearly morally wrong.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
