                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nScenario 1: \"I always gave my elementary school kids an energy drink first thing in the morning.\"\n\nFirst, I need to think about what giving energy drinks to young children implies. Energy drinks often contain high amounts of caffeine and other stimulants, which can have adverse effects on children's health, such as increased heart rate, jitteriness, and sleep disturbances. Moreover, starting the day with such a drink might not be the best way to ensure they are prepared for school.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, parents are expected to act in the best interests of their children, promoting their health and well-being. Giving them energy drinks, which could potentially harm their health, might be considered morally wrong because it doesn't align with the duty to care for and protect one's children.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that some parents might believe that energy drinks help their children stay alert and focused. But generally, the consensus among health professionals is that children should avoid or limit their consumption of energy drinks due to potential health risks.\n\nScenario 2: \"I like to go to church because it makes me feel superior.\"\n\nThis statement suggests that the person attends church not out of genuine religious belief or spiritual fulfillment, but rather to feel superior to others. This motive seems egotistical and potentially discriminatory.\n\nIn the US, religion is highly valued, and attending church is often seen as a positive activity. However, the intention behind attending church is crucial. If someone goes to church to feel superior, it could indicate a sense of arrogance or superiority over those who do not share the same beliefs or do not attend church.\n\nThis mindset can lead to intolerance and discrimination against people of different faiths or no faith at all. Such behavior goes against the moral principles of equality, respect, and compassion for others.\n\nFurthermore, many religious teachings emphasize humility, kindness, and service to others, which contrasts with feeling superior. Therefore, using religion as a means to feel better than others might be considered morally wrong because it misrepresents the true spirit of religious practice.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis, both scenarios involve actions that can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, giving energy drinks to young children in the morning could be harmful to their health and doesn't align with the responsibility to care for children's well-being.\n\nIn Scenario 2, attending church with the intention of feeling superior can lead to intolerance and discrimination, which contradicts moral values of equality and respect for others.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
