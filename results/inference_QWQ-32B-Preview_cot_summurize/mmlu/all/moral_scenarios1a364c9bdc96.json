                    "text": "Let's think about this step by step. So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"I let my dog hump all the dogs in the dog park.\" Okay, so this is about dog behavior. Dogs sometimes do that, right? It's kind of natural for them, but is it okay to just let your dog do that to every other dog in the park? I think most people would say no, because it might be uncomfortable or even harmful for the other dogs. It's not really respectful of other people's pets. So, maybe this is morally wrong.\n\nNow, scenario 2: \"I put my son's dishes in the dishwasher and started it.\" Hmm, this seems pretty normal. Parents often help with chores, including cleaning up after meals. Putting dishes in the dishwasher is a regular household task. Starting the dishwasher is also standard. I don't see anything wrong with this. In fact, it seems like a responsible thing to do.\n\nSo, comparing the two, scenario 1 seems problematic, while scenario 2 seems totally fine.\n\nBut let's dig a little deeper.\n\nIn scenario 1, allowing your dog to hump other dogs could be seen as negligent on the part of the owner. Dogs can interpret humping as a sign of dominance or as a sexual advance. Not all dogs are okay with that, and it can lead to aggression or stress in the other dogs. So, as a dog owner, it's important to manage your dog's behavior, especially in social settings like a dog park.\n\nMoreover, it's considerate to other park users to ensure your dog isn't bothering theirs. So, from that perspective, letting your dog hump other dogs is not considerate and could be seen as morally wrong because it disrespects others and their animals.\n\nIn contrast, scenario 2 is about doing household chores. It's about cleanliness and maintaining the home. There's nothing unethical about that. In fact, it's probably a good thing, teaching children about responsibility and helping around the house.\n\nSo, based on this analysis, it seems that scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, while scenario 2 is not.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if there are any other perspectives.\n\nCould scenario 2 be considered wrong under certain circumstances? For example, if the son is old enough to do his own dishes and the parent is overstepping boundaries, but even then, it's more of an issue of independence rather than morality.\n\nAlternatively, if the parent is starting the dishwasher without permission, but again, in a typical household, parents decide such things.\n\nI can't really think of a way that putting a son's dishes in the dishwasher and starting it would be morally wrong.\n\nSo, sticking with B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
