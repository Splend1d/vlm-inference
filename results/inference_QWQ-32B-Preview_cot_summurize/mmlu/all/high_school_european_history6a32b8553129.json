One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds.

Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.\n\u2014Voltaire, in a letter, 1755\nWhich of the following Enlightenment philosophes questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about Voltaire's response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and it's asking which Enlightenment philosopher questioned reliance on reason and began the Romantic Movement for the rationale given. So, I need to connect Voltaire's thoughts after the earthquake to one of these philosophers and their ideas.\n\nFirst, let's recall what Voltaire said. He's expressing horror at the devastation caused by the earthquake, mentioning the cruelty of nature and the suffering of people, including the loss of many lives and destruction of property. He also makes a sarcastic remark about the Inquisition, hoping that the inquisitors were also crushed, which suggests he sees this as a critique of religious institutions.\n\nVoltaire was a key figure in the Enlightenment, known for his advocacy of civil liberties and his criticism of religious dogma. The Enlightenment was characterized by a faith in reason as a means to understand and improve the world. However, events like the Lisbon earthquake posed a challenge to this optimistic view, raising questions about the nature of suffering and the justice of the world.\n\nNow, the question is linking this to the beginning of the Romantic Movement, which is generally seen as a reaction against the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason. Romanticism valued emotion, individualism, and the sublime in nature, among other things.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\n\nRousseau is often associated with Romanticism for his emphasis on emotion and the natural goodness of humanity, which he believed was corrupted by society. His ideas did influence the Romantic Movement.\n\nB. Baron Montesquieu because he thought that governments were not capable of being fair.\n\nMontesquieu is more associated with Enlightenment political thought, particularly his ideas on the separation of powers, which influenced many democratic constitutions. His critique of government is more about political structures rather than a rejection of reason.\n\nC. Mary Wollstonecraft because she railed against the subjugation of women emotionally.\n\nWollstonecraft was an Enlightenment thinker who argued for women's rights based on reason. While she did write about emotions and education, her approach was rooted in Enlightenment rationalism.\n\nD. Adam Smith because he stated that reason could not be used to understand how another feels.\n\nAdam Smith is known for his economic theories and also wrote about moral sentiments. He did discuss the limits of reason in understanding others' feelings, but his overall approach was still within the Enlightenment framework.\n\nGiven this, option A seems the most aligned with the transition towards Romanticism. Rousseau's critique of society and his emphasis on emotion and the natural state of humanity resonate with the Romantic Movement's values.\n\nMoreover, Voltaire's response to the Lisbon earthquake might have contributed to a questioning of the Enlightenment optimism, as expressed by philosophers like Leibniz, who talked about the \"best of all possible worlds.\" Voltaire's pessimism and emphasis on the cruelty of nature could be seen as moving towards a more Romantic perspective that values emotion and questions the adequacy of reason alone to comprehend the world's suffering.\n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A. Jean-Jacques Rousseau because he thought society corrupted noble souls.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
