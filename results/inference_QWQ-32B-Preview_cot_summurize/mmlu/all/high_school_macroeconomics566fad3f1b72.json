So, we're talking about how an increase in the federal deficit might affect the demand for loan funds, the real interest rate, and investment spending. We need to figure out the correct sequence of effects from these changes.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand what a federal deficit is. A federal deficit occurs when a government's expenditures exceed its revenues, typically from taxes. So, if the government is spending more than it's taking in, it needs to borrow money to make up the difference. This borrowing usually happens in the financial markets, where the government issues bonds to raise funds.\n\nNow, when the government increases its borrowing, it's essentially increasing the demand for loanable funds in the financial market. Loanable funds are the funds available for lending to businesses and individuals for investment and other purposes. So, if the government is borrowing more, it's competing with private borrowers for those same funds.\n\nThis increased demand for loanable funds from the government can shift the demand curve to the right in the loanable funds market. According to the basic principles of supply and demand, when demand increases and supply remains constant, prices rise. In this context, the \"price\" of loanable funds is the interest rate. Therefore, an increase in the demand for loanable funds due to higher government borrowing should lead to an increase in the real interest rate.\n\nSo, the first part of the sequence is: Demand for loanable funds increases, leading to an increase in the real interest rate.\n\nNext, we need to consider how this higher real interest rate affects investment spending. Investment spending by businesses and households is sensitive to interest rates because borrowing costs are higher when interest rates are up. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can discourage investment. Therefore, an increase in the real interest rate is likely to lead to a decrease in investment spending.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Demand for loanable funds increases.\n\n- Real interest rate increases.\n\n- Investment spending decreases.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Increases | Increases | Increases\n\nB. Decreases | Decreases | Decreases\n\nC. Decreases | Decreases | Increases\n\nD. Increases | Increases | Decreases\n\nOption D matches our analysis.\n\nHowever, it's always a good idea to double-check our reasoning. Let's consider if there are any other factors that might come into play.\n\nFor instance, sometimes, an increase in government borrowing can lead to what's called \"crowding out.\" This is the idea that government borrowing competes with private borrowing, driving up interest rates and reducing private investment. This seems consistent with what we've just outlined.\n\nBut perhaps there are scenarios where this doesn't hold. For example, if the central bank decides to increase the money supply to keep interest rates from rising, that could mitigate the effect on investment spending. However, the question is about the federal deficit affecting the demand for loan funds and subsequently the real interest rate and investment spending, assuming other factors are held constant.\n\nAdditionally, if the government increases its deficit by increasing spending on infrastructure or other productive investments, this might have a positive impact on economic growth, which could stimulate private investment despite higher interest rates. But again, the question seems to be focusing on the direct effects through the loanable funds market.\n\nGiven that, I think our initial analysis holds: an increase in the federal deficit leads to higher demand for loanable funds, which increases the real interest rate and decreases investment spending.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D: Increases | Increases | Decreases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
