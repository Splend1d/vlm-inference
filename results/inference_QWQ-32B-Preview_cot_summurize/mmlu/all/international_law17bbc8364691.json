                    "text": "So I've got this question here about reservations in treaties, and I need to figure out under what circumstances a reservation is considered invalid under international law. The options are:\n\nA. When the majority of State parties object to it.\n\nB. When an international tribunal says so.\n\nC. When it's incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law (jus cogens).\n\nD. When it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what a reservation is in the context of treaties. A reservation is basically when a state party to a treaty expresses its disagreement with certain provisions of the treaty at the time of accession or ratification. It's like saying, \"We'll join this treaty, but we don't agree with this part, so we're not going to apply it.\"\n\nNow, the question is about when such a reservation is invalid. So, invalid means that the reservation isn't accepted under international law, and the state can't get away with modifying the treaty in that way.\n\nOption A says that a reservation is invalid when the majority of State parties object to it. Hmm, that sounds like a democratic approach, but in international law, decisions aren't always based on majority rules, especially concerning treaty interpretations. I think there might be a more specific legal standard for determining the validity of reservations.\n\nOption B suggests that a reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so. Well, international tribunals do interpret and apply international law, but they don't necessarily have jurisdiction over all treaty reservations unless specifically provided for. Moreover, many treaties have their own mechanisms for dealing with reservations, so I'm not sure if this is the right answer.\n\nOption C states that a reservation is invalid only when it's incompatible with a peremptory norm of international law, or jus cogens. Jus cogens norms are fundamental principles of international law from which no derogation is permitted, like prohibitions against genocide, slavery, or torture. So, if a reservation tries to opt out of such a norm, it should indeed be invalid. That makes sense.\n\nOption D says that a reservation is invalid when it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. This also sounds plausible because a reservation that undermines the main goals of the treaty would defeat the very reason for the treaty's existence.\n\nNow, I need to think about which of these options is the correct statement under the law of treaties. I recall that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties deals with reservations, so maybe I should refer to that.\n\nArticle 19 of the Vienna Convention says that a reservation is permissible unless:\n\n(a) The reservation is prohibited by the treaty;\n\n(b) The treaty provides that only specified reservations, which do not include the reservation in question, may be made; or\n\n(c) The reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\nSo, according to Article 19, a reservation is invalid if it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. That seems to correspond with option D.\n\nBut option C mentions jus cogens, which is also important. Article 53 of the Vienna Convention states that a treaty is void if it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. However, specifically regarding reservations, Article 27 says that a party cannot invoke its internal law as justification for failing to perform a treaty, but I'm not sure if that directly addresses the validity of reservations concerning jus cogens.\n\nWait, Article 53 talks about the invalidity of treaties conflicting with jus cogens, not specifically about reservations. Maybe there's another article that deals with reservations and jus cogens.\n\nUpon checking, it seems that the Vienna Convention doesn't explicitly state that a reservation incompatible with jus cogens is invalid, but it's a general principle that jus cogens norms cannot be derogated from. So, if a reservation seeks to opt out of a jus cogens norm, it should be invalid.\n\nBut comparing options C and D, both seem relevant, but according to the Vienna Convention, option D seems more directly related to the validity of reservations.\n\nOption A, about majority objection, doesn't seem to have a solid basis in the Vienna Convention. It's more about specific objections by other parties. Article 20 of the Vienna Convention allows other parties to object to a reservation, but it doesn't say that a majority objection is required to invalidate a reservation.\n\nOption B, about international tribunals, isn't the primary determinant of the validity of reservations, although tribunals can interpret and apply the law regarding reservations.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the correct answer is D: a reservation is invalid when it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\nOption C is also important because reservations that conflict with jus cogens are invalid, but according to the Vienna Convention, incompatibility with the object and purpose is the specific criterion for invalidity of reservations.\n\nMaybe both C and D are correct, but since it's a multiple-choice question, I have to pick one.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that incompatibility with jus cogens is a separate ground for invalidity.\n\nUpon further reflection, I think both C and D could be correct, but in the context of the Vienna Convention, option D is more directly related to the validity of reservations.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for when a reservation is considered invalid under the law of treaties, and considering that jus cogens norms are fundamental and cannot be derogated from, I think both options C and D could be valid reasons for invalidity.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects the answer based on the Vienna Convention's explicit provisions.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option D: a reservation is invalid when it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
