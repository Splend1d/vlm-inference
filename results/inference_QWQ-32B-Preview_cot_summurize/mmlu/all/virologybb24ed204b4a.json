                    "text": "Let's see what interferons are and how they work in our defense against viruses. I remember that interferons are proteins made and released by host cells in response to the presence of pathogens, especially viruses. They basically act as signals to alert neighboring cells to heighten their defenses against viral infections.\n\nOption A says that interferons bind to viruses directly. Hmm, I don't think that's how they work. Interferons are more about signaling between cells rather than directly interacting with viruses.\n\nOption B mentions that they bind to neighboring cells. That sounds plausible because interferons are known to attach to receptors on the surface of nearby cells, triggering a response that helps those cells resist viral infection.\n\nOption C talks about producing a long-lasting state of resistance. Interferons do induce an antiviral state in cells, but is it long-lasting? I think the effects can be quite potent but may not last indefinitely. Maybe this isn't the best description.\n\nOption D says that interferons inhibit virus-induced enzymes. While interferons do have effects that can inhibit viral processes, including enzyme activities, I think their primary mechanism is more about activating cellular defenses rather than directly inhibiting viral enzymes.\n\nLet me think again. The key function of interferons is to signal to neighboring cells to prepare for a viral attack. They do this by binding to specific receptors on the surfaces of these cells, which then sets off a series of intracellular events leading to the production of proteins that interfere with viral replication. That's why they're called \"interferons\" because they interfere with viral growth.\n\nSo, considering that, option B seems the most accurate: binding to neighboring cells to alert them to the presence of a virus and activate their antiviral defenses.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider each option again.\n\nOption A: Binding to viruses. I don't recall interferons having a direct role in binding to viruses. Their main role is in cell-to-cell communication.\n\nOption B: Binding to neighboring cells. Yes, they bind to interferon receptors on the surfaces of neighboring cells.\n\nOption C: Producing a long-lasting state of resistance. While the effects of interferons can be robust, they are part of the innate immune response, which is rapid but not necessarily long-lasting like the adaptive immune response.\n\nOption D: Inhibiting virus-induced enzymes. Interferons do induce the production of proteins that can inhibit viral enzymes, but that's more of a downstream effect rather than their primary mode of action.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best answer is B: binding to neighboring cells to activate their antiviral defenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
