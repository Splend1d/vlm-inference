                    "text": "To determine which change in a circuit will always result in an increase in current, we need to recall Ohm's Law, which states that the current (I) through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the conductor. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{V}{R} \\]\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this relationship:\n\n**Option A: Increased voltage and increased resistance**\n\n- If voltage increases, current increases (direct proportionality).\n- If resistance increases, current decreases (inverse proportionality).\n- Therefore, the effect on current is uncertain because it depends on which factor changes more.\n\n**Option B: Decreased voltage and decreased resistance**\n\n- If voltage decreases, current decreases.\n- If resistance decreases, current increases.\n- Again, the net effect on current is uncertain without knowing the relative magnitudes of the changes.\n\n**Option C: Increased voltage and decreased resistance**\n\n- If voltage increases, current increases.\n- If resistance decreases, current increases.\n- Both changes act to increase current, so current will definitely increase.\n\n**Option D: Decreased voltage and increased resistance**\n\n- If voltage decreases, current decreases.\n- If resistance increases, current decreases.\n- Both changes act to decrease current, so current will definitely decrease.\n\nGiven this analysis, the only option that will always result in an increase in current is Option C: Increased voltage and decreased resistance.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
