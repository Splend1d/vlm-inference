                    "text": "So I have this polynomial: 8x\u00b3 + 6x\u00b2 - 9x + 24, and I need to figure out if it satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over the rationals, Q. The options are A: yes, with p=2; B: yes, with p=3; C: yes, with p=5; or D: no.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Eisenstein criterion is. It's a test to determine if a polynomial is irreducible over the rationals. The criterion states that for a polynomial f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 with integer coefficients, if there exists a prime number p such that:\n\n1. p divides each a_i for i < n (so p divides a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, ..., a_0),\n\n2. p does not divide a_n, and\n\n3. p\u00b2 does not divide a_0,\n\nthen f(x) is irreducible over Q.\n\nSo, for my polynomial 8x\u00b3 + 6x\u00b2 - 9x + 24, the coefficients are a3 = 8, a2 = 6, a1 = -9, and a0 = 24.\n\nI need to check for each option:\n\nA: p=2\n\nCheck if 2 divides a2, a1, and a0; 2 does not divide a3; and 2\u00b2=4 does not divide a0.\n\n- 2 divides 6 (a2), -9 (a1), and 24 (a0)? Yes, 6/2=3, -9/2=-4.5, wait, -9 divided by 2 is -4.5, which is not an integer. So, 2 does not divide -9. Hmm, that's a problem. Eisenstein requires that p divides all a_i for i < n, which in this case is a2, a1, and a0. Since 2 doesn't divide a1 (-9), option A is not satisfied.\n\nB: p=3\n\nCheck if 3 divides a2, a1, and a0; 3 does not divide a3; and 3\u00b2=9 does not divide a0.\n\n- 3 divides 6 (a2): 6/3=2, yes.\n\n- 3 divides -9 (a1): -9/3=-3, yes.\n\n- 3 divides 24 (a0): 24/3=8, yes.\n\n- 3 does not divide 8 (a3): 8/3 is not an integer, so yes.\n\n- 3\u00b2=9 does not divide 24 (a0): 24/9=2.666..., which is not an integer, so yes.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied for p=3. So, option B seems correct.\n\nC: p=5\n\nCheck if 5 divides a2, a1, and a0; 5 does not divide a3; and 5\u00b2=25 does not divide a0.\n\n- 5 divides 6 (a2): 6/5=1.2, not an integer, so no. So, Eisenstein fails here because p doesn't divide a2.\n\nD: No.\n\nBut option B already works, so D is not correct.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that option B is indeed correct and that there are no mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check for p=3:\n\n- a3 = 8, 3 does not divide 8: correct.\n\n- a2 = 6, 3 divides 6: correct.\n\n- a1 = -9, 3 divides -9: correct.\n\n- a0 = 24, 3 divides 24: correct.\n\n- Moreover, 3\u00b2=9 does not divide 24: correct.\n\nSo, all conditions for Eisenstein's criterion are satisfied with p=3, which means the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\n\nIs there any other prime that could work? Let's check p=2 again quickly, even though it didn't work earlier.\n\nFor p=2:\n\n- a3 = 8, 2 divides 8: wait, no! 2 divides 8, but Eisenstein requires that p does not divide the leading coefficient a_n, which is a3=8 in this case. Wait, I think I messed up earlier.\n\nWait, Eisenstein requires that p does not divide a_n, which is a3=8 for p=2. Does 2 divide 8? Yes, 8 is divisible by 2. Wait, that's a mistake. If p divides a_n, then Eisenstein cannot be applied with that p.\n\nWait, no, Eisenstein requires that p does not divide a_n. So, for p=2, since 2 divides 8, which is a3, this condition fails. So, p=2 cannot be used.\n\nWait, but in my initial check, I thought 2 divides a3, which is correct, but Eisenstein requires that p does not divide a_n. So, actually, for p=2, since 2 divides a3, Eisenstein cannot be applied, which means option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is correct, as p=3 satisfies all conditions.\n\nOption C is incorrect because p=5 does not divide a2=6.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B: Yes, with p=3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
