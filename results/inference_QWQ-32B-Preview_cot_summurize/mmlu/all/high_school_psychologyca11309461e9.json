Freud would probably say this is an example of a defense mechanism. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Repression: That's when you push unwanted thoughts or feelings deep down into your unconscious. But in this case, Chantal is actively projecting qualities onto her mom that she herself has.\n\nB. Regression: That's when you go back to an earlier stage of development in behavior. Like, acting like a child when you're upset. Doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nC. Projection: This is when you attribute your own undesirable traits or feelings to someone else. So, if Chantal doesn't want to acknowledge that she's domineering and overbearing, she might project those traits onto her mom.\n\nD. Displacement: That's redirecting feelings from the original object to a safer one. For example, being angry at your boss but kicking the dog instead.\n\nGiven that Chantal is attributing her own characteristics to her mom, projection seems to be the most fitting defense mechanism here. So, the answer should be C. Projection.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
