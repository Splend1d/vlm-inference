Over the course of time, the land-development company developed two residential subdivisions of the land, an eastern subdivision and a western subdivision, each of which contained 150 acres. These subdivisions were created by separate plats that made no reference to each other. The restrictions in the plats were, however, substantially identical. The plats and each deed provided that \"the use of the land herein conveyed is restricted to single-family dwellings only, and this covenant is intended to apply to each and every lot in the subdivision and runs with the land, binding every lot owner, his heirs, and assigns. \"After all but four lots in each subdivision had been sold by the land-development company, it sold 50 acres of the remaining 100 acres of land to a country club by a deed containing the following provisions:\"This deed is executed and accepted with the understanding that the property above described is hereby restricted so that(1) said property may be used as a country club, with a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other improvements appropriate to a country club. (2) said property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern subdivision and the property shall thereafter be used in accordance with and conveyed subject to residential restrictions that shall conform with those restrictions in force against the eastern subdivision. (3) the restrictions herein contained shall be deemed covenants running with the land, and for breach of any covenant herein, the land development company, its successors, and assigns may, at its option, re-enter and terminate the estate conveyed hereby. \"At the time of this conveyance, the land- development company retained title to the remaining 50 acres in the original 400-acre tract. Within a few months of the execution of this deed, the country club had built a club house, golf course, and tennis courts on a portion of its land, and it had 25 acres of vacant land upon which it wished to build a complex containing a hotel and shopping mall surrounded by high-rise buildings and luxury apartments. With respect to the 50-acre tract that the country club purchased from the land-development company, which of the following most accurately describes the deed restrictions (1) and (2)?\n\nA. Affirmative covenant(s).\nB. Equitable easement(s).\nC. Express easement(s) appurtenant.\nD. Equitable servitude(s).\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what kind of restrictions are imposed by provisions (1) and (2) in the deed from the land-development company to the country club. The options are affirmative covenants, equitable easements, express easements appurtenant, or equitable servitudes. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nAn affirmative covenant is a promise to do something, like maintaining a property in a certain way or contributing to a homeowners' association.\n\nAn equitable easement is a type of easement that is enforced in equity, often related to land use restrictions.\n\nAn express easement appurtenant is a right granted to use another's land in a specific way, and it benefits a particular piece of land.\n\nAn equitable servitude is a type of easement that runs with the land and binds successive owners, often used in the context of restrictive covenants in subdivisions.\n\nNow, looking at the deed restrictions:\n\n(1) The property may be used as a country club with specific features like a golf course, pool, tennis courts, club house, eating facilities, and other appropriate improvements.\n\n(2) The property may also be subdivided and platted as a residential subdivision similar to the eastern subdivision, with residential restrictions conforming to those in the eastern subdivision.\n\nSo, restriction (1) allows for certain uses of the property, specifically for a country club with specified amenities. Restriction (2) allows for subdivision into a residential area with restrictions similar to an existing subdivision.\n\nI think both of these are types of land use restrictions that run with the land, meaning they affect not just the current owner but also future owners. This sounds a lot like equitable servitudes.\n\nAffirmative covenants typically require the owner to do something, like maintain the property or pay fees, whereas these restrictions are more about what can and cannot be done with the land.\n\nEquitable easements and express easements appurtenant are types of easements, which generally grant a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. Here, the restrictions are more about limiting uses rather than granting rights to use the land.\n\nEquitable servitudes, on the other hand, are covenants that run with the land and are enforceable against subsequent owners. They are often used in subdivisions to maintain certain standards or restrictions on land use.\n\nGiven that, I think both restrictions (1) and (2) are best described as equitable servitudes because they are restrictions on land use that run with the land and bind future owners.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nRestriction (1) specifies how the property can be used, which is a classic example of a restrictive covenant that would be an equitable servitude.\n\nRestriction (2) allows for subdivision into a residential area with specific restrictions, again, this is about imposing restrictions on how the land can be used, which aligns with equitable servitudes.\n\nAffirmative covenants usually involve some positive action, like maintaining common areas or paying dues, which isn't directly addressed here.\n\nEquitable easements and express easements appurtenant are more about granting rights to use land, not restricting its use.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description for both restrictions (1) and (2) is equitable servitudes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. Equitable servitudes."
