Bowie knife. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all these terms, but let's see what I can figure out.\n\nFirst off, \"Arkansas toothpick\" sounds like some kind of weapon or tool, maybe related to knives or something like that. I've heard of Bowie knives, which are big knives named after Jim Bowie, a famous knife fighter from Arkansas. So, maybe it's related to that.\n\nOption A is Scottie Pippen, who is a former professional basketball player. That doesn't seem related to a toothpick or any kind of knife, so I can probably rule that out.\n\nOption B is spare rib, which is a type of food, specifically a cut of meat from the pig. That doesn't sound like a toothpick or a knife, so that seems unlikely.\n\nOption C is pinkie finger, which is the smallest finger on your hand. Again, not really related to a toothpick or a knife, so I don't think that's it.\n\nOption D is Bowie knife, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a large knife associated with Jim Bowie. Since Arkansas is mentioned, and Jim Bowie is related to Arkansas, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nLet me see if I can find more information to confirm this. Arkansas is known for its association with Jim Bowie and his famous knife. The \"Arkansas toothpick\" might be a local name or nickname for the Bowie knife in that region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different type of knife or weapon altogether. I should consider if there are other weapons or tools that are famous in Arkansas and are called a toothpick.\n\nBut honestly, I don't know of any other options besides the Bowie knife that fit this description. Scottie Pippen, spare rib, and pinkie finger don't seem relevant to the term \"Arkansas toothpick.\"\n\nSo, based on my limited knowledge, I'm going to guess that the answer is D. Bowie knife.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
