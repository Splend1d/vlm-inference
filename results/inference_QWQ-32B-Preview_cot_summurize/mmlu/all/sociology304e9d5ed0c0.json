His parents might not be able to afford to stay because property values are rising. I need to figure out which term best describes this situation.\n\nOption A is gentrification. I think gentrification is when an area that was previously lower-income or working-class starts to attract more affluent residents, leading to improvements and often displacement of the original residents. That seems to fit here, as the neighborhood is getting new, nicer developments and property values are rising, which might make it hard for his parents to stay.\n\nOption B is urbanization, which is when people move from rural areas to urban areas. But here, it's about changes within an already urban neighborhood, so maybe not the best fit.\n\nOption C is white flight, which is when white residents move out of urban areas into suburbs, often due to racial tensions or changes in the community's demographics. But in this case, the neighborhood is primarily African American, and the changes are about new developments and rising property values, not about white residents leaving.\n\nOption D is the demographic transition, which is a model that explains changes in birth and death rates as a society develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economy. That doesn't seem directly related to the changes in Leroy's neighborhood.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think gentrification is the best answer. The neighborhood is becoming more attractive and expensive, which could push out long-time residents who can't afford the higher costs.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
