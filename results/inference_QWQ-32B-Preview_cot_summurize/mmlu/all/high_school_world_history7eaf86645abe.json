In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . .

                    "text": "So I've got this passage from a book by this guy al-Bakri from the 11th century, talking about the city of Ghana. It sounds like Ghana was a pretty interesting place back then, with a mix of Muslim and pagan populations, and the king had some interesting customs. But the question is about the economy of Ghana according to this passage. Let's see what it says.\n\nFirst, it mentions that there are two towns, one inhabited by Muslims with mosques and religious figures. It also says that even though the king and his court have some Muslim influence, the majority of the people are pagans. So, religion-wise, it's a mix.\n\nThen, it talks about the king's setup: his interpreters, treasury officials, and ministers are mostly Muslims, but only the royalty can wear sewn clothes, while others wear robes made of different materials based on their wealth. The king dresses differently, adorning himself with necklaces and bracelets, and has a ceremonial setup with a domed pavilion and horses.\n\nRegarding greetings, people who share the king's religion kneel and sprinkle dust on their heads, while Muslims clap their hands to greet him. So, there's a difference in how people greet the king based on their religion.\n\nNow, about religion, it says that the people's religion is paganism and idol worship, which contrasts with the Muslim presence in the town.\n\nThen, it mentions something about salt: \"On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out.\" So, the king taxes salt imports and exports. Similarly, from a load of copper, the king takes five mithqals, and from other goods, ten mithqals. Also, it says that all the gold nuggets found in the mines belong to the king, and only gold dust is left for the people. It suggests that if the people had all the gold, it might lose its value.\n\nBeyond Ghana, there's another country called Malal, whose king was attached to Islam, but his people were still polytheists.\n\nOkay, so looking at the options:\n\nA. The king of Ghana's subjects are engaged in salt mining.\n\nWell, the passage mentions that the king levies taxes on salt imports and exports, but it doesn't explicitly say that his subjects are engaged in salt mining. Maybe they are, but it's not directly stated here.\n\nB. The Ghanians raised cattle for meat and hides.\n\nThere's no mention of cattle or animal husbandry in this passage. It talks about vegetable cultivation near the wells, but nothing about cattle.\n\nC. The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.\n\nThis seems directly supported by the passage. It specifically mentions taxes on salt imports and exports, as well as taxes on copper and other goods.\n\nD. The Ghanians had a self-sufficient farming economy.\n\nThe passage mentions that they grow vegetables using water from wells, but it doesn't say whether their economy is self-sufficient or based solely on farming. They seem to engage in trade, given the mention of taxes on imports and exports.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, option C seems to be the most accurate description of the economy of Ghana according to this passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
