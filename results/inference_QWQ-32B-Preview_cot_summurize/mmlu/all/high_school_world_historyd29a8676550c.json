                    "text": "Let's see. This question is about changes in Indian religious practice under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. First, I need to recall who Ashoka was and what he did regarding religion.\n\nI know that Ashoka was a Mauryan emperor who ruled in the 3rd century BCE, after the time of the Upanishads mentioned in the quote. He's famous for converting to Buddhism and promoting it throughout his empire. So, I think option D, \"The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts,\" might be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption A says, \"The rise of Sikhism as a syncretic faith.\" I think Sikhism came much later, around the 15th century CE, founded by Guru Nanak. So that's way after Ashoka's time. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B mentions, \"The arrival of Islam as a new religion borne by external invaders.\" Islam arrived in India around the 7th or 8th century CE, again, long after Ashoka's reign. So, that's not it either.\n\nOption C says, \"The eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force.\" I don't think Ashoka tried to eradicate Hinduism. He was more about promoting tolerance and peace among different religions. In fact, he supported various religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and others. So, eradication doesn't sound right.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the most accurate. Ashoka did promote Buddhism and had edicts carved on rocks and pillars across his empire, spreading Buddhist teachings and principles.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure about Ashoka's religious policies. Ashoka was indeed a Buddhist emperor who embraced Buddhism after the bloody Kalinga War. He believed in non-violence and dharma, which he promoted through his edicts. He sent missionaries to spread Buddhism not only within his empire but also to other parts of the world, like Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.\n\nSo, his encouragement of Buddhist edicts was a significant change in Indian religious practice during his time. He didn't force people to convert to Buddhism but encouraged moral and ethical values based on Buddhist principles.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is D: The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
