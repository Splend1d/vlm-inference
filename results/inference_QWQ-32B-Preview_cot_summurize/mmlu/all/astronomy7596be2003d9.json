Hawking radiation\n\nStep-by-step justification:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question is asking about the type of radiation that causes black holes to evaporate over time. This is a concept in theoretical physics related to black holes and their behavior.\n\n2. **Options Provided**:\n   - A. Schwarzschild radiation\n   - B. Planck radiation\n   - C. Kolmogorov radiation\n   - D. Hawking radiation\n\n3. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - **Schwarzschild radiation**: Schwarzschild is known for the Schwarzschild solution in general relativity, which describes the spacetime around a non-rotating black hole. However, there is no widely recognized \"Schwarzschild radiation.\"\n   - **Planck radiation**: This term might refer to Planck's law describing the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium. While fundamental in physics, it's not specifically associated with black hole evaporation.\n   - **Kolmogorov radiation**: Andrey Kolmogorov is famous for his work in probability theory, turbulence, and other areas, but there is no standard concept known as \"Kolmogorov radiation\" in the context of black holes.\n   - **Hawking radiation**: Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon, leading to a slow evaporation of the black hole over time. This is a well-established concept in theoretical physics.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, Hawking radiation is the correct answer as it is the radiation responsible for black hole evaporation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
