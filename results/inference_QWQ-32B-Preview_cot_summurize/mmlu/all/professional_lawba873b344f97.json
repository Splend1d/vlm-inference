The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to use exclusively one brand of ballpoint pens and pencils as their writing utensils. According to a study, the federal government could save in excess of $250,000 a year in office supply costs if all executive agencies were to use standardized pens and pencils.\nB. The President issued an executive order requiring all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during regular working hours. According to the President's directive, executive employees are prohibited from wearing colored (e. g. , blue or yellow) or striped shirts and blouses while on duty. The President issued the order in an effort to establish a uniform dress code for all executive employees.\nC. In 1887, Congress passed a law establishing a federal Commission of Birdwatchers. The Commission, which is still in effect, consists of seven members who are appointed by the President. The Commission's main function is to go on periodic retreats to photograph and study North American birds and their migratory habits. Believing that the Commission is archaic, the President decides that any future funding will simply be a waste of money. He thus executes an executive decree abrogating the Commission of Birdwatchers.\nD. A devastating hurricane damages an island which is part of a foreign country. The storm destroys many homes, resulting in death and injury to thousands. In response to a request from the foreign government for emergency aid, the President, without seeking the advice and consent of the Senate, issues an executive decree authorizing U. S. Army troops to the island to provide medical and humanitarian assistance.\n"

The goal is to save money on office supplies. This seems like a management decision. The President has authority over how the executive branch operates, so this might be within his powers.\n\nOption B: The President requires all executive branch employees to wear only white shirts and blouses during working hours. This is about dress code. While it's unusual, the President might have some leeway in setting standards for appearance, especially if it's for a specific reason like establishing a uniform look. However, this seems more trivial than Option A.\n\nOption C: The President decides to abolish the Commission of Birdwatchers, which was established by Congress in 1887. This seems like interfering with Congress's legislative authority. The President can't just abolish a commission created by Congress unless there's a specific provision allowing him to do so. This might be unconstitutional because it undermines the separation of powers.\n\nOption D: After a hurricane in a foreign country, the President sends U.S. Army troops to provide medical and humanitarian assistance, following a request from the foreign government. This seems like a foreign policy decision. The President has significant authority in foreign affairs, especially in matters of national security and humanitarian aid. However, there might be laws or constitutional provisions that require congressional approval for such actions.\n\nLet me consider each option more carefully.\n\nOption A: Requiring the use of a specific brand of pens and pencils. This is an internal management decision. The President has broad authority to manage the executive branch, so this is probably within his powers. It's similar to setting other standards or preferences for office supplies.\n\nOption B: Mandating white shirts and blouses. This is about employee dress code. While it's unusual, the President might have authority to set such standards, especially if it's for a specific reason, like professionalism or uniformity. However, it could be seen as an overreach if it's deemed irrelevant to job performance or if it imposes an undue burden on employees.\n\nOption C: Abolishing the Commission of Birdwatchers. This is more serious because it involves eliminating a commission created by Congress. The President doesn't have the authority to unilaterally abolish congressional creations unless there's a specific provision allowing it. This could be seen as usurping Congress's legislative power, which is a clear violation of the separation of powers.\n\nOption D: Sending troops for humanitarian aid without congressional approval. The President has authority in foreign affairs, but there are limits. The War Powers Resolution, for example, requires congressional approval for the deployment of troops beyond a certain period. However, humanitarian aid might be different from engaging in hostilities. It's a gray area, but perhaps not as clearly unconstitutional as Option C.\n\nComparing all options, Option C seems most likely to be found unconstitutional because it directly challenges Congress's legislative authority by abolishing a commission it created. The President doesn't have the power to eliminate congressional creations without following the proper legal procedures, which would likely involve congressional action.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
