But she feels she has very little privacy. So, the question is asking what this situation is an example of, and it gives four options: A. win-win, B. trade-off, C. infill, D. leapfrog development.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nA. Win-win: This usually means a situation where everyone involved benefits or gains something. It's a positive outcome for all parties.\n\nB. Trade-off: This is when you get something but have to give up something else in return. It's about balancing advantages and disadvantages.\n\nC. Infill: In urban planning, infill development refers to building on vacant or underused land in already developed areas. It's about filling in empty spaces.\n\nD. Leapfrog development: This is when development skips over areas and moves to previously undeveloped land further out, often leading to sprawl.\n\nNow, looking back at Mary's situation. She doesn't need a car because everything is close by, which is convenient and probably has environmental benefits. However, she feels she has very little privacy. So, she's gaining convenience but losing privacy.\n\nThis sounds like a trade-off to me. She's trading privacy for convenience. It's not a win-win because not both aspects are positive for her; one is positive (convenience), and one is negative (lack of privacy).\n\nInfill and leapfrog development are about types of urban development, which might be related to her neighborhood, but the question is about her personal situation regarding privacy and convenience.\n\nSo, I think the best answer is B. trade-off.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf it were a win-win, both aspects would be positive, which they're not. She's experiencing a lack of privacy, which is negative.\n\nInfill is about developing empty spaces, which might be related to her neighborhood, but doesn't directly relate to her personal trade-off between privacy and convenience.\n\nLeapfrog development is about development jumping to new areas, which again, doesn't directly relate to her personal situation.\n\nTherefore, trade-off seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
