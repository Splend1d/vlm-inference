                    "text": "So I have this problem: 5 over 8 times m equals 6. In other words, (5/8)*m = 6. I need to solve for m, and there are four options given: A. 3 and 5 over 9, B. 3 and 3 over 4, C. 5 and 1 over 3, and D. 9 and 3 over 5. I'm not entirely sure how to approach this, but I think I should isolate m. Let me try to do that step by step.\n\nFirst, the equation is (5/8)*m = 6. To solve for m, I need to get m by itself on one side. Since m is being multiplied by 5/8, I can undo that by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 5/8, which is 8/5. That should give me m = 6 * (8/5).\n\nLet me calculate that. 6 times 8 is 48, and 48 divided by 5 is 9.6. So m = 9.6. Now, I need to see which of the options matches 9.6.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. 3 and 5 over 9. That's 3 + 5/9. Let's calculate that: 3 + 5/9 = 3 + 0.555... which is approximately 3.555, which is not 9.6.\n\nB. 3 and 3 over 4. That's 3 + 3/4 = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75, which is also not 9.6.\n\nC. 5 and 1 over 3. That's 5 + 1/3 = 5 + 0.333... = approximately 5.333, not 9.6.\n\nD. 9 and 3 over 5. That's 9 + 3/5 = 9 + 0.6 = 9.6, which matches the value I got.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be D. 9 and 3 over 5.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with (5/8)*m = 6, multiplying both sides by 8/5 should indeed give m = 6 * (8/5). That's m = (6*8)/5 = 48/5 = 9.6. And 9.6 is the same as 9 and 3/5, since 0.6 is equal to 3/5.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have cross-multiplied or thought of it in terms of proportions, but the way I did it is straightforward. I think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9\\ \\dfrac{3}{5}} \\]"
