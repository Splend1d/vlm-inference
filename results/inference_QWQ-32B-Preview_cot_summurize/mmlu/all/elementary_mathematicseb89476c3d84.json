I'll write down 28 and multiply it by 42.\n\nStarting with 28 x 2, which is 56.\n\nThen, 28 x 40, which is 1120.\n\nNow, I add those two results together: 1120 + 56 = 1176.\n\nSo, 28 x 42 equals 1176.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 420\n\nB. 816\n\nC. 1,166\n\nD. 1,176\n\nThe correct answer is D. 1,176.\n\nAlternatively, I could break it down further using the distributive property.\n\n28 x 42 can be thought of as 28 x (40 + 2) which is (28 x 40) + (28 x 2).\n\nWe already calculated 28 x 40 = 1120 and 28 x 2 = 56.\n\nAdding them together gives 1176.\n\nSame result.\n\nI can also check by multiplying 42 x 28 to verify.\n\n42 x 8 is 336.\n\n42 x 20 is 840.\n\nAdding them together: 336 + 840 = 1176.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, the correct choice is D. 1,176.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
