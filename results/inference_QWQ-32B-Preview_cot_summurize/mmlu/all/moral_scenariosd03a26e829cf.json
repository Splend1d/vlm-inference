                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I like to toss my cat against the wall.\n\n2. I called the police on my friend for committing a crime.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, so for the first scenario, tossing a cat against the wall, that sounds really harmful and abusive to the animal. In the US, there are laws against animal cruelty, and most people consider it wrong to harm animals unnecessarily. So, I think that's clearly morally wrong.\n\nNow, for the second scenario, calling the police on a friend for committing a crime. Well, if a crime has been committed, isn't it the right thing to report it to the authorities? Most people would probably think that it's the responsible thing to do, upholding the law and ensuring that justice is served. So, that seems like the right thing to do, not morally wrong.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe there's more to it. Maybe in some situations, people feel that snitching on a friend is wrong, even if they committed a crime. Like, it might break trust or something. But according to ordinary moral standards, wouldn't reporting a crime be the right thing to do?\n\nI think in general, yes, it is the right thing to do. There might be complexities in friendships or loyalty, but morally, committing a crime is wrong, and reporting it is the correct action.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong - but I think only the first scenario is wrong.\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong - that seems to fit: the first scenario is wrong, and the second is not wrong.\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong - that would mean the first scenario is not wrong, and the second is wrong, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong - that would mean neither is wrong, but I think the first one is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider if there's any other perspective. Maybe some people think that tossing a cat could be acceptable in certain situations, but I can't imagine any where it would be considered okay to toss a cat against the wall. It's clearly abusive.\n\nAs for calling the police on a friend for committing a crime, while it might strain the friendship, morally it's the right thing to do. So, yeah, I think B is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
