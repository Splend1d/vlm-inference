                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the old building that the company is selling. So, the company has moved to a new building, and they're actively trying to sell the old one, expecting to complete the sale in four months. We have four statements here, and we need to find out which one is not correct regarding the old building.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for an asset to be held for sale. When a company decides to sell an asset, it needs to account for it differently in its financial statements. There are specific rules for how to classify and measure assets that are held for sale.\n\nOption A says: \"It will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\" That sounds right. When a company decides to sell an asset, it should reclassify it as held for sale in its balance sheet.\n\nOption B says: \"It will be classified as a current asset.\" Hmm, is that correct? Assets held for sale are generally classified as current assets because the company expects to sell them within one year or the operating cycle, whichever is longer. Since the sale is expected to be completed in four months, which is less than a year, it should be classified as a current asset. So, this seems correct too.\n\nOption C says: \"It will no longer be depreciated.\" Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. When an asset is held for sale, it's no longer being used in the operations of the business, so it makes sense that depreciation would cease. So, this also seems correct.\n\nOption D says: \"It will be valued at historical cost.\" Now, this one sounds a bit off. Generally, when an asset is reclassified as held for sale, it should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount (which is historical cost minus accumulated depreciation) or its fair value minus costs to sell. So, it's not necessarily valued at historical cost alone. It seems like this might be the incorrect statement.\n\nLet me double-check the accounting standards for assets held for sale. According to IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, an asset classified as held for sale should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell. Similarly, under US GAAP, specifically ASC 360-10, the asset should be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\n\nSo, indeed, the asset should not be valued solely at historical cost when it's held for sale. It should be adjusted to the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- A: Correct, it will be reclassified as an asset held for sale.\n\n- B: Correct, it will be classified as a current asset.\n\n- C: Correct, it will no longer be depreciated.\n\n- D: Incorrect, it will be valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, not necessarily at historical cost.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
