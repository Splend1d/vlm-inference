                    "text": "So I've got this question here about characteristics of information in statistical tables versus financial statements in a comprehensive annual financial report. The question is asking which characteristic differentiates the information in these statistical tables from that in the financial statements. The options are about whether the information covers financial trends and whether it's presented on a fiscal year basis. There are four choices: A. Yes Yes; B. Yes No; C. No Yes; D. No No.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what statistical tables and financial statements typically include in a comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR). A CAFR usually consists of three main sections: the introductory section, the financial section, and the statistical section.\n\nThe financial section includes the government-wide financial statements, fund financial statements, notes to the financial statements, and the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A). These financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and present the financial position and results of operations for the government.\n\nThe statistical section, on the other hand, provides data that may not be directly related to the financial statements but offers context and additional information about the government's operations, economy, and demographics. This can include data on population, employment, revenues, expenditures, debt, and other relevant metrics, often presented over multiple years to show trends.\n\nSo, regarding the first characteristic: \"Data covering financial trends.\" Financial statements do show some trends through comparative financial statements, where prior year amounts are presented alongside the current year's figures. However, statistical tables often provide more detailed and longer-term trend data, sometimes going back several years or even decades, to show historical patterns and trends that may not be as evident in the financial statements alone.\n\nThe second characteristic is \"Fiscal years.\" Financial statements are prepared for a specific fiscal year, presenting the financial activities and position as of the end of that fiscal year. Statistical tables may also be presented on a fiscal year basis, but they can include data from multiple fiscal years to show changes and trends over time.\n\nGiven this, the question is asking which of these characteristics differentiates the statistical tables from the financial statements. In other words, which characteristic is true for statistical tables but not for financial statements.\n\nLooking at option A: Yes Yes. This would mean that both characteristics are present in the statistical tables and not in the financial statements. But we know that financial statements do cover financial trends through comparative information and are prepared on a fiscal year basis. So this option doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B: Yes No. This suggests that statistical tables cover financial trends, but are not presented on a fiscal year basis. However, statistical tables often are presented on a fiscal year basis, especially when showing trends over multiple years. So this also seems incorrect.\n\nOption C: No Yes. This would mean that statistical tables do not cover financial trends, but are presented on a fiscal year basis. But again, statistical tables typically do cover financial trends by providing multi-year data.\n\nOption D: No No. This would mean that statistical tables neither cover financial trends nor are presented on a fiscal year basis. But this contradicts what we know about statistical tables, which often do include financial trend data over fiscal years.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to accurately capture the difference. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the question is trying to highlight that statistical tables cover financial trends beyond what is presented in the financial statements, or that they present data on a fiscal year basis in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the differentiating characteristic is that statistical tables include data that is not directly from the financial statements, such as economic or demographic data, in addition to financial data.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the time frame or the level of detail. Statistical tables might include data over multiple fiscal years to show trends, whereas financial statements are focused on a single fiscal year, with some comparative information.\n\nBut even that might not be entirely accurate, as financial statements do include comparative data from prior years.\n\nMaybe the key is that statistical tables can include non-financial data, whereas financial statements are strictly financial.\n\nBut the question is specifically about \"information in the statistical tables included in a comprehensive annual financial report,\" which presumably would still be financial in nature, even if it's not presented in the financial statements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statistical tables include budgeted amounts or projections, whereas the financial statements are strictly about actual results.\n\nBut again, that might not be entirely accurate, as the financial statements can include information about budgetary comparisons.\n\nI think I need to look at the question differently. It's asking which characteristic differentiates the information in the statistical tables from that in the financial statements. So, perhaps it's about the level of aggregation or the type of data presented.\n\nLet me consider that statistical tables might present more aggregated or summary level data, while financial statements provide more detailed information.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, as financial statements can be quite detailed, with schedules and notes providing extensive information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe statistical tables present data in a way that facilitates trend analysis over time, with more emphasis on comparisons across multiple years, whereas financial statements focus more on the current period's financial position and results.\n\nIf that's the case, then the characteristic of covering financial trends might be more prominent in statistical tables than in financial statements, which are primarily focused on the current fiscal year, with comparative information for prior years.\n\nBut financial statements do include trends, especially in the notes and in management's discussion and analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the MD&A within the financial section discusses trends, but the core financial statements (balance sheet, statement of activities, etc.) present a snapshot and period-specific information.\n\nIn that case, the statistical tables might provide more comprehensive trend data, including non-financial information, to give context to the financial results.\n\nGiven that, maybe the differentiating characteristic is that statistical tables cover financial trends in a more extensive manner, including non-financial indicators, whereas financial statements focus on the financial position and results.\n\nBut the question is specifically about \"information in the statistical tables included in a comprehensive annual financial report,\" which should still be financial information, even if it's presented differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statistical tables include data that is not required by GAAP, whereas the financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBut again, that might not solely differentiate them, as statistical tables could include GAAP-based data as well.\n\nI'm starting to think that the question might be misphrased or that I'm missing something fundamental here.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Yes Yes\n\nB. Yes No\n\nC. No Yes\n\nD. No No\n\nThe question is about which characteristic differentiates the statistical tables from the financial statements. So, the correct answer should indicate a characteristic that applies to statistical tables but not to financial statements.\n\nIf I consider \"data covering financial trends,\" both statistical tables and financial statements include trend data, but perhaps statistical tables focus more on long-term trends.\n\nSimilarly, both present information on a fiscal year basis.\n\nMaybe the key is that statistical tables often include data from sources outside the general ledger, whereas financial statements are based on general ledger information.\n\nBut again, that might not be entirely accurate, as statistical tables could still be based on general ledger data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps statistical tables include historical data without the need to conform to GAAP, allowing for more flexibility in presentation and content.\n\nFinancial statements, being GAAP-based, have specific requirements for what information must be included and how it must be presented.\n\nIn that case, the differentiating characteristic might be that statistical tables can include information that is not governed by GAAP, allowing for a broader range of data to be presented, including financial trends that may not be directly reflected in the financial statements.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is B. Yes No, meaning that statistical tables cover financial trends, but are not necessarily presented on a fiscal year basis.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, as statistical tables are usually presented on a fiscal year basis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's C. No Yes, meaning that statistical tables do not cover financial trends, but are presented on a fiscal year basis.\n\nBut that contradicts what I know about statistical tables, which often do include financial trend data.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the financial statements are prepared on a fiscal year basis, while statistical tables can include data on a different basis, such as calendar years or other periods.\n\nBut in practice, statistical tables in a CAFR are typically aligned with the government's fiscal year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the statistical tables include data that is not directly comparable to the financial statements because it's presented differently or includes different components.\n\nFor example, statistical tables might present data on a government-wide basis, while financial statements include both government-wide and fund financial statements.\n\nBut again, this might not be a sufficient differentiator.\n\nI'm going to make an educated guess here. Perhaps the characteristic that differentiates statistical tables is that they cover financial trends over multiple years, providing a historical perspective that goes beyond what is typically included in the financial statements.\n\nFinancial statements, while including comparative information, are primarily focused on the current fiscal year, with explanations of changes from the prior year.\n\nStatistical tables, on the other hand, might present data over five, ten, or more years, allowing for a longer-term analysis of financial trends.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be A. Yes Yes, meaning that statistical tables cover financial trends and are presented on a fiscal year basis.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that option A might not be correct because financial statements also cover financial trends to some extent.\n\nHowever, perhaps the key is that statistical tables provide more extensive trend data over multiple years, differentiating them from the financial statements.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose A. Yes Yes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. Yes Yes"
