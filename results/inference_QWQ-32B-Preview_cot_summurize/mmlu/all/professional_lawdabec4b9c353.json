So, there's a man who claims he inherited property from a wealthy businessman, and he's trying to prove that the businessman is his father. His birth certificate says he was born out of wedlock, but there's a court record that says the businessman was ordered to pay child support as the father. Now, to inherit, he needs to prove that his mother and the businessman got married after he was born, which would legitimize him.\n\nThe attorney doesn't have a marriage license or certificate, but they have a photo that seems to be a wedding photo. It shows a couple dressed for a wedding, outside a church, with bystanders throwing rice. The man thinks the bride is his mother, but he doesn't know who the groom is. The attorney was told by someone who knows the businessman that the groom in the photo looks like the businessman.\n\nNow, the question is whether this photo can be introduced as evidence to prove that the mother and the businessman were married. The options are:\n\nA. Admissible only if the photographer testifies about how the photo was taken.\n\nB. Admissible only if a witness verifies it's an accurate representation of the facts.\n\nC. Inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay without any exception.\n\nD. Inadmissible because it's not the best evidence.\n\nOkay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, what is the purpose of introducing this photo? It's to prove that a marriage occurred between the mother and the businessman. So, it's being offered for the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that they were married.\n\nNow, in evidence law, hearsay is generally inadmissible. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. But here, the photo is a non-verbal representation. Can non-verbal evidence be hearsay?\n\nWell, hearsay isn't just limited to statements; it can include conduct or non-verbal representations if they were intended to assert something. So, was this photo taken with the intention to assert that a marriage occurred?\n\nProbably not. The photo was likely taken to commemorate a wedding event, assuming it is a wedding photo. But the photo itself doesn't assert that a legal marriage occurred; it just shows a wedding ceremony.\n\nHowever, in court, the photo could be used as evidence of the marriage if it's connected to other evidence that confirms the identity of the people in the photo and that the ceremony resulted in a legal marriage.\n\nBut in this case, the man can't identify the groom, only the bride, and there's just a third party who thinks the groom looks like the businessman.\n\nSo, is this photo admissible to prove the marriage?\n\nOption A says it's admissible only if the photographer testifies about the circumstances. Well, having the photographer testify could certainly help establish the context and authenticity of the photo, but is it necessary?\n\nOption B says it's admissible only if a witness verifies it's a correct and accurate representation of the facts. This seems similar to having a witness testify that the photo accurately represents the event it portrays.\n\nOption C says it's inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay without any exception. This could be a possible answer, but I'm not sure.\n\nOption D says it's inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. What would be the best evidence? Probably a marriage certificate or license.\n\nBut in the absence of that, could this photo be considered secondary evidence?\n\nLet me consider the rules of evidence.\n\nFirst, is the photo relevant? Yes, if it can show that the mother and the businessman were married.\n\nIs it authentic? Well, that's part of the issue. The man says the bride is his mother, and someone thinks the groom is the businessman. But without more definite identification, its authenticity as evidence of the marriage is questionable.\n\nIs it hearsay? As a non-verbal representation, it might not fit neatly into the hearsay definition. Maybe it's more about the photo being used to prove the marriage, which is a fact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the photo is being offered to show that a wedding ceremony took place, which could be relevant to proving the marriage, especially if it can be shown that the ceremony was a valid legal marriage.\n\nBut in many places, a wedding ceremony alone doesn't constitute a legal marriage unless it's performed by someone with the authority to do so, and there's usually some record of the marriage.\n\nSo, even if the photo shows a wedding, it might not necessarily prove a legal marriage occurred.\n\nBut perhaps in this case, it's the best evidence they have.\n\nNow, thinking about the options:\n\nA. Admissible only if the photographer testifies. Well, the photographer could testify about the circumstances, which might help establish authenticity and context. But what if the photographer is unavailable? Does that make the photo inadmissible?\n\nB. Admissible only if a witness verifies it's a correct and accurate representation of the facts. This seems similar to having a witness testify that the photo accurately shows the mother and the businessman getting married. But again, the man can only identify the bride as his mother, and someone thinks the groom looks like the businessman. That's pretty speculative.\n\nC. Inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay without any exception. This could be a possibility if the photo is considered hearsay. But I'm not entirely sure that it qualifies as hearsay.\n\nD. Inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. The best evidence would be a marriage certificate, but since that's unavailable, perhaps the photo can be admitted as secondary evidence.\n\nWait, there's a best evidence rule in evidence law, which generally requires that to prove the content of a writing, the original writing must be produced. But here, the photo is not a writing; it's a photograph. So, maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply in the same way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best evidence rule applies to photographs as well, requiring the original photo to be produced, but that seems different from the scenario here.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the photo is authentic and relevant to proving the marriage.\n\nGiven that the man can only identify the bride as his mother and someone speculates that the groom looks like the businessman, it's pretty weak evidence.\n\nMoreover, even if it is a photo of the mother and the businessman getting married, it doesn't necessarily prove that a legal marriage occurred.\n\nSo, from an evidentiary standpoint, it's questionable whether the photo should be admitted.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Admissible only if the photographer testifies. This might strengthen the evidence, but it's not clear that the photographer's testimony is necessary.\n\nB. Admissible only if a witness verifies it's a correct and accurate representation of the facts. Again, having a witness verify the identities would help, but the verification seems too uncertain here.\n\nC. Inadmissible as non-verbal hearsay without any exception. This could be a possible reason for exclusion, but I'm not fully confident about classifying the photo as non-verbal hearsay.\n\nD. Inadmissible because it's not the best evidence. This could also be a reason, given that the best evidence would be a marriage certificate.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option D makes the most sense. The photo is not the best evidence of the marriage; the marriage certificate or license would be. Since those are unavailable, the photo, with its uncertain authenticity and relevance, is not sufficient to prove the marriage.\n\nTherefore, the trial judge should rule the photograph inadmissible because it's not the best evidence.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
