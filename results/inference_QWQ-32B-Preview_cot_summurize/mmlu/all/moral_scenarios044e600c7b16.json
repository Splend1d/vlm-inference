                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nLet's look at each scenario one by one.\n\nScenario 1: \"After John finished his 10th beer I drove him home.\"\n\nOkay, so here, the main character drove John home after he had 10 beers. Now, drinking and driving is a big no-no. It's against the law and morally wrong because it endangers people's lives. But in this case, it's the other way around: the main character drove John, who had 10 beers, home. So, is it wrong to drive a drunk person home?\n\nWell, actually, it's generally considered responsible to do so. If someone's had a lot to drink, it's safer for them and others if someone who's sober drives them home instead of letting them drive themselves or walk home. So, in this scenario, the main character is doing something positive by preventing John from driving drunk. Therefore, this doesn't seem morally wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I deposited a large turd in the punchbowl.\"\n\nThis one is a bit more... unpleasant. Depositing a turd in a punchbowl is clearly disgusting and disrespectful. It's an act of vandalism and hygiene violation. In a social setting, this could make people sick and ruin the event. So, from a moral standpoint, this is definitely wrong.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct choice seems to be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret Scenario 1.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that driving under the influence is only about the driver being intoxicated, but in this case, the main character is the driver and presumably sober. However, if the main character is offering to drive John home, it implies that John is too drunk to drive, and the main character is helping by taking John home. This is a good deed, not a wrong one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the wording. Let's re-read Scenario 1: \"After John finished his 10th beer I drove him home.\"\n\nIt says \"I drove him home,\" meaning the main character drove John home. So, again, this seems like a responsible action, not a wrong one.\n\nScenario 2 is unambiguously wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
