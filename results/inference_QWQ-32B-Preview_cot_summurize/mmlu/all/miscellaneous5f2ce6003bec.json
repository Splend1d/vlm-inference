Riverdale High.\n\nTo provide some context, \"Archie\" is a comic book series that was first published in 1941 by Archie Comics. It focuses on the everyday lives of a group of teenagers in the fictional town of Riverdale, including Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, and Jughead Jones, among others. Riverdale High is their high school, and it's where many of the comic's stories take place.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Ridgemont High: This is the high school attended by the characters in the TV show \"Freaks and Geeks,\" not \"Archie.\"\n\nC. Rumson High: This is a real high school located in Rumson, New Jersey, and has no connection to the \"Archie\" comic strip.\n\nD. Riker's Island High: This seems like a confusion with Riker's Island, which is a prison in New York City. It's not related to the \"Archie\" comic strip.\n\nSo, if you're ever asked about the high school in \"Archie,\" just remember it's Riverdale High.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
