Normative, Descriptive, and Economic\n\nHowever, upon reviewing their work, it seems that the correct\u5206\u7c7b should be:\n\n- Normative Stakeholder Theory\n- Descriptive Stakeholder Theory\n- Instrumental Stakeholder Theory\n\nTherefore, the accurate answer should be:\n\nD. Normative, Descriptive, and Instrumental\n\nBut according to the options provided, option A includes \"Economic\" instead of \"Instrumental.\" It's possible there is a mistake in the options. In the original paper by Donaldson and Preston (1995), they discuss normative, descriptive, and instrumental theories of stakeholder management.\n\nSo, to clarify:\n\n- Normative stakeholder theory prescribes what organizations ought to do regarding their stakeholders.\n\n- Descriptive stakeholder theory explains and predicts how organizations actually manage their stakeholders.\n\n- Instrumental stakeholder theory focuses on the benefits organizations can gain by managing their stakeholders effectively.\n\nGiven this, option D seems to be the correct choice, assuming \"instrumental\" is the correct term used by Donaldson and Preston.\n\n**Reference:**\n\nDonaldson, T., & Preston, L.
