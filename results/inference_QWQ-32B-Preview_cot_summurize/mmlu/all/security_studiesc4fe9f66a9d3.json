                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and how it relates to the concept of state sovereignty. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst off, R2P is a global political commitment adopted by all member states of the United Nations at the 2005 World Summit. It's based on the idea that sovereign states have a responsibility to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. If a state is unable or unwilling to do so, the international community has a responsibility to step in and help, through peaceful means or, if necessary, through collective action authorized by the UN Security Council.\n\nNow, the question is asking which statement is NOT accurate regarding the tension between R2P and sovereignty. So, we need to identify which option misrepresents the relationship between R2P and the traditional Westphalian concept of sovereignty.\n\nLet's look at option A: \"In order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P, Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked, specifically the idea that intervention is required to assure international security.\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit off. The Westphalian system is based on the principle of state sovereignty and non-interference in the affairs of other states. R2P, on the other hand, argues that sovereignty comes with responsibilities, and if a state fails to protect its population, it loses some of its sovereignty and the international community has a right to intervene.\n\nSo, invoking Westphalian sovereignty to justify intervention seems contradictory because Westphalian sovereignty traditionally opposes intervention. Maybe this is the inaccurate statement.\n\nOption B: \"In order to transcend the intervention-vs.-sovereignty debate, R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty.\"\n\nThis sounds right. R2P is indeed trying to redefine sovereignty as responsibility, moving away from the traditional notion of sovereignty as absolute authority and non-interference.\n\nOption C: \"In order to facilitate the deployment of effective humanitarian intervention, the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty.\"\n\nAgain, this aligns with what I know about R2P. It redefines sovereignty as a responsibility to protect one's population, which can be enforced by the international community if necessary.\n\nOption D: \"The notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.\"\n\nThis is also accurate. R2P explicitly links sovereignty with the responsibility to protect populations from mass atrocities.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option A seems to be the one that doesn't fit. It suggests that Westphalian sovereignty is invoked to justify intervention, whereas, in reality, R2P is challenging the traditional Westphalian notion by allowing for intervention in cases where a state fails to protect its people.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
