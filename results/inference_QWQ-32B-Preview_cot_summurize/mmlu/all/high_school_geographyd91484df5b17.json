Environmental apathy\n\nD. Urban ethnic ghettos on the rise\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means and whether they are indeed issues in Europe today.\n\nStarting with A, rising immigration. I know that Europe has been experiencing an increase in immigration in recent years, with people coming from various parts of the world, especially from the Middle East and Africa, due to conflicts and economic reasons. This has been a significant topic in European politics and society, so it seems like a current problem.\n\nOption B, lack of population growth. I've heard that many European countries are facing demographic challenges, with low birth rates and aging populations. This can lead to labor shortages and strain on social welfare systems. So, this also seems like a current issue.\n\nOption C, environmental apathy. This suggests a lack of concern or action regarding environmental issues. However, from what I've seen, Europe is generally considered to be quite proactive on environmental matters, with policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, promoting renewable energy, and protecting natural habitats. So, this seems contrary to the general trend.\n\nOption D, urban ethnic ghettos on the rise. This refers to the increasing segregation of ethnic groups in urban areas. I know that this is a topic of discussion in some European cities, where certain neighborhoods have high concentrations of immigrants or minority groups, sometimes leading to social and economic disparities. So, this appears to be another current problem.\n\nComparing all these options, A, B, and D seem to be recognized issues in Europe today, while C, environmental apathy, doesn't align with the general trend of European engagement on environmental issues.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C. Environmental apathy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
