                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of tenancy by the entirety and the implications of a quitclaim deed in this context.\n\nTenancy by the entirety is a form of joint ownership available only to married couples. It has several key features:\n\n1. **Unity of Title**: Both spouses own the entire property, not just a share.\n\n2. **Right of Survivorship**: When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically inherits the entire property.\n\n3. **Protection from Creditors**: Typically, only both spouses together can encumber or transfer the property; one spouse acting alone generally cannot affect the other's interest.\n\nA quitclaim deed is a legal instrument that transfers any interest one party has in a property to another party, without warranties or guarantees about the quality or validity of that interest.\n\nNow, in this scenario:\n\n- The wife and husband own a dairy as tenants by the entirety.\n\n- The wife transfers her interest in the dairy to her aunt via a quitclaim deed, without the husband's knowledge.\n\nGiven that tenancy by the entirety requires both spouses to act together to transfer or encumber the property, the question is whether the wife's unilateral transfer via quitclaim deed has any effect.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, a unilateral transfer by one spouse of property held as tenants by the entirety is invalid without the consent of the other spouse. This is because the right to transfer such property is vested in both spouses jointly.\n\nTherefore, the aunt would likely receive no interest in the property, as the wife did not have the authority to transfer her interest alone.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider if there are any exceptions or specific rules in the jurisdiction where this transaction took place. But generally, the answer would be that the aunt has no interest in the property.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. No interest.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
