In order to determine causality, experimental or longitudinal studies are needed.\" Then it gives options: A. Ethnographic study. B. Consumer juries. C. Causal research. D. Focus-groups.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out which one of these is used to determine if one thing causes another. The question mentions that to determine causality, you need experimental or longitudinal studies. So, I should look for the option that's related to finding causes.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Ethnographic study: I think this is more about observing cultures or groups in their natural environment. It's qualitative research, right? Not sure if it's specifically about causality.\n\nB. Consumer juries: This sounds like a group of people who evaluate products or services, maybe giving feedback. Doesn't seem directly related to determining causality.\n\nC. Causal research: Oh, this one says \"causal.\" That probably means it's about causes and effects. That sounds promising.\n\nD. Focus-groups: These are groups where people discuss their thoughts and opinions about a topic. Again, seems more qualitative and not specifically about causality.\n\nSo, between these options, C. Causal research, seems like the most direct answer. The question also mentions that to determine causality, you need experimental or longitudinal studies. That makes sense because in experiments, you can manipulate variables to see if changes in one cause changes in another. Longitudinal studies track changes over time, which can help establish cause and effect.\n\nLet me double-check. Ethnographic studies are more about understanding cultural practices and social behaviors without necessarily looking for cause and effect. Consumer juries are about getting opinions or evaluations from a group of consumers. Focus-groups are similar, focusing on group discussions to gather insights.\n\nCausal research, on the other hand, is specifically designed to understand cause-and-effect relationships. So, it makes sense that it would require experimental or longitudinal methods to establish causality.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Causal research.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
