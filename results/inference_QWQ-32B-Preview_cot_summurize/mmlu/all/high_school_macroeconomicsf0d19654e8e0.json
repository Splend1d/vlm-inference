Specifically, I need to see how interest rates, new home purchases, and unemployment rates are affected. The options are:\n\nA. Interest rates decrease, new homes increase, unemployment increases.\n\nB. Interest rates decrease, new homes decrease, unemployment decreases.\n\nC. Interest rates increase, new homes decrease, unemployment decreases.\n\nD. Interest rates increase, new homes decrease, unemployment increases.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what contractionary monetary policy is. I know that monetary policy is about how the central bank manages the money supply and interest rates to influence the economy. Contractionary monetary policy is when the central bank tries to reduce inflation by decreasing the money supply or increasing interest rates, which slows down economic activity.\n\nNow, the nation is operating at full employment, which means that pretty much everyone who wants to work has a job, and unemployment is low. In this situation, if the central bank decides to implement contractionary monetary policy, it's probably because they're worried about inflation getting too high.\n\nSo, let's think about interest rates first. In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank usually raises interest rates. That's because higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which discourages people and businesses from taking out loans. This reduces spending and investing, which can help cool down the economy and reduce inflation.\n\nSo, interest rates should increase.\n\nNext, new home purchases. Housing is sensitive to interest rates because buying a home usually involves taking out a mortgage, which is a loan. If interest rates go up, the cost of borrowing for a mortgage increases, which makes buying a home more expensive. As a result, people might delay buying homes or decide not to buy at all, leading to a decrease in new home purchases.\n\nSo, new homes should decrease.\n\nNow, unemployment rates. At full employment, unemployment is already low. If the central bank raises interest rates, it makes borrowing more expensive, which can lead to less investment and slower economic growth. If the economy grows more slowly or even contracts, some businesses might have to lay off workers because there's less demand for their products or services.\n\nTherefore, unemployment might increase as a result of contractionary monetary policy.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Interest rates increase\n\n- New homes decrease\n\n- Unemployment increases\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Is it possible that unemployment could decrease? Well, if the economy slows down due to higher interest rates, you'd expect unemployment to rise, not decrease. So, options B and C, which suggest unemployment decreases, don't make sense in this context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: Interest rates increase, new homes decrease, unemployment increases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
