The word \"ruby\" comes from the Latin word \"ruber,\" meaning red. Rubies are highly valued in jewelry and are considered one of the four precious gemstones, along with diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds.\n\nWhile corundum can occur in other colors, those are typically called sapphires. For example, blue corundum is called a blue sapphire, and other colors are referred to as fancy sapphires. Only the red variety is called a ruby.\n\nSo, to summarize, a ruby is red, making option A the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
