Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"14 is 3 more than 42.\" Hmm, that doesn't sound right. If 14 is 3 more than 42, that would mean 14 = 42 + 3, which is 45. But 14 doesn't equal 45. So, that can't be right.\n\nOption B says: \"42 is 14 more than 3.\" Let's see: if 42 is 14 more than 3, that would mean 42 = 3 + 14, which is 17. But 42 doesn't equal 17. So, that's not correct either.\n\nOption C says: \"14 is 3 times as many as 42.\" Wait, if 14 is 3 times as many as 42, that would mean 14 = 3 \u00d7 42, which is 126. But 14 doesn't equal 126. That doesn't make sense.\n\nOption D says: \"42 is 3 times as many as 14.\" Let's check: if 42 is 3 times as many as 14, that would mean 42 = 3 \u00d7 14, which is indeed 42. That matches our original equation.\n\nSo, the correct interpretation is that 42 is 3 times as many as 14. Therefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
