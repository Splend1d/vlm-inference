I'm a bit confused about these terms, so I need to figure out what each one means and then see which one applies to the Rhine River.\n\nFirst, let's talk about geometric boundaries. I think geometric boundaries are like straight lines on a map, maybe drawn without considering the physical features on the ground. Like, someone just takes a ruler and draws a straight line between two points. So, that doesn't sound like a river, which has its own course based on geography.\n\nNext, artificial boundaries. This seems like it could be similar to geometric boundaries, but maybe not necessarily straight lines. Artificial boundaries are probably those that are created by humans, perhaps for political or administrative purposes. So, maybe a river could be an artificial boundary if it was created by humans, but the Rhine River is a natural feature, right? So, probably not artificial.\n\nNow, natural boundaries. This makes sense for a river like the Rhine. Natural boundaries are those that are defined by physical features in the environment, like mountains, rivers, or coastlines. The Rhine River has been a natural border between countries in Europe for centuries, so this seems likely.\n\nLastly, relict boundaries. I'm not sure what relict means in this context. Relict usually means something that has been left behind or is no longer in use. So, maybe a relict boundary is one that was once used but is now obsolete or no longer recognized. If that's the case, then the Rhine River might have been a boundary in the past but isn't anymore, or maybe it's still a boundary but in a different way.\n\nWait, let's think about the Rhine River specifically. I know that it flows through several countries: Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. It's been an important geographical feature for defining borders between these nations. For example, parts of the river have formed the border between France and Germany in the past.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the Rhine River is a natural feature that has been used as a boundary between countries. So, it's a natural boundary.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. Perhaps some parts of the river have been modified by humans, like canals or dams. Does that make it artificial? I don't think so, because even with human modifications, the overall course of the river is still determined by nature.\n\nAlso, considering that the river has been a boundary for a long time, maybe even before modern nation-states existed, it could be considered a relict boundary if its use as a boundary has changed over time. But I think the Rhine River is still an active boundary in some areas, so maybe not relict.\n\nGeometric boundaries don't seem to fit at all, since the river doesn't follow straight lines.\n\nSo, weighing all this, I think the best answer is that the Rhine River is an example of a natural boundary.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
