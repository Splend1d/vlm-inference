                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. I need to translate the formula \"~C \u2228 D\" into natural English sentences, and there are multiple options provided, labeled A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one correctly matches the logical formula given the key:\n\n- A: Marina reads a Percy Jackson book.\n\n- B: Izzy plays Minecraft.\n\n- C: Emily stops working.\n\n- D: Russell makes dinner.\n\n- E: Ashleigh stops by.\n\nThe formula is \"~C \u2228 D\", which means \"not C or D\". In logic, this is equivalent to \"if C then D\", because \"~C \u2228 D\" is the same as \"C \u2192 D\". So, if Emily doesn't stop working, then Russell makes dinner.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. If Emily doesn't stop working then Russell makes dinner.\n\nThis directly matches \"~C \u2192 D\", which is logically equivalent to \"~C \u2228 D\". So, this seems correct.\n\nB. Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nThis one is a bit tricky. \"Unless\" in logic typically translates to \"if not\", so \"Emily stops working unless Russell makes dinner\" means \"If Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily stops working\", which is \"~D \u2192 C\". That's not the same as \"~C \u2228 D\".\n\nC. Emily stops working unless Russell doesn't make dinner.\n\nThis would be \"~D \u2192 C\", similar to option B, which again is not the same as \"~C \u2228 D\".\n\nD. Emily doesn't stop working unless Russell makes dinner.\n\nThis can be interpreted as \"If Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily doesn't stop working\", which is \"~D \u2192 ~C\". That's different from \"~C \u2228 D\".\n\nSo, option A is the direct match. But let's double-check.\n\nAnother way to look at \"~C \u2228 D\" is to consider its truth table. \"~C \u2228 D\" is false only when C is true and D is false. In other words, if Emily stops working (C is true) and Russell doesn't make dinner (D is false), then the statement is false. Otherwise, it's true.\n\nOption A: If Emily doesn't stop working (~~C, which is C), then Russell makes dinner (D). That's equivalent to C \u2192 D, which is the same as ~C \u2228 D.\n\nOption B: ~D \u2192 C, which is \"if Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily stops working\".\n\nOption C: ~D \u2192 C, same as B.\n\nOption D: ~D \u2192 ~C, \"if Russell doesn't make dinner, then Emily doesn't stop working\".\n\nOnly option A matches the original formula.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
