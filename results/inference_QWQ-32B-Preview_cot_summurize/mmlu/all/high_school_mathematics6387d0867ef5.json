                    "text": "So I have this problem here: \"How many of the 401 integers from -200 to 200 are congruent to 5 mod 13?\" and the options are 30, 31, 60, or 45. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for a number to be congruent to 5 mod 13. That means when you divide the number by 13, the remainder is 5. So, in mathematical terms, a number x satisfies x \u2261 5 mod 13.\n\nNow, the range of integers given is from -200 to 200, inclusive. That's 401 integers because from -200 to 200 there are 200 negative numbers, 200 positive numbers, and zero, making it 401 in total.\n\nI need to find how many of these 401 integers satisfy the condition x \u2261 5 mod 13.\n\nOne way to think about this is to find all integers x in the range -200 \u2264 x \u2264 200 such that when x is divided by 13, the remainder is 5.\n\nSo, x can be expressed as x = 13k + 5, where k is an integer.\n\nMy task is to find all integers k such that -200 \u2264 13k + 5 \u2264 200.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities to find the range of k.\n\nFirst, solve -200 \u2264 13k + 5:\n\n-200 - 5 \u2264 13k\n\n-205 \u2264 13k\n\nDivide both sides by 13:\n\n-205/13 \u2264 k\n\nCalculating -205 divided by 13:\n\n13 * (-15) = -195\n\n-195 -13 = -208, which is too small.\n\n-195 + 13 = -182, still not enough.\n\nWait, maybe better to calculate -205 / 13.\n\n-205 \u00f7 13 = -15.769...\n\nSo, k \u2265 -15.769...\n\nSince k has to be an integer, k \u2265 -15\n\nNow, the other inequality: 13k + 5 \u2264 200\n\n13k \u2264 195\n\nk \u2264 195 / 13\n\n195 / 13 = 15\n\nSo, k \u2264 15\n\nTherefore, k ranges from -15 to 15, inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to count the integers from k = -15 to k = 15.\n\nHow many integers are there from -15 to 15?\n\nWell, from -15 to 15, that's 15 negative integers, 15 positive integers, and zero, so total is 15 + 15 + 1 = 31 integers.\n\nTherefore, there are 31 integers x in the range -200 to 200 that are congruent to 5 mod 13.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if k = -15 and k = 15 are within the range.\n\nFor k = -15:\n\nx = 13*(-15) + 5 = -195 + 5 = -190\n\n-190 is greater than -200, so it's within the range.\n\nFor k = 15:\n\nx = 13*15 + 5 = 195 + 5 = 200\n\n200 is the upper limit, so it's included.\n\nAlso, k = -15 to k = 15 includes zero, where k=0 gives x=5, which is within the range.\n\nSo, total of 31 integers.\n\nBut let me make sure there are no overlaps or missing values.\n\nThe general formula for the number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.\n\nHere, a = -15, b = 15.\n\nSo, 15 - (-15) + 1 = 15 + 15 + 1 = 31.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 31.\n\nLooking back at the options, 31 is option B.\n\nBut the problem is, the answer is given as 31, which is option B, but the options include 30, 31, 60, and 45.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there is a mistake in considering the range of k.\n\nLet me re-examine the inequalities.\n\nWe have -200 \u2264 13k + 5 \u2264 200\n\nSubtract 5: -205 \u2264 13k \u2264 195\n\nDivide by 13: -205/13 \u2264 k \u2264 195/13\n\nCalculating -205/13:\n\n13 * (-15) = -195\n\n-205 + 13 = -192, which is still less than -195.\n\nWait, perhaps better to calculate -205 divided by 13.\n\n-205 \u00f7 13 = -15.769...\n\nSo, k \u2265 -15.769...\n\nSince k is an integer, k \u2265 -15\n\nAnd k \u2264 15, as 195/13 = 15\n\nSo, k from -15 to 15 inclusive, which is 31 integers.\n\nBut maybe I need to check if x = -200 is included or not.\n\nLet's see, for k = -15:\n\nx = 13*(-15) + 5 = -195 + 5 = -190, which is greater than -200.\n\nFor k = -16:\n\nx = 13*(-16) + 5 = -208 + 5 = -203, which is less than -200.\n\nSo, k = -16 gives x = -203, which is below -200, so it's not included.\n\nTherefore, k starts from -15.\n\nSimilarly, for k = 15:\n\nx = 13*15 + 5 = 195 + 5 = 200, which is included.\n\nFor k = 16:\n\nx = 13*16 + 5 = 208 + 5 = 213, which is greater than 200, so not included.\n\nTherefore, k ranges from -15 to 15, inclusive, which is 31 integers.\n\nBut perhaps there is a different approach to this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the entire range from -200 to 200 and see how many numbers are congruent to 5 mod 13.\n\nThe total number of integers in the range is 401.\n\nThe number of integers congruent to a particular value modulo m is generally floor(n/m) or floor(n/m) + 1, depending on the remainder.\n\nBut in this case, since the range is from -200 to 200, it's symmetric around zero, and the modulo class should be evenly distributed.\n\nHowever, in practice, it's better to use the parametrization x = 13k + 5 and find the valid k's, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the total number of integers in the range that satisfy x \u2261 5 mod 13 by finding the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting from the smallest x >= -200 and ending at the largest x <= 200, with common difference 13.\n\nFirst, find the smallest x >= -200 such that x \u2261 5 mod 13.\n\nWe can find this by finding the ceiling of (-200 - 5)/13.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to find the first x >= -200 that satisfies x \u2261 5 mod 13.\n\nWe can start from x = -200 and find the smallest x >= -200 that is congruent to 5 mod 13.\n\nLet's find x such that x \u2261 5 mod 13 and x >= -200.\n\nLet me find -200 mod 13.\n\nCalculate -200 divided by 13.\n\n-200 \u00f7 13 = -15.384...\n\n13 * -15 = -195\n\n-195 is greater than -200, so -195 is within the range.\n\nNow, -195 + 5 = -190\n\nWait, this seems similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence.\n\nThe general formula is n = (l - a)/d + 1, where l is the last term, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.\n\nIn this case, the first term a is -190 (since -190 \u2261 5 mod 13), the last term l is 200, and the common difference d is 13.\n\nWait, but 200 \u2261 200 mod 13.\n\nLet's find 200 mod 13.\n\n13 * 15 = 195\n\n200 - 195 = 5, so 200 \u2261 5 mod 13.\n\nInteresting, so 200 is included.\n\nSimilarly, -190 \u2261 5 mod 13, as -190 + 195 = 5.\n\nSo, a = -190, l = 200, d = 13.\n\nNow, n = (l - a)/d + 1 = (200 - (-190))/13 + 1 = (200 + 190)/13 + 1 = 390/13 + 1 = 30 + 1 = 31.\n\nSo, again, I get n = 31.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers from -200 to 200 that are congruent to 5 mod 13 is 31.\n\nThus, the answer is 31, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{31} \\]"
