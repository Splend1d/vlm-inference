The influenza virus, also known as the flu, can cause pandemics when a new strain emerges to which people have little or no immunity.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Epidemic**: This refers to a disease that affects a larger number of people than expected in a particular area or population over a specific period. It is localized and does not spread globally.\n\n- **Endemic**: This term describes a disease that is regularly found in a particular place or population. It is present all the time but at a predictable level.\n\n- **Zoonotic**: These are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Many emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin.\n\nSo, in the case of influenza, when a new strain emerges and spreads worldwide, causing a pandemic, it is classified as a pandemic."
