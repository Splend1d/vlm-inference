                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this legal scenario. So, there's a defendant on trial for robbery, and his attorney wants to call a witness who was convicted of misdemeanor battery nine years ago. The attorney has filed a motion to prevent the prosecution from questioning the witness about this prior conviction. I need to decide whether this motion will likely be granted or denied, and why.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the rules about impeaching a witness's credibility based on prior convictions. In court, a party can attack the credibility of a witness, and one way to do that is by introducing evidence of the witness's prior convictions. However, there are rules that limit which convictions can be used for this purpose, to prevent unfair prejudice against the witness.\n\nI recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 609, there are guidelines for using a witness's criminal convictions to impeach their credibility. Rule 609 deals with the admissibility of evidence of criminal convictions for this purpose.\n\nRule 609(a)(1) generally allows for the admission of evidence of a witness's conviction if it is for a crime that was punishable by death or imprisonment for more than one year, and if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the witness or the accused. However, there are time limits; if more than 10 years have passed since the conviction or the witness's release from confinement for it, whichever is later, the evidence is not admissible unless the prosecution can show that it is still relevant.\n\nBut in this case, the witness was convicted of misdemeanor battery nine years ago. Misdemeanors are typically crimes punishable by imprisonment of one year or less. So, does Rule 609 apply to misdemeanors?\n\nLooking at Rule 609(a)(2), it seems that for crimes that are punishable by imprisonment of not more than one year, or where the fact of imprisonment was less than one year, the court may, in its discretion, consider the admission of such evidence if it finds that it has probative value that outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nSo, in this scenario, since the conviction is for a misdemeanor battery, which is probably a crime punishable by less than one year, the prosecution would need to persuade the court that the probative value of this conviction in assessing the witness's credibility outweighs any prejudicial effect it might have on the witness or the defendant.\n\nGiven that it's been nine years since the conviction, which is less than the 10-year limit, but still a significant amount of time, the court will need to balance these factors.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Granted, as a matter of right.\n\nThis suggests that the motion will be automatically granted without any need for further consideration. But based on what I know, the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes is not something that is automatically granted or denied; it requires a case-by-case analysis. So, I don't think this is the correct answer.\n\nB. Granted, because the prejudice to the defendant substantially outweighs the probative value of admitting the witness's conviction.\n\nThis option is arguing that allowing the prosecution to question the witness about their prior conviction would be more prejudicial to the defendant than it would be probative. In other words, it would unfairly harm the defendant's case without adding much value to assessing the witness's credibility.\n\nThis seems plausible. If the prior conviction is for a misdemeanor from nine years ago, it might not have much bearing on the witness's current credibility, and bringing it up could unduly prejudice the jury against the defendant.\n\nC. Denied, because the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party.\n\nThis option suggests that because impeaching a witness's credibility is a fundamental right in litigation, the motion should be denied. However, while it's true that parties can attack a witness's credibility, there are limitations, especially regarding the use of prior convictions, as we've established.\n\nSo, while in general credibility can be attacked, specific rules govern the use of prior convictions, so I don't think this is the best answer.\n\nD. Denied, because a period of less than 10 years has elapsed since the date of conviction.\n\nThis option is referencing the 10-year rule in Rule 609. Since it's been only nine years since the conviction, this might suggest that the evidence is still admissible. However, Rule 609(a)(1) generally applies to felonies, not misdemeanors, and for felonies, the 10-year limit applies differently.\n\nGiven that the conviction is for a misdemeanor, which falls under Rule 609(a)(2), the time limit isn't as strictly defined. The court has discretion to admit or exclude the evidence based on its probative value versus prejudicial effect, regardless of the time elapsed.\n\nTherefore, I don't think the passage of time is the determining factor here.\n\nConsidering all this, option B seems the most appropriate. The motion to disallow questioning about the prior conviction will likely be granted because the prejudice to the defendant substantially outweighs the probative value of admitting the witness's conviction.\n\nThe prior conviction is for a misdemeanor from nine years ago, which may not have much bearing on the witness's current credibility, and introducing it could unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
