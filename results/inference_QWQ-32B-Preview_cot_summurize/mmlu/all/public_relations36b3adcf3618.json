                    "text": "So, I've got this question here about mass communication theories, and it's asking about how current thinking compares to early theories about audiences. Early theories seemed to think that audiences were just passive recipients, like they were sitting there, absorbing whatever the media was throwing at them, and because of that, they were easy to manipulate. But now, I guess, people think differently about how audiences interact with media.\n\nThe question is: Which of the following best describes current thinking?\n\nOption A says: Audiences are more vulnerable and passive than ever before.\n\nOption B: Television viewing, in particular, creates increased activity in the right hemisphere of the brain.\n\nOption C: Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\nOption D: Technology has led to increasingly passive recipients at the ends of message transmission systems.\n\nHmm, let's see. First, I need to recall what early theories of mass communication suggested. I think one of the earliest theories was the Hypodermic Needle Model, which basically proposed that media messages could directly influence audiences, almost like a needle injecting a drug into someone's bloodstream. So, it was a very direct and powerful effect, and audiences were seen as passive and easily manipulated.\n\nBut over time, researchers started to realize that it's not that simple. Audiences don't just passively accept whatever the media says; they interpret messages based on their own experiences, beliefs, and social contexts. So, current thinking is probably more nuanced, recognizing that audiences are active participants in the communication process.\n\nLooking at option A, it says that audiences are more vulnerable and passive than ever before. That seems contrary to what I just thought about current thinking. If anything, I would think that nowadays, with so much media available and people having more choices, they might be more active in seeking out information that aligns with their interests and views. So, this option doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B talks about television viewing increasing activity in the right hemisphere of the brain. While that might be true from a neurological perspective, I'm not sure how directly that relates to the concept of passive versus active audiences in mass communication theory. It seems a bit off-topic.\n\nOption C says that active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages. This sounds more in line with current thinking. If audiences are active receivers, they wouldn't all be affected the same way by a message. Different people might interpret the same message differently based on their individual characteristics and contexts. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption D suggests that technology has led to increasingly passive recipients. Again, this seems counterintuitive. With the rise of interactive technologies, social media, and user-generated content, audiences are more engaged and active than ever before. So, this doesn't align with what I think current thinking is.\n\nBetween options C and D, C seems to better describe current thinking about mass communication and audience reception. It acknowledges that audiences are active and that their reactions to media messages vary.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should look back at some key theories in mass communication to confirm.\n\nThere's the Uses and Gratifications Theory, which suggests that audiences are active in choosing and using media to satisfy their own needs. Then there's the Encoding/Decoding Model by Stuart Hall, which proposes that meaning is not just encoded by the sender but is also decoded by the receiver in ways that can vary based on their perspective.\n\nThese theories emphasize audience activity and diversity in interpretation, which supports option C.\n\nOption D, on the other hand, suggests a return to passivity, which doesn't align with these more contemporary theories.\n\nOption B is more about the neurological effects of television viewing, which, while interesting, doesn't directly address the active/passive nature of audiences in mass communication.\n\nOption A is contrary to the progression of thought in mass communication theory, which has moved from seeing audiences as passive and uniform to recognizing their active and diverse roles.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be option C: Active receivers are not uniformly affected by mass communication messages.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
