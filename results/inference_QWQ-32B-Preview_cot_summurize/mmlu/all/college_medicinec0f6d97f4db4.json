                    "text": "So I've got this question here about branched-chain amino acids and what happens when they're deaminated in muscle. It's asking what happens to the ammonia that's produced mostly. There are four options:\n\nA. It's converted into arginine and released from the muscle.\n\nB. It's converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.\n\nC. It's converted into urea and released from the muscle.\n\nD. It's used to synthesise purines and pyrimidines in the muscle.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what deamination is. Deamination is when an amino acid loses its amino group, which is NH2, and that becomes ammonia, NH3. So, when branched-chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, they're losing their amino group, producing ammonia.\n\nNow, muscles are kind of interesting because they don't have the full urea cycle, which is the main pathway for dealing with ammonia in the liver. So, they can't convert ammonia into urea like the liver can. That makes me a bit suspicious of option C.\n\nLet me think about option A: converted into arginine and released. Arginine is an amino acid, and I don't recall any direct conversion of ammonia into arginine, especially in muscle. So, that seems unlikely.\n\nOption B: converted into alanine and glutamine and released. Hmm, alanine and glutamine are both amino acids that can act as ammonia carriers. Alanine is produced from pyruvate and ammonia in a process called glutamate dehydrogenation and transamination. Glutamine, on the other hand, can directly incorporate ammonia by attaching it to glutamate to form glutamine.\n\nOption D: used to synthesise purines and pyrimidines in the muscle. Well, purines and pyrimidines are nitrogenous bases used in nucleic acids, and ammonia is a source of nitrogen for their synthesis. However, I'm not sure if this is the main fate of ammonia in muscle.\n\nGiven that muscles can't efficiently excrete ammonia directly, they need to convert it into something that can be transported to the liver for further processing. That's where the alanine and glutamine come in.\n\nAlanine is particularly important in the glucose-alanine cycle, where muscles export alanine to the liver, and the liver can then convert it back to pyruvate and use it for gluconeogenesis, while also handling the ammonia.\n\nGlutamine is another amino acid that can transport ammonia from muscles to the liver, where it can be deaminated in the liver to release ammonia, which is then incorporated into urea.\n\nSo, it seems like option B makes the most sense because it involves converting ammonia into alanine and glutamine, which can then be released from the muscle and transported to the liver for further processing.\n\nOption C is less likely because, as I mentioned, muscles don't have the full urea cycle to convert ammonia into urea. The liver is the primary site for urea production.\n\nOption D might be a secondary function, but it doesn't seem to be the main way ammonia is handled in muscles.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is B: converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
