                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about protein requirements. So, we have four options here, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's look at each one step by step.\n\nOption A says: \"The protein requirement is equal to the demand multiplied by the efficiency of utilization.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit off. If efficiency of utilization is high, meaning the body uses protein effectively, then you might need less protein to meet the demand. So, multiplying demand by efficiency might actually give a lower number, which doesn't make sense because if efficiency is high, you shouldn't need more protein. Maybe I'm misthinking this.\n\nOption B: \"The protein requirement is equal to the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.\" Okay, this seems more plausible. If efficiency is high, dividing the demand by a higher number would result in a lower protein requirement. That makes sense because if your body uses protein more efficiently, you need less of it to meet the same demand. This seems logical.\n\nOption C: \"The protein requirement can be less than the demand.\" This one is tricky. In general, the protein requirement should meet or exceed the demand to ensure that the body has enough to function properly. If the requirement is less than the demand, there might be a deficiency, which could lead to health issues. So, I think this might not be correct.\n\nOption D: \"The protein requirement is always the same as the demand.\" Well, this seems too absolute. Protein requirements can vary based on factors like age, activity level, and overall health. So, saying it's always the same as the demand doesn't account for these variations.\n\nLet me think about this again. Protein demand refers to how much protein the body needs for maintenance, growth, and other functions. Protein requirement is the amount of protein that should be consumed to meet that demand. Efficiency of utilization refers to how effectively the body uses the protein it gets.\n\nIf the body is efficient at using protein, you might need to consume less protein to meet the same demand. That ties back to option B, where requirement equals demand divided by efficiency. That makes sense because a higher efficiency would mean a lower required intake to meet the demand.\n\nOption C suggests that the requirement can be less than the demand, which, as I thought earlier, could lead to deficiency. It's possible in some cases where the body can adapt to lower protein intakes, but generally, the requirement should at least meet the demand to prevent deficiency.\n\nOption D is too broad. Requirements vary based on individual needs.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, option B seems to be the correct statement about protein requirements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
