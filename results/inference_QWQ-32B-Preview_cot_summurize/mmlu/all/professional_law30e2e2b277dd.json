                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with a lot of details, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a conservationist who owned a tract of land in 1954. He conveyed it to his aunt with a fee simple title but included a condition: neither the aunt nor her heirs or assigns could use the property for any commercial purpose. If any part of the tract was used for other than residential purposes, the grantor or his successors could re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. This deed was properly recorded.\n\nThen, the aunt developed the tract into a residential subdivision between 1960 and 1969, dividing it into 100 single-acre lots, all sold during that decade, with single-family residential dwellings built on all but four lots. Those four lots were sold to an investor in 1968, and the deed to those four lots contained the same restriction as the original deed from the conservationist to the aunt.\n\nIn 1980, a bank acquired the investor's four lots through foreclosure and then sold them to a woman, but the deed to her didn't mention the restriction. Now, the woman wants to build a service station on her parcel, and we need to figure out which argument would give her the best chance to do so.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The restriction against residential use is void as violative of the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nWait, the restriction is against commercial use, not residential use. The deed says \"neither she nor her heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose.\" So, it's preserving the land for residential use only. Maybe there's a typo in option A? Perhaps it should say \"against commercial use\"?\n\nAssuming it's a typo and it's about the restriction against commercial use, let's consider the Rule against Perpetuities. This rule generally says that any interest in property must vest, if at all, no later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. Restrictive covenants like this could potentially violate that rule if they run indefinitely.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions, restrictive covenements are given a presumption of validity, and courts may interpret them to comply with the Rule against Perpetuities. Also, some modern statutes have modified or repealed the Rule against Perpetuities, so it might not even apply in this jurisdiction.\n\nSo, this argument might not be the strongest, especially if the jurisdiction has modified the Rule against Perpetuities.\n\nB. The commercial development surrounding the property has made the deed restriction unenforceable.\n\nThis seems to be referring to the doctrine of changed conditions or commercial impracticability. The idea is that if the surrounding area has significantly changed since the restriction was imposed, making the restriction no longer feasible or reasonable, a court might enforce the restriction.\n\nHowever, restrictive covenants are generally enforceable as long as they serve a legitimate purpose and haven't been modified or abandoned. The fact that surrounding properties have been developed commercially might not necessarily make the restriction unenforceable, especially if the restriction is still serving its original purpose of preserving a residential character in this particular tract.\n\nSo, this argument might not be the most persuasive.\n\nC. When the woman purchased the property from the bank, the deed did not contain any mention of the restriction.\n\nThis is an interesting point. The original restriction was imposed by the conservationist on the aunt, and the aunt passed it on to the investor in 1968 through a deed that included the restriction. Then, the bank foreclosed on the investor and sold the property to the woman in 1980, with a deed that didn't mention the restriction.\n\nIn this jurisdiction, the recording statute says that no unrecorded instrument affects the title or rights of a purchaser in good faith without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments.\n\nSo, if the restriction wasn't mentioned in the deed to the woman and she had no knowledge of it, she might be able to argue that she's a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the restriction, and therefore the restriction doesn't bind her.\n\nThis could be a strong argument, but we need to consider whether the restriction was of record. The original deed from the conservationist to the aunt included the restriction and was recorded. The deeds from the aunt to the investor likely included the restriction as well, assuming they were properly conveyed with the restrictions running with the land.\n\nHowever, when the bank sold the property to the woman, the deed didn't mention the restriction. If the restriction is part of the chain of title and properly recorded, a subsequent purchaser might still be bound by it, even if it's not mentioned in their deed, especially if the recording statute implies notice.\n\nBut, if the woman had no actual knowledge and didn't have constructive knowledge through recording, she might argue that she's not bound by the restriction.\n\nThis seems like a plausible argument.\n\nD. The jurisdiction in which the tract is located approved a zoning ordinance permitting the commercial development of the area surrounding the woman's property.\n\nZoning ordinances regulate land use at the municipal level, but private restrictive covenants are agreements between private parties. Generally, zoning ordinances and private restrictive covenants are separate systems, and one doesn't necessarily override the other.\n\nHowever, if the zoning allows commercial use, and there's a private restrictive covenant prohibiting commercial use, the restrictive covenant would still bind the parties to it, preventing commercial use even if zoning allows it.\n\nUnless the zoning ordinance specifically supersedes private restrictions, which is unlikely, the restrictive covenant would still be enforceable.\n\nTherefore, this argument might not help the woman in enforcing her right to build a service station.\n\nConsidering all the options, option C seems to offer the woman the best chance. If she can argue that she was a bona fide purchaser without notice of the restriction, and since the deed to her didn't mention the restriction, she might be able to avoid being bound by it.\n\nHowever, this depends on the specifics of the recording statute and whether the restriction is considered of public record or if it's solely a matter of the chain of title.\n\nGiven the information provided, I think option C is the strongest argument for the woman to proceed with building the service station.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
