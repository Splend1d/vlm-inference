                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a filling machine that puts coffee into jars. On average, it puts four ounces per jar, and there's a standard deviation of 0.25 ounces. Then, forty jars are selected at random, and I need to find the probability that the mean amount per jar in these sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces. The options are A) 0.0057, B) 0.0225, C) 0.025, and D) 0.05.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to recall some statistics here. I think this has to do with sampling distributions and the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem says that if you take enough samples, the distribution of the sample means will approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the population's distribution.\n\nSo, in this case, the population mean (mu) is 4 ounces, and the population standard deviation (sigma) is 0.25 ounces. The sample size (n) is 40 jars.\n\nI need to find the probability that the sample mean (x-bar) is less than 3.9 ounces.\n\nTo find this probability, I should standardize the sample mean to a z-score and then use the standard normal distribution table.\n\nThe formula for the z-score of the sample mean is:\n\nz = (x-bar - mu) / (sigma / sqrt(n))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx-bar = 3.9\n\nmu = 4\n\nsigma = 0.25\n\nn = 40\n\nSo,\n\nz = (3.9 - 4) / (0.25 / sqrt(40))\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n0.25 / sqrt(40) = 0.25 / 6.3246 = approximately 0.0395\n\nThen,\n\nz = (-0.1) / 0.0395 = approximately -2.53\n\nNow, I need to find the probability that z is less than -2.53 in a standard normal distribution.\n\nLooking up -2.53 in the z-table, or using a calculator, I find that the probability is approximately 0.0057.\n\nSo, the probability that the mean amount per jar in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces is 0.0057.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A) 0.0057.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure.\n\nFirst, the standard error is sigma divided by the square root of n:\n\n0.25 / sqrt(40) = 0.25 / 6.3246 = 0.0395, which seems correct.\n\nThen, z = (3.9 - 4) / 0.0395 = -0.1 / 0.0395 = -2.53\n\nAnd the probability for z < -2.53 is indeed approximately 0.0057.\n\nSo, I think A) 0.0057 is the correct answer.\n\nBut why are there other options like 0.0225, 0.025, and 0.05? Maybe some common mistakes lead to those values.\n\nFor example, if someone mistakenly used the population standard deviation instead of the standard error, they would calculate:\n\nz = (3.9 - 4) / 0.25 = -0.1 / 0.25 = -0.4\n\nThe probability for z < -0.4 is approximately 0.3446, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used a different formula or misapplied the central limit theorem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they thought that the sample size is small and used a t-distribution instead of a z-distribution.\n\nBut with n=40, which is sufficiently large, the z-distribution should be a good approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they miscalculated the standard error.\n\nWait, if they mistakenly used sigma = 0.25 and n=40, but made an error in calculating the standard error.\n\nLet me see, sqrt(40) is approximately 6.3246, so 0.25 / 6.3246 = 0.0395, which seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used a different value for sigma.\n\nWait, the problem says standard deviation is 0.25 ounces, so that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they misread the sample mean as 3.9 ounces instead of 4 ounces, but no, the sample mean is what we're trying to find the probability for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they used the wrong formula for z-score.\n\nWait, the formula I used seems correct: z = (x-bar - mu) / (sigma / sqrt(n))\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they thought that the sample mean cannot be less than the population mean, but that's not the case, as sample means can vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they thought about the individual jar's amount being less than 3.9 ounces, not the sample mean.\n\nWait, that would be a different calculation.\n\nFor an individual jar, the z-score would be:\n\nz = (3.9 - 4) / 0.25 = -0.1 / 0.25 = -0.4\n\nAnd P(z < -0.4) is approximately 0.3446, which isn't among the options.\n\nSo, that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they misread the sample size.\n\nWait, n=40 is given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they used a different value for mu or sigma.\n\nBut overall, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the answer should be A) 0.0057.\n\nIt's possible that the other options correspond to different calculations or mistakes, but based on the problem given, A) 0.0057 seems to be the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
