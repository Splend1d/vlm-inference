I remember that the Indus Valley Civilization was highly organized, with cities planned in a grid pattern. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: \"A citadel was built on the western margin of each city.\" I think citadels were important parts of Indus Valley cities, often used for administrative or religious purposes. But I'm not sure if they were always built on the western side. Maybe I should recall the layout of some famous Indus Valley cities like Mohenjo-Daro or Harappa. In Mohenjo-Daro, the citadel is in the western part, but I don't know if this was a standard feature in all Indus Valley cities. Perhaps this might not be always true.\n\nOption B: \"The 'upper cities' were encompassed by monumental walls.\" I believe the upper cities referred to the citadel areas, which were often walled for protection or privacy. So, this seems likely to be true.\n\nOption C: \"The blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed.\" Now, I know that Indus Valley cities were known for their grid planning, with streets running at right angles to each other. Houses were built along these streets in a organized manner. So, \"added haphazardly as needed\" doesn't sound right. Maybe this is the false statement.\n\nOption D: \"The bricks used in the houses were a consistent size and shape.\" I recall that the Indus Valley Civilization had standardized brick sizes, which is evident from the uniformity in their constructions. So, this seems true.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. If the cities were planned in a grid pattern, with streets at right angles, and bricks of standard size, then adding residential blocks haphazardly doesn't fit with the overall planning. So, option C seems to be the incorrect statement.\n\nBut just to be sure, let's consider option A again. While citadels were present in major cities, I'm not certain if they were always located on the western margin. Maybe in some cities, they were placed differently. However, the question is about the main Indus Valley cities, which probably follow a similar pattern.\n\nOption B seems true, as citadels were likely protected areas.\n\nOption C contradicts the general understanding of Indus Valley urban planning, which was highly organized.\n\nOption D is supported by archaeological evidence showing standardized brick sizes.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is probably option C: \"The blocks of residences were added haphazardly as needed.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
