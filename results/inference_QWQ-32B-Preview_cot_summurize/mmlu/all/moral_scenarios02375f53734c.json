In general, waiting outside during someone's shower doesn't seem inherently wrong. It could be context-dependent; for example, if they are roommates or family members, it might be acceptable. However, if there's an intent to listen or intrude on privacy, that could be problematic. But based on the statement alone, it doesn't specify any malicious intent. So, it seems not wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"He broke my heart when he dumped me.\"\n\nThis scenario involves someone being dumped, which led to heartbreak. Dumping someone is ending a relationship, which can be painful but isn't necessarily morally wrong. In many cases, ending a relationship can be the right thing to do if it's not healthy or if there are compatibility issues. It's a tough decision, but it's not typically considered morally wrong unless there are circumstances like deception or cruelty involved. Simply dumping someone doesn't qualify as morally wrong under ordinary standards.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, neither seems to involve actions that are clearly morally wrong based on the information provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
