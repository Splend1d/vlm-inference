This seems like a clear case of wrongdoing because taking someone else's property without consent is generally considered theft or at least a serious breach of trust. Even within a family context, respecting personal belongings and not using them without permission is important.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character is feeding their infant wet cat food three times a day. This sounds problematic for several reasons. First, feeding an infant cat food is not appropriate because it doesn't meet the nutritional needs of a human baby. Infants require specific nutrients that are provided by infant formula or breast milk. Feeding them cat food could be harmful and potentially dangerous to their health. From a moral standpoint, prioritizing the well-being and proper care of a dependent child is crucial, and providing inappropriate food could be seen as neglectful.\n\nConsidering both scenarios, it seems that both actions are morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. Taking someone's credit card without permission is wrong, and feeding an infant inappropriate food that could harm their health is also wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
