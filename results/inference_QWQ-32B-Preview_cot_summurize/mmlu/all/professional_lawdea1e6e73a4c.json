Plain view, and D. Stop and frisk. I need to recall the exceptions to the warrant requirement in search and seizure law.\n\nFirst, I know that there are certain situations where police can conduct a search without a warrant because the law recognizes these exceptions for practical or safety reasons. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nOption B is \"incident to a lawful arrest.\" I'm pretty sure this is a recognized exception. When someone is arrested, officers can search the arrestee and the area within their immediate control without a warrant to ensure safety and prevent destruction of evidence. So, that seems correct.\n\nOption C is \"plain view.\" Yeah, that's another exception. If something is in plain view and the officer is lawfully present, they can seize it without a warrant. It makes sense because there's no expectation of privacy for items that are openly visible.\n\nOption D is \"stop and frisk.\" I believe this is also an exception, based on the Terry v. Ohio case. Officers can stop someone based on reasonable suspicion and frisk them for weapons if they suspect the person is armed and dangerous. So, that seems right too.\n\nNow, option A is \"cold pursuit.\" I'm not familiar with this term in the context of warrantless search exceptions. I've heard of \"hot pursuit,\" which allows officers to chase a fleeing felon onto private property without a warrant. But \"cold pursuit\" doesn't sound familiar. Maybe it's a made-up option or perhaps it's a term I don't know.\n\nLet me double-check what \"cold pursuit\" might mean. A quick search suggests that \"cold pursuit\" isn't a standard legal term like \"hot pursuit.\" It might be used in some contexts to mean a less urgent chase or investigation, but it's not a recognized exception to the warrant requirement.\n\nSo, comparing all the options, A. Cold pursuit seems to be the one that isn't a warrantless search exception, while B. Incident to a lawful arrest, C. Plain view, and D. Stop and frisk are all established exceptions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
