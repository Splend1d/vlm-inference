                    "text": "This question is about contract law, specifically focusing on assignments and modifications of contracts. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, there's a written contract between the owner of a pizza restaurant and an employee. The employee is hired as the manager for three years, with a salary of $2,000 per month, paid half to the employee and half to the employee's elderly mother. Importantly, the contract includes a clause stating that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable.\"\n\nSo, the contract is clear: $1,000 to the employee and $1,000 to the mother each month for three years, and these payments cannot be assigned to someone else.\n\nNow, the mother writes a letter to the owner asking him to pay her share directly to the nursing home where she is a patient. The owner complies with this for the first year, paying $1,000 to the employee and $1,000 to the nursing home each month.\n\nAfter a year, a new pizza restaurant opens across the street, causing business to decline. The owner tells the employee that unless he agrees to a salary cut, he'll be fired. The employee reluctantly agrees to a $500 per month cut, so now the owner promises to pay $1,000 to the employee and $500 to the nursing home.\n\nThe question is: If the nursing home sues the owner for breach of contract, who is most likely to prevail?\n\nLet's consider the options:\n\nA. The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\n\nB. The owner, because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\n\nC. The nursing home, because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nD. The nursing home, because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what happened with the mother's request to pay her share to the nursing home.\n\nThe mother wrote a letter asking the owner to pay her $1,000 directly to the nursing home. This seems like an assignment by the mother of her right to receive $1,000 per month from the owner to the nursing home.\n\nHowever, the contract has an anti-assignment clause, which says that \"the monies due hereunder shall not be assignable.\" This clause is intended to prevent either party from assigning their rights under the contract without the other party's consent.\n\nGiven that there's an anti-assignment clause, any attempt to assign the right to receive payments would likely be invalid unless the owner consents to the assignment.\n\nIn this case, the owner did pay the nursing home $1,000 per month for the first year, which could be seen as implied consent to the assignment. But after that, the owner unilaterally reduced the payment to the nursing home to $500 per month, following the employee's agreement to the salary cut.\n\nNow, the nursing home is suing the owner for breaching the contract by reducing the payment from $1,000 to $500 per month.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nOption A suggests that the owner would prevail because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void due to the anti-assignment clause.\n\nBut, since the owner had been paying the nursing home for a year, this could be seen as consent to the assignment. Therefore, the anti-assignment clause might not bar the assignment in this case.\n\nOption B says the owner would prevail because the agreement between the owner and the employee reduced the owner's obligations to the nursing home.\n\nHowever, the agreement was only between the owner and the employee, and it's unclear whether the employee had the authority to bind the nursing home or the mother in this arrangement.\n\nOption C states that the nursing home would prevail because the mother's assignment would be enforceable despite the agreement between the owner and the employee.\n\nThis could be possible if the assignment is valid and the owner cannot unilaterally change the payment terms.\n\nOption D says the nursing home would prevail because the mother's gratuitous assignment was irrevocable.\n\nA gratuitous assignment is one made without consideration, and generally, such assignments are revocable by the assignor unless there's reliance by the assignee.\n\nIn this case, the mother assigned her right to receive payments to the nursing home, presumably gratuitously, and the nursing home relied on this by accepting payments for a year.\n\nHowever, given the anti-assignment clause, the validity of this assignment is questionable.\n\nConsidering all this, the key point is the anti-assignment clause in the contract. Despite the owner's initial payment to the nursing home, which might imply consent to the assignment, the clause suggests that assignments are not permitted without the owner's explicit consent.\n\nMoreover, the agreement between the owner and the employee to reduce the payment to the nursing home seems like an attempt to modify the original contract.\n\nContract modifications generally require the consent of all parties affected by the change. Since the nursing home was receiving payments under the assignment, any reduction in payment would adversely affect them, and thus their consent should be required to modify the contract.\n\nHowever, in this scenario, it's not clear that the nursing home was a party to the original contract or that they had direct dealings with the owner beyond receiving payments.\n\nGiven these complexities, option A seems the most accurate: The owner is likely to prevail because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void due to the anti-assignment clause in the contract.\n\nThis is because the anti-assignment clause prohibits the assignment of monies due under the contract without the owner's consent. Even if the owner initially paid the nursing home, that might be seen as a voluntary payment rather than consent to the assignment.\n\nTherefore, the owner could argue that the assignment was invalid due to the anti-assignment clause, and thus the nursing home has no enforceable right to receive payments under the contract.\n\nOption B is similar but focuses on the agreement between the owner and the employee reducing the owner's obligations to the nursing home. However, since the nursing home was not a party to this agreement, any reduction in payment would likely not be binding on them.\n\nOptions C and D suggest that the nursing home would prevail because the assignment was enforceable, but given the anti-assignment clause, this seems less likely.\n\nIn conclusion, the most probable answer is A: The owner, because the mother's assignment to the nursing home was void as violative of the anti-assignment clause.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
