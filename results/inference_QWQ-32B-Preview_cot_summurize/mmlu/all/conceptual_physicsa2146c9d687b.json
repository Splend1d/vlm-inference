                    "text": "Let's consider this problem step by step. We have a ball hanging from a string, and initially, it's at rest, so the tension in the string is equal to the weight of the ball, which is mg. Now, if we make the ball move in a horizontal circle, so that the string describes a cone, we need to figure out how the tension in the string changes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the forces acting on the ball when it's moving in a horizontal circle. There are two main forces: the tension in the string and the weight of the ball.\n\nThe tension in the string has two components: one that acts vertically upwards, counteracting the weight of the ball, and another that acts horizontally, providing the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion.\n\nSo, if we resolve the tension into its vertical and horizontal components, we can analyze each component separately.\n\nLet's denote the tension in the string as T, and the angle between the string and the vertical as \u03b8.\n\nThe vertical component of the tension is T cos \u03b8, and this must balance the weight of the ball, which is mg. So, we have:\n\nT cos \u03b8 = mg\n\nThe horizontal component of the tension is T sin \u03b8, and this provides the centripetal force required for the circular motion. The centripetal force is given by:\n\nF_centripetal = m v^2 / r\n\nwhere v is the speed of the ball and r is the radius of the circular path.\n\nNow, the radius r can be related to the length of the string L and the angle \u03b8:\n\nr = L sin \u03b8\n\nSo, the centripetal force equation becomes:\n\nT sin \u03b8 = m v^2 / (L sin \u03b8)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nT sin \u03b8 = m v^2 / (L sin \u03b8)\n\nMultiplying both sides by sin \u03b8:\n\nT sin^2 \u03b8 = m v^2 / L\n\nNow, from the vertical equilibrium equation, T cos \u03b8 = mg, we can solve for T:\n\nT = mg / cos \u03b8\n\nSubstituting this into the previous equation:\n\n(mg / cos \u03b8) sin^2 \u03b8 = m v^2 / L\n\nSimplifying:\n\nmg (sin^2 \u03b8 / cos \u03b8) = m v^2 / L\n\nWe can cancel m from both sides:\n\ng (sin^2 \u03b8 / cos \u03b8) = v^2 / L\n\nNow, solving for v^2:\n\nv^2 = g L (sin^2 \u03b8 / cos \u03b8)\n\nThis equation relates the speed of the ball to the angle \u03b8 and the length of the string.\n\nBut our goal is to find out how the tension T compares to mg.\n\nFrom T = mg / cos \u03b8, we can see that T depends on \u03b8.\n\nSince cos \u03b8 is always less than or equal to 1 (for \u03b8 between 0 and 90 degrees), T is always greater than or equal to mg.\n\nHowever, in the initial condition, when the ball is at rest, \u03b8 is 0 degrees, and cos \u03b8 is 1, so T = mg.\n\nWhen the ball is moving, \u03b8 is greater than 0 degrees, so cos \u03b8 is less than 1, which means T is greater than mg.\n\nTherefore, the tension in the string is always greater than mg when the ball is moving in a horizontal circle.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. is greater than mg always.\n\nBut let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider energy considerations. When the ball is moving, it has kinetic energy in addition to its potential energy. However, in this setup, the tension in the string is primarily related to the forces acting on the ball, not directly to its energy.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the tension in the string must support the weight of the ball and also provide the necessary centripetal force for the circular motion. Therefore, it makes sense that T would be greater than mg.\n\nIs there any scenario where T could be less than mg? If the ball were moving in a vertical circle, and at the top of the loop, it's possible for T to be less than mg, but in this case, it's moving in a horizontal circle, so the string is always inclined at some angle \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, in this specific setup, T is always greater than mg when the ball is moving.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. is greater than mg always.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
