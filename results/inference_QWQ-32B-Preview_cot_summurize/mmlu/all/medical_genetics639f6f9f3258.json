So, I need to pick the best reason from these options.\n\nOption A says it's commercially important as a food crop. Hmm, I don't think Arabidopsis is a food crop. I think it's more of a model organism in science. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption B says it's an endangered species. Being endangered wouldn't make it advantageous for research, would it? Probably not, because if it's rare, it might be hard to get and study. So, maybe this isn't the answer.\n\nOption C says it's the closest to humans of any existing plant. I'm not sure what that means exactly. Plants and humans are quite different biologically, so I doubt that's why it's used in genetic research. Maybe this isn't the correct option.\n\nOption D says it's a small plant with a small genome size which can be raised inexpensively. That sounds promising. Being small and having a small genome would make it easier to study genetically. Also, being inexpensive to raise would be practical for research purposes.\n\nLet me think about this again. Arabidopsis thaliana is indeed a model organism in plant biology. It's widely used because of its small size, short life cycle, and small genome, which makes it easier to grow and study in lab conditions. It's not particularly important as a food crop, and I don't think it's endangered. Also, I don't think it's closer to humans than other plants in terms of genetics.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the correct answer is D: it's a small plant with a small genome size which can be raised inexpensively.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
