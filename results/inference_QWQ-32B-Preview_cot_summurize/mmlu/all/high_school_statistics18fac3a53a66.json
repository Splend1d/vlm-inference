                    "text": "So I've got this question about z-scores in relation to a runner's marathon times. It says that the times are normally distributed, and this week his z-score is -2. I need to pick the correct interpretation from four options.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a z-score is. I know that z-score tells me how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The formula is z = (X - \u03bc) / \u03c3, where X is the value, \u03bc is the mean, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n\nIn this case, the z-score is -2, which means the runner's time is 2 standard deviations below the mean time.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. This week his time was two minutes lower than his time last week.\n\nB. This week his time was two minutes lower than his best time ever.\n\nC. This week his time was two minutes lower than his average time.\n\nD. This week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.\n\nOption A compares this week's time to last week's time, but the z-score is about how this week's time compares to the average time, not specifically to last week's time. So A seems incorrect.\n\nOption B compares this week's time to his best time ever. Again, the z-score is about the average time, not his best time. So B doesn't seem right.\n\nOption C says his time was two minutes lower than his average time. Well, this is close, but it's not quite accurate. The z-score of -2 means his time is two standard deviations below the mean, not necessarily two minutes below the mean. The standard deviation isn't the same as minutes; it's a measure of spread in the data.\n\nOption D says his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time. That directly matches the definition of a z-score. A z-score of -2 means the value is two standard deviations below the mean.\n\nSo, between C and D, D is more accurate because it refers to standard deviations, not just minutes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. The question is about interpreting the z-score, and z-score is indeed about standard deviations from the mean. So D is correct in that sense.\n\nBut let's think about what \"two standard deviations lower than his average time\" means. The average time is the mean, and standard deviation is a measure of variability in the data. So, if someone is two standard deviations below the mean, it means their time is faster than average, which makes sense for a runner.\n\nOption C is attractive because it's simpler, saying \"two minutes lower than his average time.\" But this ignores the concept of standard deviations, which is crucial for understanding z-scores.\n\nMoreover, the unit of measurement is minutes, but standard deviations aren't necessarily equal to minutes in terms of impact. Standard deviations depend on the spread of the data.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is D: This week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.\n\nI think the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
