                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this problem. It says that a string is plucked and produces four loops, and the length of the string is 12.00 meters. I need to find the wavelength of the wave. The options are 48.0 m, 24.0 m, 6.00 m, and 3.00 m.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means when it says \"four loops.\" I think loops refer to the antinodes in a standing wave on the string. So, if there are four antinodes, that probably means there are four loops above and below the equilibrium position of the string.\n\nI recall that in a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the number of antinodes is related to the harmonic number. For example, the fundamental frequency has one antinode, the second harmonic has two antinodes, and so on. So, if there are four antinodes, it might be the fourth harmonic.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Maybe I should think about the relationship between the wavelength and the length of the string.\n\nIn a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the length of the string is equal to an integer multiple of half-wavelengths. So, the formula is:\n\nL = n(\u03bb/2)\n\nwhere L is the length of the string, n is the harmonic number, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nIn this case, with four antinodes, I need to figure out what n is.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If there are four antinodes, that means there are four points of maximum displacement. In a standing wave, antinodes are separated by nodes. So, for four antinodes, there would be three nodes in between them, plus the nodes at the ends of the string.\n\nWait, no. In a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, there are nodes at both ends. So, for the fundamental frequency, there is one antinode in the middle and two nodes at the ends. For the second harmonic, there are two antinodes and three nodes (two at the ends and one in the middle). For the third harmonic, three antinodes and four nodes, and so on.\n\nSo, in general, the number of antinodes is equal to the harmonic number n.\n\nTherefore, if there are four antinodes, it's the fourth harmonic.\n\nSo, n = 4.\n\nGiven that, I can plug into the formula:\n\nL = n(\u03bb/2)\n\n12.00 m = 4(\u03bb/2)\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n12.00 m = 2\u03bb\n\nSo, \u03bb = 12.00 m / 2 = 6.00 m.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if n really equals the number of antinodes.\n\nFrom my earlier reasoning, it seems that n equals the number of antinodes.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the wavelength in terms of the distance between nodes.\n\nIn a standing wave, the distance between two consecutive nodes is equal to half a wavelength (\u03bb/2).\n\nBut in this case, since the string is fixed at both ends, the total length L is equal to n(\u03bb/2), where n is the harmonic number.\n\nSo, again, with n = 4, L = 4(\u03bb/2) = 2\u03bb.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb = L / 2 = 12.00 m / 2 = 6.00 m.\n\nThat matches option C.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps the four loops correspond to four wavelengths.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because that would imply \u03bb = L / 4 = 12.00 m / 4 = 3.00 m, which is option D.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nI need to resolve this confusion.\n\nLet me look up the relationship between the number of loops (antinodes) and the wavelength in a standing wave on a string.\n\nAfter checking, I find that in a standing wave on a string fixed at both ends, the number of antinodes is equal to the harmonic number n.\n\nThe wavelength is related to the length of the string by the equation:\n\n\u03bb = 2L / n\n\nSo, for n = 4, \u03bb = 2*12.00 m / 4 = 6.00 m.\n\nThat confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each loop corresponds to half a wavelength, since each loop consists of an antinode and a node, and the distance between two nodes is \u03bb/2.\n\nTherefore, with four loops, the total length would be 4*(\u03bb/2) = 2\u03bb.\n\nSo again, \u03bb = L / 2 = 12.00 m / 2 = 6.00 m.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the number of loops is equal to the number of antinodes, which is n, then \u03bb = 2L / n = 2*12.00 m / 4 = 6.00 m.\n\nSo, in all cases, I arrive at \u03bb = 6.00 m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C. 6.00 m.\n\nBut wait, in my initial consideration, I also thought about \u03bb = L / 4 = 3.00 m, which is option D.\n\nI need to understand why that approach is incorrect.\n\nI think the mistake lies in assuming that each loop corresponds to one wavelength.\n\nIn reality, each loop corresponds to half a wavelength, because each loop consists of an antinode and a node, which is half a wavelength.\n\nTherefore, four loops correspond to four half-wavelengths, or two full wavelengths.\n\nHence, \u03bb = L / 2 = 6.00 m.\n\nThat's why option D (3.00 m) is incorrect in this context.\n\nSo, to summarize, the wavelength of the wave is 6.00 meters.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
