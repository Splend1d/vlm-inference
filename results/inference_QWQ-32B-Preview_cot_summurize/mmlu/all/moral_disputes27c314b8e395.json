                    "text": "So I've got this question here from Norcross, and it's about morality and how it applies to certain actions. The statement is: \"If morality demands that we not torture puppies merely to enhance our own eating pleasure, morality also demands that...\" and then it gives a few options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the premise. It's saying that morality tells us not to torture puppies just to make our eating experience better. So, it's about not causing unnecessary harm to animals for our own pleasure.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of the options follows from that premise. Let's look at each one:\n\nA. We try to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nB. We donate money to Oxfam.\n\nC. We not support factory farming.\n\nD. We follow the Golden Rule.\n\nLet's think about each one in relation to the premise.\n\nOption A: Reducing our carbon footprint is about being environmentally conscious, which is related to morality in terms of caring for the planet and future generations. But it's not directly connected to the treatment of animals for eating pleasure. So, it might be a stretch to say that the premise directly implies this.\n\nOption B: Donating to Oxfam is about helping people in need, which is a moral action. But again, it's not directly related to the treatment of animals for eating pleasure. So, similar to option A, it might not directly follow from the premise.\n\nOption C: Not supporting factory farming. Factory farming is known for its treatment of animals, often involving conditions that many people consider cruel. So, if morality demands that we not torture puppies for our eating pleasure, it might also demand that we not support systems that treat other animals cruelly for the same purpose. This seems closely related to the premise.\n\nOption D: Following the Golden Rule, which is \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" This is a general moral principle about treating others as you'd like to be treated. While it's a fundamental moral guideline, it's not specifically about the treatment of animals or eating pleasure.\n\nConsidering these points, option C seems to be the most directly related to the premise. The premise is about not causing unnecessary harm to animals for eating pleasure, and factory farming is a system that often involves such treatment. Therefore, if we accept that morality prohibits torturing puppies for eating pleasure, it would logically follow that morality also prohibits supporting factory farming for the same reasons.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. We not support factory farming.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
