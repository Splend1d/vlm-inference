                    "text": "So I've got this scenario here, and I need to figure out what kind of interest the coal company has in the woman's property. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the woman inherited her father's farm after he died testate, meaning he had a will. But that part doesn't directly relate to the issue at hand. The important part is that she was already running the farm due to her father's declining health. Then, she granted a coal company rights to strip-mine coal from under the farm.\n\nThey had an agreement where the coal company would pay her a per-ton royalty for the coal extracted, and in return, the company agreed to fill in the excavated area and replace the topsoil on the surface of the land. But later, the woman noticed that the company wasn't filling in the excavated area as agreed. Even though the company was paying her the royalties, she didn't object to their failure to replace the topsoil.\n\nTwo years later, the coal company finished its strip-mining operations under their arrangement with the woman. Now, I need to identify what kind of interest the coal company had in the woman's property.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Profit-\u00e0-prendre.\n\nB. License.\n\nC. Easement in gross.\n\nD. Voluntary waste.\n\nLet's look at each one.\n\nStarting with A, profit-\u00e0-prendre. I think this is a type of interest in property that allows someone to take something from the land, like minerals or timber. It seems similar to what's happening here, since the coal company is extracting coal from under the farm.\n\nOption B is a license. A license is usually a revocable permission to use someone else's property for a specific purpose. It's generally not as formal as other interests and can be terminated by the owner at any time.\n\nOption C is an easement in gross. An easement in gross is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose, but it's not attached to another piece of land. It's personal to the holder of the easement.\n\nOption D is voluntary waste. That's when a life tenant intentionally damages the property, reducing its value for the remainderman or reversioner.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, the coal company was granted rights to strip-mine coal from under the farm, with a promise to pay royalties and to fill in the excavated areas and replace the topsoil. But they didn't fill in the areas and replace the topsoil, even though they paid the royalties.\n\nGiven that, it seems like the coal company had some kind of legal interest in the land to extract the coal. So, between profit-\u00e0-prendre, license, and easement in gross, which one fits best?\n\nA profit-\u00e0-prendre does sound like it allows someone to take something from the land, which is what the coal company was doing by extracting coal. A license is more temporary and can be revoked, but in this case, there was a specific agreement that lasted for two years until the mining was complete.\n\nAn easement in gross is a right to use the land for a specific purpose, but it's usually for a nonpossessory use, like accessing the land or running utilities across it. Extracting minerals might be considered possessory, so maybe not quite fitting.\n\nVoluntary waste doesn't seem to apply here because it involves a life tenant damaging the property, and in this case, the woman owns the property outright; she's not a life tenant.\n\nSo, profit-\u00e0-prendre seems to be the most appropriate answer. It allows the coal company to extract minerals from the land in exchange for payment, and there was an agreement outlining the terms, including the obligation to restore the land, which they didn't fully comply with.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check what exactly a profit-\u00e0-prendre is. From what I recall, it's a type of interest in land that gives the holder the right to take something from the land, like minerals or timber, and it's often granted in exchange for payment.\n\nIn comparison, a license is more informal and can be revoked at any time, whereas a profit-\u00e0-prendre is a more formal interest, often with defined terms and durations.\n\nAn easement in gross, as I mentioned, is a right to use the land for a specific purpose, but it's typically not for extraction of resources; more for things like access or utility lines.\n\nSo, in this case, since the coal company was extracting coal from under the farm and paying royalties for it, with a specific agreement about the terms, including restoration, it sounds like a profit-\u00e0-prendre.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the woman didn't object to the company's failure to replace the topsoil, even though they were paying the royalties, suggests that the core agreement was about the extraction and payment, and the restoration was a separate obligation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. profit-\u00e0-prendre.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
