The belief that the United States is different from other major powers because it is concerned not only with power, but also with principles.\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is a term that reflects the unique nature of the United States in the global arena. It suggests that the U.S. is distinct from other nations due to its commitment to both power and principles. This concept acknowledges that while the U.S. is a major power and pursues its national interests, it also upholds certain democratic values and principles that guide its actions on the international stage. This combination of power and principles is seen as setting the U.S. apart from other major powers.\n\nOption B is partially correct in that the U.S. is indeed the most powerful nation in the world, but American exceptionalism is not solely about power; it's about the blend of power and principles. Option C is incorrect because the U.S. is not pacifist; it has been involved in numerous military conflicts. Option D is also incorrect because, while economic factors do play a role in U.S. foreign policy, American exceptionalism is more about the balance between power and principles, not just economic motivations."
