                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which option best represents the use of a hidden market for hiring new personnel. The question is about a human resources manager who hires through a hidden market, and I need to choose the best example from the given options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a hidden market is in the context of hiring. A hidden market, also known as the hidden job market, refers to job opportunities that are not publicly advertised. These positions are often filled through networking, referrals, or other informal channels. So, it's about finding candidates or jobs that aren't openly listed in traditional job boards or advertisements.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Posting the job opening to a social media website.\n\nThis seems like a public way of advertising a job. Social media platforms are widely used and accessible to many people, so posting a job there would likely reach a broad audience. This doesn't sound like a hidden market because it's an open invitation for anyone to apply.\n\nB. Advertising the job opening on job posting websites.\n\nSimilar to option A, this is a standard way of making a job opening known to potential candidates. Job posting websites are designed for employers to list positions and for job seekers to find them. Again, this is a public method, not a hidden one.\n\nC. Receiving a recommendation from a current employee.\n\nThis sounds more like networking or word-of-mouth referral. When a current employee recommends a candidate, it often happens outside of formal advertising channels. The candidate might not have known about the job opening if not for the referral. This seems aligned with the concept of a hidden market because the job wasn't publicly advertised; instead, it was filled through an internal connection.\n\nD. Participating in a career fair at a local community college.\n\nCareer fairs are events where employers meet with potential candidates, often students or graduates. While it's a way to find new talent, it's still a public and formal method of recruitment. Many people attend career fairs specifically to look for job opportunities, so it's not a hidden market.\n\nComparing all these options, option C seems to best represent the use of a hidden market. It involves filling a position through a recommendation, which is an informal and non-public method.\n\nI think the answer is C. Receiving a recommendation from a current employee.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
