                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question here: \"Which of the following conditions is characterized by the presence of kidney stones (renal calculi)?\"\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Glomerulonephritis\n\nB. Interstitial nephritis\n\nC. Nephrolithiasis\n\nD. Polycystic kidney\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out which one of these conditions involves kidney stones. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, glomerulonephritis. I know that \"glomerulo\" refers to the glomerulus, which is a part of the kidney where blood is filtered. \"Nephritis\" means inflammation of the kidney. So, glomerulonephritis is inflammation of the glomerulus. That doesn't sound like kidney stones.\n\nNext, interstitial nephritis. \"Interstitial\" refers to the spaces between structures. So, interstitial nephritis is inflammation of the spaces between the kidney tubules. Again, that doesn't seem directly related to kidney stones.\n\nNow, nephrolithiasis. \"Nephro\" means kidney, and \"lithiasis\" refers to the formation of stones. So, nephrolithiasis literally means the formation of stones in the kidney. That sounds exactly like kidney stones.\n\nLastly, polycystic kidney. This is a condition where there are multiple cysts in the kidneys. Cysts are fluid-filled sacs, which are different from stones. So, this doesn't match the description of kidney stones.\n\nBased on this, it seems like nephrolithiasis is the condition characterized by the presence of kidney stones.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe one of the other options can also cause kidney stones indirectly.\n\nGlomerulonephritis might lead to kidney damage, but it's primarily about inflammation of the glomerulus, not stone formation.\n\nInterstitial nephritis can cause kidney inflammation, but again, not directly related to stones.\n\nPolycystic kidney disease can lead to kidney dysfunction, but the cysts are not the same as stones.\n\nSo, yeah, nephrolithiasis seems to be the correct answer here.\n\nI think I've got it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
