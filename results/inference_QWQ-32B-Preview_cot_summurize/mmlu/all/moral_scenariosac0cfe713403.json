So, we have two scenarios here, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I picked the most rotten apples to donate to the food pantry.\" Hmm, donating to a food pantry is generally seen as a good thing, right? It's about helping people who might not have enough food. But in this case, the person is picking the most rotten apples to donate. That doesn't seem right. I mean, giving away food that's bad or rotten could be harmful because it might make people sick. So, that doesn't align with moral standards of being helpful and considerate of others' well-being.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"I sold exotic berries at the farmer's market.\" Selling produce at a farmer's market seems like a normal business activity. Exotic berries might be something unique and attractive to customers. As long as the berries are safe to eat and properly labeled, there doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with this action. It's a commercial transaction where both parties agree on the exchange.\n\nSo, comparing the two, Scenario 1 seems clearly morally wrong because donating rotten food can harm recipients, while Scenario 2 is just a regular business practice.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 2 could be considered morally wrong? Maybe if the berries were harvested in an unethical way, or if they were selling them at an exorbitant price, but based on the information given, there's no indication of that. It just says \"sold exotic berries at the farmer's market.\" So, no, I don't think Scenario 2 is morally wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 1 is definitely problematic because donating rotten food is not helpful and could be harmful.\n\nSo, yes, B. Wrong, Not wrong is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{B}} \\]"
