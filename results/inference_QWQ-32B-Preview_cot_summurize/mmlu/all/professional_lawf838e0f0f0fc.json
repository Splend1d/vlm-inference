The boyfriend asked his girlfriend to drive the getaway car, to which she agreed, on the condition that no loaded weapons were used during the robbery. On the day of the robbery, the boyfriend and his girlfriend drove to the grocery store. Unknown to the girlfriend, the boyfriend entered the store with a loaded gun. The boyfriend approached one of the cashiers and told him to fill a bag with all the money from the register. When the cashier refused, the boyfriend shot and killed him. He then turned to the next cashier and pointed his gun at her. The cashier suffered a heart attack and died. The boyfriend then took the money from the registers himself and exited the store. One of the customers had called the police, and they were waiting outside. A shootout ensued, and the boyfriend was killed by the police. If this jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder, the girlfriend is guilty if how many counts of murder?\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. None.\n"

                    "text": "This is a complex legal scenario involving felony murder and agency theory. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, understand that felony murder is a legal doctrine that holds participants in certain felonies criminally liable for homicides that occur during the commission of those felonies, even if they did not directly cause the death.\n\nAgency theory of felony murder states that all participants in the felony are liable for homicides committed by co-felons if the homicides are committed in furtherance of the felony or are foreseeable.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- The boyfriend planned and carried out the robbery.\n\n- The girlfriend agreed to drive the getaway car but conditioned her agreement on no loaded weapons being used.\n\n- The boyfriend entered the store with a loaded gun, unknown to the girlfriend.\n\n- He shot and killed one cashier and another cashier died from a heart attack upon being pointed at with the gun.\n\n- The boyfriend was killed by police in a shootout after exiting the store.\n\nNow, let's consider the girlfriend's liability under agency theory.\n\n1. **Knowledge and Intent:**\n\n   - The girlfriend agreed to drive the getaway car but specified that no loaded weapons were to be used.\n\n   - This suggests she did not intend for the robbery to involve deadly weapons.\n\n   - However, under agency theory, her liability may still extend to homicides committed by her co-felon, the boyfriend, if those homicides were committed in furtherance of the felony or were foreseeable.\n\n2. **Homicides Committed:**\n\n   - Cashier 1: Shot and killed by the boyfriend.\n\n   - Cashier 2: Died from a heart attack after being pointed at with the gun.\n\n   - Police officers: None mentioned as killed; the boyfriend was killed by police.\n\n3. **Applying Agency Theory:**\n\n   - Under agency theory, the girlfriend could be liable for the homicides committed by the boyfriend if they occurred during the commission of the felony (robbery) and were either in furtherance of the felony or foreseeable.\n\n   - The shootings were directly related to the robbery, as the boyfriend was attempting to force the cashiers to comply.\n\n   - The heart attack death may also be considered foreseeable, as pointing a gun at someone can reasonably be expected to cause extreme distress leading to health complications.\n\n4. **Condition on Unloaded Weapons:**\n\n   - The girlfriend's condition that no loaded weapons be used suggests she did not anticipate the use of deadly force.\n\n   - However, agency theory may still hold her liable for the boyfriend's actions, despite her lack of knowledge about the weapon being loaded.\n\n5. **Number of Murder Counts:**\n\n   - Cashier 1: Shot and killed.\n\n   - Cashier 2: Died from heart attack.\n\n   - Therefore, two homicides occurred during the robbery.\n\n   - Under agency theory, the girlfriend could be held liable for both murders.\n\nHowever, there is a debate about whether the heart attack death qualifies as a homicide under felony murder rules. Some jurisdictions may consider it, while others might not.\n\nGiven that the question specifies this jurisdiction follows agency theory, and assuming that both deaths are considered homicides in furtherance of the felony, the girlfriend could be guilty of two counts of murder.\n\nBut, considering the condition she set and her lack of knowledge about the weapon being loaded, there might be arguments for mitigating her liability, but under strict agency theory, she could still be held accountable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B. 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
