I need to figure out which one isn't a type of fabric.\n\nFirst, I know that velveteen is a type of fabric. It's a cotton or cotton-blend fabric with a velvety nap. It's often used for clothing and home decor. So, A is a fabric.\n\nNext, seersucker is also a fabric. It's a lightweight, ribbed cotton fabric that's often striped or checkered. It's commonly used for casual clothes like shirts and pants, especially in warm weather. So, C is also a fabric.\n\nTencel is another fabric. It's a type of rayon made from wood pulp, and it's known for being environmentally friendly. It's used in a variety of clothing and textiles. So, D is a fabric too.\n\nNow, Celotex. I'm not sure what that is. I think it's something related to insulation or building materials. Let me think about it. I recall that Celotex is a brand name for a type of insulation material, specifically a type of fiberboard made from cellulose, resin, and other materials. It's used in construction for insulation and soundproofing, not for making clothes or textiles.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, Velveteen, Seersucker, and Tencel are all fabrics used in clothing and textiles, while Celotex is an insulation material used in construction.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. Celotex, as it is not a fabric.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
