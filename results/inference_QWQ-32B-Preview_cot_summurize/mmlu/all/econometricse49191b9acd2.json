                    "text": "Let's see. I need to determine which statements about the ACF (autocorrelation function) and PACF (partial autocorrelation function) are true. There are four statements, and I have to choose the correct option among A, B, C, and D.\n\nFirst, statement (i): \"The ACF and PACF are often hard to interpret in practice.\" Hmm, I remember that ACF and PACF plots are used to identify the order of ARIMA models. Sometimes, these plots can be straightforward, but other times, they might be less clear, especially with small sample sizes or when there are multiple patterns in the data. So, I think this statement could be true.\n\nNext, statement (ii): \"The ACF and PACF can be difficult to calculate for some data sets.\" I recall that calculating ACF and PACF involves some mathematical computations, but with modern software, it's usually straightforward. However, for very large datasets or for data with particular characteristics, like non-stationarity, calculations might become more complicated. So, this might also be true.\n\nStatement (iii): \"Information criteria represent an alternative approach to model order determination.\" Yes, information criteria like AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) are indeed used to determine the order of a model, especially in time series analysis. They provide a way to balance model fit and complexity, which is different from looking at ACF and PACF plots. So, this seems true as well.\n\nFinally, statement (iv): \"If applied correctly, the ACF and PACF will always deliver unique model selections.\" I think this might be false. ACF and PACF plots can sometimes suggest multiple possible models, and the choice might not be unique. It depends on how clearly the patterns appear in the plots. Additionally, different practitioners might interpret the same plots differently. So, I don't think ACF and PACF always deliver unique model selections.\n\nBased on this, it seems that statements (i), (ii), and (iii) are true, while (iv) is false. Looking at the options, that corresponds to option C: (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where ACF and PACF are easy to interpret? Yes, for example, in purely random data, both ACF and PACF should be close to zero, which is straightforward. However, statement (i) says \"often hard to interpret,\" not always. So, it's still possible for them to be hard to interpret in many cases.\n\nAlso, regarding statement (ii), while software makes calculations easy, there might be computational challenges with very large datasets or specific types of data. So, it's plausible that calculations can be difficult sometimes.\n\nStatement (iii) seems solid, as information criteria are indeed an alternative method for model order determination.\n\nAnd statement (iv) seems false because ACF and PACF interpretations can be subjective and might not always point to a single unique model.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
