The key relationship here is that the body uses oxygen to produce energy, and there's a standard value that relates oxygen consumption to energy expenditure.\n\nFirst, we need to understand that the energy expenditure can be estimated using the oxygen uptake rate and a factor that relates oxygen consumption to energy production. The general rule is that, for aerobic activities, approximately 20 kJ of energy are expended per liter of oxygen consumed.\n\nGiven:\n- Oxygen uptake rate: 3.0 liters per minute\n- Duration of exercise: 5 minutes\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total oxygen consumed during the exercise.\nTotal oxygen consumed = oxygen uptake rate \u00d7 duration\nTotal oxygen consumed = 3.0 L/min \u00d7 5 min = 15 liters\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total energy expenditure.\nEnergy expenditure = total oxygen consumed \u00d7 energy per liter of oxygen\nEnergy expenditure = 15 L \u00d7 20 kJ/L = 300 kJ\n\nTherefore, the approximate energy expenditure is 300 kJ.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 300 kJ.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- The value of 20 kJ per liter of oxygen is an average and can vary slightly depending on the type of activity and the individual's metabolic efficiency.\n- This calculation assumes that the exercise is purely aerobic, which may not always be the case, especially during high-intensity exercises where anaerobic metabolism also contributes to energy production.\n- It's also important to note that this is an approximation and actual energy expenditure can be influenced by various factors such as the athlete's efficiency, environmental conditions, and the specific movements involved in the exercise.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
