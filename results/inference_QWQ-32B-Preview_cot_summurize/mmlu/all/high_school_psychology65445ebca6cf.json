                    "text": "So I've got this question here about Aaron Beck and his negative triad of beliefs. It says that this concept explains the cycle of depression by looking at negative thoughts about oneself and the world, and it's an example of a certain type of therapy. The options are Psychoanalytic, Cognitive, Humanistic, and Behavioral. I need to figure out which one it is.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who Aaron Beck is. I remember that he's a psychologist known for developing Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. So, that might give me a clue.\n\nThe negative triad, as I recall, refers to three main areas where depressed individuals have negative beliefs: about themselves, about their environment, and about the future. So, it's all about these pessimistic thoughts that perpetuate depression.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA. Psychoanalytic: This is Freud's approach, focusing on unconscious processes and early childhood experiences. Doesn't seem directly related to thoughts about oneself and the world in the way Beck describes.\n\nB. Cognitive: This approach focuses on thoughts and cognition, how our perceptions and thoughts affect our emotions and behaviors. That sounds pretty relevant here, since the negative triad is all about negative thoughts.\n\nC. Humanistic: This is the approach that emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and a positive view of human nature. It doesn't really align with the negative thoughts aspect.\n\nD. Behavioral: This focuses on behaviors and how they're shaped by environmental factors, reinforcement, and punishment. While CBT has behavioral components, the negative triad seems more cognitive.\n\nGiven that, it seems like Cognitive is the best fit. Beck's work is foundational in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, which combines cognitive techniques with behavioral ones, but the negative triad specifically seems to be about cognition\u2014about thoughts and beliefs.\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I should look up the negative triad to make sure I have it right.\n\nOkay, according to my notes, the negative triad consists of:\n\n1. Negative views of the self: feeling inadequate, worthless.\n\n2. Negative views of the world: seeing the world as a hostile, unfriendly place.\n\n3. Negative views of the future: expecting things to get worse, no hope for improvement.\n\nAll of these are cognitive elements\u2014ways of thinking about oneself and the world.\n\nIn Cognitive Therapy, the idea is that these negative thoughts aren't just symptoms of depression; they're causes. So, by changing these thought patterns, you can alleviate depression.\n\nComparatively, Psychoanalytic therapy would look deeper into unconscious conflicts and past experiences that might be causing these negative thoughts.\n\nHumanistic therapy would focus more on empowering the individual to achieve their potential and have a more positive self-view.\n\nBehavioral therapy would look at how behaviors are reinforced or punished, and how to change behaviors through conditioning.\n\nSo, again, Cognitive Therapy seems the most aligned with the concept of the negative triad.\n\nJust to be thorough, I should consider if CBT, which combines cognitive and behavioral approaches, might be the answer. But since the question is about the type of therapy and CBT is a combination, and the negative triad seems specifically cognitive, I think Cognitive is the best answer.\n\nAlso, the question mentions \"examining negative thoughts,\" which is a key component of Cognitive Therapy.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. Cognitive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
