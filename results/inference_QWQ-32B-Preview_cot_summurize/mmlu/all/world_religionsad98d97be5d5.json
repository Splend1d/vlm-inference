                    "text": "I'm going to take a shot at this question about the distinctive beliefs or practices of the southerners, who are known as Digambara in Jainism. So, Digambara is one of the two main sects in Jainism, the other being Svetambara. I remember that \"Digambara\" means \"sky-clad\" in Sanskrit, which refers to their practice of not wearing clothes, believing that renunciation should be complete, including giving up clothing, to achieve spiritual purity.\n\nOption A says they worshipped exclusively outside of the temple. I don't recall anything specific about that. Digambaras do have temples and worship practices, so I think this might not be accurate.\n\nOption B mentions that they believed nakedness was an elemental expression of non-attachment. That sounds familiar. Since \"Digambara\" means sky-clad, and they practice nakedness as a sign of renouncing worldly attachments, including clothing, this seems like a plausible answer.\n\nOption C says they included women within the ranks of the leadership. I think in Digambara tradition, women are not allowed to be monks and must be reborn as men to achieve liberation. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption D states that they believed the omniscient Jina must eat and sleep. I don't think that's correct. Jinas are enlightened beings who have overcome worldly desires and attachments, so I don't recall them needing to eat or sleep.\n\nBased on what I know, I think option B is the correct answer. Digambaras believe that nakedness is an expression of non-attachment, which is a key principle in their path to spiritual liberation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
