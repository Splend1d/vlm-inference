The 55% popular vote for the president was the third largest in the nineteenth century, surpassed only by Jackson's first victory in 1828 and Grant's reelection in 1872. McClellan won only New Jersey, Delaware, and Kentucky. Republicans drew support from native-born farmers, skilled and professional workers, those of New England descent, younger voters, and military personnel. Democrats were strongest in the cities and among Irish- and German-Americans (the most populous immigrant groups). It has been estimated that Lincoln received 78% of the vote of Union soldiers and sailors. The figure was not necessary for his reelection, but was perhaps the margin of victory in a few close states and, more importantly, of great symbolic value. Republicans also gained seats in Congress to retain unassailable control, 149 to 42 in the House and 42 to 10 in the Senate; took back several state legislatures; and lost only the governorship of New Jersey (McClellan's home state).\"\nElection of 1864, Harpweek.com\nWhich of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about the 1864 election and the opposition to Lincoln from Radical Republicans. So, the question is: Which of the following provides the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1864? And we have four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to recall who the Radical Republicans were. They were a faction within the Republican Party who were more aggressive in their views on slavery and Reconstruction after the Civil War. They wanted immediate and complete abolition of slavery and more punitive measures against the Southern states that seceded.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation was done without congressional oversight.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The Emancipation Proclamation was indeed issued by Lincoln as a presidential proclamation, which is within his executive power as commander-in-chief during the war. It didn't require congressional approval. But, I think the Radical Republicans generally supported the Emancipation Proclamation because it moved towards emancipation, which was their goal. So, maybe this isn't the best reason for their opposition.\n\nB. The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate.\n\nWell, Lincoln did issue the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which was a step towards emancipation, but it only freed slaves in the Confederate states that were not under Union control. The Radical Republicans might have wanted a more comprehensive emancipation that applied to all slaves, including those in border states that stayed with the Union. So, this could be a reason for their opposition.\n\nC. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan provided no assurance of black suffrage.\n\nLincoln's Ten Percent Plan was part of his Reconstruction policy. It stated that a Southern state could form a new government and be readmitted into the Union once 10% of its voters from the 1860 election swore an oath of allegiance to the Union. The plan didn't address black suffrage directly. Radical Republicans wanted more\u4fdd\u969c for the rights of freed slaves, including the right to vote. So, this seems like a valid point of contention.\n\nD. Lincoln's appointment of Andrew Johnson as vice president clashed with the Reconstruction goals of the Senate.\n\nAndrew Johnson was a Southern Democrat who had remained loyal to the Union. Lincoln chose him as his running mate in 1864 to try to build a coalition of Unionists, including War Democrats. The Radical Republicans might have preferred a candidate who was more aligned with their views on Reconstruction. When Lincoln was assassinated and Johnson became president, he clashed with the Radical Republicans over Reconstruction policies. So, perhaps their opposition in 1864 was foreshadowing this later conflict.\n\nNow, considering all these options, I need to pick the one that best explains why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1864.\n\nOption A seems less likely because they generally supported the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nOption B is plausible because they wanted immediate and complete emancipation, which Lincoln's steps might have seemed insufficient.\n\nOption C is also strong because the Ten Percent Plan didn't address black suffrage, which was important to Radical Republicans.\n\nOption D is interesting because it involves Lincoln's choice of vice president, but it might be more about the potential future leadership rather than immediate policy differences.\n\nPerhaps a combination of B and C is the best answer, but since I have to choose one, I'll go with C. The Ten Percent Plan not assuring black suffrage seems like a significant point of disagreement between Lincoln and the Radical Republicans.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
