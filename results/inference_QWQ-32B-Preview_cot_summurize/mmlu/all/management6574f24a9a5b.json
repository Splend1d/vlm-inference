                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out who is considered a leading writer on the contingency theory of leadership among these options: Rosabeth Kanter, Joan Woodward, Rensis Likert, and Fred Fiedler. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to recall what I know about each of them and their contributions to leadership theory.\n\nFirst, let's consider Rosabeth Moss Kanter. She's a well-known organizational scholar and author. I think she's more associated with organizational change, culture, and innovation. She wrote books like \"Men and Women of the Corporation\" and \"The Change Masters.\" While her work is important for leadership, I don't recall her being directly linked to contingency theory.\n\nNext, Joan Woodward. She was a British scholar who did pioneering work in organizational structure and environment. Her research suggested that organizational structure is related to performance, depending on the technology used. This seems relevant to contingency theory, which suggests that leadership effectiveness depends on matching the leadership style to the situation. So, Woodward might have contributed to the idea that organizational structures should fit the environment, which aligns somewhat with contingency approaches.\n\nRensis Likert was an American social psychologist who developed the Likert scaling method and is known for his work on organizational climate and leadership systems. He categorized leadership systems into four main types: Exploitative Authoritative, Benevolent Authoritative, Consultative, and Participative. His focus was more on different styles of leadership and their impact on organizational climate, rather than on matching leadership to specific situations. So, while his work is valuable, it doesn't seem directly tied to contingency theory.\n\nFinally, Fred Fiedler is widely recognized for his contingency theory of leadership. He developed the contingency model, which suggests that the effectiveness of a leadership style depends on how well it matches the situation. Fiedler introduced the concept of least preferred coworker (LPC) to measure leadership style, where leaders with high LPC scores are relationship-oriented, and those with low LPC scores are task-oriented. According to his theory, different situations require different leadership styles for optimal effectiveness.\n\nGiven this, it seems clear that Fred Fiedler is the leading writer on contingency theory of leadership among the options provided. Joan Woodward's work is related to matching organizational structures to environments, which has some overlap with contingency thinking, but Fiedler specifically focused on leadership and situational factors.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- Rosabeth Kanter: Organizational change and culture.\n\n- Joan Woodward: Organizational structure and environment.\n\n- Rensis Likert: Leadership styles and organizational climate.\n\n- Fred Fiedler: Contingency theory of leadership.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Fred Fiedler.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
