                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about intestinal failure. So, the options are:\n\nA. Always requires parenteral nutritional support\n\nB. May follow colectomy\n\nC. Is always permanent\n\nD. May benefit from sodium supplementation of >=90mmol/l\n\nFirst, I need to understand what intestinal failure is. Intestinal failure occurs when a person's intestine can no longer absorb nutrients and fluids adequately to maintain health. This can happen due to various reasons like extensive bowel resection, chronic intestinal diseases, or congenital abnormalities.\n\nOption A says \"Always requires parenteral nutritional support.\" Parenteral nutrition is when nutrients are delivered directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. While many patients with intestinal failure do require parenteral nutrition, especially in the acute phase or when the intestine is not functioning at all, some patients might be managed with enteral nutrition or oral supplementation if their intestine has some residual function. So, it's not always required, but often necessary.\n\nOption B says \"May follow colectomy.\" Colectomy is the surgical removal of all or part of the colon. Intestinal failure can occur after extensive bowel resection, including colectomy, especially if a large portion of the small intestine is also removed. The small intestine is crucial for nutrient absorption, so its loss can lead to intestinal failure. So, this seems plausible.\n\nOption C states \"Is always permanent.\" Intestinal failure can be either acute or chronic. In some cases, especially acute intestinal failure, the intestine might recover over time, and patients can transition back to oral nutrition. However, in cases where there's extensive bowel loss or irreversible damage, it can be permanent. So, it's not always permanent.\n\nOption D says \"May benefit from sodium supplementation of >=90mmol/l.\" Sodium supplementation is important in patients with intestinal failure, particularly those on parenteral nutrition, to maintain electrolyte balance. However, the specific level of 90 mmol/l seems high, and the appropriate supplementation would depend on the patient's needs and the composition of their parenteral nutrition formula. So, this might not be accurate.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems to be the most accurate statement among the given options. Intestinal failure can indeed occur after colectomy, especially if a significant portion of the small intestine is also removed.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
