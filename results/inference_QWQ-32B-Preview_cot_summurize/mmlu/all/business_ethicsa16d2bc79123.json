It's about a theory that suggests there are three levels of moral reasoning people can use to evaluate ethical issues, and it depends on their cognitive abilities. The options are Egoism, Cognitive moral development, Power distance, and Uncertainty avoidance.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what each of these theories is about.\n\nEgoism sounds like a theory where people act in their own self-interest. That doesn't seem directly related to levels of moral reasoning.\n\nPower distance is a concept from cultural psychology, I think, that deals with how power is distributed in a society and how acceptable inequality is. Not sure if that fits here.\n\nUncertainty avoidance is another cultural dimension that measures how comfortable a society is with uncertainty and ambiguity. Again, not directly about moral reasoning levels.\n\nCognitive moral development sounds promising. I think this is related to Lawrence Kohlberg's theory, which proposes that moral reasoning develops through a series of stages or levels as people mature cognitively.\n\nKohlberg's theory has three main levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. Each level has two stages, so overall, there are six stages across three levels. This matches the description in the question.\n\nSo, based on this, I believe the answer is B. Cognitive moral development.\n\nTo double-check, let me recall Kohlberg's levels briefly:\n\n1. Preconventional level: This is where children base moral decisions on external factors, like avoiding punishment or gaining rewards.\n\n2. Conventional level: Here, moral decisions are based on social norms and expectations. People conform to rules to be accepted by society.\n\n3. Postconventional level: At this stage, individuals base their moral decisions on abstract principles and personal ethics, even if they conflict with laws or social norms.\n\nThis progression reflects increasing cognitive complexity in moral reasoning, which aligns with the question's description.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is B. Cognitive moral development.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
