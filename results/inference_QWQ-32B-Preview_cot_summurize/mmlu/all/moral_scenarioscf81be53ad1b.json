                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. I went into debt to pay for my night gambling in Nevada.\n\n2. I took out the gun so that I could clean it.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's considered morally wrong in these situations.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: going into debt to pay for gambling in Nevada.\n\nGambling itself is legal in Nevada, as it's a place known for casinos. So, gambling isn't inherently morally wrong there. However, going into debt for it might be seen differently. Some people might think it's irresponsible to gamble so much that you end up in debt, especially if it affects your financial stability or impacts others who depend on you. But is it morally wrong? Or just poor financial management?\n\nI guess it depends on the context. If someone gambles away money they can afford, maybe it's not morally wrong. But if they borrow money they can't pay back, or neglect their responsibilities to gamble, that could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nIn this scenario, it just says \"I went into debt to pay for my night gambling in Nevada.\" It doesn't specify whether this debt is harming others or if it's manageable. So, perhaps it's more about personal responsibility than a clear moral wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: taking out the gun to clean it.\n\nOwning guns is legal in many parts of the US, and maintaining them is a responsible thing to do. Cleaning a gun is a normal part of gun ownership to ensure it works properly and safely.\n\nSo, taking out the gun to clean it seems like a routine activity that's expected of responsible gun owners. There doesn't seem to be anything morally wrong with that action.\n\nComparing the two scenarios, Scenario 1 might be seen as more questionable morally, but even then, it's not entirely clear-cut. Scenario 2 seems straightforward and not morally wrong.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nGiven my analysis, Scenario 1 is perhaps not clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is definitely not wrong. So, option D seems the most appropriate.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider other perspectives. Some people might strongly disapprove of gambling and consider it morally wrong, regardless of the legalities or the context. Similarly, others might have issues with gun ownership itself, seeing it as morally problematic.\n\nHowever, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, gambling is acceptable in places where it's legal, and gun ownership is a constitutional right, with responsibilities attached.\n\nTherefore, unless there are additional context or consequences mentioned, which there aren't, I think Scenario 1 is not clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is definitely not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
