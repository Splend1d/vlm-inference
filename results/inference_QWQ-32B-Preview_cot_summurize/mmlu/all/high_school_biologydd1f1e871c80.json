                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out what this question is asking. It's about fish in a pond, some have long fins and some have short fins. Then there's a big thunderstorm in the summer, and a lot more long-finned fish die than short-finned ones. So now, there are fewer long-finned fish compared to short-finned fish. The question is asking what this is an example of, and it gives four options: gene flow, natural selection, genetic drift, or stabilizing selection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nGene flow is when genes move from one population to another, usually through migration of individuals.\n\nNatural selection is when certain traits become more or less common in a population because they affect an individual's ability to survive and reproduce.\n\nGenetic drift is when allele frequencies change randomly in a population, often due to chance events, especially in small populations.\n\nStabilizing selection is a type of natural selection where the average trait is favored, and extreme variations are selected against.\n\nOkay, so in this scenario, a thunderstorm causes more long-finned fish to die. This seems like an event that affects the population's genetic makeup by changing the proportion of long-finned to short-finned fish.\n\nIs this gene flow? Well, gene flow involves genes moving between populations, but here, it's just one population being affected by an environmental event, so probably not gene flow.\n\nIs it natural selection? Natural selection would suggest that the short-finned fish have an advantage in surviving thunderstorms, or maybe in general, and that's why more of them survive. But the question says it's a \"horrific\" thunderstorm that leads to the death of a disproportionate number of long-finned fish. It doesn't specify that the short-finned fish have any particular advantage; it just happened that more long-finned fish died.\n\nWait, but maybe the short fins are better in stormy conditions, or something like that. But the question doesn't provide that information, so I shouldn't assume.\n\nGenetic drift seems plausible. Genetic drift can occur when random events cause changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations. Here, a random event (the thunderstorm) caused a disproportionate number of long-finned fish to die, which would change the frequency of the long-finned allele in the population.\n\nStabilizing selection is about favoring the average trait, but I don't see how that applies here. The question is about a shift in the relative frequencies of two traits, not about favoring the average.\n\nSo, between natural selection and genetic drift, which one fits better?\n\nNatural selection is typically thought of as a process where certain traits confer a survival or reproductive advantage, leading to those traits becoming more common over time. In this case, it's not clear that the short-finned trait confers an advantage; it's just that more long-finned fish died in a storm.\n\nGenetic drift, on the other hand, can cause changes in allele frequencies due to random events, without any particular advantage to one trait over another.\n\nGiven that, I think genetic drift is the better answer here. The thunderstorm is a random event that affected the population, leading to a change in the frequency of the long-finned trait without necessarily any inherent advantage or disadvantage to that trait.\n\nBut wait, maybe it's natural selection. If the storm selectively killed more long-finned fish, perhaps there is something about long fins that made them more susceptible to dying in the storm. In that case, it could be considered natural selection, where the short-finned trait is advantageous in stormy conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's just random chance that more long-finned fish died, regardless of their fin length having anything to do with their survival in the storm.\n\nThe question says \"a disproportionate number of long-finned fish die,\" which suggests that more long-finned fish died than would be expected based on their proportion in the population. This could be due to a selective advantage of short fins in the storm, or it could just be random chance.\n\nGiven that, it's a bit tricky to decide between natural selection and genetic drift.\n\nMaybe I should consider the definitions again.\n\nNatural selection: differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype, which is influenced by genetic differences.\n\nGenetic drift: random changes in allele frequencies, often due to chance events, especially in small populations.\n\nIn this case, if the long-finned fish died because their fins were more likely to be harmed in the storm, that would be natural selection, as their phenotype affected their survival.\n\nHowever, if the deaths were random, and the long-finned fish just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, regardless of their fin length, then it's genetic drift.\n\nThe question doesn't provide enough information to determine whether the deaths were due to the fin length or just random chance.\n\nBut it does say \"a disproportionate number of long-finned fish die,\" which might imply that there was something about the long fins that made them more vulnerable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the storm affected certain areas of the pond where long-finned fish happened to be more concentrated.\n\nWithout more information, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nPerhaps the best approach is to consider that natural selection involves consistent, heritable traits that affect survival and reproduction, whereas genetic drift is about random changes in allele frequencies.\n\nIn this case, since the question highlights that the relative frequency of the two forms has shifted due to the storm, and it's a random event that disproportionately affected one trait, genetic drift seems like the most appropriate answer.\n\nMoreover, genetic drift can have a more significant impact in smaller populations, where random events can cause larger fluctuations in allele frequencies.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the population size, so I can't use that as a deciding factor.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that natural selection typically acts over multiple generations, whereas genetic drift can cause rapid changes in allele frequencies, even in a single generation.\n\nHere, the thunderstorm is a single event that caused a shift in the relative frequencies, which aligns more with genetic drift.\n\nAdditionally, the question mentions that it's a \"horrific\" thunderstorm, which might imply that it's an unusual event, further supporting the idea of genetic drift due to a random, infrequent event.\n\nIn contrast, if this were a recurring pattern where long-finned fish consistently had lower survival rates in storms, then it would be more indicative of natural selection.\n\nGiven all that, I think the answer is genetic drift.\n\nSo, the correct choice is C. Genetic drift.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
