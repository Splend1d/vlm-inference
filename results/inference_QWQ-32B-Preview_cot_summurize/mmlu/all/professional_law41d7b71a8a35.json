                    "text": "On April 10, the owner of a golf course entered into an oral agreement with a gardener whereby the gardener promised to install all new sprinkler heads on the sprinkler system at the 18-hole golf course. In return, the owner promised to pay the gardener $2,400 upon completion of the job. Since a golf tournament was scheduled for the weekend of April 20 \u0080\u009421, the gardener agreed to replace all the sprinkler heads no later than April 19. Before accepting the job, the gardener had inspected the golf course and determined that 240 sprinkler heads had to be replaced. By April 14, the gardener had installed 80 new sprinkler heads on the first six holes of the 18-hole golf course. That afternoon, however, the owner learned that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12, so he notified the gardener to discontinue the job. The next day, the owner hired a landscaper to complete the installation work at $8 per head. The landscaper installed the remaining 160 sprinkler heads and completed the work on April 19. Despite making reasonable efforts, the gardener was unable to find any gainful employment during the period. Also, the gardener's application for unemployment compensation was rejected at the same time. Which of the following statements, if found to be true, would provide the owner with legally justifiable grounds for discharging the gardener?\n\nA. The gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt onApril 12.\nB. The gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged.\nC. The contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing.\nD. Half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace the sprinkler heads.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out which statement would give the owner a legal reason to stop working with the gardener. So, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says that the gardener had been adjudicated bankrupt on April 12. Now, being bankrupt might mean that the gardener doesn't have the financial resources to complete the job, but I'm not sure if that alone is a legal reason to discharge him. Maybe the owner is worried about the gardener's ability to perform, but I think there might be better reasons among the options.\n\nOption B says that the gardener had only completed 33 percent of the installation work when he was discharged. Completing only a third of the work might be seen as slow progress, but I don't think that's enough to legally discharge him, especially since there was a deadline set for April 19. The owner probably wanted the work done by then, but the gardener had already installed some heads by April 14, so maybe he could have finished on time. I'm not sure if partial completion is a legal ground for discharge.\n\nOption C mentions that the contract between the owner and the gardener was not in writing. I know that in some states, oral contracts for services over a certain value might not be enforceable, but I think the Statute of Frauds requires written contracts for services that can't be performed within one year. Here, the job was supposed to be done by April 19, so it's a matter of a few days, not a year. So, maybe this isn't a valid legal reason to discharge the gardener.\n\nOption D says that half of the sprinkler heads installed by the gardener were determined to be defective, and the gardener refused to replace them. This seems serious. If the work is substandard and the gardener isn't willing to fix it, that could be a breach of contract. The owner might have a right to terminate the contract if the work doesn't meet the agreed standards.\n\nLet me think about this again. In option A, the gardener's bankruptcy might imply that he's not reliable financially, but I don't know if that directly affects his ability to do the physical work of replacing sprinkler heads. Maybe the owner is concerned about the gardener disappearing or not being available to finish the job, but I'm not sure if that's a solid legal ground.\n\nIn option B, the progress is slow, but maybe the gardener can still finish by the deadline. Unless there's a specific clause in the agreement about the pace of work, I don't think slow progress alone justifies discharge.\n\nOption C seems unlikely because the contract was oral, but as I thought earlier, since the work was to be completed in a short time frame, maybe the Statute of Frauds doesn't apply here.\n\nOption D, though, suggests that the work is defective, which is a major issue. If the gardener installed defective sprinkler heads, that could affect the entire golf course's irrigation system, possibly causing problems for the upcoming tournament. If the gardener refuses to correct the defects, that's a clear breach of contract, and the owner would likely have the right to terminate the contract and find someone else to finish the job.\n\nSo, among these options, I think D provides the strongest legal justification for the owner to discharge the gardener.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{d} \\]"
