                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about corporate governance and shareholder voting rights. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have Rainbow Corporation with two types of shares: voting common stock and nonvoting preferred stock. There are 1,000 shares of each outstanding. The preferred stock has a liquidation preference equal to its par value of $100 per share plus a 3% noncumulative dividend. Now, the company wants to authorize a new class of preferred stock with redemption rights that would have priority over the existing preferred stock in liquidation.\n\nThe proposal is put to a shareholders' meeting, and the voting results are: 700 common shares and 400 preferred shares in favor. So, in total, 1,100 shares approved the proposal, while there are 2,000 shares outstanding in total (1,000 common + 1,000 preferred). That's 55% overall, which is a majority.\n\nBut the question is whether this proposal is validly approved or not. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The proposal is validly approved because overall a majority of the outstanding shares did approve.\n\nB. The proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nC. The vote of the preferred stockholders does not matter because it was nonvoting stock.\n\nD. The proposal is invalidly approved because a two-thirds vote of each class is required.\n\nOkay, so option A suggests that since more than 50% of the total shares approved, the proposal passes. But I'm not sure if that's correct because there might be class voting requirements.\n\nOption B says that the proposal is invalid because a majority of the preferred shareholders didn't approve. Now, 400 out of 1,000 preferred shares voted in favor, which is 40%. So, less than a majority of the preferred class approved.\n\nOption C claims that the preferred stockholders' vote doesn't matter because it's nonvoting stock. But wait, preferred stock is typically considered a voting class in certain situations, especially when there are changes that affect their rights.\n\nOption D mentions that a two-thirds vote of each class is required, but the question doesn't specify any such requirement. It only says that the preferred stock is nonvoting, but for certain major decisions, class votes might still be required.\n\nIn corporate law, when a company wants to issue a new class of stock that has preferences over existing stock, it often requires the approval of both classes affected. In this case, the new preferred stock would come ahead of the existing preferred in liquidation, which affects the existing preferred stockholders' rights.\n\nSo, probably, both classes need to approve this change: common and preferred shareholders.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\n- Common shareholders: 700 out of 1,000 voted in favor, which is 70%. That's a majority.\n\n- Preferred shareholders: 400 out of 1,000 voted in favor, which is 40%. That's less than a majority.\n\nIf both classes need to approve, then the preferred class didn't approve, so the proposal shouldn't pass.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the proposal is invalidly approved because a majority of the preferred shareholders did not approve.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only considers the overall majority without regarding the class votes.\n\nOption C is wrong because even though the preferred stock is nonvoting, they still have voting rights on certain major issues that affect their interests, like changes to their rights.\n\nOption D isn't supported by the information given, as there's no mention of a two-thirds vote requirement.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFirst, confirm if class votes are required. In corporate law, amendments that alter the rights of a class of stockholders usually require the approval of that class. Here, the new preferred stock has redemption rights that come ahead of the old preferred, which likely affects the liquidation rights of the existing preferred shareholders.\n\nTherefore, it's probable that the existing preferred shareholders need to approve this change separately.\n\nGiven that, even if the overall majority approves, if the preferred class doesn't approve, the proposal shouldn't pass.\n\nHence, option B is correct.\n\nOption C is incorrect because nonvoting preferred stock still has voting rights on certain fundamental issues.\n\nOption D is not applicable since there's no indication of a two-thirds vote requirement.\n\nSo, the final answer is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
