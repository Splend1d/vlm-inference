                    "text": "To determine which atom has the lowest electron affinity among the given options, we need to understand what electron affinity is and how it varies across the periodic table.\n\n**Electron Affinity:**\nElectron affinity is the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a neutral atom in its gaseous state to form a negative ion. It is essentially the tendency of an atom to gain an electron. Electron affinity can be positive (energy is released when an electron is added) or negative (energy is absorbed when an electron is added).\n\n**Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity:**\n1. **Across a Period (left to right):** Electron affinity generally increases across a period. This is because the number of protons increases, leading to a stronger attraction for the added electron.\n2. **Down a Group:** Electron affinity generally decreases down a group. This is due to the increased distance between the nucleus and the outer electrons, resulting in a weaker attraction for the added electron.\n\nNow, let's look at the given options:\n\nA. F (Fluorine)\nB. Si (Silicon)\nC. O (Oxygen)\nD. Ca (Calcium)\n\nFirst, let's locate these elements on the periodic table:\n\n- Fluorine (F) is in Period 2, Group 17 (Halogens).\n- Silicon (Si) is in Period 3, Group 14 (Carbon group).\n- Oxygen (O) is in Period 2, Group 16 (Chalcogens).\n- Calcium (Ca) is in Period 4, Group 2 (Alkaline earth metals).\n\n**Analyzing Electron Affinity:**\n\n1. **Fluorine (F):** Fluorine has a high electron affinity because it is highly electronegative and has a small atomic radius, leading to a strong attraction for the added electron.\n\n2. **Silicon (Si):** Silicon is a metalloid with moderate electron affinity. It is less electronegative than fluorine and oxygen but more than calcium.\n\n3. **Oxygen (O):** Oxygen has a higher electron affinity than silicon but lower than fluorine. It is more electronegative than silicon due to its smaller atomic size and higher nuclear charge.\n\n4. **Calcium (Ca):** Calcium is a metal with low electron affinity. Metals generally have low or negative electron affinities because adding an electron to their outer shell requires energy due to the repulsion from existing electrons and the weaker nuclear attraction.\n\n**Comparing the Options:**\n\n- Fluorine and oxygen are non-metals with high electron affinities.\n- Silicon is a metalloid with moderate electron affinity.\n- Calcium is a metal with low electron affinity.\n\nAmong these, calcium is expected to have the lowest electron affinity due to its position in the periodic table and its metallic nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the periodic trends and the properties of the elements, calcium (Ca) has the lowest electron affinity among the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
