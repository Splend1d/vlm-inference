                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out these two statements about homomorphisms. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** A homomorphism may have an empty kernel.\n\nFirst off, what's a homomorphism? It's a function between two algebraic structures that preserves the operations. For groups, it means that if you have groups G and H, and a function f: G \u2192 H, then for any two elements a and b in G, f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b), where * is the group operation.\n\nNow, the kernel of a homomorphism f: G \u2192 H is the set of all elements in G that map to the identity element in H. In other words, kernel(f) = { g \u2208 G | f(g) = e_H }, where e_H is the identity in H.\n\nSo, can this kernel be empty? Hmm. Well, consider that the identity element e_G in G must map to the identity e_H in H, because f(e_G * e_G) = f(e_G) * f(e_G), which implies f(e_G) = e_H. Therefore, e_G is always in the kernel. So, the kernel can't be empty. It has at least the identity element.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\n\nOkay, this one sounds a bit tricky. First, what's a nontrivial homomorphism? It's a homomorphism that isn't just mapping everything to the identity of the codomain group. So, it's injective or has a nontrivial image.\n\nNow, is it possible to have such a homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group?\n\nWell, let's think of an example. Take the group of integers modulo n, which is finite, and the group of integers, which is infinite. Can we have a nontrivial homomorphism from Z_n to Z?\n\nLet's see. Suppose f: Z_n \u2192 Z is a homomorphism. Since Z_n is generated by 1, f is completely determined by f(1). But f(1 + 1 + ... + 1 (n times)) = f(0) = 0 in Z, because 0 is the identity in Z_n. So, n * f(1) = 0 in Z, which implies f(1) = 0, since n is a positive integer. Therefore, f is the trivial homomorphism.\n\nHmm, so in this case, only the trivial homomorphism exists.\n\nWhat about another example? Consider the cyclic group of order 2, C2, and the group of integers Z. Can we have a nontrivial homomorphism from C2 to Z?\n\nAgain, C2 is generated by one element, say a, with a^2 = e. So, f(a)^2 = f(a^2) = f(e) = 0 in Z. Therefore, f(a)^2 = 0, which implies f(a) = 0. So, again, only the trivial homomorphism exists.\n\nWait, but maybe there are other infinite groups where a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group exists.\n\nLet's consider the finite group C3, the cyclic group of order 3, and the infinite group of complex numbers under multiplication, C*.\n\nDefine f: C3 \u2192 C* by sending the generator of C3 to a primitive third root of unity, say \u03c9, where \u03c9^3 = 1.\n\nThen, f is a homomorphism because f(a^k) = \u03c9^k, and \u03c9^3 = 1, which corresponds to a^3 = e in C3.\n\nThis seems like a nontrivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group.\n\nWait, but C* is the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication, which is infinite.\n\nSo, in this case, we have a nontrivial homomorphism from C3 to C*.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\nWait a minute, but in the first examples I thought of, only the trivial homomorphism existed. But in this case, a nontrivial one exists. So, it depends on the infinite group.\n\nIs there a general rule here? It seems that if the infinite group has elements of finite order, then you can have nontrivial homomorphisms from finite groups into it.\n\nFor example, in C*, there are elements of finite order, like the roots of unity.\n\nBut in Z, every non-identity element has infinite order, so only the trivial homomorphism exists from a finite group to Z.\n\nSo, in general, it is possible to have nontrivial homomorphisms from finite groups to infinite groups, but it depends on the infinite group.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is false.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nStatement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is false.\n\nSo, the answer is B. False, False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
