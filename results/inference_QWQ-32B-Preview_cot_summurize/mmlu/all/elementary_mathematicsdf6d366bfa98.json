I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the relationship between grams and centigrams. I know that \"centi-\" is a prefix in the metric system that means one-hundredth (1/100). So, 1 centigram (cg) is equal to 0.01 grams (g), or conversely, 1 gram is equal to 100 centigrams.\n\nSo, if I have 0.32 grams, and I want to convert that to centigrams, I need to multiply by 100 because there are 100 centigrams in a gram.\n\nLet me do the calculation: 0.32 grams times 100 equals... well, moving the decimal point two places to the right, that would be 32 centigrams.\n\nSo, 0.32 g = 32 cg.\n\nLooking back at the options, A) 32 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about this again. If 1 gram is 100 centigrams, then 0.32 grams should be 0.32 times 100 centigrams, which is indeed 32 centigrams.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the conversion in terms of units. Grams to centigrams, since centi- means 1/100, the conversion factor should be 100.\n\nSo, 0.32 g * 100 cg/g = 32 cg.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 32.\n\nI don't see any reason to choose any of the other options. B) 3.2 is too small, C) 3,200 is way too big, and D) 320 is ten times larger than 32.\n\nSo, I'm confident that A) 32 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
