                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a farmer who wants to test if a new fertilizer has increased the mean weight of his apples. With the old fertilizer, the mean weight was 4.0 ounces per apple. Now, he's testing the new fertilizer to see if it makes the apples heavier on average. He's set up his hypotheses like this:\n\n- Null hypothesis (H0): The mean weight \u03bc is equal to 4.0 ounces.\n\n- Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The mean weight \u03bc is greater than 4.0 ounces.\n\nHe's doing this test at a 5% level of significance. The weights of the apples are approximately normally distributed, which is good because that satisfies one of the assumptions for the test.\n\nHe took a random sample of 16 apples and found that the sample mean is 4.3 ounces with a sample standard deviation of 0.6 ounces. Now, he needs to find the p-value for this test.\n\nFirst, I need to decide whether to use a z-test or a t-test. Typically, if the population standard deviation is known, we use a z-test. If it's unknown, we use a t-test. In this problem, the population standard deviation isn't given, and only the sample standard deviation is provided (0.6 ounces). So, it seems like a t-test is appropriate here.\n\nAlso, since the alternative hypothesis is Ha: \u03bc > 4.0, this is a one-tailed test.\n\nGiven that the sample size is 16, which is relatively small, and we're using the sample standard deviation, degrees of freedom (df) would be n - 1 = 15.\n\nSo, the test statistic would be calculated using the formula for the t-score:\n\nt = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / (sample standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nt = (4.3 - 4.0) / (0.6 / sqrt(16)) = 0.3 / (0.6 / 4) = 0.3 / 0.15 = 2\n\nSo, the t-score is 2 with 15 degrees of freedom.\n\nNow, since this is a one-tailed test (right-tailed, because Ha: \u03bc > 4.0), the p-value would be the area under the t-distribution curve with 15 df to the right of t = 2.\n\nTherefore, the p-value is P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. P(Z > 2)\n\nB. P(Z < 2)\n\nC. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nD. P(t < 2) with 15 degrees of freedom\n\nThe correct choice is C. P(t > 2) with 15 degrees of freedom.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it uses the Z-distribution instead of the t-distribution, and the sample size is small with unknown population standard deviation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it's looking at the left tail, but our alternative hypothesis is for an increase, so we need the right tail.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it's the cumulative probability up to t = 2, but we need the probability beyond t = 2 for the p-value in this right-tailed test.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
