                    "text": "So I have this question here about chemically based sensory systems. It lists three systems: the gustatory system, the auditory system, and the olfactory system. And it asks which of these are chemically based. The options are:\n\nA. I only (which is just the gustatory system)\n\nB. II only (just the auditory system)\n\nC. III only (just the olfactory system)\n\nD. I and III only (both gustatory and olfactory systems)\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what a chemically based sensory system is. From what I know, chemical senses are those that involve the detection of chemicals in the environment. So, they respond to molecules that are floating around, either in the air or in fluids.\n\nLet's look at each one:\n\nI. Gustatory system - that's the sense of taste. When we eat something, our taste buds detect different flavors, which are essentially chemicals in the food. So, taste is definitely chemically based.\n\nII. Auditory system - that's hearing. Hearing is about detecting sound waves, which are vibrations in the air or other mediums. It doesn't directly involve chemicals; it's more about physical vibrations. So, I don't think this is chemically based.\n\nIII. Olfactory system - that's smell. Smell involves detecting odor molecules in the air. So, it's also chemically based because it's responding to specific chemical compounds.\n\nSo, both the gustatory and olfactory systems are chemically based, while the auditory system is not.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says I and III only, which matches what I just thought.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any chance that the auditory system could be considered chemically based in some way? Maybe in how the sound is transduced into electrical signals in the brain, but I don't think that involves direct chemical detection like taste and smell do.\n\nAlso, confirming what I know about the senses:\n\n- Taste (gustation): detects chemicals in substances we put in our mouth.\n\n- Smell (olfaction): detects chemicals in the air we breathe.\n\n- Hearing (audition): detects sound waves, which are physical vibrations.\n\n- Sight (vision): detects light, which is electromagnetic radiation.\n\n- Touch (somatosensation): detects physical stimuli like pressure, temperature, pain.\n\nSo, indeed, only taste and smell are chemically based senses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D. I and III only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
