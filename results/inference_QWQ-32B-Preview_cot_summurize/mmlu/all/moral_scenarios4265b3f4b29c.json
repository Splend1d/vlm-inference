                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The scenarios are:\n\n1. At the grocery store, I coughed into my shirt sleeve.\n\n2. I called the police on my friend for doing a good deed.\n\nAnd the options are:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to think about each scenario separately.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Coughing into my shirt sleeve at the grocery store.\n\nHmm, coughing is something that happens naturally, right? But how we handle it can be a matter of hygiene and consideration for others, especially in a public place like a grocery store where lots of people are around.\n\nI remember during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a big emphasis on coughing into one's elbow or sleeve to prevent spreading germs. So, coughing into your sleeve was actually recommended as a way to contain droplets and minimize the risk of transmitting illnesses to others.\n\nSo, in that context, coughing into your sleeve is actually a responsible thing to do. It shows consideration for others' health and follows public health guidelines.\n\nTherefore, in Scenario 1, the main character is doing something that is not morally wrong; in fact, it's probably morally praiseworthy because they're taking steps to prevent the spread of illness.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: Calling the police on my friend for doing a good deed.\n\nThis seems more complicated. First, I need to understand what is meant by \"doing a good deed.\" A good deed typically refers to an action that is beneficial or helpful to others, perhaps even selfless.\n\nSo, if my friend is doing something good, why would I call the police on them? That doesn't make much sense. Calling the police is usually reserved for situations involving crime or danger to public safety.\n\nIf my friend is genuinely doing a good deed, like helping someone who's injured or assisting an elderly person cross the street, there's no reason to involve the police, unless maybe the situation is unclear or there's some misunderstanding.\n\nBut according to the scenario, my friend is doing a good deed, which implies a positive action. So, calling the police on them in this context seems unnecessary and perhaps even malicious, depending on the intent behind the call.\n\nLet's consider the possible motives. Maybe the main character is trying to get their friend in trouble for some other reason, using the police as a tool for personal gain or revenge. That would be morally wrong because it's abusing the authority of the police and potentially causing harm to the friend who is trying to do good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main character is confused about what constitutes a good deed and thinks that the friend is actually up to no good, but that would require more context.\n\nHowever, based on the information given, the friend is doing a good deed, and the main character is calling the police on them. This seems like an inappropriate and potentially harmful action, which would be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, in Scenario 2, the main character is doing something that is clearly morally wrong.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to interpret Scenario 1.\n\nIs there any situation where coughing into your sleeve in a grocery store could be considered wrong?\n\nWell, if someone is coughing repeatedly and not covering their mouth at all, that could be considered irresponsible, but in this case, the main character is coughing into their sleeve, which is the recommended practice.\n\nSo, no, I don't think Scenario 1 involves anything morally wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2, calling the police on a friend for doing a good deed, seems clearly wrong, as it's an abuse of the police system and potentially harmful to the friend.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
