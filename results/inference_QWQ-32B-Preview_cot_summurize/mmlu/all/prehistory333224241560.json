                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It's about early evidence of complexity in Mayan societies, and it's tied to a specific time period: around 2650 years Before Present (B.P.). So, I need to think about which of these options best represents a sign of social complexity from that time.\n\nFirst, I should understand what social complexity means in an archaeological context. Generally, it refers to characteristics like social stratification, specialized labor, monumental architecture, and organized religion. These are indicators that a society has moved beyond simple bands or tribes and has developed more structured forms of organization.\n\nOption A is \"finely carved obsidian statuary.\" Obsidian is a volcanic glass that was highly valued in Mesoamerica for its sharp edges and luster. If the Mayans were carving intricate statues from obsidian, that could suggest several things: advanced craftsmanship, which implies specialized skills; valuable materials being used for non-utilitarian purposes, which might indicate surplus resources; and possibly, these statues had religious or ceremonial significance, pointing to a complex belief system.\n\nOption B is \"decorated stepped platforms.\" Stepped platforms are a common feature in Mesoamerican architecture and are often associated with temples or other important structures. If these platforms were decorated, that could suggest they held significant cultural or religious importance. The construction of such structures would require organized labor and planning, which are hallmarks of social complexity.\n\nOption C is \"the introduction of chocolate into the Mesoamerican economy.\" Chocolate comes from cacao beans, which were indeed important in Mesoamerican cultures, including the Maya. Cacao was used not only as a beverage but also as a form of currency. The incorporation of cacao into the economy could indicate trade networks, valued commodities, and possibly social stratification if certain groups had greater access to it.\n\nOption D is \"a ritual ball game in which the losers were sacrificed to the gods.\" The Mesoamerican ballgame is well-known and was played by many cultures in the region, including the Maya. It was often tied to religious rituals and could have political implications. The fact that losers were sometimes sacrificed suggests that the game had high stakes and was perhaps used to resolve conflicts or please the gods. This practice could reflect a society with complex religious beliefs and possibly rigid social hierarchies.\n\nNow, I need to consider which of these appeared around 2650 B.P. First, I should convert B.P. to a more familiar date. If B.P. means years before 1950 (the standard reference point), then 2650 B.P. would be approximately 650 BCE (Before Common Era). So, I need to think about which of these features can be traced back to around 650 BCE in Mayan societies.\n\nLooking back at my knowledge of Mayan history, the Preclassic period is generally considered to be from about 2000 BCE to 250 CE. The Early Preclassic spans from 2000 to 1000 BCE, the Middle Preclassic from 1000 to 400 BCE, and the Late Preclassic from 400 BCE to 250 CE. So, 650 BCE falls within the Middle Preclassic period.\n\nDuring the Middle Preclassic, Mayan societies were becoming more complex. There was an increase in population, the development of larger settlements, and the emergence of social stratification. Architectural achievements, such as the construction of ceremonial centers and platforms, began to appear.\n\nGiven that, option B, \"decorated stepped platforms,\" seems like a strong candidate. The construction of ceremonial platforms would require organized labor and social organization, indicating complexity. Moreover, these platforms often served religious or ceremonial purposes, which suggests a developed belief system.\n\nOption A, \"finely carved obsidian statuary,\" could also be indicative of complexity, as it suggests specialized craftsmanship and possibly ritual or ceremonial use. However, I'm not sure if obsidian carving was as prominent or widespread as platform construction during that period.\n\nOption C, the introduction of chocolate into the Mesoamerican economy, is interesting. Cacao was certainly important to the Maya, but I'm not sure if its incorporation into the economy dates back to 650 BCE. I think cacao was used much earlier, possibly even before 1000 BCE, but I'm not certain about the exact timing.\n\nOption D, the ritual ball game with sacrifices, is another practice that suggests social complexity. However, I'm not sure about the earliest dates for this practice in Mayan society. I believe the ballgame was present in Mesoamerica by the Preclassic period, but I need to confirm if it was established by 650 BCE.\n\nConsidering all this, I think option B, \"decorated stepped platforms,\" is the best answer. It directly relates to architectural developments that are indicative of social complexity and is likely to have been present during the Middle Preclassic period.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
