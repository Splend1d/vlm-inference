                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about the U.S. Constitution and what it says about judges. So, Article III, Section 1 says that judges shall hold their offices during good behavior. I need to figure out what a consequence of this clause is from the options given.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: Congress cannot remove federal judges from office.\n\nHmm, I know that judges can be removed from office, but only through impeachment. Is impeachment by Congress? I think so. So, maybe this isn't the right answer because Congress can impeach judges, but only for specific reasons.\n\nOption B says: federal judges have political independence to fulfill their duties.\n\nThis sounds plausible. If judges have their positions secured as long as they behave well, they might feel more independent and not worry about being removed for making unpopular decisions.\n\nOption C says: the president has no influence over the composition of the Supreme Court.\n\nWait, the president appoints Supreme Court justices, subject to Senate confirmation. So, the president does have influence over the composition of the Supreme Court. Therefore, this statement seems incorrect.\n\nOption D says: federal judges lack opportunity for advancement or promotion.\n\nI'm not sure about this. Once a judge is appointed, they can potentially be elevated to a higher court, like from a district court to a court of appeals, or from there to the Supreme Court. So, there might be opportunities for advancement.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most accurate. The clause about holding office during good behavior likely contributes to the political independence of federal judges, allowing them to make decisions without fear of reprisal unless they engage in impeachable offenses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
