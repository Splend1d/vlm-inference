                    "text": "Let's see. I'm trying to figure out why Pizarro was able to conquer the entire Inca empire. There are four options here:\n\nA. His horses and guns frightened the Incas into submission.\n\nB. He was such a brilliant military strategist.\n\nC. The empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered.\n\nD. He arrived with a superior force of more than 80,000 soldiers.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some history about Pizarro and the Inca empire. Francisco Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador who led the expedition that resulted in the conquest of the Inca Empire. This happened in the 16th century.\n\nOption A mentions horses and guns frightening the Incas. I know that horses and firearms were introduced by the Europeans and were unknown to the Incas. So, it's possible that these new weapons and animals intimidated the Incas initially. But was this the main reason for the conquest of the entire empire?\n\nOption B says that Pizarro was a brilliant military strategist. While leadership and strategy\u80af\u5b9a played a role, I'm not sure if this was the primary factor in subduing the entire empire.\n\nOption C suggests that the Inca empire hadn't won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. Is this true? I recall that the Inca empire was known for its efficient administration and integration of conquered peoples through a combination of force and cultural assimilation. But perhaps there were still resentments and dissatisfaction among some groups.\n\nOption D states that Pizarro arrived with a superior force of more than 80,000 soldiers. Wait a minute, I think this might not be accurate. From what I remember, Pizarro's force was actually relatively small, something like a few hundred men, not 80,000. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nLet me think again. If Pizarro had only a few hundred men, how could he possibly conquer an empire with such a small force? There must have been other factors at play.\n\nI recall that one key factor was the exploitation of internal divisions within the Inca empire. At the time Pizarro arrived, the Inca empire was in the midst of a civil war between two brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, over the succession of the throne. This weakened the empire and made it easier for the Spanish to exploit these divisions.\n\nAlso, the Incas had no immunity to diseases brought by the Europeans, such as smallpox, which decimated the population and further weakened the empire.\n\nAdditionally, the Incas may have been initially confused by the Spanish weapons and horses, but I don't think fear alone would have been sufficient to subdue the entire empire.\n\nSo, option A might have been a factor, but probably not the main reason.\n\nOption B could be partly true, as Pizarro's strategic decisions were important, but again, not the primary factor.\n\nOption C seems plausible because if there were dissatisfied groups within the empire, Pizarro could ally with them against the Incas.\n\nOption D is probably incorrect because Pizarro's force was small, perhaps around 168 men and about 62 horses, if I remember correctly.\n\nGiven this, I think the best answer is C: the empire had never won the allegiance of the peoples it had conquered. This would have allowed Pizarro to form alliances with these dissatisfied groups and use them to defeat the Incas.\n\nMoreover, the capture of the Inca emperor Atahualpa by Pizarro was a crucial turning point, which further supports the idea that internal divisions and dissatisfaction among the conquered peoples played a significant role in the conquest.\n\nSo, I'll go with option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
