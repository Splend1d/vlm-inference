Her job responsibilities included preparing new course outlines, proofreading and grading student homework assignments. The bar review course agreed to pay the graduate a starting salary of $2,500 a month. Three months later, the graduate was approached by the regional director of the bar review course, who handed her a newly published 60-page booklet entitled \"Employment Manual. \" He instructed the graduate to read the manual and indicated that it contained important information concerning company policy considerations and employee benefits. When the graduate returned home that evening, she started to read the manual. After reading about 30 pages, the graduate became tired and went to sleep. She never got around to reading the rest of the manual. Six months later, the graduate received a termination notice from the bar review course. The notice indicated that the graduate was being fired for insubordination because she had complained about the poor quality of the bar review course's materials and refused to work overtime grading papers. Following her dismissal, the graduate brought suit against the bar review course for breach of contract. Which of the following, if true and provable, would furnish the bar review course with its best defense?\n\nA. All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.\nB. When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.\nC. The materials in the bar review course had recently been reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and had received \"high acclaim. \"\nD.

                    "text": "So I've got this legal scenario here, and I need to figure out which option would give the bar review course the best defense against the graduate's breach of contract claim. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the facts:\n\n- The graduate was hired as an editorial consultant with oral agreement for $2,500 a month.\n\n- After three months, she received a 60-page employment manual.\n\n- She read about 30 pages and didn't finish it.\n\n- Six months later, she was fired for insubordination.\n\n- She sued for breach of contract.\n\nSo, she's claiming that there was a contract, and they breached it by firing her. The bar review course needs to defend themselves, probably by arguing that there was no contract, or that the contract didn't promise continued employment, or something like that.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. All other bar review course employees worked overtime whenever requested to do so.\n\n- This might show that working overtime is a normal expectation, but it doesn't directly address the contract issue. Maybe it could be used to show that she was insubordinate for refusing to work overtime, but that's more about the reason for termination, not about whether there was a contract.\n\nB. When the graduate accepted employment with the bar review course, the company never made any promises regarding job security or duration of employment.\n\n- This seems relevant. If there were no promises about job security or duration, then maybe there was no contract for continued employment. Just a monthly salary arrangement, perhaps at will.\n\nC. The materials in the bar review course had recently been reviewed by the American Bar Association's Committee on Legal Education and had received \"high acclaim.\"\n\n- This seems unrelated to the contract issue. She complained about the quality, but if the ABA says they're high quality, maybe her complaints were unfounded, but again, that's more about the reason for termination, not the contract itself.\n\nD. The second page of the bar review course manual contained a paragraph stating that all policies, guidelines and employee benefits are \"purely gratuitous and not intended to create any ongoing contractual obligation.\"\n\n- This is interesting. If the manual disclaims any contractual obligations, that could be important. But did the graduate know about this? She only read half the manual.\n\nSo, thinking about contract law, for there to be a breach, there needs to be a contract in the first place. Maybe the bar review course can argue that there was no contract for continued employment, just a month-to-month arrangement, or an at-will employment relationship.\n\nOption B seems to support that\u2014no promises about job security or duration. That could be a strong defense.\n\nOption D is also compelling because it suggests that the manual doesn't create any contractual obligations. However, since the graduate only read half the manual, she might argue that she wasn't aware of that disclaimer. But if the disclaimer is right there on page 2, it's likely that she should have read it, even if she didn't.\n\nComparing B and D, option B goes straight to the agreement at the time of hire, which might be more fundamental. Option D relates to the manual, which was provided later.\n\nPerhaps the best defense is a combination of B and D: there were no promises of job security at hire, and the manual explicitly states that policies don't create contractual obligations.\n\nBut since I have to choose one, I think option D might be the strongest, because it directly addresses any potential contractual implications of the manual, which the graduate relied on.\n\nWait, but the graduate didn't finish reading the manual. Maybe she didn't know about the disclaimer.\n\nHowever, in contract law, if a party receives a document and signs it, or indicates acceptance, they are bound by its terms, even if they didn't read them. But in this case, there was no signing or explicit acceptance of the manual.\n\nStill, if the director instructed her to read it and told her it contained important information, there might be an implication that by continuing her employment, she accepted the terms.\n\nBut she didn't read it all. Is she bound by the terms she didn't read?\n\nThis gets complicated.\n\nPerhaps option B is safer for the bar review course: there were no promises about job security or duration at the time of hire. So, even if the manual had certain terms, the original agreement didn't promise continued employment.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, employment is at will unless there's a contract specifying otherwise. So, if there was no such contract, they can terminate her at any time, for any reason, without breaching anything.\n\nTherefore, option B seems like a solid defense.\n\nOption D could be used to support that there were no contractual obligations created by the manual, but the core defense is that there was no contract promising continued employment in the first place.\n\nSo, I think B is the best choice.\n\nBut let's consider the other options briefly:\n\nOption A: Other employees worked overtime. That might show that overtime was expected, but doesn't directly relate to the contract issue.\n\nOption C: ABA acclaim for the materials. That might counter her complaints about quality, but again, doesn't address the contract issue.\n\nTherefore, the bar review course's best defense would be option B: there were no promises regarding job security or duration of employment at the time of hire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
