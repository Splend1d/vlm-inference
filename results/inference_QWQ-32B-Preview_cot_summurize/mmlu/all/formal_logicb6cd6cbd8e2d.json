                    "text": "So I have this logic problem here, and I need to construct a truth table for the given argument and then determine whether it's valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I have to pick the correct counterexample from the options provided.\n\nThe argument is:\n\n~C \u2283 D\n\nD \u2283 C\n\nTherefore, C\n\nFirst, I need to understand what this means. We have two premises:\n\n1. If not C, then D.\n\n2. If D, then C.\n\nAnd the conclusion is C.\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, I need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In other words, whenever both premises are true, does the conclusion have to be true?\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to construct a truth table for the premises and the conclusion, and then check if there's any row where both premises are true but the conclusion is false. If there is such a row, the argument is invalid, and that row would be a counterexample. If there's no such row, the argument is valid.\n\nSo, let's list all possible truth values for C and D, since those are the only propositions involved. There are four combinations:\n\n1. C is true, D is true\n\n2. C is true, D is false\n\n3. C is false, D is true\n\n4. C is false, D is false\n\nI'll make a table with columns for C, D, ~C, ~C \u2283 D, D \u2283 C, and C (the conclusion).\n\nLet's start by listing all possible truth values for C and D:\n\nC | D\n\n---\n\nT | T\n\nT | F\n\nF | T\n\nF | F\n\nNext, I need to compute ~C for each row.\n\n~C is just the negation of C:\n\nIf C is true, ~C is false.\n\nIf C is false, ~C is true.\n\nSo:\n\nC | D | ~C\n\n---\n\nT | T | F\n\nT | F | F\n\nF | T | T\n\nF | F | T\n\nNow, I need to compute ~C \u2283 D.\n\nIn logic, \"A \u2283 B\" is false only when A is true and B is false.\n\nSo, for each row:\n\n1. ~C is false, D is true: F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n2. ~C is false, D is false: F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\n3. ~C is true, D is true: T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n4. ~C is true, D is false: T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\nSo, ~C \u2283 D is:\n\nC | D | ~C | ~C \u2283 D\n\n---\n\nT | T | F | T\n\nT | F | F | T\n\nF | T | T | T\n\nF | F | T | F\n\nNext, I need to compute D \u2283 C.\n\nAgain, \"A \u2283 B\" is false only when A is true and B is false.\n\nSo, for each row:\n\n1. D is true, C is true: T \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n2. D is false, C is true: F \u2283 T \u2192 T\n\n3. D is true, C is false: T \u2283 F \u2192 F\n\n4. D is false, C is false: F \u2283 F \u2192 T\n\nSo, D \u2283 C is:\n\nC | D | ~C | ~C \u2283 D | D \u2283 C\n\n---\n\nT | T | F | T | T\n\nT | F | F | T | T\n\nF | T | T | T | F\n\nF | F | T | F | T\n\nFinally, the conclusion is C, which is just the value of C in each row.\n\nSo, adding that:\n\nC | D | ~C | ~C \u2283 D | D \u2283 C | C\n\n---\n\nT | T | F | T | T | T\n\nT | F | F | T | T | T\n\nF | T | T | T | F | F\n\nF | F | T | F | T | F\n\nNow, to determine if the argument is valid, I need to look for any row where both premises (~C \u2283 D) and (D \u2283 C) are true, but the conclusion C is false.\n\nLet's look at each row:\n\n1. ~C \u2283 D is T, D \u2283 C is T, C is T \u2192 both premises true, conclusion true.\n\n2. ~C \u2283 D is T, D \u2283 C is T, C is T \u2192 same as above.\n\n3. ~C \u2283 D is T, D \u2283 C is F, C is F \u2192 here, one premise is false (D \u2283 C is F), so it doesn't matter.\n\n4. ~C \u2283 D is F, D \u2283 C is T, C is F \u2192 one premise is false.\n\nOnly in row 3 are both premises true:\n\n- ~C \u2283 D is T\n\n- D \u2283 C is F\n\nWait, no, in row 3:\n\n- ~C \u2283 D is T\n\n- D \u2283 C is F\n\nSo, both premises are not true in row 3 because D \u2283 C is F.\n\nIn row 1 and row 2, both premises are true, and in both cases, C is true.\n\nSo, there is no row where both premises are true and C is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Valid\n\nB. Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are true\n\nC. Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false\n\nD. Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false\n\nAccording to my truth table, in the row where C is true and D is true (row 1), both premises are true, and conclusion is true.\n\nIn the row where C is true and D is false (row 2), both premises are true, and conclusion is true.\n\nIn the row where C is false and D is true (row 3), one premise is false.\n\nIn the row where C is false and D is false (row 4), one premise is false.\n\nSo, no row has both premises true and conclusion false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is valid.\n\nBut option B says invalid with counterexample when C and D are true.\n\nWait, but in that case, both premises are true, and conclusion is true.\n\nSo, that's not a counterexample.\n\nSimilarly, option C has C true and D false, but in that case, both premises are true, and conclusion is true.\n\nOption D has D true and C false, but in that case, D \u2283 C is false, so it's not a counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Valid.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
