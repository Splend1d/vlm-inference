                    "text": "A Colles fracture is a specific type of fracture that occurs in the distal part of the radius bone, which is one of the two bones in the forearm. It is named after Abraham Colles, an Irish surgeon who first described it in the early 19th century.\n\nTo understand what a Colles fracture is, it's important to know the anatomy of the wrist and forearm. The forearm consists of two bones: the radius and the ulna. The radius is the larger of the two bones and is located on the thumb side of the forearm, while the ulna is on the little finger side.\n\nA Colles fracture specifically refers to a fracture of the distal end of the radius, typically within 1 to 2 centimeters from the wrist joint. This type of fracture is common and often results from a fall onto an outstretched hand, especially in older individuals with osteoporosis.\n\nCharacteristics of a Colles fracture include:\n\n1. **Dinner Fork Deformity:** One of the classic signs of a Colles fracture is the \"dinner fork\" deformity, where the wrist appears bent backward at the fracture site, resembling the curve of a dinner fork.\n\n2. **Silver Fork Deformity:** Another possible deformity is the \"silver fork\" deformity, which is less common and involves a different angulation of the fractured bone.\n\n3. **Pain and Swelling:** Patients with a Colles fracture usually experience severe pain and swelling in the wrist and hand following the injury.\n\n4. **Limited Motion:** There may be limited movement of the wrist and hand due to pain and structural damage.\n\nTreatment for a Colles fracture depends on the severity and displacement of the fracture. Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures may be treated with casting or splinting to immobilize the wrist and allow healing. In more severe cases, where the bones are significantly displaced or angulated, surgical intervention may be necessary to realign the bones and stabilize them with plates, screws, or pins.\n\nIn summary, a Colles fracture is a fracture of the distal radius, typically occurring near the wrist joint, and is characterized by specific deformities and symptoms. It is a common injury, particularly in older adults, and treatment options range from conservative management to surgical intervention based on the extent of the fracture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
