                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's an employee who took a company vehicle to a fast-food restaurant during lunch break, and on the way back, he had an accident. The driver of the other car sued the company, and the company says that the employee didn't have permission to use the vehicle. Now, at trial, the company wants to call the employee's boss to testify that the employee called him five minutes after the accident and said, \"I hope you won't be sore, because I took the company car without permission.\"\n\nThe question is asking whether this evidence should be admitted or not, and gives four options: A. admissible as a declaration against interest; B. admissible as an admission; C. inadmissible because the employee was not unavailable; D. inadmissible because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what a declaration against interest is. A declaration against interest is a statement that is contrary to the declarant's own interest. It's an exception to the hearsay rule, meaning that even though it's hearsay\u2014because it's an out-of-court statement being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u2014it can still be admitted if it meets certain criteria.\n\nOne of those criteria is that the declarant must be unavailable. So, if the employee is available to testify, then his statement might not qualify as a declaration against interest. But in this case, the company is calling the boss to testify about what the employee said, not the employee himself. So, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, actually, the boss is testifying about what the employee said to him over the phone. So, it's a hearsay within hearsay situation. The boss is testifying to what the employee said, and that statement is offered to prove that the employee took the car without permission.\n\nNow, for this to be admissible, the statement must fall under one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. One possibility is that it's an admission by a party-opponent. In litigation, statements made by a party's agent or employee are considered admissions if they are made within the scope of their employment.\n\nIn this case, the employee is an agent of the company, and if he made a statement about taking the car without permission, that could be considered an admission against the company, since it suggests that he acted without authorization.\n\nBut, wait, the company is using this statement to defend itself, saying that the employee didn't have permission to use the vehicle. So, is this an admission against the employee or against the company?\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think about it differently. The company is being sued, and it's trying to show that the employee wasn't authorized to use the vehicle at the time of the accident. If the employee says, \"I took the company car without permission,\" that would support the company's position.\n\nBut, is this statement admissible as an admission? In evidence law, admissions are out-of-court statements by a party-opponent that are offered against that party. Here, the employee is an agent of the company, so his statement could be considered an admission by the company.\n\nHowever, the company is trying to use this statement to its advantage, but it's a statement against the employee's own interest. So, perhaps it's more accurately considered a declaration against interest.\n\nBut, going back to the options, A is admissible as a declaration against interest, and B is admissible as an admission.\n\nOption C says inadmissible because the employee was not unavailable. Option D says inadmissible because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nFirst, let's consider the availability of the employee. If the employee is available to testify, then a declaration against interest may not be admissible, because one of the requirements for the declaration against interest exception is that the declarant be unavailable.\n\nBut in this case, the company is calling the boss to testify about what the employee said, not the employee himself. So, perhaps the employee's availability isn't directly relevant here.\n\nWait, actually, for the declaration against interest exception to apply, the declarant (the employee) must be unavailable. Since the company is calling the boss to testify about the employee's statement, and presumably the employee could testify himself, his availability might be an issue.\n\nHowever, if the statement is considered an admission by the party-opponent, then hearsay exceptions don't apply in the same way. Admissions by party-opponents are not considered hearsay and are admissible regardless of the declarant's availability.\n\nSo, perhaps option B is correct: admissible as an admission.\n\nBut let's think about the Fifth Amendment rights. Could this statement be inadmissible because it violates the employee's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination?\n\nWell, the Fifth Amendment protects against compelled self-incrimination in criminal cases, but this is a civil lawsuit. Additionally, the employee isn't being compelled to testify; the company is offering testimony from the boss about what the employee said.\n\nSo, it seems unlikely that the Fifth Amendment applies here.\n\nTherefore, option D is probably not correct.\n\nNow, between options A and B, I think B is more appropriate because it's an admission by a party-opponent. The employee, as an agent of the company, made a statement that is adverse to the company's interests, but in this case, the company is trying to use it to support its defense.\n\nWait a minute, is the statement really adverse to the company's interests? The employee says he took the car without permission, which supports the company's position that he didn't have authorization.\n\nSo, perhaps it's not strictly an admission against the company, but rather an admission against himself.\n\nBut in litigation, statements by parties or their agents that are offered against them are considered admissions. So, if the company is a party to the lawsuit, and the employee is its agent, then his statement could be considered an admission by the party-opponent.\n\nTherefore, the evidence should be admitted as an admission.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. admissible as an admission.\n\nBut let's double-check why option A is not correct. Option A is admissible as a declaration against interest. As mentioned earlier, for a declaration against interest to be admissible, the declarant must be unavailable. In this case, the employee is presumably available, since the company is calling his boss to testify about the statement.\n\nTherefore, since the employee is available, his statement wouldn't qualify as a declaration against interest.\n\nHence, option A is not the correct choice.\n\nOption C says inadmissible because the employee was not unavailable. But as we just determined, if it's an admission, then availability isn't an issue.\n\nOption D, as discussed, doesn't apply because it's a civil case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. admissible as an admission.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
