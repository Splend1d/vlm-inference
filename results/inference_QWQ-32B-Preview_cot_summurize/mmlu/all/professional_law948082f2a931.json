                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this legal scenario involving a gardener and a homeowner, and there's a dispute about the agreed payment for landscaping services. The gardener says they agreed on $200, but the homeowner paid only $100, and now there's a lawsuit for breach of contract. There's also a Dead Man's Statute in place, and the gardener wants to testify about what his bilingual friend told him regarding the agreement, but the friend is now deceased. The question is about the admissibility of the gardener's proposed testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a Dead Man's Statute is. From what I recall, it's a law that prevents certain parties from testifying about communications with a deceased person, usually to prevent fraud or perjury since the deceased can't cross-examine or defend themselves. So, in this case, since the friend who interpreted is deceased, and the gardener wants to testify about what this friend told him concerning the agreement with the homeowner, who also speaks only Japanese, there might be issues with the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Admissible as an admission by a party-opponent.\n\nI need to think about whether the testimony qualifies as an admission. An admission is a statement by a party that's offered against them in court. Here, the gardener is testifying about what his friend told him regarding the agreement with the homeowner. It doesn't seem like the homeowner is directly admitting to anything; it's third-hand information through the friend. So, perhaps this isn't directly an admission by the party-opponent.\n\nB. Admissible as non-hearsay to corroborate evidence of a verbal act.\n\nThis option is a bit tricky. Hearsay is generally inadmissible, but there are exceptions. If the testimony is considered non-hearsay because it's not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show that the statement was made, that might be acceptable. However, in this case, the gardener is probably trying to prove that the agreement was for $200, so the testimony is about the content of what was communicated, which seems like hearsay.\n\nC. Inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nGiven that the friend is deceased and was involved in communicating the agreement between the gardener and the homeowner, and now the gardener wants to testify about what this deceased friend told him, this seems like a classic situation where the Dead Man's Statute would apply. The statute is designed to prevent testimony about communications with a deceased person, especially in cases where the deceased can't defend themselves. So, this seems like a strong candidate for inadmissibility.\n\nD. Inadmissible, unless it is established that the gardener accepted the friend as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract.\n\nThis option introduces the concept of agency. If the friend was acting as the homeowner's agent in communicating the terms of the contract, then perhaps the gardener's acceptance of the friend as the agent could make the testimony admissible. However, I'm not sure if establishing agency would overcome the Dead Man's Statute. The statute is more about preventing testimony about communications with deceased persons, regardless of their role.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems most straightforward. The Dead Man's Statute would likely bar the gardener's testimony about what his deceased friend told him regarding the agreement with the homeowner.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's an exception or something I'm missing.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, Dead Man's Statutes may have exceptions for statements that are against interest or for independent corroboration. However, in this case, the gardener is trying to prove that there was an agreement for $200, and the only evidence is through a deceased interpreter. It's likely that the statute would bar this testimony to prevent potential fabrication or misrepresentation.\n\nAlso, regarding option D, even if the friend was the homeowner's agent, the issue remains that the friend is deceased, and the gardener is testifying about what the friend told him. The agency relationship might affect the weight of the testimony or other legal considerations, but it may not overcome the Dead Man's Statute.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C: inadmissible, because of the Dead Man's Statute.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
