Using genetic reassortment\n\nFirst, I need to recall what calciviruses are. I know that calciviruses, also known as caliciviruses, are a family of viruses that include pathogens like norovirus and hepatitis E virus. They are non-enveloped viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes.\n\nNow, to understand how they replicate, I need to remember the different types of RNA viruses and their replication strategies.\n\nOption A is negative strand RNA viruses. These are viruses like influenza and rabies, where the viral RNA is complementary to the mRNA and needs to be transcribed by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to make mRNA.\n\nOption B is positive strand RNA viruses. These viruses have RNA that is directly translated by the host cell's ribosomes because their genome is similar to mRNA.\n\nOption C, retroviruses, are different because they have RNA genomes but use a DNA intermediate during replication, involving reverse transcription.\n\nOption D, genetic reassortment, is a process where different viruses exchange genetic material, but it's not a replication method per se.\n\nGiven that calciviruses have positive-sense RNA genomes, I think they replicate as positive strand RNA viruses. Let me confirm that.\n\nPositive-sense RNA viruses can be directly translated by the host's ribosomes. Their replication typically involves the synthesis of a complementary negative strand, which then serves as a template for making new positive strands and progeny viruses.\n\nCalciviruses, being positive-strand RNA viruses, should follow this pattern. They probably have a genome that includes genes for replicase enzymes that help in making the negative strand and then more positive strands.\n\nI don't think calciviruses are negative-strand RNA viruses because their genome is positive-sense. They aren't retroviruses because they don't use reverse transcription to make DNA from their RNA genome. And genetic reassortment isn't a replication method but rather a mechanism for genetic diversity.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B. As positive strand RNA viruses.\n\nTo double-check, I can think about other positive-strand RNA viruses, like picornaviruses (e.g., poliovirus) and flaviviruses (e.g., dengue virus), which also have similar replication strategies.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the answer is B. As positive strand RNA viruses.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
