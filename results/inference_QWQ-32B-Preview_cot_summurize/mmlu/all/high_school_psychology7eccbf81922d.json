                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. So, there's a pastry chef who usually makes 15 apple turnovers in 15 minutes. But when culinary arts students are watching him, he speeds up and makes 20 turnovers in the same amount of time. The question is asking which psychological concept this scenario best illustrates. The options are:\n\nA. Foot-in-the-door phenomenon\n\nB. Social loafing\n\nC. Social facilitation\n\nD. The bystander effect\n\nOkay, first I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nStarting with A, the foot-in-the-door phenomenon: This is a compliance technique where a person is asked to agree to a small request first, and then is more likely to agree to a larger request later. It's about getting an initial commitment to make future commitments more likely. But in this scenario, there's no request being made or commitment being sought. The chef is just making more turnovers when watched. So, I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nNext, B, social loafing: This is when individuals put in less effort to achieve a goal when they work in a group compared to when they work alone. It's like relying on others to carry the load. But in this case, the chef is actually performing better when being watched, not worse. So, social loafing doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nOption C is social facilitation: This is a concept in social psychology that suggests that people perform tasks better or worse in the presence of others, depending on the nature of the task. For well-learned or simple tasks, performance improves in the presence of others, but for complex or unfamiliar tasks, performance may deteriorate. In this scenario, the chef is making more turnovers when watched, which suggests that his performance improves in the presence of others. Since making turnovers is probably a well-learned task for a pastry chef, social facilitation seems like a plausible answer.\n\nLastly, D, the bystander effect: This is the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help a victim when other people are present. It's about diffusion of responsibility in emergency situations. Again, this doesn't seem relevant to the scenario presented, which is about performance enhancement when being observed.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, social facilitation appears to be the most appropriate choice. The chef is performing a well-practiced task more efficiently when being watched by students, which aligns with the concept of social facilitation.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if any other option could potentially fit. For example, maybe the foot-in-the-door phenomenon could be stretched to fit if we imagine that the chef feels obliged to perform better because the students are watching, but that seems like a forced interpretation. Similarly, social loafing is about performing worse in groups, which isn't happening here. The bystander effect is unrelated to performance.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is C. social facilitation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
