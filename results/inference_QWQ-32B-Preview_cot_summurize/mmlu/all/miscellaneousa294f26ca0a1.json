                    "text": "I've come across this cooking term 'au gratin' and I'm a bit confused about what it means exactly. The question here is asking which topping is typically used in an au gratin dish, and the options are cheese, fruit, gravy, or whipped cream. I think I have a general idea, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nFirst off, I know that \"au gratin\" is a French term, and French cuisine is known for its precise terminology. So, understanding the origins might help. I believe \"gratin\" refers to a crispy topping, but I'm not sure what constitutes that crispiness.\n\nOption A is cheese. I've heard of dishes like potatoes au gratin, which usually have a cheesy topping that gets brown and crispy in the oven. So, cheese seems plausible.\n\nOption B is fruit. That seems a bit odd. I can't recall any dish that combines fruit with a gratin topping. Maybe in some desserts, but it doesn't sound right for a general definition.\n\nOption C is gravy. Gravy is more commonly associated with meat dishes or sauces, but I don't recall it being used as a topping for gratin dishes.\n\nOption D is whipped cream. That seems more like a dessert topping. While you might have gratin dishes that are sweet, whipped cream doesn't sound typical for au gratin.\n\nLet me think about some common au gratin dishes. Potatoes au gratin comes to mind again, and that usually involves cheese. Also, there's cauliflower au gratin, which again, typically has a cheese topping. So, based on these examples, cheese seems like the most likely answer.\n\nBut maybe there are other dishes where different toppings are used. For example, is there such a thing as a fruit gratin? I'm not sure. Perhaps in some regional cuisines, but it doesn't seem standard.\n\nGravy as a topping for gratin sounds unusual. Gravy is more of a pouring sauce, not something that would create a crispy topping.\n\nWhipped cream is definitely a dessert topping, but I don't recall it being used in au gratin dishes. Maybe in some variations, but it doesn't seem like the classic definition.\n\nSo, going back to the French origin, \"gratin\" means \"crust\" or \"crisp,\" and it refers to the browned top layer of a dish. In many classic French dishes, this crust is achieved by adding cheese and breadcrumbs, then browning it in the oven or under a broiler.\n\nTherefore, cheese seems to be the most appropriate answer among the options provided.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should check a reliable source to confirm this.\n\nLooking it up, according to culinary dictionaries, \"au gratin\" indeed refers to dishes that are topped with breadcrumbs, cheese, or both, and then browned in an oven or under a broiler. So, cheese is definitely a key component in many au gratin dishes.\n\nMoreover, in classic French cuisine, dishes like gratin dauphinois, which is a potato dish, traditionally include cream and cheese, baked until golden and crispy on top.\n\nTherefore, it's safe to say that cheese is a common topping in au gratin dishes.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. cheese.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
