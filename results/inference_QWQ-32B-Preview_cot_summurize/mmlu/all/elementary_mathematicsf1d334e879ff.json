Let's convert quarts to cups since the first quantity is in cups.\n\nFirst, recall that:\n1 quart (qt) = 4 cups\n\nSo, 3 quarts = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 cups\n\nNow, the ratio of 2 cups to 3 quarts is the same as the ratio of 2 cups to 12 cups.\n\nThis can be written as a fraction: 2/12\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.\n\n2 \u00f7 2 = 1\n12 \u00f7 2 = 6\n\nSo, the simplified fraction is 1/6\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 1 over 6\n"
