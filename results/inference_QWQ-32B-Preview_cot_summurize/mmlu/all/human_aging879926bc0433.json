So, let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, option A: \"It becomes thicker.\" I know that as we age, the lens can become less flexible and thicker. This is part of why older people often have trouble with near vision, like reading small print. So, that seems like something that does happen.\n\nNext, option B: \"It yellows.\" I've heard that the lens can change color over time, becoming more yellowish. This can affect how we perceive colors as we get older. So, that seems plausible.\n\nOption C: \"It becomes clouded.\" I think this is related to cataracts, which are common in older people. So, that's probably something that can happen.\n\nFinally, option D: \"It fills with fluid.\" Hmm, I don't recall hearing about the lens filling with fluid as we age. I know that the lens has a certain structure with proteins arranged in a particular way to keep it clear, but filling with fluid doesn't sound right.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should recall what the lens is made of. The lens is mostly made up of water and proteins. As we age, these proteins can clump together, causing parts of the lens to become cloudy, which is what happens in cataracts. But filling with fluid sounds different.\n\nPerhaps, in some eye conditions, there are changes in the fluid balance within the eye, but I don't think the lens itself fills with fluid as a normal part of aging.\n\nLet me double-check. Option A, becoming thicker, that makes sense. Option B, yellowing, that also seems correct. Option C, clouding, definitely happens with cataracts. Option D, filling with fluid, doesn't seem to be a standard part of aging.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. It fills with fluid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
