                    "text": "Let's tackle these statements one by one. Starting with Statement 1: \"Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a quotient ring is. Given a ring R and an ideal I of R, the quotient ring is R/I, which consists of cosets of I in R. The operations are defined as (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I and (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I.\n\nNow, if R is commutative, that means for any a, b in R, ab = ba. I need to check if R/I is also commutative.\n\nTake any two elements in R/I, say a + I and b + I. Their product is (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I, and similarly, (b + I)(a + I) = ba + I. Since R is commutative, ab = ba, so ab + I = ba + I. Therefore, (a + I)(b + I) = (b + I)(a + I), which means R/I is commutative.\n\nSo, Statement 1 seems to be true.\n\nMoving on to Statement 2: \"An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, recall that an ideal N of a ring R is a subset that is closed under addition and satisfies the absorption property: for any r in R and n in N, both rn and nr are in N.\n\nNow, if R has unity 1, and 1 is in N, then for any r in R, r*1 = r and 1*r = r are in N, because N is an ideal and must absorb elements via multiplication by any element of R. Therefore, every element r in R is in N, which means N = R.\n\nThat takes care of the \"if\" part: if 1 is in N, then N = R.\n\nNow, for the \"only if\" part: if N = R, then 1 is in N.\n\nWell, if N = R, then every element of R is in N, including the unity 1. So, 1 is in N.\n\nTherefore, the statement holds both ways: N = R if and only if 1 is in N.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nPutting it all together, both statements are true, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
