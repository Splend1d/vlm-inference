So, the Commerce Clause is part of the U.S. Constitution that gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the states, and with Indian tribes. I think it's mainly about controlling trade and business activities across these different areas.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Release detainees from prison following unlawful arrest.\n\nHmm, that seems more related to criminal procedure and maybe the due process clauses in the Constitution, not directly to commerce. So, probably not A.\n\nB. Maintain the navy.\n\nMaintaining the navy falls under the powers related to national defense and the armed forces, which are enumerated in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, but not specifically under the Commerce Clause. So, maybe not B.\n\nC. Increase the power of the national government.\n\nThis one interests me. Historically, the interpretation of the Commerce Clause has been used by the Supreme Court to expand the powers of the national government over the states. For example, in cases like Gibbons v. Ogden and Wickard v. Filburn, the Court has interpreted \"commerce\" very broadly to include almost any economic activity that affects interstate commerce. This has allowed Congress to pass a wide range of laws that might not have been possible under a narrower interpretation of commerce. So, this seems plausible.\n\nD. Veto legislative bills of attainder.\n\nBills of attainder are laws that inflict punishment without a trial, and the Constitution prohibits both Congress and the states from passing them. This is more related to separation of powers and due process, not directly to commerce. So, probably not D.\n\nBetween all these options, I think C is the most accurate. The Commerce Clause has indeed been used to increase the power of the national government by allowing Congress to regulate a broad range of activities that affect interstate commerce.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. The Commerce Clause is primarily about regulating trade and commerce. Over time, the courts have interpreted \"commerce\" very broadly, including activities that might not seem like traditional commerce but still have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. This broad interpretation has allowed Congress to pass laws related to labor relations, civil rights, environmental protection, and more, all under the banner of regulating commerce.\n\nSo, by expanding the definition of commerce, the national government's powers have been enhanced. States' powers have been correspondingly limited in areas where Congress chooses to act. Therefore, the Commerce Clause has been a key tool in increasing the national government's authority.\n\nI don't think options A, B, or D are directly related to the Commerce Clause. A is more about criminal procedure, B is about national defense, and D is about legislative restrictions on bills of attainder. None of these seem to fit with the primary purpose of the Commerce Clause, which is about regulating trade and economic activities.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is C: increase the power of the national government.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
