                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about self-monitoring. So, self-monitoring is a concept in psychology that refers to how much a person regulates their behavior based on the social situation they're in. People who are low in self-monitoring tend to act according to their inner feelings, attitudes, and beliefs, regardless of the social context. On the other hand, high self-monitors are more likely to adjust their behavior based on the social cues and norms of the situation.\n\nThe question is asking about someone who is low in self-monitoring. According to Snyder's 1987 model, these individuals rely more on their internal states rather than external social cues when deciding how to act in a social situation.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. His/her life scripts.\n\nLife scripts are like personal narratives or plans that people have for their lives. They guide expectations and behaviors over time but might not directly influence moment-to-moment social interactions in the same way that immediate feelings or social cues do.\n\nB. His/her own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs.\n\nThis seems aligned with the description of low self-monitors. They are more likely to act in accordance with their internal states rather than external social pressures.\n\nC. The emotional reactions and behaviors of the people he/she is interacting with.\n\nThis sounds more like what high self-monitors would do. They are attuned to the social environment and adjust their behavior based on others' reactions.\n\nD. Internal working models that were acquired during infancy and early childhood.\n\nInternal working models are mental frameworks that people develop early in life, often based on their relationships with primary caregivers. These models influence how they perceive and interact with others but might be too broad to specifically guide behavior in particular social situations.\n\nGiven this, option B seems to be the most accurate answer. Low self-monitors rely on their own feelings, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding how to act in a social situation.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing something, let's think about each option a bit more.\n\nOption A, life scripts, are more about long-term life plans and expectations. While they can influence behavior, they might not be the primary guide in specific social situations for low self-monitors.\n\nOption C is more in line with high self-monitors, who are sensitive to and adjust based on the behaviors and reactions of others.\n\nOption D, internal working models, are indeed important in shaping interpersonal behavior, but they are more about expectations and interpretations of relationships rather than immediate behavioral decisions based on current feelings or social cues.\n\nTherefore, option B appears to be the best fit for how low self-monitors make decisions about how to act in social situations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
