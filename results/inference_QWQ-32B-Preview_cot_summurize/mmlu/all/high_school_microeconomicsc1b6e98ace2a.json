                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this economics problem about oligopolists and their demand curves. The question is: \"Which of the following illustrates the demand curve facing an oligopolist when rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase?\" And then there are four options: A. Perfectly horizontal demand curve. B. Highly inelastic demand curve. C. Highly elastic demand curve. D. A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments.\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what an oligopolist is. Oligopoly is a market structure where there are only a few sellers, and each seller's actions can affect the others. So, in this scenario, if one firm changes its price, its rivals might react differently depending on whether the price is increased or decreased.\n\nThe question says that rival firms follow a price decrease but not a price increase. That means if one firm lowers its price, others will also lower theirs, but if one firm raises its price, others won't necessarily do the same.\n\nNow, I need to think about how this affects the demand curve faced by an individual oligopolist.\n\nLet's consider what happens when the firm decreases its price. If rivals follow suit and also decrease their prices, then the firm doesn't gain much market share because everyone is selling at a lower price. So, the quantity demanded for the firm might not increase significantly. On the other hand, if the firm tries to increase its price while rivals keep their prices the same, customers might switch to rivals, leading to a significant drop in quantity demanded for the firm.\n\nThis suggests that the demand curve is more elastic for price increases and less elastic for price decreases. In other words, customers are more sensitive to price increases than to price decreases.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Perfectly horizontal demand curve. A perfectly horizontal demand curve would imply perfect elasticity, meaning that any small increase in price would cause quantity demanded to drop to zero. But in this scenario, it's not that any price increase leads to zero demand; it's just that demand is more elastic for price increases.\n\nB. Highly inelastic demand curve. If demand is highly inelastic, customers are not sensitive to price changes. But in this case, customers are sensitive to price increases but less so to price decreases.\n\nC. Highly elastic demand curve. If demand is highly elastic, small changes in price lead to large changes in quantity demanded. But again, in this scenario, elasticity seems to depend on the direction of the price change.\n\nD. A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments. This option suggests that the demand curve has two separate parts, possibly reflecting different behaviors for price increases and decreases.\n\nGiven that rivals follow price decreases but not price increases, the demand curve might have different elasticities for increases and decreases, which could be represented by two different segments.\n\nI think option D makes the most sense here because it acknowledges that the demand curve behaves differently depending on whether the firm is considering a price increase or a decrease. Specifically, for price increases, demand is more elastic, and for price decreases, demand is less elastic due to rivals also decreasing their prices.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the kinked demand curve model, which is a concept in oligopoly theory. In the kinked demand curve model, when one firm raises its price, others don't follow, so the firm loses a lot of customers to rivals. Conversely, when one firm lowers its price, rivals also lower their prices to match, so the firm doesn't gain as many customers as it might have if rivals hadn't matched the price decrease.\n\nThis results in a demand curve that is more elastic above the current price (for price increases) and less elastic below the current price (for price decreases), creating a kink at the current price level.\n\nHowever, in this question, it's phrased in terms of discontinuous segments, not necessarily a kink. But the idea is similar: the demand curve has different elasticities for price increases and decreases, which can be represented by two distinct segments.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. A demand curve consisting of two discontinuous segments.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
