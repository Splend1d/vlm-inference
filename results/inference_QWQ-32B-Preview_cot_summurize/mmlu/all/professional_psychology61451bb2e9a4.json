                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out this question about a family therapist using Salvador Minuchin's structural approach. The options are:\n\nA. clarify boundaries between family members to reduce enmeshment.\n\nB. work initially with the most differentiated family member.\n\nC. use a multiple-therapist team to prevent any one therapist from becoming \"triangulated\" into the family system.\n\nD. issue specific \"directives\" designed to counteract dysfunctional processes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Minuchin's structural approach is all about. I remember that it's a type of family therapy that focuses on the family's internal structure and interactions. It's about how roles, boundaries, and hierarchies within the family affect its functioning.\n\nOption A mentions clarifying boundaries to reduce enmeshment. Enmeshment is when family members are too involved in each other's lives, lacking clear boundaries. Minuchin does emphasize the importance of boundaries in families, so this seems relevant.\n\nOption B talks about working with the most differentiated family member. Differentiation is more of a concept from Murray Bowen's family systems theory, not directly from Minuchin. So, this might not be the best fit.\n\nOption C suggests using a multiple-therapist team to prevent triangulation. Triangulation is when two people in a relationship involve a third person to diffuse tension between them. While triangulation is a concept in family therapy, I don't recall Minuchin specifically advocating for multiple therapists to prevent it.\n\nOption D mentions issuing specific directives to counteract dysfunctional processes. Minuchin is known for his use of structural interventions, which can include directives to change the family's interaction patterns.\n\nBetween A and D, both seem plausible. But I think A is more directly related to the structural approach, as it focuses on boundaries, which are a key component of the family's structure.\n\nLet me double-check. Minuchin's structural family therapy aims to identify and reform the underlying structure of the family, which includes hierarchies, boundaries, and subsystems. So, clarifying boundaries to reduce enmeshment aligns well with that goal.\n\nOption D, about issuing directives, is something Minuchin does advocate, but it's more about how the therapist intervenes in the therapy session to reshape the family's interactions. While important, it might not be the primary focus compared to addressing boundaries.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is A: clarify boundaries between family members in order to reduce enmeshment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
