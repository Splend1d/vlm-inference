                    "text": "I'm looking at this function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b3 and I need to figure out which statement about its relative extrema is true. The options are:\n\nA. f has all of its relative extrema on the line x = y.\n\nB. f has all of its relative extrema on the parabola x = y\u00b2.\n\nC. f has a relative minimum at (0, 0).\n\nD. f has an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3).\n\nOkay, first things first, to find the relative extrema of a function of two variables, I need to find its critical points. Critical points occur where both partial derivatives with respect to x and y are zero, or where they are undefined. So, I'll start by computing the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y.\n\nLet's compute f_x, the partial derivative with respect to x:\n\nf_x = \u2202f/\u2202x = 2x - 2y\n\nAnd f_y, the partial derivative with respect to y:\n\nf_y = \u2202f/\u2202y = -2x + 3y\u00b2\n\nNow, to find the critical points, I need to solve the system of equations where both partial derivatives are set to zero:\n\n2x - 2y = 0\n\n-2x + 3y\u00b2 = 0\n\nFrom the first equation, 2x - 2y = 0, which simplifies to x = y.\n\nSubstituting x = y into the second equation:\n\n-2(y) + 3y\u00b2 = 0\n\n-2y + 3y\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor out y:\n\ny(-2 + 3y) = 0\n\nSo, y = 0 or -2 + 3y = 0 \u21d2 y = 2/3\n\n corresponding x values, since x = y:\n\nIf y = 0, then x = 0\n\nIf y = 2/3, then x = 2/3\n\nTherefore, the critical points are (0, 0) and (2/3, 2/3).\n\nNow, I need to determine the nature of these critical points: whether they are relative minima, relative maxima, or saddle points.\n\nTo do this, I can use the second derivative test for functions of two variables. I need to compute the second partial derivatives and the discriminant D.\n\nFirst, compute the second partial derivatives:\n\nf_xx = \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2 = 2\n\nf_yy = \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = 6y\n\nf_xy = \u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u2202y = -2\n\nThe discriminant D is given by:\n\nD = f_xx * f_yy - (f_xy)\u00b2\n\nSo, D = 2 * 6y - (-2)\u00b2 = 12y - 4\n\nNow, evaluate D at each critical point.\n\nFirst, at (0, 0):\n\nD = 12(0) - 4 = -4\n\nSince D < 0, the second derivative test says that (0, 0) is a saddle point.\n\nSecond, at (2/3, 2/3):\n\nD = 12*(2/3) - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4\n\nSince D > 0 and f_xx = 2 > 0, the second derivative test says that (2/3, 2/3) is a relative minimum.\n\nSo, from this analysis:\n\n- (0, 0) is a saddle point.\n\n- (2/3, 2/3) is a relative minimum.\n\nNow, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. f has all of its relative extrema on the line x = y.\n\nWell, both critical points are on the line x = y, and the relative minimum is at (2/3, 2/3), which is on x = y. But since (0, 0) is a saddle point, not an extremum, this statement might still hold true, as it specifies \"relative extrema,\" not including saddle points. So, this could be true.\n\nB. f has all of its relative extrema on the parabola x = y\u00b2.\n\nLet's check if the critical points lie on x = y\u00b2.\n\nFor (0, 0): 0 = 0\u00b2 \u2192 yes.\n\nFor (2/3, 2/3): 2/3 = (2/3)\u00b2 \u21d2 2/3 = 4/9, which is not true. So, (2/3, 2/3) does not lie on x = y\u00b2. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nC. f has a relative minimum at (0, 0).\n\nBut we found that (0, 0) is a saddle point, not a relative minimum. So, this is false.\n\nD. f has an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3).\n\nWe found that (2/3, 2/3) is a relative minimum, but not necessarily an absolute minimum. To check if it's an absolute minimum, we'd need to analyze the behavior of f as x and y approach infinity and see if f can get lower than at (2/3, 2/3).\n\nLet's consider the function f(x, y) = x\u00b2 - 2xy + y\u00b3.\n\nLet's see what happens when y approaches infinity while x is fixed. Since y\u00b3 term will dominate, and it's positive, f will go to infinity.\n\nSimilarly, when y approaches negative infinity, y\u00b3 will go to negative infinity, so f will go to negative infinity.\n\nThis suggests that there is no absolute minimum, because f can become arbitrarily negative.\n\nTherefore, option D is false.\n\nSo, the only potentially true statement is A.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Statement A says \"f has all of its relative extrema on the line x = y.\"\n\nWe found that the only relative extremum is at (2/3, 2/3), which is on x = y, and there's a saddle point at (0, 0), which is also on x = y, but saddle points are not extrema.\n\nSo, all relative extrema (only one in this case) are on x = y.\n\nTherefore, statement A is true.\n\nStatement B is false, as (2/3, 2/3) is not on x = y\u00b2.\n\nStatement C is false because (0, 0) is a saddle point.\n\nStatement D is false because there is no absolute minimum.\n\nHence, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
