Later that same day, he approached a victim and, brandishing a knife, told her to accompany him or he would stab her. He led the victim to his car and then ordered her to disrobe. As the victim was removing her pantyhose, she kicked the defendant in the head, temporarily dazing him. The victim then safely ran from the car. The defendant is arrested and charged with the crime of assault with the intent to commit rape.\nB. A defendant attended a wedding reception at a hotel, where he drank several vodka daiquiris. Following the reception, the defendant engaged in a violent argument with the hotel's parking lot attendant. The defendant took a tire iron from his car and threw it at the attendant. The tire iron missed the attendant and hit a victim as he was entering the hotel. The defendant is arrested and charged with assault with the intent to commit battery.\nC. A defendant had been drinking liquor all evening at a bar with three of his buddies. An undercover detective overheard the defendant and his buddies plot to rob the bar after closing hours. When the defendant attempted to draw a gun from his coat, he was quickly disarmed and placed under arrest by the detective. The defendant is charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery.\nD. At his law school graduation party, a defendant drank two six-packs of beer. Around midnight, the defendant was approached by a girl, who asked him to drive her home. Although the girl was only 15 years old, she had the appearance of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties. The defendant, who had had his eye on the girl all night, quickly agreed, and he showed her the way to his car. Once inside, they engaged in sexual intercourse. The age of consent in this jurisdiction is 17 years old for females. The defendant is subsequently arrested and charged with statutory rape.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into these scenarios to figure out in which one the defendant's intoxication wouldn't negate his criminal culpability. So, first things first, we need to understand what it means for intoxication to negate criminal culpability.\n\nIntoxication can be used as a defense in some cases if it prevents the defendant from forming the necessary mens rea, or mental state, required for the crime. For example, in specific intent crimes, where a particular intention is required, intoxication might be used to show that the defendant didn't have that specific intent because they were too drunk to know what they were doing.\n\nHowever, not all crimes require specific intent. Some crimes are general intent crimes, where the intention to perform the physical act is enough, regardless of what the defendant intended to achieve by it. In these cases, intoxication might not be a valid defense because the defendant still intended to perform the act that constitutes the crime.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: The defendant approaches a victim with a knife, threatens her, and tries to get her into his car to disrobe. This sounds like assault with intent to commit rape. Typically, rape requires specific intent\u2014to have sexual intercourse without consent. So, if the defendant was too intoxicated to form that specific intent, maybe his intoxication could negate his culpability. But in this case, he brandished a knife and made threats, which suggests he knew what he was doing. It's complicated.\n\nOption B: The defendant gets drunk, has an argument, takes a tire iron, and throws it at someone, hitting a different person. He's charged with assault with intent to commit battery. Assault with intent usually requires specific intent to cause harm. So, if he was too intoxicated to form that intent, maybe intoxication could be a defense. But again, throwing a tire iron suggests he knew what he was doing.\n\nOption C: The defendant and his buddies plot to rob a bar after drinking all evening. He's charged with conspiracy to commit robbery. Conspiracy generally requires an agreement to commit a crime, and intent to achieve that criminal objective. Intoxication might not negate the intent if they planned the robbery while intoxicated, but intent was still present.\n\nOption D: The defendant drinks at his graduation party, picks up a 15-year-old girl who looks older, and has sex with her. He's charged with statutory rape. Statutory rape is a strict liability crime, meaning that the defendant's intent or knowledge about the victim's age is irrelevant. As long as the act occurred and the victim was below the age of consent, the defendant is guilty. In this case, intoxication wouldn't be a defense because the crime doesn't require specific intent; it's about the act itself and the age of the victim.\n\nSo, comparing all these options, option D seems to be the one where intoxication wouldn't negate criminal culpability because statutory rape is a strict liability offense. The defendant's state of mind or level of intoxication doesn't affect his guilt.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to make sure.\n\nIn option A, assault with intent to commit rape typically requires specific intent, so intoxication might be relevant to show lack of intent.\n\nIn option B, assault with intent to commit battery also usually requires specific intent, so intoxication could be a factor.\n\nIn option C, conspiracy requires intent to agree and intent to commit the crime, so intoxication might not excuse the intent if they agreed while intoxicated.\n\nBut in option D, since it's statutory rape, intent is not a factor, so intoxication shouldn't affect liability.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
