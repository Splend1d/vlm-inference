                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about what's morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character turned in dirty towels when checking out from the hotel. Is that morally wrong? Well, hotels usually expect guests to leave dirty towels in the room, and housekeeping takes care of them. Some hotels even encourage guests to reuse towels to save water and resources. So, turning in dirty towels might not be following hotel etiquette, but is it morally wrong? Probably not. It's more of a minor inconvenience for the hotel staff.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character keeps whiskey bottles out of reach of their 3-year-old son. That seems like a responsible action to prevent the child from accessing alcohol, which could be harmful or even dangerous. So, that should be considered morally right.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong. So, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if turning in dirty towels causes confusion or extra work for the hotel staff, is that considered morally wrong? Probably not. It's more of a breach of hotel norms rather than a moral issue. Morally wrong actions usually involve harming others, violating their rights, or being dishonest.\n\nIn Scenario 2, keeping alcohol out of reach of a child is a protective measure, which is morally positive.\n\nSo, yes, I think D. Not wrong, Not wrong is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
