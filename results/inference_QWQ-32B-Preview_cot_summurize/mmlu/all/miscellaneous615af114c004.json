                    "text": "Let's see here. I have this question about candies and which one is traditionally fruit flavored. The options are M&M's, Skittles, Reese's Pieces, and Junior Mints. Hmm, I need to think about each one and recall what flavor they usually are.\n\nStarting with M&M's. I know M&M's are those colorful candies with chocolate inside and a hard shell outside. I think the shell is usually milk chocolate, and maybe some have other flavors like peanut or almond, but traditionally, I believe they're chocolate flavored. So, probably not fruit flavored.\n\nNext, Skittles. Skittles are known for their bright colors and the slogan \"Taste the Rainbow.\" I remember that each color corresponds to a different fruit flavor: red is strawberry, orange is orange, yellow is lemon, green is lime, and purple is grape, I think. So, yeah, Skittles are definitely fruit flavored.\n\nNow, Reese's Pieces. These are the small, orange, peanut butter candies. I think they're primarily peanut butter flavored with a slight sweetness, but not really fruit flavored. Maybe sometimes they have limited edition flavors that are fruit, but traditionally, they're peanut butter.\n\nLastly, Junior Mints. These are small, mint-flavored candies with a hard shell and a soft center. Mint is a different flavor profile from fruit, so I don't think they're fruit flavored.\n\nComparing all of these, it seems like Skittles are the ones that are traditionally fruit flavored. M&M's are chocolate, Reese's Pieces are peanut butter, and Junior Mints are mint.\n\nSo, my answer would be B. Skittles.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
