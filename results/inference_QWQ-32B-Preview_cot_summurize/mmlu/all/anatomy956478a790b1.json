Osteoclasts are the cells responsible for breaking down bone, right? So, they resorb bone.\n\nNow, about their origin. I think osteoclasts come from a type of blood cell called monocytes. Monocytes are part of the immune system, and osteoclasts somehow differentiate from them to become bone-resorbing cells.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nA. deposit bone and differentiate from periosteal mesenchymal cells.\n\nB. resorb bone and differentiate from periosteal mesenchymal cells.\n\nC. deposit bone and differentiate from monocytes.\n\nD. resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes.\n\nOkay, so options A and C say that osteoclasts deposit bone, but I think they resorb bone, so those might be wrong.\n\nOptions B and D say that osteoclasts resorb bone, which matches what I think.\n\nNow, about their origin: periosteal mesenchymal cells or monocytes.\n\nI recall that osteoblasts, which are the cells that deposit bone, come from mesenchymal cells, particularly those in the periosteum.\n\nBut osteoclasts are different; they originate from monocytes, which are part of the hematopoietic system.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should double-check.\n\nWhat does periosteal mesenchymal cells give rise to? I think osteoblasts, which deposit bone.\n\nAnd monocytes differentiate into osteoclasts, which resorb bone.\n\nSo, that would make option D the correct one.\n\nI don't think it's option B because that says they differentiate from periosteal mesenchymal cells, which, as I recall, give rise to osteoblasts, not osteoclasts.\n\nYes, I'm fairly confident with D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
