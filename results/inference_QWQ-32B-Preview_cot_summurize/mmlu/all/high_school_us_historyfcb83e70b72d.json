                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Frederick Douglass's excerpt from 1857. I need to figure out which development in the mid-nineteenth century this quote best exemplifies. The options are:\n\nA. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves\n\nB. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation\n\nC. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\n\nD. The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion\n\nFirst, I should understand what Douglass is saying in the excerpt. He's talking about how slaveholders have an advantage because they are well-organized. He mentions that state governments in slaveholding states are complete slavery organizations, and even the churches there support slavery. Moreover, he points out that the federal government, including the army, navy, chief magistrate, Supreme Court, and chief marshalship, is pledged to support and defend slavery.\n\nSo, Douglass is painting a picture where slavery is deeply embedded in the political and religious institutions of the South and is also backed by the federal government. He refers to this as a \"crying curse of human bondage\" and mentions that \"the pen, the purse, and the sword\" are united against the truth preached by humble men in obscure places. This suggests that there's an opposition to slavery, but it's being suppressed by the powerful institutions that support it.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The gradual replacement of indentured servants with African slaves\n\nThis seems like an economic or historical development, but Douglass's excerpt doesn't really talk about the transition from indentured servants to slaves. He's focusing on the institutional support for slavery in the mid-19th century, not on how slavery developed over time.\n\nB. The preservation of African culture through cultural adaptation\n\nThis option seems related to how enslaved Africans maintained their cultural practices despite being forced into slavery. However, Douglass's excerpt doesn't discuss cultural practices or adaptation. He's more concerned with the political and religious structures that support slavery.\n\nC. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery\n\nThis option aligns closely with what Douglass is describing. He mentions that the federal government, from the president to the Supreme Court and military, is pledged to support and defend slavery. This suggests that the South has influenced the federal government to protect slavery, which was a major issue in the mid-19th century leading up to the Civil War.\n\nD. The success of abolitionists to sway majority public opinion\n\nDouglass was himself an abolitionist, and he mentions \"humble men in obscure places\" preaching against slavery. However, his tone suggests that their message is being suppressed by the powerful institutions supporting slavery. So, it doesn't seem like abolitionists have swayed the majority public opinion based on this excerpt; otherwise, Douglass might have portrayed a different situation.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C seems to be the most accurate choice. Douglass is highlighting how the South has influenced the federal government to defend slavery, which was a critical development in the mid-19th century and a key factor leading to the Civil War.\n\nTo confirm, let's think about the historical context. In the mid-19th century, the debate over slavery was intensifying. The South was heavily invested in slavery as an economic system, and they sought to protect it not just at the state level but also at the federal level. This included influencing federal policies, such as the Fugitive Slave Act, which required the return of escaped slaves, and the Dred Scott decision, which ruled that slaves were not citizens and had no right to sue in federal courts.\n\nThese examples show that the South was indeed influencing the federal government to defend slavery, which aligns perfectly with what Douglass is describing in his excerpt.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Southern influence upon the federal government to defend the institution of slavery.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
