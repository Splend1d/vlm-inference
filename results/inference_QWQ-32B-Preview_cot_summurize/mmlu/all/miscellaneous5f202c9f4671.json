So, the correct answer is C. 0.75.\n\nAlternatively, you can think of it in terms of money. A quarter is worth 25 cents, and since there are four quarters in a dollar, each quarter is 1/4 of a dollar. So, 3 quarters would be 75 cents, which is 0.75 of a dollar.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to convert the fraction to a percentage first. Since 3/4 is equal to 75%, and percentages are out of 100, you can write 75% as 75/100, which simplifies to 0.75.\n\nSo, no matter which method you use, the answer is 0.75, which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
