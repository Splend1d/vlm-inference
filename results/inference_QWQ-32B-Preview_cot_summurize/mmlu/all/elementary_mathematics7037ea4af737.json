                    "text": "So I've got this problem here: find 3 over 4 minus 1 over 8. And there are some options provided: A. 21 over 32, B. 1, C. 5 over 8, and D. 11 over 16. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"3 over 4 minus 1 over 8\" means. It's a subtraction of two fractions: 3/4 - 1/8. To subtract fractions, they need to have the same denominator. So, I'll need to find a common denominator for 4 and 8.\n\nI know that 8 is a multiple of 4, so the least common denominator (LCD) should be 8. Now, I need to convert 3/4 to a fraction with a denominator of 8. To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator of 3/4 by 2, which gives me 6/8.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes 6/8 - 1/8. Since the denominators are the same, I can just subtract the numerators: 6 - 1 = 5. Therefore, 6/8 - 1/8 = 5/8.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 5 over 8, which matches my answer. But I should double-check if there's another way to approach this or if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, I could find the difference directly without finding the LCD. Starting with 3/4 - 1/8, I can keep the denominators as they are and subtract the fractions directly, but I remember that's not how subtraction of fractions works. I need a common denominator to subtract them properly.\n\nAnother way is to express both fractions with the LCD, which I already did, or to use the formula for subtracting fractions: (a/b - c/d) = (ad - bc)/bd. Let's try that.\n\nSo, a = 3, b = 4, c = 1, d = 8.\n\nPlugging into the formula: (3*8 - 1*4)/(4*8) = (24 - 4)/32 = 20/32.\n\nWait, 20/32 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4, which gives 5/8. So, again, I get 5/8.\n\nThis matches my previous result and option C. But just to be thorough, let's see if any of the other options could make sense.\n\nOption A is 21/32. How would I get that? Maybe if I misapplied the formula or made a calculation error.\n\nLet me see: if I mistakenly added instead of subtracting, 3/4 + 1/8. Using the LCD of 8, 3/4 is 6/8, plus 1/8 is 7/8, which is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, if I mistakenly multiplied instead of subtracting, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption B is 1. That would only be correct if 3/4 - 1/8 equals 1, which doesn't seem right because 3/4 is 0.75 and 1/8 is 0.125, so 0.75 - 0.125 is 0.625, which is 5/8, not 1.\n\nOption D is 11/16. Let's see, if I incorrectly chose 16 as the LCD instead of 8, then convert 3/4 to 12/16 and 1/8 to 2/16, then 12/16 - 2/16 = 10/16, which simplifies to 5/8, not 11/16.\n\nSo, unless there's a mistake in my calculations, it seems like option C, 5/8, is the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if 5/8 can be expressed in another way to match one of the other options. 5/8 is equal to 10/16, which is not among the options. 20/32 is equivalent to 5/8, which matches option A, 21/32, but that's not the same.\n\nWait, perhaps someone made a mistake in simplifying fractions. But 20/32 simplifies to 5/8, not 21/32.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation of the problem, like mixing up the numerators or denominators.\n\nBut based on the straightforward approach, I think C, 5/8, is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
