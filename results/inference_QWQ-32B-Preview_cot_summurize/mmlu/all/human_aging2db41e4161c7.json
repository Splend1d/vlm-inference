The options are married couples, single men, single women, and older adults.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what makes retirement financially challenging. Retirement typically means a decrease in income, relying on savings, pensions, or social security. Expenses might change too; some go down, like commuting costs, but others might go up, like healthcare.\n\nNow, considering the options:\n\nA. Married couples: They might have dual incomes during their working years, so their savings could be higher. But they also have two people to support in retirement, which could double some expenses. However, they might also have economies of scale in housing and other areas.\n\nB. Single men: They might have only one income history, which could mean less savings. Additionally, men generally have shorter lifespans than women, but I'm not sure if that affects financial adjustments.\n\nC. Single women: Women often live longer than men, which means their retirement savings need to last longer. They might also have lower lifetime earnings due to various factors, leading to smaller savings.\n\nD. Older adults: This is a bit broad since older adults can be married or single, men or women. But generally, older adults might have more health issues, which could increase expenses.\n\nHmm, considering these points, I think single women might have the most difficulty adjusting financially to retirement. They likely have lower lifetime earnings and need their savings to last longer due to longer lifespans.\n\nBut let me check if there's any specific data or studies on this. I recall that women tend to save less for retirement and live longer, which could make financial adjustments more challenging for them.\n\nAlso, single individuals, whether men or women, might not have the benefit of shared resources that married couples enjoy. So, single women might be at a double disadvantage\u2014lower savings and longer life expectancy.\n\nMarried couples might fare better because they can combine resources, but they also have to plan for both partners' retirements.\n\nOlder adults is a broad category, but if they are part of a married couple, they might have more resources.\n\nSingle men might have higher earnings than single women, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nOverall, I think single women face the most difficulty in financial adjustments to retirement.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Single women.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
