                    "text": "Let's see what this question is asking. It says, \"In comparison to an Oldowan tool, a hand axe ____________.\" And then there are four options:\n\nA. is made out of stone, wood, or bone.\n\nB. needs constant cleaning and maintenance.\n\nC. requires metal and a source of heat to be forged.\n\nD. requires many more flakes to be removed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Oldowan tools and hand axes are. Oldowan tools are some of the earliest stone tools, dating back to about 2.6 million years ago. They are simple stone tools, often just cores with flakes removed to create a sharp edge. Hand axes, on the other hand, come from a later period, around the Acheulean industry, which started about 1.7 million years ago.\n\nSo, hand axes are more advanced than Oldowan tools. They are typically larger, more symmetrical, and have a more standardized shape, often resembling a teardrop or oval.\n\nOption A says, \"is made out of stone, wood, or bone.\" Oldowan tools are primarily made of stone, so are hand axes. But hand axes are also mainly stone tools, not wood or bone. So, this option seems a bit off because both are primarily stone tools, but hand axes might not necessarily include wood or bone.\n\nOption B says, \"needs constant cleaning and maintenance.\" I don't recall specific information about maintenance requirements for these tools. Stone tools, in general, might require occasional retouching of edges, but I don't think either type needs constant cleaning and maintenance. So, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption C says, \"requires metal and a source of heat to be forged.\" This is interesting because Oldowan tools and hand axes are both stone tools, and stone tools are made by knapping or shaping stone, not by using metal or heat. Metalworking comes much later in human history. So, this option doesn't make sense for either tool type.\n\nOption D says, \"requires many more flakes to be removed.\" This seems plausible because hand axes are more complex than Oldowan tools. Oldowan tools are simple, with just a few flakes removed to create a basic cutting edge, whereas hand axes require more careful shaping and removal of multiple flakes to achieve their characteristic shape.\n\nSo, comparing the two, hand axes would indeed require many more flakes to be removed than Oldowan tools.\n\nLet me double-check. Oldowan tools are rudimentary, often unifacial (flaked on one side only), and not very standardized. Hand axes are bifacial (flaked on both sides), more symmetrical, and have a more standardized shape, which would require more flaking and skill to produce.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
