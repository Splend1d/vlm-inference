Eyestrain from screens is a common issue, especially with how much time people spend in front of computers nowadays.\n\nOption A suggests using eye drops regularly. Eye drops can certainly help with dry eyes, which is a symptom that can accompany eyestrain. However, I'm not sure if this directly addresses the root cause of eyestrain. Maybe it's part of the solution, but perhaps not the best primary prevention method.\n\nOption B is about changing the choice of software programs. I'm not really seeing the connection here. As far as I know, the specific software you use shouldn't directly impact eyestrain, unless maybe some programs have features that are easier on the eyes. But that seems pretty vague. I don't think this is the right answer.\n\nOption C suggests limiting the resolution on the monitor. Hmm, resolution affects the clarity of the image on the screen. Higher resolution generally means clearer, sharper images. I would think that clearer images might be easier on the eyes, actually. So limiting resolution might make the image less clear, which could potentially lead to more eyestrain as the eyes try to interpret blurry text or images. So this seems counterintuitive for preventing eyestrain.\n\nOption D is about taking periodic breaks to view natural lighting. I've heard of the 20-20-20 rule, which suggests that every 20 minutes, you should look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This is supposed to help reduce eyestrain by giving your eyes a break from focusing on the screen. Viewing natural lighting could be a part of that, as it might help regulate your circadian rhythms and reduce eye fatigue over time. This seems like a solid preventative measure.\n\nLet me consider all options again. Eye drops can help with dryness, which is related to eyestrain, but maybe not the primary cause. Changing software doesn't seem relevant. Limiting resolution seems like it could worsen eyestrain. Taking breaks to view natural lighting aligns with established guidelines for preventing eyestrain.\n\nI think the best answer is D. Take periodic breaks to view natural lighting.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
