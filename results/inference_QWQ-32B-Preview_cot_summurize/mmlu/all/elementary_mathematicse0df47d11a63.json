                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem: simplify \\(-4 + 7 \\cdot 3^2\\). I've got multiple options here: use a calculator, grab some paper and pencil, or try to do it mentally. I think I'll attempt it mentally first and then check with a calculator if I'm unsure.\n\nOkay, so the expression is \\(-4 + 7 \\cdot 3^2\\). I remember that when simplifying expressions, I need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction).\n\nLooking at the expression, there are no parentheses, so I start with exponents. There's an exponent here: \\(3^2\\). That's 9. So, the expression now becomes \\(-4 + 7 \\cdot 9\\).\n\nNext, I handle multiplication and division from left to right. There's a multiplication here: \\(7 \\cdot 9\\), which is 63. Now, the expression is \\(-4 + 63\\).\n\nFinally, I perform addition and subtraction from left to right. So, \\(-4 + 63\\) is the same as 63 - 4, which equals 59.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 437\n\nB. 27\n\nC. 289\n\nD. 59\n\nIt seems like option D, 59, is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should use a calculator to verify.\n\nOkay, typing \\(-4 + 7 \\cdot 3^2\\) into the calculator. First, I enter 3 ^ 2, which is 9. Then, 7 * 9 is 63. Finally, -4 + 63 is indeed 59. So, that matches my mental calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the expression. Maybe if I misapplied the order of operations, I could get a different result.\n\nSuppose I added -4 and 7 first, getting 3, and then multiplied by 9 (since \\(3^2 = 9\\)). That would give me 27, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because multiplication and division should be done before addition and subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, if I multiplied 7 by 3 first, getting 21, and then squared that, which is 441, and then added -4, getting 437, which is option A. But that's wrong because exponents are applied before multiplication unless there are parentheses.\n\nWait, in the original expression, it's 7 multiplied by 3 squared, which is 7 times 9, not (7 times 3) squared. So, no, option A is incorrect.\n\nAnother mistaken approach could be to square 3 first, getting 9, then multiply by 7 to get 63, and then add -4, which is 59, matching my initial answer.\n\nAlternatively, if someone squared 3 to get 9, then multiplied by 7 to get 63, and then added 4 instead of subtracting, they might get 67, but that's not one of the options.\n\nOption C, 289, seems way off. Maybe if someone squared 17 or something, but that's not relevant here.\n\nSo, indeed, the correct answer is 59, which is option D.\n\nIt's important to remember the order of operations to avoid mistakes in simplifying expressions like this. PEMDAS is a helpful mnemonic, but it's crucial to understand that multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.\n\nIn summary, the expression \\(-4 + 7 \\cdot 3^2\\) simplifies to 59 when following the correct order of operations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{59} \\]"
