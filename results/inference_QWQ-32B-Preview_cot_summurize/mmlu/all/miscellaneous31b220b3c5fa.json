Let me just make sure about the other options to be completely sure.\n\nA hedonist is someone who believes that pleasure is the most important goal in life, so that doesn't relate to belief in God.\n\nA deist believes in a higher power or a creator but doesn't necessarily believe in traditional religious doctrines or a personal God.\n\nAn agnostic is someone who believes that the existence of God is unknown or unknowable; they're not sure if God exists or not.\n\nSo, compared to these options, an atheist is the one who explicitly does not believe in God's existence. Therefore, D. atheist is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
