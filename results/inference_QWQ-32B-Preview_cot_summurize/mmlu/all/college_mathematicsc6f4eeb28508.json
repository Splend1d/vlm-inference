                    "text": "Let's tackle this system of linear equations. We have four equations with four variables: w, x, y, and z. The equations are:\n\n1. \\( w + 3x + 2y + 2z = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( w + 4x + y = 0 \\)\n\n3. \\( 3w + 5x + 10y + 14z = 0 \\)\n\n4. \\( 2w + 5x + 5y + 6z = 0 \\)\n\nWe need to determine which of the given statements is false. The statements are:\n\nA. The system is consistent.\n\nB. The system has infinitely many solutions.\n\nC. The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\n\nD. Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nFirst, let's understand what these statements mean.\n\n- **Statement A**: A system is consistent if it has at least one solution. Since it's a homogeneous system (all equations equal zero), the trivial solution (0,0,0,0) is always a solution. So, the system is consistent. Therefore, statement A is true.\n\n- **Statement B**: For a homogeneous system, if there are free variables, the system has infinitely many solutions. We need to check if there are free variables by reducing the system to row echelon form.\n\n- **Statement C**: In a linear system, the sum of any two solutions is also a solution. This is a property of linear systems, especially homogeneous ones. So, statement C is true.\n\n- **Statement D**: This suggests that the solution set is spanned by a single vector (-5, 1, 1, 0), meaning the solution space is one-dimensional. We need to verify if this is the case.\n\nTo proceed, let's write the system in matrix form and row reduce it to find the solution space.\n\nThe augmented matrix for the system is:\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 4 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nWe'll perform row operations to get this into row echelon form.\n\nFirst, subtract row 1 from row 2:\n\n\\[\nR2 = R2 - R1 \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n3 & 5 & 10 & 14 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nNext, subtract 3 times row 1 from row 3:\n\n\\[\nR3 = R3 - 3R1 \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThen, subtract 2 times row 1 from row 4:\n\n\\[\nR4 = R4 - 2R1 \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 4 & 8 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nNow, add 4 times row 2 to row 3:\n\n\\[\nR3 = R3 + 4R2 \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 2 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nThen, add row 2 to row 4:\n\n\\[\nR4 = R4 + R2 \\rightarrow \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc|c}\n1 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & -2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\nNow, the matrix is in row echelon form. We have two leading variables (w and x) and two free variables (y and z).\n\nFrom the reduced matrix, the system of equations is:\n\n1. \\( w + 3x + 2y + 2z = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( x - y - 2z = 0 \\)\n\nLet's express w and x in terms of y and z.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n\\( x = y + 2z \\)\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n\\( w + 3(y + 2z) + 2y + 2z = 0 \\)\n\n\\( w + 3y + 6z + 2y + 2z = 0 \\)\n\n\\( w + 5y + 8z = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( w = -5y - 8z \\)\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\n\\[\n(w, x, y, z) = (-5y - 8z, y + 2z, y, z)\n\\]\n\nWe can express this as a linear combination of two vectors:\n\n\\[\ny(-5, 1, 1, 0) + z(-8, 2, 0, 1)\n\\]\n\nThis shows that the solution space is spanned by the vectors (-5, 1, 1, 0) and (-8, 2, 0, 1), meaning the solution space is two-dimensional.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the statements again with this information.\n\n- **Statement A**: The system is consistent. As established earlier, this is true.\n\n- **Statement B**: The system has infinitely many solutions. Since there are free variables (y and z), this is true.\n\n- **Statement C**: The sum of any two solutions is a solution. This is true for linear homogeneous systems.\n\n- **Statement D**: Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). However, from the general solution, we see that solutions are linear combinations of two vectors, not just scalar multiples of one vector. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nThus, the false statement is statement D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
