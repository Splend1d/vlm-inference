Maybe in France, they have a different nickname, but I don't know for sure. I should probably look it up to make sure.\n\nWait, I remember something about the term \"bobby\" coming from Sir Robert Peel, who was instrumental in establishing the modern police force in the UK. That's probably why they're called \"bobbies\" there. So, England makes sense.\n\nLet me consider the other options quickly. Israel has its own police force, but I don't know if they have a specific nickname for their officers. Same with Greece. France has the CRS and other police units, but I don't think \"bobby\" is used there.\n\nSo, based on what I know, I'll go with C. England.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
