                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a particle moving in a circle. The radius is 10 meters, and at a certain point, the particle's speed is 10 meters per second and it's increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared. I need to find the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors at that instant.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what velocity and acceleration mean for an object moving in a circle. For circular motion, there are two components of acceleration: centripetal acceleration, which is always directed towards the center of the circle and is responsible for the change in direction of the velocity vector, and tangential acceleration, which is parallel to the velocity vector and is responsible for any change in the speed of the particle.\n\nGiven that the particle's speed is increasing, there must be a tangential acceleration component in addition to the centripetal acceleration.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Radius of the circle, r = 10 meters\n\n- Speed, v = 10 m/s\n\n- Rate of increase of speed, which I think is the tangential acceleration, a_t = 10 m/s\u00b2\n\nI need to find the angle between the velocity vector (v) and the acceleration vector (a).\n\nFirst, I should find the centripetal acceleration (a_c). The formula for centripetal acceleration is:\n\na_c = v\u00b2 / r\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na_c = (10 m/s)\u00b2 / 10 m = 100 m\u00b2/s\u00b2 / 10 m = 10 m/s\u00b2\n\nSo, a_c = 10 m/s\u00b2\n\nNow, the total acceleration vector a is the vector sum of the centripetal acceleration a_c and the tangential acceleration a_t.\n\nSince a_c is directed towards the center of the circle and a_t is tangent to the circle, they are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, the angle between them is 90 degrees.\n\nGiven that, I can represent a_c and a_t as perpendicular vectors, and the total acceleration a is the resultant vector of these two.\n\nTo find the angle between the velocity vector v and the acceleration vector a, I can use the dot product formula.\n\nFirst, let's consider the directions:\n\n- Velocity vector v is tangent to the circle.\n\n- Centripetal acceleration a_c is directed towards the center, perpendicular to v.\n\n- Tangential acceleration a_t is parallel to v.\n\nWait a minute, actually, tangential acceleration a_t is parallel or antiparallel to v, depending on whether the speed is increasing or decreasing. Since the speed is increasing, a_t is in the same direction as v.\n\nSo, a_t is parallel to v, and a_c is perpendicular to v.\n\nTherefore, the acceleration vector a is the vector sum of a_c (perpendicular to v) and a_t (parallel to v).\n\nNow, to find the angle between v and a, I can use vector components.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where v is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, v = v i + 0 j = 10 i m/s\n\na_t = a_t i + 0 j = 10 i m/s\u00b2\n\na_c = 0 i - a_c j = 0 i - 10 j m/s\u00b2\n\nTherefore, the total acceleration a = a_t i + a_c j = 10 i - 10 j m/s\u00b2\n\nNow, the angle \u03b8 between v and a can be found using the dot product formula:\n\nv \u00b7 a = |v| |a| cos \u03b8\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 = (v \u00b7 a) / (|v| |a|)\n\nFirst, compute v \u00b7 a:\n\nv \u00b7 a = (10 i + 0 j) \u00b7 (10 i - 10 j) = 10*10 + 0*(-10) = 100 + 0 = 100\n\nNow, |v| = sqrt(10\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = 10 m/s\n\n|a| = sqrt(10\u00b2 + (-10)\u00b2) = sqrt(100 + 100) = sqrt(200) = 10*sqrt(2) m/s\u00b2\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = 100 / (10 * 10*sqrt(2)) = 100 / (100*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)/2\n\nSo, \u03b8 = 45 degrees\n\nWait, but the problem says the speed is increasing at a rate of 10 m/s\u00b2, which I took as a_t = 10 m/s\u00b2. Is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check the problem statement: \"the particle\u2019s speed is 10 meters per second and is increasing at a rate of 10 meters per second squared.\"\n\nYes, that sounds like tangential acceleration a_t = 10 m/s\u00b2.\n\nAnd centripetal acceleration a_c = v\u00b2/r = 10\u00b2/10 = 10 m/s\u00b2, as I calculated.\n\nSo, the total acceleration a = a_t + a_c, where a_t is parallel to v and a_c is perpendicular to v.\n\nTherefore, the angle between v and a is indeed 45 degrees, as I calculated.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there any other way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, since a_t is parallel to v and a_c is perpendicular to v, the acceleration vector a forms a right triangle with a_t and a_c as the legs.\n\nTherefore, the angle between v and a is the angle between the base and the hypotenuse of that right triangle.\n\nIn that case, tan \u03b8 = a_c / a_t = 10 / 10 = 1\n\nSo, \u03b8 = arctan(1) = 45 degrees\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is 45 degrees.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 45\u00b0\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{45^\\circ} \\]"
