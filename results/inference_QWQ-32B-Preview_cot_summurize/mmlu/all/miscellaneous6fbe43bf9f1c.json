The question is: \"The American patriot Paul Revere was named for his father whose original name was what?\" And the options are:\n\nA. John Paul Revere\n\nB. Paul Silver\n\nC. Apollos Rivoire\n\nD. Paolo Reverini\n\nOkay, so I know that Paul Revere was a silversmith and a Patriot in the American Revolution. He's famous for his midnight ride to warn the colonial militia about the approaching British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord.\n\nNow, the question is about his father's original name. So, I need to find out who his father was and what his original name was.\n\nFirst, I recall that Paul Revere's father was also named Paul Revere. But I think his father had a different original name because he was French. I think his father's name was Apollos Rivoire.\n\nLet me check that. Paul Revere's father was Apollos Rivoire, who was a Huguenot silversmith from France. He anglicized his name to Paul Revere after coming to the American colonies.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the answer should be C. Apollos Rivoire.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's look at the other options.\n\nOption A is John Paul Revere. I don't think that was his father's name. His father was Apollos Rivoire, not John Paul Revere.\n\nOption B is Paul Silver. That doesn't sound right. Paul Revere was a silversmith, but his father's name wasn't Paul Silver.\n\nOption D is Paolo Reverini. That sounds Italian, but Paul Revere's father was French, not Italian.\n\nSo, based on this, C. Apollos Rivoire seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, I think there might be a slight confusion here. Paul Revere's father was Apollos Rivoire, but the question is asking for his original name. Apollos Rivoire might already be the anglicized name. Let me verify that.\n\nUpon checking, Apollos Rivoire was indeed his father's name, and he was from France. So, his original name was likely in French, perhaps something like Apollos Rivoire or similar.\n\nBut I think Apollos is a Greek name, not French, so maybe it was anglicized from something else.\n\nWait, perhaps his original name was something like Paul Rivoire, and he changed it to Paul Revere.\n\nActually, I recall that Apollos Rivoire anglicized his name to Paul Revere. So, his original name was Apollos Rivoire.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. Apollos Rivoire.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me confirm this information.\n\nPaul Revere was born in Boston in 1735 to Apollos Rivoire and Deborah Hichborn. His father, Apollos Rivoire, was a Huguenot who immigrated to the colonies from France. He was a silversmith by trade, and Paul Revere followed in his footsteps.\n\nSo, yes, Apollos Rivoire was his father's name.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Apollos Rivoire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
