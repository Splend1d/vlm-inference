                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about standardized residuals from a GARCH model. I need to evaluate each statement and determine which ones are true.\n\nFirst, what is a GARCH model? It stands for Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity. It's used in time series analysis, especially in finance, to model volatility clustering in data. So, it's all about modeling how the variance of the errors changes over time.\n\nNow, standardized residuals are the residuals from the model divided by their conditional standard deviations. Essentially, they're the residuals scaled by their own volatility estimates.\n\nLet's look at statement (i): \"They are assumed to be normally distributed.\" In many GARCH models, especially the basic ones, it is common to assume that the standardized residuals follow a normal distribution. However, in practice, financial returns often exhibit fat tails, meaning that extreme values are more likely than a normal distribution would predict. So, while the assumption is often made, it may not always hold in reality. But for the sake of this question, I think the statement is generally true in the context of model assumptions.\n\nStatement (ii): \"Their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate.\" This seems a bit tricky. In a GARCH model, the conditional variance (which is the square of the conditional standard deviation) is modeled as a function of its own lags and the lags of squared residuals. So, if the GARCH model is appropriate, the squared standardized residuals should be approximately white noise, meaning no autocorrelation. Wait, but the GARCH model captures the autocorrelation in the squared residuals of the original model. So, after modeling with GARCH, the standardized residuals should be uncorrelated, and their squares should also be uncorrelated. Therefore, if the GARCH model is appropriate, there shouldn't be any relationship between the squares of the standardized residuals and their lagged squared values. So, this statement seems false.\n\nStatement (iii): \"In practice, they are likely to have fat tails.\" As I mentioned earlier, financial data often exhibit fat tails, meaning higher kurtosis than a normal distribution. Even after modeling with GARCH to account for changing volatility, the standardized residuals might still have heavier tails than a normal distribution. So, this statement seems true.\n\nStatement (iv): \"If the GARCH model is adequate, the standardized residuals and the raw residuals will be identical.\" Raw residuals are just the differences between observed and predicted values, without any scaling. Standardized residuals are these differences divided by their conditional standard deviations. So, for the standardized residuals to be identical to the raw residuals, the conditional standard deviations would have to be constant and equal to 1. But in a GARCH model, the whole point is that the conditional variances are time-varying. Therefore, unless the GARCH model is degenerate and implies constant volatility, the standardized residuals won't be identical to the raw residuals. So, this statement is false.\n\nSummarizing:\n\n- (i) True\n\n- (ii) False\n\n- (iii) True\n\n- (iv) False\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\nWait a minute, but in my analysis, statement (ii) seems false, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me double-check.\n\nIn a GARCH model, the conditional variance equation is something like:\n\nh_t = w + a * e_{t-1}^2 + b * h_{t-1}\n\nWhere h_t is the conditional variance at time t, e_t is the residual, and w, a, b are parameters.\n\nAfter estimating the GARCH model, the standardized residuals are e_t / sqrt(h_t), and these should be approximately i.i.d., meaning no autocorrelation in their squares if the model is correctly specified.\n\nSo, if the GARCH model is appropriate, there shouldn't be any relationship between the squares of the standardized residuals and their lagged squared values. Therefore, statement (ii) is incorrect.\n\nHence, the answer should be B. (i) and (iii) only.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
