                    "text": "According to Hindu tradition, the current age is the Kali Yuga. So, the correct answer is A. Kali Yuga.\n\nTo provide some context, Hindu cosmology divides time into four ages or yugas: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga. These yugas are part of a larger cycle called a Mahayuga, which consists of all four yugas in sequence.\n\n- **Satya Yuga** (also known as Krita Yuga): This is the first and most golden age, where humanity is governed by gods and people live piously and have long lifespans.\n\n- **Treta Yuga**: In this age, some imperfections begin to appear in human society. It's known for the great epic, the Ramayana, which is set in this period.\n\n- **Dvapara Yuga**: This age sees further decline in human virtues and the rise of conflicts and wars. The Mahabharata, another major Hindu epic, is set in this yuga.\n\n- **Kali Yuga**: This is the age of darkness and decadence, where moral values are at their lowest. It is believed to be the current age we are in, according to Hindu tradition.\n\nEach yuga has a specific duration, with Kali Yuga being the shortest. The transition between yugas is marked by various cosmic and societal changes.\n\nSo, in summary, the correct answer is A. Kali Yuga."
