                    "text": "So I've got this question here that's referring to two sources: one is the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia from 1819, and the other is the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil from 1824. The question is asking which option would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1 of Source 1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Article 1 of Source 1 says. Source 1 is the Fundamental Law from Gran Colombia, and Article 1 states: \"The Republics of Venezuela and New Granada are from this day on united in a single one under the glorious title of Republic of Colombia\u2026\"\n\nSo, the expectation here is that Venezuela and New Granada are uniting into one republic called Colombia. The idea is that these two republics are coming together to form a single nation.\n\nNow, the question is asking which option would most undermine this expectation. Let's look at each choice:\n\nA. Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries.\n\nHmm, external intervention could certainly cause problems for newly independent states, but in this context, it's about the unity of Venezuela and New Granada. So, while external interference might destabilize the region, it's not directly undermining the unity of these two specific republics unless specified.\n\nB. Nationalism in Latin America pressing for stronger unity between the former Spanish colonies of South America.\n\nThis seems counter to undermining the unity. If nationalism is pushing for stronger unity, that would support the formation of Gran Colombia, right? So, this might actually reinforce the expectations expressed in Article 1.\n\nC. Slave rebellions fragmenting newly independent Latin American states.\n\nSlave rebellions could certainly cause internal strife and fragmentation within a country, but again, it's not directly targeted at the unity between Venezuela and New Granada. It could affect the stability of the individual republics, but not necessarily their union.\n\nD. Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states.\n\nThis is interesting. Sectionalism refers to loyalties to one's own region over the nation as a whole. If elites in different territories are more loyal to their own regions, that could undermine the unity of a larger nation like Gran Colombia.\n\nConsidering that, option D seems like it would most undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1, which is the unity of Venezuela and New Granada into one republic.\n\nLet me think about this a bit more. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nOption A: External intervention could potentially undermine the new nation by causing conflicts or interfering in internal affairs, but again, it's not directly targeting the unity between Venezuela and New Granada.\n\nOption B: Stronger unity pushed by nationalism would likely support the formation of Gran Colombia.\n\nOption C: Slave rebellions could cause internal chaos, but unless they specifically target the union between Venezuela and New Granada, it might not directly undermine the expectations of Article 1.\n\nOption D: Elites in different territories being more attached to their own sections could lead to demands for autonomy or even secession, which would directly challenge the unity envisioned in Article 1.\n\nSo, I think D is the best answer here.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider the context of the time. In the early 19th century, after the independence movements in Latin America, there were indeed struggles between centralists and federalists. Some elites wanted a strong central government, while others wanted more power to reside in regional governments.\n\nIn the case of Gran Colombia, it eventually fell apart due to regional tensions and the desires of local elites for more autonomy. So, sectionalism among elites was a significant factor in undermining the unity of Gran Colombia.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Sectionalism of elites in the various territories of newly independent Latin American states.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
