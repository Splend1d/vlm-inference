                    "text": "So Jack picked 60 apples from an apple tree. Then he used 12 of them to make applesauce. So, the number of apples left after making applesauce would be the total apples minus the ones used for applesauce, right? That would be 60 minus 12.\n\nNow, he places these remaining apples equally into 6 gift baskets. So, to find out how many apples go into each basket, we need to divide the remaining apples by 6.\n\nSo, the equation should be (60 - 12) divided by 6 equals a, where a is the number of apples in each basket.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (60/6) - 12 = a\n\nB. (60 - 12)/6 = a\n\nC. (60 - 6) - 12 = a\n\nD. (60 + 12)/6 = a\n\nThe correct one is B, because it first subtracts the 12 apples used for applesauce from the total, and then divides the result by 6 to find the number of apples per basket.\n\nOption A divides the total apples by 6 and then subtracts 12, which doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nOption C subtracts 6 from the total and then subtracts 12, which doesn't relate to the problem.\n\nOption D adds 12 to the total and then divides by 6, which also doesn't fit the situation.\n\nSo, the correct equation is B: (60 - 12)/6 = a.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
