                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which statement isn't part of Gunnar Myrdal's theory of cumulative causation. First, I should probably recall what Myrdal's theory is all about.\n\nGunnar Myrdal was a Swedish economist who developed the theory of cumulative causation, which is a key concept in the core-periphery model. This theory basically suggests that there are self-reinforcing mechanisms that lead to the concentration of economic activity in certain regions, creating a core that becomes increasingly dominant over peripheral regions.\n\nSo, according to Myrdal, regions that start with some advantage tend to attract more resources, like labor, capital, and trade, which further enhances their development. This process continues in a cycle, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, unless interrupted by external factors.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade.\n\nHmm, this sounds contrary to Myrdal's theory. If the core is dominating and attracting more resources, it's unlikely that wealth is being shared similarly between developing and developed regions through trade. In fact, Myrdal's theory suggests that trade often benefits the core at the expense of the periphery.\n\nB. The core will always dominate the periphery.\n\nThis seems aligned with Myrdal's theory. The core-periphery model posits that the core has a dominant position over the periphery, and this dominance persists unless disrupted.\n\nC. Growth and prosperity of the core exists at the expense of the periphery.\n\nAgain, this fits with Myrdal's theory. The core benefits by exploiting resources and markets in the periphery, which hinders the periphery's own development.\n\nD. Regions with initial advantage keep and expand it as they attract labor, capital, and trade.\n\nThis is a direct reflection of the cumulative causation process that Myrdal described. Regions with an initial advantage reinforce that advantage by attracting more resources, leading to further growth and development.\n\nSo, considering these points, option A seems to be the statement that isn't part of Myrdal's theory. In fact, it contradicts the theory, which suggests that wealth is not shared equally but is skewed in favor of the core regions.\n\nTo double-check, let's think about it another way. Myrdal's theory is about how inequalities between regions are perpetuated and even exacerbated over time. So, the idea that developing and developed regions share similarly in wealth through trade doesn't align with this perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
