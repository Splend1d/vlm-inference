                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this professor who owns an apartment building and he wants to convey it to his son and daughter. First, he makes a deed saying he conveys it to them as tenants in common, and he reserves a life estate for himself. Then, he puts this deed in the family vault in the library.\n\nLater, the son marries a doctor, whom the professor doesn't like. So, the professor executes another deed, calling it a \"correction deed,\" conveying the same apartment building to his son and daughter, but this time as joint tenants with right of survivorship, again reserving a life estate for himself. Both children accept this new deed.\n\nThen, six months after that, the son dies intestate, leaving the doctor as his sole heir. Now, the question is: who has title to the apartment building?\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand the difference between tenants in common and joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nTenants in common means each owns a separate share, and upon death, their share passes according to their will or intestacy laws.\n\nJoint tenants with right of survivorship mean that when one dies, their share automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant(s).\n\nNow, the professor initially conveyed the property as tenants in common, but then he made a second conveyance as joint tenants with right of survivorship.\n\nI need to figure out which deed takes precedence.\n\nAlso, the professor reserved a life estate for himself in both deeds.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial deed: \"I convey my apartment building to my son and daughter as tenants in common,\" with a life estate reserved to himself.\n\nThen, the \"correction deed\" says: \"I convey my apartment building to my son and daughter as joint tenants with right of survivorship,\" again with a life estate reserved to himself.\n\nBoth deeds were executed by the professor and delivered to the children.\n\nNow, the question is whether the second deed overrides the first one.\n\nIn general, deeds are conveyances of interest in real property, and they need to be properly executed and delivered to be effective.\n\nHere, both deeds were properly executed and delivered to the grantees, who accepted them.\n\nSo, typically, the last deed prevails, assuming there's no issue with notice or recording.\n\nBut in this case, the first deed was placed in the family vault, which presumably isn't a public record.\n\nDeeds generally need to be recorded to provide notice to third parties, but since both grantees (the son and daughter) had possession of both deeds, they had notice of both.\n\nHowever, the second deed was labeled a \"correction deed,\" suggesting that it was intended to supersede the first deed.\n\nSo, it's likely that the second deed is the operative one, conveying the property as joint tenants with right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nNow, the son dies intestate, leaving the doctor as his sole heir.\n\nIf the property was held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, then upon the son's death, his interest should pass to the surviving joint tenant, which is the daughter.\n\nTherefore, the daughter would own the entire property, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nBut wait, the options include the doctor having some interest.\n\nOption A says the daughter and the doctor as tenants in common.\n\nOption B says just the daughter, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nOption C says daughter and doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nOption D says daughter and doctor as joint tenants with survivorship rights, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nGiven that the property was held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and the son died, his interest should pass to the daughter, not to his heir (the doctor).\n\nBut perhaps there's a twist here.\n\nMaybe the joint tenancy was severed by the son's marriage or something.\n\nWait, no. Joint tenancy with right of survivorship typically requires unity of time, title, interest, and possession.\n\nHere, both children received the second deed, so they both had the same interest as joint tenants.\n\nBut when the son died, his interest should pass to the daughter, unless there's some intervention.\n\nHowever, perhaps the professor's life estate complicates things.\n\nThe professor has a life estate, meaning he has a life interest in the property, and the remainder goes to the son and daughter as joint tenants.\n\nUpon the son's death, his remainder interest would pass to the daughter, assuming the joint tenancy with right of survivorship holds.\n\nTherefore, the daughter would own the remainder interest, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nBut the doctor is the son's heir; does she have any interest?\n\nIn joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the surviving joint tenant gets the entire interest, excluding the decedent's heirs.\n\nSo, in this case, the daughter should get the entire remainder interest, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the daughter, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nBut let's check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption A: daughter and doctor as tenants in common.\n\nThis would be the case if the joint tenancy was not effective, or if the son's interest passed to his heir rather than to the surviving joint tenant.\n\nBut based on standard joint tenancy rules, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C: daughter and doctor as tenants in common, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nSimilar to option A, but now subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nAgain, seems incorrect because the joint tenancy should pass the entire interest to the daughter.\n\nOption D: daughter and doctor as joint tenants with survivorship rights, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nThis would only be the case if the joint tenancy continued after the son's death, which typically it doesn't, because joint tenancy requires all joint tenants to be alive.\n\nUpon one joint tenant's death, the interest passes to the surviving joint tenants, extinguishing the deceased's interest.\n\nTherefore, option B seems correct: the daughter, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I need to consider the recording statutes or something.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, deeds need to be recorded to provide notice to third parties, but since both grantees had possession of both deeds, recording shouldn't be an issue here.\n\nAlso, since the second deed was intended to correct the first one, and both grantees accepted it, it's likely that the second deed is the operative one.\n\nTherefore, the property is held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nUpon the son's death, his interest passes to the daughter, making her the sole owner of the remainder interest, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\nHence, the answer should be B: the daughter, subject to the professor's life estate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
