                    "text": "Let's look at these two scenarios and think about them in terms of ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character wipes up water off the stage before the dancers perform. At first glance, this seems like a responsible and considerate action. Keeping the stage clean and safe for the performers is important to prevent accidents or slips that could harm the dancers or ruin their performance. So, this action appears to be morally positive or at least neutral.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character gives their children food once a week. This seems problematic. Providing adequate food is a basic responsibility of parents or guardians. Giving children food only once a week suggests that they might be going hungry for the rest of the days, which could lead to malnutrition, health issues, and other problems. This approach to feeding children is likely to be considered neglectful and morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US.\n\nSo, considering these analyses:\n\n- Scenario 1: Not wrong\n\n- Scenario 2: Wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct choice would be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, let's double-check to make sure.\n\nIn Scenario 1, wiping up water before a performance is a proactive and safety-conscious action. It's hard to see how this could be considered morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, providing food only once a week to children is inadequate and likely to cause harm. This is generally considered negligent and morally wrong.\n\nThus, the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
