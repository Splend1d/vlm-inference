                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about plant embryogenesis. I need to identify which statement is incorrect among the options provided. Let's review each option step by step.\n\nOption A: \"The suspensor is derived from the basal cell.\"\n\nIn plant embryogenesis, the zygote divides to form an apical cell and a basal cell. The basal cell typically gives rise to the suspensor, which plays a role in anchoring the embryo and facilitating nutrient transfer. So, this statement seems correct.\n\nOption B: \"Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell.\"\n\nThe apical cell, derived from the zygote, usually gives rise to the shoot apical meristem and the cotyledons in dicotyledonous plants. Cotyledons are embryonic leaves, and their development from the apical cell is a standard part of plant embryogenesis. Therefore, this statement also appears to be correct.\n\nOption C: \"Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.\"\n\nThis one seems a bit off. In plant development, the shoot apical meristem is formed during embryogenesis, not after seed formation. The meristem is crucial for the post-germination growth of the plant, but its formation precedes seed maturation. So, this might be the incorrect statement.\n\nOption D: \"Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis.\"\n\nPlant tissue systems include the dermal tissue, ground tissue, and vascular tissue.
