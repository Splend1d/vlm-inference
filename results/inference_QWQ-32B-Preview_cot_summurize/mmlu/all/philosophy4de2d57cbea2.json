                    "text": "I'm going to take a stab at this question about Cicero's view on human nature. So, Cicero was an ancient Roman philosopher and statesman who wrote a lot about ethics and philosophy, drawing from Greek thinkers like Aristotle and Plato.\n\nThe question is: In Cicero\u2019s view, each person is invested by Nature with two characters:\n\nA. universal and individual.\n\nB. virtuous and vicious.\n\nC. good and evil.\n\nD. divine and beastly.\n\nHmm, I need to recall what Cicero believed about human nature. I think he saw humans as having both a rational and irrational part, which might relate to some of these options.\n\nOption A says \"universal and individual.\" That sounds plausible because Cicero, being a Stoic-influenced thinker, might have viewed people as having both a unique, individual character and a universal human nature that connects us all.\n\nOption B says \"virtuous and vicious.\" Well, Cicero was certainly interested in virtue and vice, but I'm not sure if he specifically said that nature invests us with these two characters.\n\nOption C says \"good and evil.\" Again, these are concepts Cicero would have dealt with, but I don't recall him stating that nature gives us both good and evil characters.\n\nOption D says \"divine and beastly.\" This reminds me of the idea that humans have a higher, rational part (divine) and a lower, irrational part (beastly). That seems similar to Plato's division of the soul.\n\nLet me think more carefully. Cicero was a proponent of Stoicism, which emphasizes reason and the development of virtue. Stoics believe that humans have a rational soul that can align with universal reason, which they call logos.\n\nIn Stoic philosophy, there is an idea that humans possess a rational faculty that connects us to the divine or the cosmic intelligence. At the same time, we also have irrational passions and desires that can lead us astray.\n\nSo, in that context, \"divine and beastly\" seems like a possible characterization. The divine part is our rational soul, and the beastly part is our irrational desires and passions.\n\nOption A, \"universal and individual,\" also makes sense because Stoics believe in a universal human nature and individual differences. However, I'm not sure if Cicero specifically paired these two as characters invested by nature.\n\nOption B, \"virtuous and vicious,\" is something Cicero would have discussed, as he wrote extensively about virtues and vices. But again, I don't recall him stating that nature invests us with both.\n\nOption C, \"good and evil,\" is similar to B, and again, it's a concept he would have engaged with, but I'm not sure if he framed it exactly like this.\n\nGiven that, I think option D, \"divine and beastly,\" might be the best answer. It aligns with the Stoic dichotomy of control, where we have the rational part that can be in harmony with the universe and the irrational part that causes us trouble.\n\nMoreover, Cicero wrote about the concept of the \"divine spark\" within humans, which refers to our rational nature. So, pairing that with a \"beastly\" aspect makes sense.\n\nLet me see if I can find some support for this. In Cicero's \"On the Nature of the Gods,\" he discusses the divine aspect of human nature. Also, in his writings on ethics, he contrasts the rational soul with irrational desires.\n\nAdditionally, in \"De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum,\" Cicero explores different philosophical schools' views on what constitutes the good life, and he often contrasts rationality with irrationality.\n\nTherefore, it seems that Cicero did view humans as having both a divine, rational part and a beastly, irrational part.\n\nComparatively, option A, \"universal and individual,\" while true in a broader sense, might not be the specific pairing Cicero used.\n\nOptions B and C are more about moral evaluations, whereas option D gets at the fundamental duality of human nature that Cicero likely endorsed.\n\nHence, I believe the correct answer is D. divine and beastly.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
