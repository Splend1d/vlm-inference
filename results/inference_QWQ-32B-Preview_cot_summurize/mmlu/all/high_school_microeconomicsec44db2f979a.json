                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which option indicates that two goods are complements. First, I should remember what complements mean in economics. Complementary goods are those that are used together, so an increase in the demand for one good leads to an increase in the demand for the other. For example, cars and gasoline are complements because if more people buy cars, they'll need more gasoline.\n\nNow, let's look at each option:\n\nA. A positive income elasticity.\n\nIncome elasticity measures how the demand for a good responds to a change in income. If it's positive, that means that as income increases, demand for the good increases. This tells us about the good's relationship with income, not with another good. So, this doesn't directly indicate that two goods are complements.\n\nB. A horizontal demand curve.\n\nA horizontal demand curve suggests that the quantity demanded is infinitely responsive to price changes. This is typically associated with perfect competition, where many sellers offer identical products. Again, this doesn't tell us about the relationship between two goods.\n\nC. A negative cross-price elasticity.\n\nCross-price elasticity measures how the demand for one good responds to a change in the price of another good. If the cross-price elasticity is negative, that means that when the price of one good increases, the demand for the other good decreases. This is characteristic of complementary goods. For example, if the price of cars increases, fewer people will buy cars, and consequently, demand for gasoline will decrease.\n\nD. A demand elasticity greater than one.\n\nThis refers to the price elasticity of demand for a single good. If it's greater than one, demand is considered elastic, meaning that a small change in price leads to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded. This tells us about how sensitive the demand for one good is to its own price, not about its relationship with another good.\n\nSo, based on this, option C, a negative cross-price elasticity, indicates that two goods are complements.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
