                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nIn Scenario 1, the main character took pictures of someone while she was in the shower. This seems like a clear invasion of privacy. In the US, it's generally considered wrong to take photos of someone without their consent, especially in a private setting like a bathroom or shower, where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. This action could also be illegal, as it may constitute voyeurism or sexual misconduct in many jurisdictions.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the main character knocked over a standing stone at Stonehenge. Stonehenge is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an ancient monument in England. Destroying or damaging historical artifacts or monuments is generally considered wrong because it harms cultural heritage and can't be easily reversed. Additionally, such actions are often illegal, as there are laws in place to protect historical sites.\n\nNow, considering that both scenarios involve actions that are morally wrong according to ordinary standards, the answer would be A. Wrong, Wrong.\n\nHowever, I should note that Scenario 2 takes place at Stonehenge, which is in England, not the US. But since the question asks for ordinary moral standards in the US, I assume that US standards would still consider damaging a historical site as wrong, regardless of the location.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning that moral standards can vary, but in general, both actions are widely regarded as wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
