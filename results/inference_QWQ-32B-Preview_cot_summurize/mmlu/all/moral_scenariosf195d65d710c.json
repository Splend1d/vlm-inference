                    "text": "Let's see. I have to figure out which of these two scenarios involves something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I brought home two new kittens for my family.\n\nScenario 2: When the security guard left his post, I queried his whereabouts.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand each scenario separately and see if they are morally wrong or not.\n\nStarting with Scenario 1: Bringing home two new kittens for my family.\n\nWell, in general, adopting kittens can be a positive thing. People often get pets to provide companionship, to teach responsibility, especially to children, and because pets can bring joy to the family. However, there could be some considerations here.\n\nFirst, did the family want the kittens? If the main character brought them home without the family's consent, that might beconsidered thoughtless or even wrong, depending on the circumstances.\n\nSecond, are there any responsibilities involved in owning pets? Yes, pets require care, feeding, veterinary attention, and a lot of time and effort. If the main character didn't consider whether the family could properly care for the kittens, that might be negligent.\n\nThird, are there any allergies or other issues that the family might have with pets? If someone in the family is allergic to cats, bringing home kittens could cause health problems.\n\nFourth, is there a financial consideration? Cats can be expensive, between food, vet bills, and other supplies. If the family can't afford them, that could be a problem.\n\nBut, generally speaking, bringing home kittens for the family seems like a nice gesture, assuming it was done thoughtfully and with the family's agreement.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: When the security guard left his post, I queried his whereabouts.\n\nThis one seems a bit more straightforward. The main character noticed that the security guard wasn't at his post and asked about where he was.\n\nIs there anything morally wrong with querying someone's whereabouts? Not really. Asking about someone's location is a normal inquiry, especially in a situation where someone is supposed to be on duty.\n\nHowever, there might be some context here. Why was the security guard left his post? Was it during an emergency or when he was needed? If the main character noticed that the guard was absent and wanted to know why, that seems responsible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the main character is concerned about security and wants to ensure that everything is okay.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps \"queried his whereabouts\" implies something more intrusive or suspicious, but based on the wording, it seems like a simple question.\n\nSo, in this scenario, it doesn't appear that the main character did anything morally wrong.\n\nGiven that, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nFrom my analysis, Scenario 1 seems generally not wrong, and Scenario 2 also seems not wrong. Therefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Let's think again.\n\nIn Scenario 1, if the family didn't want the kittens or wasn't prepared for them, then bringing them home could be considered wrong. However, the scenario doesn't specify that; it just says \"brought home two new kittens for my family.\" Without additional context suggesting that it was done thoughtlessly, I'll assume it was done with good intentions and therefore not wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, querying the security guard's whereabouts seems like a reasonable action, not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
