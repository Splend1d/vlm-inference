Let's see.\n\nOption A says: \"effervescent ceremonies that create a feeling of belonging.\" Hmm, I know Durkheim talked about rituals and ceremonies that bring people together, especially in his work on religion. He mentioned that these ceremonies can create a sense of unity and shared identity among participants. But is that what he meant by collective representations? Maybe not directly. It sounds more like he's referring to the ceremonies themselves rather than the ideas or symbols that those ceremonies represent.\n\nOption B says: \"images of gods or totems that are widely recognized.\" Okay, Durkheim did discuss totems in his study of Australian aboriginal societies. He saw totems as symbols that represent the group and its beliefs. So, perhaps this is related to collective representations. But is it too narrow? Does it only include gods and totems, or is it broader than that?\n\nOption C says: \"shared ideas and moral values, often symbolized by an object or figurehead.\" This seems promising. Durkheim emphasized that societies are held together by shared beliefs and values, and that these are often represented through symbols and figures. For example, in religious contexts, gods or totems can embody certain moral principles or collective ideals. So, this option appears to capture both the ideological aspect and the symbolic representation.\n\nOption D says: \"ideological tools used to obscure class divisions.\" I think this might be more aligned with Marxist ideas about ideology, where ideas are used to mask inequalities and maintain the status quo. While Durkheim did consider the role of ideas in social cohesion, I don't recall him specifically using collective representations to describe tools for obscuring class divisions.\n\nConsidering these options, I think Option C is the most accurate. Collective representations, in Durkheim's view, are shared ideas and moral values that are often symbolized by objects or figureheads. This aligns with his broader theory of how social solidarity is maintained through shared beliefs and common symbols.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should look back at some of Durkheim's key works. In \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,\" he discusses how religious symbols and rituals reinforce social norms and collective consciousness. He argues that religion is a manifestation of social values and that collective representations are central to this process.\n\nAlso, in \"Division of Labor in Society,\" Durkheim talks about how different types of solidarity are based on shared conscience or organic solidarity based on interdependence. In both cases, collective representations play a crucial role in fostering social cohesion.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that Option C is the correct choice. Collective representations are indeed shared ideas and moral values, often symbolized by objects or figureheads, which help bind society together.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
