She's not doing any experiments or surveys; she's just watching and noting down what she sees. That sounds a lot like observing people in their natural environment without interfering.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Naturalistic observation \u2013 This is when researchers observe subjects in their natural environment without manipulating anything. It seems like Jyoti is doing this by watching people in line without intervening.\n\nB. Survey \u2013 This involves collecting data through questionnaires or interviews. Since Jyoti is just observing and not asking people questions, this doesn't fit.\n\nC. Controlled experiment \u2013 This is where researchers manipulate variables and control conditions to see the effect on the subjects. Jyoti isn't controlling anything or manipulating variables, so this isn't it.\n\nD. Quasi-experiment \u2013 This is similar to a controlled experiment but without random assignment. Again, Jyoti isn't experimenting or manipulating variables.\n\nSo, based on this, it looks like Jyoti is using naturalistic observation. But let me think a bit more to make sure.\n\nIs there any chance she could be doing a survey? Maybe she's observing and also asking people questions. But the question says she's noting their behavior, not interacting with them. So, probably not a survey.\n\nCould it be a quasi-experiment? Well, in a quasi-experiment, the researcher observes the effect of some natural intervention or pre-existing condition. But again, Jyoti seems to be just observing behavior without any manipulation.\n\nControlled experiment is out because there's no mention of manipulating variables or controlling conditions.\n\nTherefore, naturalistic observation seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other method that might fit. Maybe case study? But a case study usually involves in-depth analysis of a particular individual or group, not just observing behavior in a general setting.\n\nOr perhaps ethnography? That's a type of research where the researcher immerses themselves in a culture or group to observe and understand their behavior. While similar to naturalistic observation, it's more in-depth and usually over a longer period.\n\nIn this scenario, Jyoti is observing people waiting in line for rock concert tickets, which seems like a specific, perhaps one-time event. Ethnography might be too broad for this context.\n\nSo, sticking with naturalistic observation seems appropriate.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether this could be participant observation, where the researcher joins the group they're observing. But the question doesn't mention Jyoti participating in the line; she's just noting behavior. So, it's more of a non-participant observation.\n\nIn conclusion, the research method Jyoti is using is naturalistic observation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
