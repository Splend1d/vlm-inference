The formula is:\n\n\\[ P = V \\times I \\]\n\nGiven that the power (P) is 60 watts and the voltage (V) is 120 volts, we can rearrange the formula to solve for current (I):\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{P}{V} \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{W}}{120 \\, \\text{V}} \\]\n\nNow, performing the division:\n\n\\[ I = 0.5 \\, \\text{A} \\]\n\nTherefore, the current drawn by the light bulb is 0.5 amperes.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.25 A\n\nB. 0.5 A\n\nC. 2:00 AM\n\nD. 4:00 AM\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.5 A.\n\nIt's worth noting that options C and D seem unrelated to the question, as they appear to be times rather than current measurements. It's possible there was a mistake in listing those options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
