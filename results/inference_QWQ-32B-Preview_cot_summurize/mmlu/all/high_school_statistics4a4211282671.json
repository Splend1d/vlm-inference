                    "text": "Let's think about this problem step by step. We have a county school system with 4,752 employees, and their salaries are right-skewed with the superintendent's salary being an outlier on the higher side. A random sample of 20 employees was taken, and we have a 95% t-confidence interval for the mean salary: ($15,360, $32,470). Now, we need to determine why the t-confidence interval might not be appropriate in this situation.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a t-confidence interval assumes. The t-interval is based on the t-distribution, which is appropriate when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small, typically less than 30. The t-distribution is used to account for the extra uncertainty from estimating the standard deviation from the sample.\n\nHowever, there are assumptions that need to be met for the t-interval to be valid. One of the key assumptions is that the data are normally distributed, especially when the sample size is small. This is because the t-distribution is derived under the assumption of normality.\n\nIn this problem, we're told that the salary distribution is right-skewed, which means it's not normal. Skewness can affect the validity of the t-interval, particularly with small sample sizes. So, option B seems relevant here: \"the skewed salary distribution tells us that the assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied.\"\n\nLet's consider the other options to see if they might also be reasons why the t-interval is not appropriate.\n\nOption A says: \"the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system to give a fair representation.\" A sample size of 20 out of 4,752 might seem small, but in terms of statistical inference, the\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u66f4\u591a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u62bd\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7edd\u5bf9\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u62bd\u6837\u662f\u968f\u673a\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5373\u4f7f\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u603b\u4f53\u7684\u5408\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5426\u5b9at\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002\n\nOption C states: \"the population standard deviation of the salaries of employees of this county school system is not known.\" Actually, this is not a problem because the t-interval is designed for cases where the population standard deviation is unknown. We estimate it from the sample, which is exactly what the t-interval accounts for.\n\nOption D says: \"the teacher salaries are not negotiable, but the superintendent\u2019s salary is negotiable, so the superintendent\u2019s salary should be excluded from the population sampled.\" This seems like an attempt to deal with the outlier, but excluding data points should not be done arbitrarily. If the superintendent's salary is part of the population, it should be included. Excluding it would bias the estimate. Moreover, the issue here is more about the distribution's shape affecting the appropriateness of the t-interval rather than whether to include specific individuals.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most compelling reason why the t-confidence interval might not be appropriate is the skewness of the salary distribution, which violates the normality assumption required for small sample sizes in t-intervals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. the skewed salary distribution tells us that the assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
