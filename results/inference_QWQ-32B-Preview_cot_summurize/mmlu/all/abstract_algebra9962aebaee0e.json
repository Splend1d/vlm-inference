                    "text": "So I have these two polynomials, f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2, and I need to find their product in the polynomial ring Z_8[x]. I'm a bit rusty on polynomial multiplication and working in modular arithmetic, so let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to multiply two polynomials, I need to use the distributive property, basically multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second one and then combining like terms. Since we're in Z_8[x], all coefficients will be reduced modulo 8.\n\nSo, f(x) * g(x) = (4x - 5) * (2x^2 - 4x + 2).\n\nLet me distribute each term:\n\nFirst, 4x multiplied by each term in g(x):\n\n4x * 2x^2 = 8x^3\n\n4x * (-4x) = -16x^2\n\n4x * 2 = 8x\n\nNext, -5 multiplied by each term in g(x):\n\n-5 * 2x^2 = -10x^2\n\n-5 * (-4x) = 20x\n\n-5 * 2 = -10\n\nNow, let's write down all these terms:\n\n8x^3 - 16x^2 + 8x - 10x^2 + 20x - 10\n\nNow, I need to combine like terms:\n\nThe x^3 term: 8x^3\n\nThe x^2 terms: -16x^2 - 10x^2 = -26x^2\n\nThe x terms: 8x + 20x = 28x\n\nThe constant term: -10\n\nSo, the preliminary product is:\n\n8x^3 - 26x^2 + 28x - 10\n\nNow, since we're working in Z_8[x], I need to reduce each coefficient modulo 8.\n\nLet's do that one by one:\n\n8 mod 8 = 0, so 8x^3 becomes 0x^3, which disappears.\n\n-26 mod 8: First, find 26 mod 8. 8*3 = 24, so 26 - 24 = 2, so 26 mod 8 is 2. Since it's -26, it's -2 mod 8, which is equivalent to 6 mod 8 (because -2 + 8 = 6).\n\nSo, -26x^2 becomes 6x^2.\n\n28 mod 8: 8*3 = 24, 28 - 24 = 4, so 28 mod 8 is 4. So, 28x becomes 4x.\n\n-10 mod 8: 8*1 = 8, -10 + 8 = -2, and -2 + 8 = 6, so -10 mod 8 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the product in Z_8[x] is:\n\n0x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 6\n\nSince 0x^3 is just 0, it vanishes, leaving us with:\n\n6x^2 + 4x + 6\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 2x^2 + 5\n\nB. 6x^2 + 4x + 6\n\nC. 0\n\nD. x^2 + 1\n\nIt seems that option B matches our result. However, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the multiplication again:\n\n(4x - 5)(2x^2 - 4x + 2)\n\nFirst, 4x * 2x^2 = 8x^3\n\n4x * (-4x) = -16x^2\n\n4x * 2 = 8x\n\nThen, -5 * 2x^2 = -10x^2\n\n-5 * (-4x) = 20x\n\n-5 * 2 = -10\n\nCombining: 8x^3 -16x^2 +8x -10x^2 +20x -10\n\nCombining like terms: 8x^3 + (-16x^2 -10x^2) + (8x +20x) -10\n\nWhich is 8x^3 -26x^2 +28x -10\n\nNow, reducing coefficients modulo 8:\n\n8 mod 8 = 0\n\n-26 mod 8: -26 + 32 = 6 (since -26 + 24 = -2, and -2 + 8 = 6)\n\n28 mod 8 = 4\n\n-10 mod 8 = 6 (as above)\n\nSo, 0x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 6, which simplifies to 6x^2 + 4x + 6.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 6x^2 + 4x + 6.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ 6x^{2} + 4x + 6} \\]"
