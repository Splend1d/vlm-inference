                    "text": "I'm trying to recall what Aristotle thought about starting ethical inquiry. I remember that he was a big name in ethics, along with Plato and Socrates. So, let's see.\n\nOption A says we should begin by specifying which things are intrinsically valuable. Intrinsically valuable means something is valuable in itself, not just as a means to an end. Aristotle did talk about things that are valuable for their own sake, like happiness or eudaimonia. So, maybe this is a starting point for him.\n\nOption B is about determining the aim of human life. Aristotle was known for his idea of the ultimate purpose or goal of human life, which he called the telos. He believed that understanding the purpose of human life is crucial for ethics because ethics is about how to live well and fulfill that purpose. So, this seems like a strong candidate.\n\nOption C mentions fundamental duties. I think this is more associated with deontological ethics, like Immanuel Kant's ideas, where duties are central. Aristotle's ethics, on the other hand, is more about virtues and character development. So, maybe this isn't the primary starting point for him.\n\nOption D talks about constraints on behavior that it would be reasonable to agree to. This sounds a bit like social contract theory, where moral rules are based on agreements among rational agents. Aristotle did discuss the role of law and justice, but I don't recall him starting ethics from the perspective of agreed-upon constraints.\n\nLet me think more carefully. In Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, he begins by discussing the concept of eudaimonia, which is often translated as happiness or flourishing. He argues that eudaimonia is the highest good and the aim of human life. So, it seems that specifying the aim of human life is indeed where he starts.\n\nMoreover, he argues that to live well is to perform one's function well. He believes that the human function is rational activity, so living well involves rational activity in accordance with virtue. Therefore, understanding the aim of human life leads to understanding what virtues are and how to cultivate them.\n\nIn contrast, starting with intrinsically valuable things might be a part of his ethics, but it seems like a more specific component rather than the broad starting point. Similarly, duties and constraints are not the primary focus of his ethical theory.\n\nSo, between options A and B, B seems more accurate. The aim of human life is the starting point, and from there, Aristotle elaborates on virtues, moral development, and the good life.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. In Book I of Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle does discuss that all activities aim at some good, and he notes that there is a highest good which is the end for the sake of which we choose all other goods. He identifies this highest good as eudaimonia, or happiness.\n\nTherefore, it appears that Aristotle begins his ethical inquiry by identifying the aim of human life, which is to achieve eudaimonia.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B: the aim of human life.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
