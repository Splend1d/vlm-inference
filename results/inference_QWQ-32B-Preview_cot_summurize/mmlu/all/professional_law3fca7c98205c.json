In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract \"to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. \" This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, \"No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. \"If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely\n\nA. win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.\nB. win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\nC. win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.\nD. lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.\n"

                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex with a lot of moving parts, so I need to make sure I understand all the elements involved.\n\nFirst, there's a conservationist who owned a 100-acre tract of land in 1981. He conveyed this land to his nephew in fee simple, but with a condition: the property could only be used for residential purposes, not commercial. If the condition was breached, the grantor (the conservationist) or his successors could re-enter as of his former estate.\n\nSo, the conservationist conveyed the land to his nephew with this condition attached. This sounds like a conditional fee simple, where the fee simple estate is subject to a condition subsequent. If the condition is breached, the grantor or his successors have a right to re-enter and retake possession of the land.\n\nThe nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, who are his only heirs.\n\nBetween 1981 and 2007, the area around the tract developed significantly, with office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial structures springing up around it, although the tract itself remained undeveloped.\n\nIn 2009, the nephew's wife conveyed the tract to a developer in fee simple, and this deed was recorded. The deed didn't mention the earlier restriction.\n\nAfter acquiring title, the developer started constructing a hotel complex on part of the tract that borders an apartment building.\n\nNow, one of the conservationist's daughters is suing to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel. We need to determine the most likely outcome.\n\nLet's consider the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.\n\nI need to understand what \"vested\" means in this context. Vested rights are those that are fixed and determined, meaning the person has a definite interest that can't be taken away. In the case of a condition subsequent, like here, the right to re-enter only vests upon breach of the condition. So, when the developer starts constructing a hotel, which is a commercial use, that breaches the condition, and at that point, the right to re-enter vests in the grantor or his successors.\n\nSince the conservationist is dead, his successors would be his heirs, which are his two daughters. So, upon the breach (starting construction of the hotel), the daughters' right to re-enter vests. So, this option seems plausible.\n\nOption B: Win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\n\nThis seems directly in line with what I just thought. Since the condition was broken by the developer's commercial use, the successors of the grantor (the daughters) have the right of re-entry. So, this also seems likely.\n\nOption C: Win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.\n\nWait a minute. Possibility of reverter is different from right of re-entry. A possibility of reverter occurs in a fee simple determinable estate, where the estate automatically reverts to the grantor upon the occurrence of a specified event. In this case, the conveyance was \"in fee simple, provided that,\" which typically creates a condition subsequent, giving the grantor a right of re-entry, not a determinable fee with a possibility of reverter.\n\nSo, unless there's language in the deed specifying that the estate determinable, which there isn't, it's more likely that it's a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, creating a right of re-entry.\n\nTherefore, option C might not be correct.\n\nOption D: Lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.\n\nI'm not sure what this means exactly. Maybe it's suggesting that since the surrounding area has been developed commercially, there's an implied understanding or scheme that includes the tract, so the restriction doesn't apply anymore. However, the deed restriction is specific to this tract, and the fact that surrounding areas have been developed differently doesn't necessarily override the specific restriction on this property.\n\nMoreover, the developer recorded the deed, but the restriction was already part of the chain of title, so recording shouldn't affect the enforceability of the restriction.\n\nTherefore, option D seems less likely.\n\nNow, between options A and B, both seem plausible. Option A focuses on the vesting of the right upon the breach (construction of the hotel), while option B simply states that the daughters have the right of re-entry for the condition broken.\n\nI think option B is more straightforward and directly addresses the legal right involved. The right of re-entry is the key here, and since the condition was broken, the daughters, as successors of the grantor, have that right.\n\nOption A might be correct, but it's a bit more convoluted in its explanation. So, I would go with option B.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The conservationist conveyed the land to his nephew with a condition subsequent.\n\n- The condition was that the property shouldn't be used for commercial purposes.\n\n- The nephew died, then the conservationist died, leaving his daughters as heirs.\n\n- The nephew's wife conveyed the property to a developer, who started building a hotel, breaching the condition.\n\n- The daughters, as successors of the grantor, have the right of re-entry for the condition broken.\n\nTherefore, if one of the daughters sues to enjoin the developer, she will most likely win because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
