Generally, in the US, finding someone's wallet and returning it is considered the right thing to do. It's honest and helpful. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this action is not wrong; in fact, it's praised.\n\nIn Scenario 2, the person made a painting in the style of Picasso to study his technique. Copying someone's style for educational purposes is common and usually acceptable. It's a way to learn and understand artistic techniques. However, if the painting was being sold or presented as an original Picasso, that would be different, but in this case, it's just for studying, so it shouldn't be considered morally wrong.\n\nSo, considering both scenarios, neither of them involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Not wrong, Not wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
