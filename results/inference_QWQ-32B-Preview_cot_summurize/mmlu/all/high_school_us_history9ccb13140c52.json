We of the Progressive party here dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of the duty laid upon us by our fathers to maintain the government of the people, by the people and for the people whose foundations they laid. We hold with Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln that the people are the masters of their Constitution, to fulfill its purposes and to safeguard it from those who, by perversion of its intent, would convert it into an instrument of injustice. In accordance with the needs of each generation the people must use their sovereign powers to establish and maintain equal opportunity and industrial justice, to secure which this Government was founded and without which no republic can endure.\n\"This country belongs to the people who inhabit it. Its resources, its business, its institutions and its laws should be utilized, maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest. It is time to set the public welfare in the first place.\"\nProgressive Party Platform, 1912\n\"Muckraking\" author Jacob A.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about the Progressive Party Platform from 1912, and it's asking which quote from the excerpt best exemplifies \"muckraking\" author Jacob A. Riis's book, \"How the Other Half Lives.\" First, I need to understand what \"muckraking\" means and what Riis's book is about.\n\nMuckraking refers to the practice of investigative journalism that aims to expose corruption, social injustices, and misconduct in public and private institutions. Jacob A. Riis was a Danish-American journalist and social reformer who wrote \"How the Other Half Lives\" in 1890. The book documented the squalid living conditions in New York City's tenement districts and aimed to raise awareness about the plight of the urban poor.\n\nNow, looking back at the Progressive Party Platform, I need to see which quote connects best with Riis's work. Let's look at each option:\n\nA. \"the duty laid upon us by our fathers\"\n\nThis seems to refer to the responsibilities inherited from previous generations who founded the nation. While important, it doesn't directly relate to the exposure of social injustices that Riis focused on.\n\nB. \"masters of their Constitution\"\n\nThis suggests that the people have control over their constitution and can shape it according to their needs. Again, while significant, it doesn't specifically connect to the theme of exposing injustices.\n\nC. \"an instrument of injustice\"\n\nThis phrase implies that something, perhaps the government or its institutions, can be used to perpetuate injustice. Riis's book exposed the injustices faced by the poor in tenement districts, so this seems relevant.\n\nD. \"without which no republic can endure\"\n\nThis likely refers to the necessity of certain principles for the survival of a republic. It's broad and doesn't specifically relate to exposing injustices.\n\nComparing these options, C. \"an instrument of injustice\" seems to be the most directly related to Riis's work, as his book exposed the injustices in society. By documenting the poor living conditions and raising awareness, Riis was essentially showing how the system was failing a portion of the population, making it an \"instrument of injustice.\"\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C."
