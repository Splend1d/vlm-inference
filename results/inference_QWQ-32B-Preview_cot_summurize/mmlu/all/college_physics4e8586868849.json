                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide off due to the static friction between the coin and the turntable surface.\n\nGiven:\n- Coefficient of static friction, \\( \\mu_s = 0.30 \\)\n- Turntable rotation speed, \\( f = 33.3 \\) revolutions per minute (rpm)\n\nFirst, we need to understand the forces acting on the coin. The coin experiences a centripetal force due to the rotation of the turntable, which is provided by the static frictional force between the coin and the turntable surface. The maximum static frictional force is given by:\n\n\\[ f_s = \\mu_s \\cdot N \\]\n\nwhere \\( N \\) is the normal force, which is equal to the weight of the coin (\\( N = mg \\)), and \\( m \\) is the mass of the coin, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe centripetal force required to keep the coin moving in a circle is:\n\n\\[ f_c = m \\cdot \\omega^2 \\cdot r \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity of the turntable, and \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the turntable to the coin.\n\nFor the coin to not slide off, the maximum static frictional force must be at least equal to the centripetal force:\n\n\\[ f_s \\geq f_c \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( f_s \\) and \\( f_c \\):\n\n\\[ \\mu_s \\cdot m \\cdot g \\geq m \\cdot \\omega^2 \\cdot r \\]\n\nWe can cancel the mass \\( m \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ \\mu_s \\cdot g \\geq \\omega^2 \\cdot r \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r \\leq \\frac{\\mu_s \\cdot g}{\\omega^2} \\]\n\nSo, the maximum distance \\( r_{\\text{max}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\mu_s \\cdot g}{\\omega^2} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) in radians per second. The turntable rotates at 33.3 revolutions per minute. To convert this to radians per second:\n\n\\[ \\omega = 2 \\pi f \\]\n\nwhere \\( f \\) is in hertz (Hz). Since 1 Hz = 60 rpm, we have:\n\n\\[ f = \\frac{33.3 \\text{ rpm}}{60} = 0.555 \\text{ Hz} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ \\omega = 2 \\pi \\times 0.555 \\approx 3.48 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\nNow, plugging in the values for \\( \\mu_s \\), \\( g \\), and \\( \\omega \\):\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{0.30 \\times 9.81}{(3.48)^2} \\]\n\nCalculating the numerator:\n\n\\[ 0.30 \\times 9.81 = 2.943 \\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n\\[ (3.48)^2 = 12.1104 \\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ r_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2.943}{12.1104} \\approx 0.243 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide is approximately 0.243 meters, which corresponds to option D. 0.242 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
