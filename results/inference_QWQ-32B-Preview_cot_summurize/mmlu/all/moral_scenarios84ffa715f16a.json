                    "text": "So I've got this question here with two scenarios, and I need to figure out which one, if any, involves something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. The options are:\n\nScenario 1: \"I voted for the man who was innocent.\"\n\nScenario 2: \"Me and my sister had a close sexual relationship.\"\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: \"I voted for the man who was innocent.\"\n\nHmm, voting for someone who is innocent\u2014does that sound morally wrong? Well, voting is a fundamental right in democracy, and people have the freedom to choose who they want to vote for. The fact that the man was innocent probably means he wasn't guilty of something, but without more context, it's a bit unclear.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's more to this scenario. If the man was innocent of a crime but was running for office, and the voter knew about his innocence, then voting for him might be the right thing to do. On the other hand, if \"innocent\" refers to something else, like not being qualified or suitable for the position, then voting for him might be seen as a mistake, but not necessarily morally wrong.\n\nI think in this context, voting for someone who is innocent probably means voting for someone who hasn't done anything wrong, which shouldn't be morally wrong itself. So, I'm leaning towards this not being morally wrong.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: \"Me and my sister had a close sexual relationship.\"\n\nThis one seems more straightforward. In the US, ordinary moral standards prohibit sexual relationships between immediate family members, specifically between siblings. This is considered incest, which is not only morally condemned but also illegal in all states.\n\nSo, having a close sexual relationship with your sister would be seen as clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nThat matches with choice C: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any way that Scenario 1 could be seen as morally wrong? Maybe if the person voted for someone who was innocent but had other immoral characteristics or policies, but based on the information given, it's hard to say that voting for an innocent person is wrong.\n\nAnd Scenario 2 is clearly wrong due to the nature of the relationship.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
