                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this question about perceiving your front door as a rectangle even when it's open. The options are color constancy, closure, shape constancy, and size constancy. I think it's related to how our brain interprets shapes consistently, regardless of the perspective or angle we're seeing them from.\n\nSo, color constancy is about how we perceive color under different lighting conditions, right? Like, a white shirt looks white whether it's in sunlight or shadow. That doesn't seem to fit here.\n\nClosure is when we fill in gaps to perceive a complete image. Like the famous Kanizsa triangle, where we see a triangle even though it's made up of partial lines. That's not exactly about shape consistency over different perspectives.\n\nShape constancy seems promising. It's the ability to recognize that an object has the same shape regardless of the angle from which it's viewed. So, no matter if the door is open or closed, we still see it as a rectangle. That sounds right.\n\nSize constancy is about perceiving an object as the same size even when it's closer or farther away. So, if you see a door from a distance or up close, you still know it's the same size, even though the retinal image changes.\n\nGiven that, I think shape constancy is the best answer here. It's specifically about maintaining the perception of shape despite changes in perspective or viewing angle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
