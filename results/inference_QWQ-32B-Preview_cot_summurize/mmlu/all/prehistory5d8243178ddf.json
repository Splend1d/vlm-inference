                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about stone blades and extinct elephants. The options are Thule, Lapita, Dorset, and Clovis. I think this has something to do with ancient tools and prehistoric cultures, but I'm not entirely sure which one is associated with fluted points on both faces and extinct elephants.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a fluted point is. From what I recall, a fluted point is a type of stone tool where the craftsman has removed long, thin flakes from both faces of the blade, creating a channel or flute down the length of each side. This technique is typically associated with certain prehistoric cultures.\n\nNow, the question mentions that this stone blade is associated with extinct elephants. That probably refers to the fact that these tools were used by humans who hunted or scavenged from now-extinct species of elephants, like mastodons or mammoths.\n\nLet me look at each option:\n\nA. Thule: I think the Thule people were from the Arctic region and were known for their advanced whaling technology. They were ancestors of the Inuit people. I don't recall them being associated with fluted points or extinct elephants.\n\nB. Lapita: I believe the Lapita culture is associated with the Pacific Islands and is known for its pottery and navigation skills. Again, I don't think they are related to fluted points or elephant hunting.\n\nC. Dorset: The Dorset culture was in the Canadian Arctic and is known for its unique tools and art. They predate the Thule culture. I'm not sure if they used fluted points or interacted with extinct elephants.\n\nD. Clovis: I've heard of Clovis points before. They are famous fluted stone points associated with the first human inhabitants of North America. These points are often found in association with extinct animals like mammoths and mastodons.\n\nComparing these options, it seems like the Clovis culture is the one that matches the description of having fluted points on both faces and being associated with extinct elephants.\n\nTo double-check, let me recall what I know about Clovis points. Clovis points are distinctive stone tools characterized by a flute\u2014a channel flakes from both faces of the blade. They are typically dated to around 13,000 to 12,800 years ago and have been found across North America, often in association with mammoth remains.\n\nThule, Lapita, and Dorset are all important prehistoric cultures, but their tool technologies and geographical regions don't match the description in the question.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D. Clovis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
