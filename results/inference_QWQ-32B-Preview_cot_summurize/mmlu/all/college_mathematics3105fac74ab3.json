It's asking which of the options A, B, C, or D must be true. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to recall the differences between Riemann integrability and Lebesgue integrability. I know that Lebesgue integrability is a more general concept, meaning that every Riemann integrable function is also Lebesgue integrable, but not necessarily vice versa. So, option A says that f is Riemann integrable. But since Lebesgue integrable functions can be more general, it's possible that f is Lebesgue integrable but not Riemann integrable. Therefore, A doesn't have to be true.\n\nOption B says that there does not exist a countably infinite set E in R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x in E. Hmm, that seems tricky. I need to think about whether a Lebesgue integrable function must be differentiable everywhere except possibly on a countably infinite set.\n\nWell, integrability doesn't directly imply differentiability. In fact, a function can be integrable even if it's nowhere differentiable. So, it's possible to have a function that's Lebesgue integrable but nondifferentiable on an uncountable set. Therefore, option B seems false because there can exist a countably infinite set where the function is nondifferentiable.\n\nOption C says that there does not exist an uncountable subset E of R such that f is nondifferentiable at every x in E. This is interesting because, as I just thought, a Lebesgue integrable function can be nondifferentiable on an uncountable set. For example, the Weierstrass function is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere, and it's bounded, so it should be Lebesgue integrable. So, this would be a counterexample to option C.\n\nWait a minute, the Weierstrass function is continuous everywhere and differentiable nowhere, and it's bounded, so it's Lebesgue integrable. That means it's nondifferentiable on the entire real line, which is uncountable. So, option C is not true.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C are not necessarily true, that leaves option D: none of the above.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any possibility that one of these options must be true for any bounded Lebesgue integrable function?\n\nOption A: f is Riemann integrable. As I said, not necessarily, because there are Lebesgue integrable functions that are not Riemann integrable.\n\nOption B: No countably infinite set where f is nondifferentiable everywhere in that set. But functions can be nondifferentiable on countably infinite sets, and still be Lebesgue integrable.\n\nOption C: No uncountable subset where f is nondifferentiable everywhere in that subset. But as the Weierstrass function shows, this isn't true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D: none of the above.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
