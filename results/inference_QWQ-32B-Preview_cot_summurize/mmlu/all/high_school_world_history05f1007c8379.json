The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:\nA Negro with beard\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202610 or 15,000 cowries.\nThey are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.\nAn adult Negress\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons\nAn adolescent Negro\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.30,000 cowries\nA young Negress \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u202650\u201360,000 cowries\nThe price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.\nA male Negro child\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..45,000 cowries\nA female Negro child \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.35\u201340,000 cowries\nFinally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.\nWhich statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this passage here about the Arab slave trade in the 1830s in Algeria, as told by a French officer. It's pretty intense stuff. There's a lot going on here, but I need to find which statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields\n\nB. With orders to attack places without defenses\n\nC. Four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women\n\nD. All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes\n\nHmm. So, I need to think about which of these statements suggests that religion was a factor in the slave trade.\n\nOption A is about seizing peasants who were farming. That seems more related to economics or labor, not directly to religion.\n\nOption B is about attacking places without defenses. Again, that seems more strategic or military, not necessarily religious.\n\nOption C is about the number of slaves, with three hundred being women. That might indicate gender preferences or something, but it doesn't directly relate to religion.\n\nOption D is: \"All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes.\" Now, \"idolatrous\" is a religious term, referring to people who worship idols, which is considered wrong in some religions. \"Koholanes\" seems to be a pejorative term for black Africans, possibly implying they practice a different religion.\n\nSo, in this statement, there's a religious undertone because they're referring to the people they're hunting as \"idolatrous,\" which suggests that their religion is being used as a justification or a motivation for capturing them.\n\nComparing this with the other options, this is the only one that directly mentions something religious. The other options are more about military actions or the demographics of the slaves.\n\nTherefore, I think option D is the best choice here. It shows that religion was being used to justify or motivate the slave raids.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's think about it again. The term \"idolatrous\" is a religious insult, implying that the Koholanes practice a false religion. This could be used to justify enslaving them, perhaps based on religious doctrines or interpretations that allow or encourage the enslavement of non-believers.\n\nIn contrast, the other options don't have any religious terminology or implications. So, yes, option D is the strongest support for the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
