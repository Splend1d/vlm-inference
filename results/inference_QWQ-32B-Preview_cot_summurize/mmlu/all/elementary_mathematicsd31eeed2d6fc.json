                    "text": "So Rita has this big job moving 120 rocks to build a wall, and she's doing it by hand, carrying some number of rocks at a time. The question is asking for an expression that represents the total number of loads she'll need to move all the rocks, and it's giving us options, but I wanna make sure I understand this correctly before picking one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what 'h' represents. It's the number of rocks she can carry in one load. So, if h is, say, 10, that means she can carry 10 rocks per trip. To find out how many trips she needs to make to move all 120 rocks, I would divide the total number of rocks by the number she can carry per load. So, 120 divided by h would give me the number of loads.\n\nLet me think about this with a number to make sure. If h is 10, then 120 divided by 10 is 12 loads. That makes sense. If she carries 10 rocks each time, she'll need to make 12 trips to move all 120 rocks.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 120 + h\n\nThat would be 120 plus the number of rocks per load. That doesn't make sense for finding the number of loads. If h is 10, that would be 130, which is not the number of loads.\n\nB. 120h\n\nThat's 120 times h. So if h is 10, that's 1200. That's way more than the number of loads needed. That seems incorrect.\n\nC. 120 - h\n\nThat's 120 minus h. If h is 10, that's 110. Again, that doesn't represent the number of loads. That would be the number of rocks left after one load, but not the total loads needed.\n\nD. 120 / h\n\nThat's 120 divided by h, which, as I thought earlier, would give the number of loads needed. So, if h is 10, it's 12, which matches my earlier reasoning.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if h was something else, say h=15. Then, 120 divided by 15 is 8 loads. Does that make sense? Yes, if she carries 15 rocks per load, she'd need 8 trips to move 120 rocks.\n\nWhat if h=20? 120 divided by 20 is 6 loads. Again, that makes sense.\n\nNow, what if h=1? Then, 120 divided by 1 is 120 loads, which means she's carrying one rock at a time, so she'd need 120 trips. That also makes sense.\n\nWhat if h=120? Then, 120 divided by 120 is 1 load. She carries all the rocks in one go. That makes sense too.\n\nSo, in all these cases, 120 divided by h gives the correct number of loads needed.\n\nLooking back at the other options:\n\nA. 120 + h: This would only make sense if the number of loads increased by h for some reason, but that doesn't align with the concept of dividing the total rocks by the capacity per load.\n\nB. 120h: This would be the total number of rocks if she were to carry h rocks per load for 120 loads, but that's not what we're trying to find.\n\nC. 120 - h: This would represent the remaining rocks after one load, but not the total number of loads needed.\n\nTherefore, the correct expression is D. 120 / h.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if h doesn't divide evenly into 120. For example, if h=7, then 120 divided by 7 is approximately 17.14. But you can't have a fraction of a load; she'd need to make 18 full loads, with the last load carrying only the remaining rocks.\n\nSo, in reality, the expression should account for any remainder, meaning she'd need to round up to the next whole number.\n\nHowever, since the question is asking for an expression and not a function that rounds up, and given the options provided, D. 120 / h is the most accurate representation.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the exact number of loads would be the ceiling of 120 divided by h, but since that option isn't provided, D is the best choice among the given options.\n\nMoreover, in the context of the problem, h is likely to be a divisor of 120 to avoid fractional loads, but the expression should still represent the general case.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 120 / h.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
