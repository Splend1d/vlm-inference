                    "text": "Let's see, I'm trying to figure out what makes an offer irrevocable under the Uniform Commercial Code, specifically in the context of contracts for the sale of goods. I remember that the UCC has some specific rules about offers and acceptances that might differ from common law principles.\n\nOption A says that the offer must be made by a merchant to a merchant. I know that the UCC does give special treatment to merchants, as they are considered to have special knowledge and expertise in the goods they deal with. But does that alone make an offer irrevocable? I don't think so. Irrevocability usually has to do with the terms of the offer and perhaps some consideration to keep it open.\n\nOption B mentions that the offer must be contained in a signed writing which gives assurance that the offer will be held open. This sounds familiar. I think there's a section in the UCC that talks about signed writings that hold an offer open. Let me recall, is this related to option contracts? Yeah, in common law, an option contract requires consideration to keep the offer open, but under the UCC, there might be different rules.\n\nOption C states that the offer must state the period of time for which it is irrevocable. This also sounds relevant. If an offer specifies how long it will remain open, that could make it irrevocable for that period. But I need to check if this is indeed the case under the UCC.\n\nOption D says that the offer must not be contained in a form supplied by the offeror. I'm not sure about this one. It seems unrelated to the irrevocability of an offer. The UCC does have provisions about form contracts and fairness, but I don't recall anything specific about irrevocability based on who supplies the form.\n\nLet me try to think this through step by step. First, under common law, offers can generally be revoked at any time before acceptance, as long as the offeree hasn't provided consideration to keep the offer open. However, the UCC might have modified this rule for commercial transactions.\n\nLooking at UCC Section 2-205, which deals with firm offers by merchants, it seems that a merchant can make a firm offer that is irrevocable for a stated period, but only if the offer is in a signed writing and the offeree relies on the offer to their detriment. Wait, but that seems a bit different from what option B says.\n\nActually, UCC Section 2-205 provides that a merchant's firm offer, in a signed writing, is irrevocable for the time stated or a reasonable time up to three months, even without consideration, as long as the offeree relies on the offer to their detriment. So, this seems to align somewhat with option B.\n\nBut option B just says \"a signed writing which gives assurance that the offer will be held open,\" without mentioning anything about the offeree's reliance or the offer being by a merchant. Maybe I need to look closer at the language of the UCC.\n\nAnother section that might be relevant is UCC Section 2-204, which deals with firm offers by any offeror, not just merchants, but it requires consideration to support the promise to keep the offer open. However, Section 2-205 provides an exception for merchants, allowing irrevocable offers without consideration, under certain conditions.\n\nGiven that, option A seems important because it specifies that both parties are merchants, which might be a requirement for the irrevocability under Section 2-205.\n\nOption C also seems relevant because the offer needs to state the period for which it is irrevocable, as per the UCC provisions.\n\nBut the question is asking for the condition that must be met for an offer to be irrevocable under the UCC. Perhaps it's a combination of factors.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that an irrevocable offer under the UCC requires a signed writing assuring that the offer will be held open, and it must be made by a merchant to a merchant, and it must state the period of time for which it is irrevocable.\n\nBut looking back at the options, only option B mentions the signed writing, which seems like a crucial element.\n\nOption D seems out of place and\u4e0d\u592a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\n\nPerhaps the key is the signed writing, as that provides the necessary assurance and meets the formal requirements under the UCC.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other section in the UCC that pertains to irrevocable offers.\n\nUCC Section 2-205 is titled \"Firm Offers by Merchants,\" and it states that a merchant's firm offer, in a signed writing, is irrevocable for the time stated or a reasonable time up to three months, without any need for consideration, provided the offeree relies on the offer to their detriment.\n\nBut it seems that even without the offeree's reliance, if the offer is in a signed writing and states the period, it might be irrevocable.\n\nHowever, I need to recall the exact language of the section.\n\nUCC \u00a7 2-205 states:\n\n\"(1) The following provisions supplement the provisions of the general law relating to offers and acceptances.\n\n(2) An offer by a merchant to sell or buy goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time not exceeding three months, but in all events\n\n(a) the duration of the offer is not affected by the fact that the offer contains a provision for extension upon notice given by either party; and\n\n(b) acceptance may be made at any time within the time fixed or, if no time is fixed, until a reasonable time has elapsed.\n\n(3) A firm offer under subsection (2) requires good faith and is subject to subchapter 1 (Sections 2-101 through 2-108).\"\n\nSo, according to this, an offer by a merchant in a signed writing that gives assurance it will be held open is irrevocable for the time stated or a reasonable time up to three months.\n\nThis seems to directly support option B: \"Be contained in a signed writing which gives assurance that the offer will be held open.\"\n\nOption C, \"State the period of time for which it is irrevocable,\" is also mentioned in the UCC section, as it says \"for the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time not exceeding three months.\"\n\nSo, both B and C seem to be requirements for an irrevocable offer under the UCC.\n\nBut the question is asking for the condition that must be met, implying perhaps a single correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is a combination of A, B, and C.\n\nBut since it's a multiple-choice question with options A through D, and it's phrased as \"the offer must,\" it seems like they're expecting one specific condition.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to capture the essence of the UCC's requirement for a firm offer by a merchant: it must be in a signed writing assuring that the offer will be held open.\n\nOption A, \"Be made by a merchant to a merchant,\" is also important because the firm offer rule under the UCC applies only to merchants.\n\nHowever, option A isn't listed as one of the choices, but it's implied in the UCC section.\n\nWait, option A is present, but perhaps the question is designed to highlight the signed writing aspect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing whether you know that the offer must be in a signed writing to be irrevocable under the UCC.\n\nGiven that, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nOption C is somewhat covered in the UCC section, but it's secondary to the requirement of a signed writing.\n\nOption D seems irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, I would go with option B: \"Be contained in a signed writing which gives assurance that the offer will be held open.\"\n\nBut to be thorough, let me double-check.\n\nIf an offer is in a signed writing and assures that it will be held open, then under the UCC, it is irrevocable for the stated period or a reasonable time up to three months.\n\nThis seems to be the key requirement for an irrevocable offer under the UCC, at least for merchants.\n\nSo, I think B is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
