                    "text": "I'm trying to understand this question about Socrates' view on wisdom and virtue. It's saying that for Socrates, being wise and virtuous isn't just about knowing lots of examples of just or virtuous actions, but about understanding the essence of justice or virtue itself. And then it gives four options to choose from, explaining why that's the case.\n\nOption A says that even without knowing what makes something just or virtuous, just knowing examples is enough to live a good life. But I don't think that's what Socrates would say. He was all about understanding things deeply, not just superficially knowing examples.\n\nOption B says that knowing individual examples isn't enough because it doesn't prepare you for situations where those examples don't directly apply. That sounds more like Socrates. He believed in universal principles that could be applied to various situations, not just memorizing specific cases.\n\nOption C suggests that what makes an action just or virtuous can only be known by asking people's opinions and considering each opinion equally valuable. That seems more like relativism, where everything is subjective. But Socrates was against that; he thought there were objective truths to be discovered.\n\nOption D says that justice and virtue are universal goals for all humans, even if people disagree on how to achieve them. That sounds plausible, but it doesn't directly explain why understanding the essence is important.\n\nComparing these options, Option B seems to align best with Socrates' philosophy. He emphasized the importance of understanding universal definitions and principles that could guide behavior in various situations, not just relying on specific examples.\n\nI recall that in his dialogues, Socrates often tried to define concepts like justice, courage, and wisdom by asking questions and seeking universal definitions. He believed that knowing the essence of these virtues would enable people to act rightly in any situation, even if it wasn't exactly like previous examples they'd encountered.\n\nMoreover, in the \"Meno,\" Socrates discusses the idea of recollection, suggesting that we have innate knowledge of these universal truths and that learning is a process of remembering them. So, it's not about accumulating examples but about uncovering the underlying principles.\n\nOption A contradicts this approach because it suggests that merely knowing examples is sufficient, which goes against Socrates' emphasis on understanding the underlying forms or essences.\n\nOption C is problematic because it promotes moral relativism, which Socrates argued against. He believed in objective standards of morality, not in the idea that all opinions are equally valid.\n\nOption D acknowledges that justice and virtue are universal goals, but it doesn't explain why understanding the essence is crucial. It seems more like a statement about human aspirations rather than an epistemological point about how to achieve virtue.\n\nTherefore, Option B seems to be the most accurate reflection of Socrates' view: that knowing individual examples isn't enough because it doesn't equip you to deal with new situations that don't neatly match those examples. Understanding the essence allows for more flexible and accurate application of justice and virtue in diverse contexts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
