                    "text": "Let's see. So, the market for denim jeans is in equilibrium, and then the price of polyester pants, which are a substitute good, rises. I need to figure out what happens in the jean market based on that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a substitute good is. Substitute goods are those that can be used in place of each other. So, if someone wants to buy jeans, but the price of polyester pants goes up, they might choose jeans instead because pants are more expensive now.\n\nSo, if polyester pants are more expensive, some people might decide to buy jeans instead. That means the demand for jeans might increase.\n\nNow, in the jean market, if the demand increases, what happens to the price and quantity? Well, in a standard supply and demand model, if demand increases and supply stays the same, the equilibrium price and quantity both increase.\n\nWait, but let's look at the options:\n\nA. supply falls, increasing the price and decreasing the quantity.\n\nB. supply falls, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nC. demand falls, increasing the price and decreasing the quantity.\n\nD. demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nHmm, option D seems to match what I'm thinking. Demand rises, price increases, and quantity increases.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the price of polyester pants rises, and they're a substitute for jeans, then people might buy more jeans and fewer pants. So, the demand for jeans increases.\n\nIn a graph, that would be a rightward shift of the demand curve. If supply remains unchanged, the new equilibrium would be at a higher price and a higher quantity.\n\nSo, why are options A and B talking about supply falling? The question is about the price of polyester pants rising, which should affect the demand for jeans, not the supply of jeans.\n\nUnless maybe the supply of jeans falls for some reason, but that's not mentioned in the scenario. The only change mentioned is the price of polyester pants rising.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is D: demand rises, increasing the price and increasing the quantity.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there any reason why the supply of jeans would fall just because the price of polyester pants rises?\n\nI don't think so. The supply of jeans depends on factors like the cost of producing jeans, technology, number of suppliers, etc. The price of polyester pants shouldn't directly affect the supply of jeans, unless maybe there's some shared input in production, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nSo, it's probably safe to assume that the supply of jeans remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the change in the market for jeans is due to a shift in demand.\n\nAnd since polyester pants are substitutes, their price increase should lead to an increase in demand for jeans.\n\nSo, demand rises, price increases, and quantity increases.\n\nThat matches option D.\n\nLet me just consider if there's any other way to look at this.\n\nMaybe if polyester pants and jeans are complementary goods, but the question says they're substitutes. So, substitutes mean that when the price of one goes up, the demand for the other increases.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think D is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
