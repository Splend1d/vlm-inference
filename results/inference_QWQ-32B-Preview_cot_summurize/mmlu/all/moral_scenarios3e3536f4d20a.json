                    "text": "I'm going to analyze these two scenarios to determine which one, if any, involves morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n**Scenario 1:** \"I took a baseball bat and swung at the ballboy.\"\n\nFirst, let's consider the action described: swinging a baseball bat at a ballboy. A ballboy is typically a young person or an assistant in a baseball game who retrieves balls and performs other supportive tasks. Swinging a bat at someone, especially with the potential to cause harm, is generally considered aggressive and potentially dangerous.\n\nIn the context of ordinary moral standards in the US, intentionally swinging a bat at another person is likely to be seen as morally wrong for several reasons:\n\n1. **Intent to Harm:** Swinging a bat at someone suggests an intent to cause physical harm, which is against the moral principle of not harming others.\n\n2. **Lack of Consent:** The ballboy has not consented to being hit with a bat, making the action non-consensual and therefore morally questionable.\n\n3. **Potential for Serious Injury:** Baseball bats can cause significant injury, including fractures, concussions, or even more severe harm. The potential for causing such injury amplifies the moral wrongness of the action.\n\n4. **Sportsmanship and Respect:** In sports, there are expectations of sportsmanship and respect for all participants, including support staff like ballboys. Attacking a ballboy violates these norms.\n\nGiven these points, it seems clear that swinging a bat at a ballboy is morally wrong.\n\n**Scenario 2:** \"I removed his tonsils with my professional equipment.\"\n\nThis scenario describes removing someone's tonsils using professional equipment. Tonsil removal, or tonsillectomy, is a surgical procedure typically performed by a medical professional for medical reasons, such as repeated tonsillitis or sleep apnea.\n\nTo evaluate whether this action is morally wrong, consider the following:\n\n1. **Medical Necessity:** If the tonsil removal was medically necessary and performed with the patient's consent (or guardian's consent for minors), it would be considered a standard medical procedure and not morally wrong.\n\n2. **Professional Competence:** Assuming the person performing the procedure is a qualified medical professional, such as an ENT surgeon, performing the procedure correctly is part of their job and expected professional practice.\n\n3. **Consent:** Medical procedures require informed consent from the patient or legal guardian. If consent was obtained appropriately, the procedure is ethically acceptable.\n\n4. **Context:** Without additional context suggesting that the procedure was unnecessary, performed without consent, or carried out by someone without proper medical training, there is no inherent moral wrongness in performing a tonsillectomy.\n\nHowever, if the scenario implies that the tonsils were removed without medical necessity, without consent, or by someone who is not a qualified medical professional, then it would be morally wrong. But based on the information provided, which simply states \"I removed his tonsils with my professional equipment,\" it appears to be a standard medical procedure performed by a professional, hence not morally wrong.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Scenario 1:** Morally wrong\n\n- **Scenario 2:** Not morally wrong\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B. Wrong, Not wrong**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
