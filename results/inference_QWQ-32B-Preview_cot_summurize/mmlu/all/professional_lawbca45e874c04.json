After the dishwasher had been installed in the buyer's home, it functioned properly for the first month. Then it began to make a loud rattling noise whenever it was in use. The buyer called the appliance store, and a manager there assured her that it was not uncommon for the dishwasher to make such a noise. Moreover, he indicated that the machine's clamorous sound would eventually disappear with continued use. One week later, after a dinner party, the buyer placed her most expensive china set in the dishwasher and turned on the machine. After the dishwasher had been in operation for a few minutes, the buyer heard the rattling noise followed by the sound of breaking china. She immediately stopped the machine. Upon looking inside, she saw that a blade from the dishwasher had broken, destroying her entire china set. If the buyer asserts a claim for strict products liability against the appliance company, will she prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n"

                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out this problem about a buyer who purchased a dishwasher and had some issues with it. So, the scenario is that the buyer got a new dishwasher from an appliance store, and it was made by an appliance company. At first, it worked fine for a month, but then it started making a loud rattling noise. The store manager said it was normal and that it would go away with more use. But then, after using it one time, it broke a set of expensive china. Now, the buyer is thinking about suing the appliance company for strict products liability. The question is, would she win?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nB. Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher.\n\nC. No, because the buyer was not personally injured.\n\nD. No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise.\n\nOkay, so strict products liability is a legal theory where a manufacturer is held responsible for any defects in their products that cause harm. The key elements are usually that the product was defective, the defect existed when it left the manufacturer's control, and the defect caused the harm.\n\nFirst, was the dishwasher defective? It started making a loud rattling noise, and eventually, a blade broke and destroyed the china. That sounds like a defect to me. So, option A says yes, because it was defective. That seems plausible.\n\nBut then, option C says no, because the buyer was not personally injured. Hmm, that's interesting. In products liability, the harm can be to the product itself, to other property, or to people. In this case, it was the china that was damaged, not the buyer personally. I think products liability can still apply to property damage, not just personal injury. So, maybe this isn't a good reason to say she wouldn't prevail.\n\nOption B says yes, because she was the purchaser. Well, being the purchaser might give her standing to sue, but in products liability, sometimes even someone who isn't the purchaser can sue if they were foreseeably using the product. So, maybe being the purchaser isn't the decisive factor here.\n\nOption D says no, because a reasonably prudent person would have stopped using the dishwasher after hearing the rattling noise. So, this might be getting at whether the buyer was contributorily negligent or not using the product as intended. But in strict products liability, the focus is on the product's defect, not on the user's actions, although there can be limits based on foreseeability of use.\n\nLet me think about this again. The manager assured the buyer that the noise was normal and would go away. So, she might have reasonably continued to use the dishwasher based on that information. If the manufacturer or seller knew about the noise issue and assured her it was normal, that could be seen as encouraging her to continue using the defective product.\n\nIn products liability, one of the key issues is whether the product was defective and unreasonably dangerous. Here, the dishwasher had a defect that led to it breaking the china. So, it seems like the product was defective and caused property damage.\n\nAlso, in strict liability, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove negligence on the part of the manufacturer; they just need to show that the product was defective and caused harm.\n\nNow, regarding option C, about no personal injury. I think products liability can cover property damage. For example, if a washing machine explodes and damages your clothes or the wall, you can still seek liability for the property damage.\n\nSimilarly, in this case, the dishwasher's defect caused damage to the china, which is property damage. So, I don't think the lack of personal injury disqualifies the claim.\n\nOption D suggests that a prudent person would have stopped using the dishwasher after hearing the rattling noise. But the manager assured her that it was normal and would go away. So, she had a reason to believe it was okay to continue using it. If the manufacturer or seller knew about the issue and didn't warn against continued use, it might not be fair to hold the buyer responsible for continuing to use it.\n\nAdditionally, in products liability, the user is expected to use the product in a foreseeable way. If continuing to use the dishwasher despite the noise was a foreseeable action, especially with the assurance from the store manager, then the manufacturer should have anticipated that and ensured the product was safe under those conditions.\n\nTherefore, it seems like the buyer would have a case against the appliance company for strict products liability because the dishwasher was defective and caused property damage.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. Yes, because the dishwasher was defective.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A: Yes, because the dishwasher was defective. This seems correct based on the analysis.\n\nOption B: Yes, because she was the purchaser of the dishwasher. While she might have standing to sue as the purchaser, the purchaser status isn't the main reason in products liability; it's the defect and the harm caused.\n\nOption C: No, because the buyer was not personally injured. But as discussed, products liability can cover property damage, not just personal injury.\n\nOption D: No, because a reasonably prudent person would have discontinued using the dishwasher after becoming aware of the rattling noise. However, considering the assurance from the store manager, it's arguable that continuing to use it was reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
