                    "text": "I've got this question about radio telescopes and which one has the largest parabolic antenna. The options are the Green Bank Telescope, the Arecibo Telescope, the Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope, and the Effelsberg Telescope. I need to figure out which one is the biggest in terms of its parabolic antenna.\n\nFirst, I should probably recall what a parabolic antenna is. It's a type of antenna that uses a parabolic reflector to direct radio waves to a receiver. In radio telescopes, the larger the antenna, the more sensitive it is to detecting faint signals from space.\n\nLet me start by considering the Green Bank Telescope. I know that it's located in West Virginia, USA, and it's operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. I think it's pretty big, but I'm not sure exactly how large it is.\n\nNext, there's the Arecibo Telescope. That's the one in Puerto Rico, right? I remember it collapsed a while back, but before that, it was enormous. I think its dish was about 305 meters in diameter. That sounds huge.\n\nThen there's the Yevpatoria RT-70 Telescope. I'm not as familiar with this one. Yevpatoria is in Crimea, and I believe RT-70 stands for something like \"Radio Telescope - 70 meters.\" So, if it's 70 meters in diameter, that's still pretty big, but probably smaller than Arecibo.\n\nLastly, the Effelsberg Telescope, which is in Germany. I think it's also a large radio telescope. I recall its dish being about 100 meters in diameter.\n\nComparing these sizes:\n\n- Green Bank Telescope: I need to look up its exact size.\n\n- Arecibo Telescope: 305 meters\n\n- Yevpatoria RT-70: 70 meters\n\n- Effelsberg Telescope: 100 meters\n\nWait a minute, Arecibo was 305 meters, but I heard it collapsed. Does that mean it's no longer operational? Maybe I should confirm that.\n\nLooking it up quickly, Arecibo Observatory did collapse in December 2020 due to structural failures. So, although it had the largest dish, it's no longer functional.\n\nSo, if Arecibo is out, that leaves the Green Bank Telescope as potentially the largest. Let me check its specifications.\n\nThe Green Bank Telescope, also known as the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, has a diameter of 100 meters. Wait, that's the same as Effelsberg.\n\nHmm, so Green Bank and Effelsberg are both 100 meters. Yevpatoria is 70 meters, and Arecibo was 305 meters but is no longer operational.\n\nIs there another telescope that's larger than 100 meters?\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), which is in China. I think that's larger than Arecibo, but I'm not sure if it's a parabolic antenna.\n\nLooking it up, FAST has a diameter of 500 meters, but it's a spherical telescope, not a parabolic one. So, perhaps it doesn't qualify as a parabolic antenna.\n\nAlso, there are arrays like the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), but that's an array of multiple smaller telescopes, not a single large parabolic antenna.\n\nSo, if FAST isn't considered a parabolic antenna due to its spherical design, then perhaps the Green Bank Telescope and the Effelsberg Telescope, both at 100 meters, are the largest operational parabolic antennas.\n\nBut the question includes Arecibo, which was larger, but it's no longer operational. So, perhaps in terms of what's currently operational, Green Bank and Effelsberg are the largest.\n\nWait, but the options don't include FAST or ALMA, so maybe I should focus only on the given choices.\n\nGiven that, among Green Bank, Arecibo, Yevpatoria, and Effelsberg, Arecibo was the largest at 305 meters, but it's not operational. So, perhaps the question is considering the largest among the operational ones.\n\nIn that case, Green Bank and Effelsberg are both 100 meters, while Yevpatoria is 70 meters.\n\nBut the question seems to be phrased as \"has the largest parabolic antenna,\" without specifying operational status.\n\nIf it includes both operational and non-operational, then Arecibo was the largest.\n\nBut since Arecibo is no longer functional, maybe it's not considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding about the sizes.\n\nLet me double-check the sizes:\n\n- Arecibo: 305 meters\n\n- Green Bank: 100 meters\n\n- Effelsberg: 100 meters\n\n- Yevpatoria: 70 meters\n\n- FAST: 500 meters, but spherical, not parabolic.\n\nSo, if only parabolic antennas are considered, and Arecibo is out, then Green Bank and Effelsberg are tied for the largest at 100 meters.\n\nBut the question seems to imply there's a single largest one among the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have incorrect information about the Green Bank Telescope's size.\n\nLet me look it up again.\n\nThe Green Bank Telescope has a diameter of 100 meters, but its reflector is more flexible and can be reshaped, but its maximum diameter is 100 meters.\n\nSimilarly, Effelsberg is also 100 meters in diameter.\n\nYevpatoria RT-70 is indeed 70 meters.\n\nSo, unless there's a mistake in my assumptions, Green Bank and Effelsberg are equal in size, larger than Yevpatoria, and Arecibo was larger but is no longer operational.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is the Green Bank Telescope, assuming Arecibo is not considered.\n\nBut the question includes Arecibo as an option, even if it's not operational.\n\nMaybe the question is considering only operational telescopes.\n\nIn that case, Green Bank would be the largest among the operational ones listed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's more to consider.\n\nWait, maybe the Arecibo telescope is still included as an option, even though it's not operational, so perhaps the answer is Arecibo, despite its collapse.\n\nBut that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the sizes.\n\nLet me check again:\n\n- Arecibo: 305 meters\n\n- Green Bank: 100 meters\n\n- Effelsberg: 100 meters\n\n- Yevpatoria: 70 meters\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, if Arecibo is included as an option, and it has the largest antenna, then technically, it's the answer.\n\nBut considering it's not operational, perhaps the question expects a different answer.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the question is asking for the largest parabolic antenna among those that are currently operational.\n\nIn that case, Green Bank would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is outdated and doesn't account for Arecibo's collapse.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is Arecibo.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another telescope larger than Green Bank and Effelsberg that I'm not aware of.\n\nWait, maybe the options are incomplete, but based on the choices given...\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the safest answer is Arecibo Telescope, as it had the largest antenna, even if it's not operational.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only operational telescopes, in which case Green Bank would be the answer.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with Green Bank Telescope as the largest operational parabolic antenna among the options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
