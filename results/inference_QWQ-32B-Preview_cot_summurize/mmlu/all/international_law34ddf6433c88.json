So, in simpler terms, it's about a country having the authority to prosecute someone who is not from that country for harming one of its citizens, even if the crime happened outside of that country's borders.\n\nLet's look at the options you provided:\n\nA. It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the offender\n\nThis is actually known as active personality jurisdiction or nationalities jurisdiction. It's when a country exercises jurisdiction based on the nationality of the person who committed the crime, regardless of where the crime was committed or the nationality of the victim.\n\nB. It is jurisdiction based on where the offence was committed\n\nThis is territorial jurisdiction. It's the most common type of jurisdiction, where a country has the authority to prosecute crimes that occur within its territory, regardless of the nationality of the offender or the victim.\n\nC. It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims\n\nThis sounds a lot like passive personality jurisdiction. It's when a country asserts jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victim, especially when the crime is considered serious and the country wants to protect its citizens.\n\nD. It is jurisdiction based on the country where the legal person was registered\n\nThis might refer to jurisdiction over corporations or legal entities based on where they are incorporated or registered. It's not directly related to passive personality jurisdiction.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be C. It is jurisdiction based on the nationality of the victims.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose a U.S. citizen is murdered in France by a French national. Under passive personality jurisdiction, the United States might choose to prosecute the offender, even though the crime occurred in France and both the offender and the primary location are foreign.\n\nIt's important to note that the application of passive personality jurisdiction can sometimes lead to conflicts between countries, as both the country where the crime occurred and the country of the victim might claim jurisdiction. International law and treaties often play a role in resolving such conflicts.\n\nAlso, not all countries recognize or apply passive personality jurisdiction in the same way. Some may only apply it to certain types of crimes, such as terrorism or very serious offenses like murder or kidnapping.\n\nIn summary, passive personality jurisdiction is a legal principle that allows a country to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad by foreign nationals against its own citizens, primarily to protect and seek justice for its nationals regardless of where they are in the world.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
