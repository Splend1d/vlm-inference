I remember that Edgar Schein proposed a model that describes how organizational culture is formed and evolves over time. According to Schein, culture consists of several layers, including artifacts, espoused values, and basic underlying assumptions.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. Shared values - I think this relates to the espoused values layer in Schein's model. Shared values are important in shaping culture.\n\nB. Pre-conceptions - This one sounds a bit unfamiliar in the context of Schein's model. I'm not sure where this fits in.\n\nC. Shared beliefs - Similar to shared values, shared beliefs would also fall under the espoused values layer, I believe.\n\nD. Norms - Norms are behavioral expectations that are part of the organizational culture, and I think they relate to the basic underlying assumptions in Schein's model.\n\nSo, comparing these options to Schein's model, it seems like shared values, shared beliefs, and norms are all components of culture as per Schein. However, \"pre-conceptions\" doesn't directly correspond to any specific layer or component in Schein's model.\n\nMaybe I should double-check Schein's actual model to be sure. According to Schein, the three levels of culture are:\n\n1. Artifacts: The visible, tangible aspects of culture, such as behavior, physical space, and products.\n\n2. Espoused values: The stated values and beliefs that guide decision-making and behavior.\n\n3. Basic underlying assumptions: The taken-for-granted beliefs, perceptions, thoughts, and feelings that are so deeply embedded that they are taken for granted.\n\nShared values would fall under espoused values, shared beliefs could also be considered part of espoused values, and norms might be part of the basic underlying assumptions or artifacts, depending on how they are manifested.\n\nPre-conceptions, on the other hand, aren't specifically mentioned in Schein's model. Pre-conceptions might relate to initial beliefs or assumptions people bring into an organization, but they aren't a formal part of Schein's cultural model.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B. Pre-conceptions.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider if pre-conceptions could be indirectly related to Schein's model. Perhaps they influence the formation of basic underlying assumptions over time. However, in Schein's model, basic underlying assumptions are the result of ongoing organizational learning and adaptation, not just pre-existing beliefs.\n\nSo, overall, I believe pre-conceptions are not a direct part of Schein's model of culture formation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
