                    "text": "So I've got this question here about which structure is most susceptible to damage from acid precipitation. The options are a monument made of granite, a roof made of slate, a tombstone made of marble, and a statue made of gabbro. I need to figure out which one is most likely to be damaged by acid rain.\n\nFirst, I should understand what acid precipitation is. Acid precipitation, or acid rain, is rain, snow, or fog that is polluted by acid substances from the atmosphere. These acids can come from natural sources like volcanoes, but more often they're from human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, which releases sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the air. These gases react with water vapor in the atmosphere to form acids, like sulfuric and nitric acid, which then fall to the ground as acid precipitation.\n\nNow, I need to think about how these acids might affect different materials. The key here is to consider the chemical composition of each material and how reactive it is with acids.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A is a monument made of granite. Granite is an igneous rock, primarily composed of quartz and feldspar, with some minor amounts of mica and amphibole minerals. Quartz is silicon dioxide (SiO2), which is quite resistant to acidic weathering. Feldspar is also relatively resistant to acid attack. So, overall, granite should be fairly resistant to damage from acid precipitation.\n\nOption B is a roof made of slate. Slate is a metamorphic rock, mainly composed of clay minerals and sometimes quartz. It's generally quite resistant to weathering, including acid rain, because its structure is dense and it doesn't react much with acids.\n\nOption C is a tombstone made of marble. Marble is a metamorphic rock derived from limestone, and it's primarily composed of calcite, which is calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Calcium carbonate is known to react with acids. In fact, this is why marble and limestone can be dissolved by acid rain over time, leading to erosion and damage to sculptures and buildings made from these materials.\n\nOption D is a statue made of gabbro. Gabbro is an igneous rock similar to granite but with a higher proportion of darker minerals like pyroxene and amphibole. Like granite, it's composed of minerals that are resistant to acid weathering.\n\nComparing all these options, it seems that marble, being primarily calcium carbonate, is the most reactive with acids among the materials listed. Therefore, the tombstone made of marble would be the most susceptible to damage from acid precipitation.\n\nTo confirm this, I can think about real-world examples. Historical buildings and sculptures made of marble have shown significant damage due to acid rain in many parts of the world. For instance, the Parthenon in Athens and various marble statues in European cities have suffered from acid rain-induced erosion and discoloration.\n\nIn contrast, granite and slate structures tend to weather more slowly and are less affected by acid rain. Gabbro, being similar to granite, would also be resistant.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct answer should be option C, the tombstone made of marble.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
