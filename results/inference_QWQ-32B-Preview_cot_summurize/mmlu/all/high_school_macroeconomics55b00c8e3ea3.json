                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out which list has only Fed actions that will increase the money supply. Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; sell bonds.\n\nFirst, raising reserve requirements means banks have to hold more money in reserve and can't lend out as much. That should decrease the money supply, right? Because less money is being lent out and circulating in the economy.\n\nLowering the discount rate means the Fed is charging banks less to borrow from them. That might encourage banks to borrow more, which could increase the money supply.\n\nSelling bonds means the Fed is taking money out of the economy, because people are giving their money to the Fed in exchange for bonds. That should decrease the money supply.\n\nSo in option A, we have one action that decreases the money supply (raise reserve requirements), one that might increase it (lower discount rate), and one that decreases it (sell bonds). So this list has mixed actions, not all increasing the money supply.\n\nOption B: Raise reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\nAgain, raising reserve requirements decreases the money supply.\n\nLowering the discount rate might increase it.\n\nBuying bonds injects money into the economy, which increases the money supply.\n\nSo here, we have one decreasing, one possibly increasing, and one increasing. Still mixed.\n\nOption C: Raise reserve requirements; raise the discount rate; sell bonds.\n\nRaising reserve requirements decreases the money supply.\n\nRaising the discount rate makes it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Fed, which might decrease borrowing and thus decrease the money supply.\n\nSelling bonds, as before, decreases the money supply.\n\nSo in option C, all actions seem to be decreasing the money supply. That's the opposite of what we're looking for.\n\nOption D: Lower reserve requirements; lower the discount rate; buy bonds.\n\nLowering reserve requirements means banks can lend out more money, which increases the money supply.\n\nLowering the discount rate makes it cheaper for banks to borrow from the Fed, which might encourage more borrowing and increase the money supply.\n\nBuying bonds injects money into the economy, increasing the money supply.\n\nSo in option D, all three actions are aimed at increasing the money supply.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
