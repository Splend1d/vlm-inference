It is expressed in degrees, with 0\u00b0 at the equator and increasing degrees as you move towards the North Pole (90\u00b0N) or the South Pole (90\u00b0S).\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Latitude**: These are imaginary horizontal lines that circle the Earth parallel to the equator. They are used to measure positions north or south of the equator.\n\n- **Longitude**: These are imaginary vertical lines that run from the North Pole to the South Pole, crossing the equator. They are used to measure positions east or west of the Prime Meridian, which is designated as 0\u00b0 longitude and passes through Greenwich, England.\n\n- **Prime Meridian**: This is the line of 0\u00b0 longitude from which east and west longitudes are measured.\n\n- **Global Grid System**: This is a network of latitude and longitude lines used to pinpoint locations on the Earth's surface.\n\nSo, in summary, latitude is the correct term for measuring distances north and south of the equator."
