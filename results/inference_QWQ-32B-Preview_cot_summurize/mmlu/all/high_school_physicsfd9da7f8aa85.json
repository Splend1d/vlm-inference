                    "text": "So I've got this question here about sound waves. It says that a sound wave with frequency f travels through air at speed v. And then it asks, with what speed will a sound wave with frequency 4f travel through the air? The options are A. v/4, B. v, C. 2v, or D. 4v.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall how sound waves work in air. I remember that the speed of sound in a medium like air depends on the properties of the medium itself, such as temperature and pressure, but not on the frequency of the sound wave. So, regardless of the frequency, sound should travel at the same speed in the same medium under the same conditions.\n\nWait a minute, but the question is presenting a scenario where the frequency is increased to 4f, and it's asking for the speed. If the speed of sound is independent of frequency, then the speed should remain v, right? So, the answer should be B. v.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's something I'm missing here. Perhaps in certain conditions, frequency affects the speed of sound. Let me think about the relationship between frequency, wavelength, and speed in sound waves.\n\nI know that for any wave, the relationship between speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (\u03bb) is given by:\n\nv = f * \u03bb\n\nSo, if the frequency increases to 4f, and the speed remains the same, then the wavelength must decrease to maintain the equation. That makes sense because in air, the speed of sound is relatively constant, and changing the frequency just changes the wavelength.\n\nAlternatively, if the speed were to change with frequency, that would imply that the medium behaves differently for different frequencies, which could happen in some materials, like dispersive media. But air is generally considered a non-dispersive medium for sound waves, meaning that the speed should be independent of frequency.\n\nLet me confirm this by thinking about everyday examples. We know that high-frequency sounds and low-frequency sounds travel at the same speed in air; otherwise, we would experience different delays for different frequencies, which isn't the case in normal listening conditions. For example, in a thunderstorm, the rumble of thunder doesn't separate into different frequencies arriving at different times, which suggests that all frequencies travel at the same speed.\n\nAlso, in musical instruments, sound waves of different frequencies travel through the air to our ears at the same speed, allowing us to hear chords and harmonies correctly.\n\nFurthermore, the speed of sound in air is a well-known constant, approximately 343 meters per second at room temperature, and it doesn't change based on the frequency of the sound.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the speed of a sound wave with frequency 4f should still be v in air.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where frequency could affect the speed of sound in air.\n\nI recall that at very high frequencies, or in certain non-ideal conditions, there might be slight variations, but for the purposes of this question, which seems to be at a basic physics level, I don't think that's relevant.\n\nAdditionally, in fluids, including air, the speed of sound is primarily determined by the bulk modulus and the density of the medium, as given by the formula:\n\nv = sqrt(B / \u03c1)\n\nWhere B is the bulk modulus and \u03c1 is the density. Since neither of these properties depends on the frequency of the sound wave, the speed should be independent of frequency.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is B. v.\n\nJust to make sure, let's consider if there's any possibility that the speed could be different.\n\nIf the medium were dispersive, meaning that the speed depends on frequency, then different frequencies would travel at different speeds. However, air is not a dispersive medium for sound waves in the normal range of audible frequencies.\n\nIn optical materials, dispersion is common, which is why we see phenomena like prism spectra, where different colors (frequencies) of light travel at different speeds through the prism. But for sound in air, this isn't the case.\n\nHence, the speed of a 4f sound wave in air should be the same as that of an f sound wave, which is v.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. v.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
