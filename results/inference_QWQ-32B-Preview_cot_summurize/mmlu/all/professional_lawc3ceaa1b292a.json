For safety concerns, the condominium association amended the covenants and restrictions toprohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children. The amendment did not affect families withchildren already living in balcony units. The amendment was promptly recorded. The condominium associationhad a valid covenant providing that all sales had to be approved by the association. Subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, the owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a familywith minor children. Before the closing, the association told the buyers that because they had minor children,they could not buy the unit. The association further told the buyers that numerous units were available in thebuilding without balconies. After receiving this notification, the buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming that the amendmentwas unenforceable because it violated federal fair housing laws. Is there reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred?\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\nB.

                    "text": "This question is about whether a condominium association's amendment to prohibit the sale of balcony units to families with minor children violates federal fair housing laws. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation:\n\n- There are two buildings: one with balconies and one without.\n\n- The association amended the covenants to prohibit future sales of balcony units to families with minor children.\n\n- The amendment doesn't affect families with children already living in balcony units.\n\n- The amendment was recorded promptly.\n\n- The association has a valid covenant requiring all sales to be approved by the association.\n\n- After the amendment, an owner of a balcony unit contracted to sell it to a family with minor children.\n\n- Before closing, the association informed the buyers they couldn't purchase the unit because of the children.\n\n- The association also told the buyers that there are numerous units available in the building without balconies.\n\n- The buyers complained to a fair housing agency, claiming the amendment violates federal fair housing laws.\n\nNow, the question is whether there's reasonable cause to believe a violation has occurred.\n\nTo answer this, I need to know about federal fair housing laws, specifically regarding familial status. The Fair Housing Act protects against discrimination in housing based on several protected classes, including familial status, which includes families with children under 18.\n\nSo, if the amendment is seen as discriminating against families with children by prohibiting them from buying balcony units, it could be a violation.\n\nHowever, there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. The amendment doesn't prevent families with children from living in the condominium; they can buy units without balconies.\n\n2. The amendment is based on safety concerns related to balconies.\n\n3. Families with children who already live in balcony units are not affected.\n\nLet's look at each answer choice:\n\nA. No, because families with children are allowed to purchase units in the building without balconies.\n\nThis suggests that since there are other units available, there's no violation. But the Fair Housing Act also prohibits steering or limiting housing opportunities based on protected classes. By restricting where families with children can live, it might still be a violation.\n\nB. No, because the amendment is based on legitimate safety issues.\n\nSafety is a valid concern, but the question is whether the restriction is necessary to achieve that safety goal. If there are less restrictive ways to address safety, this might not be a valid defense.\n\nC. Yes, because families with children are already living in units with balconies.\n\nThis points out that the amendment doesn't apply to current residents, which might suggest that it's only affecting future buyers. However, the Fair Housing Act applies to sales and rentals, so restricting sales based on familial status could still be a violation.\n\nD. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n\nThis suggests that by restricting families with children to certain units, it's a form of segregation, which would violate the Fair Housing Act.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the best answer is D. Yes, because families with children cannot be segregated within the condominium development.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe Fair Housing Act not only prohibits outright discrimination but also practices that have a discriminatory effect or that segregate based on protected classes. By restricting families with children to units without balconies, the amendment could be seen as segregating them within the development.\n\nEven though safety is a concern, and there are units available without balconies, the restriction limits the housing opportunities for families with children, potentially steering them away from certain areas of the development.\n\nMoreover, the fact that existing families with children in balcony units are not affected might suggest that the restriction is only impacting future buyers, which could still be a violation.\n\nTherefore, there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, specifically regarding segregation based on familial status.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
