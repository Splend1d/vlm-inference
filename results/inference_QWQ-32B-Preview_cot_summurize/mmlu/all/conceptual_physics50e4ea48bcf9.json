                    "text": "This question is about the Doppler effect, which describes how the frequency of a wave changes for an observer moving relative to the wave source. In this case, the wave is sound from a siren on a fire engine.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Speed: The speed of sound in air is determined by the properties of the air, such as temperature and pressure, not by the motion of the source or the observer. So, the speed of sound should remain the same whether the fire engine is stationary or moving.\n\nB. Frequency: Frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a point per unit time. When the source is moving towards the observer, the waves are compressed, leading to a higher frequency. This is why the siren sounds higher pitched as the fire engine approaches.\n\nC. Wavelength: Wavelength is the distance between consecutive crests of a wave. Since speed equals wavelength times frequency, and the speed of sound doesn't change, an increase in frequency would mean a decrease in wavelength.\n\nSo, if frequency increases, wavelength should decrease, not increase.\n\nGiven this, the correct answer should be B. frequency.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. The question says \"increased\" frequency, which matches the Doppler effect for an approaching source. However, the wavelength would actually decrease, not increase, for an approaching source.\n\nBut the options say \"increased\" wavelength, which would be incorrect in this scenario.\n\nOption D says \"All of these,\" but that can't be right because we've established that speed remains the same and wavelength decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
