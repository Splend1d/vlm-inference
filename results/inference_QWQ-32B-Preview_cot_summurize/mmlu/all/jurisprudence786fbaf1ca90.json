                    "text": "Let's dive into this question about Savigny's Volksgeist. So, Volksgeist is a concept developed by the German jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny. It's all about the idea that law is an expression of a nation's spirit or culture. Basically, Savigny believed that law isn't just something made by rulers or written down in codes; it's deeply embedded in the customs, traditions, and shared beliefs of a people.\n\nOption A says, \"A society's law is a reflection of its culture.\" That sounds right up Savigny's alley. He would definitely agree with that because that's the core of his Volksgeist idea. So, that's likely to follow logically from his notion.\n\nOption B, \"Law is like language.\" Hmm, that's interesting. Savigny did compare law to language in the sense that both evolve organically within a society. Just like language is a means of communication that develops naturally among people, law is a system that emerges from their interactions and customs. So, this also aligns with his thoughts.\n\nOption C, \"Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.\" This sounds more like the command theory of law, which was propounded by thinkers like John Austin and later developed by H.L.A. Hart. According to this view, law is essentially the commands issued by a sovereign authority that has the power to enforce them. This is in contrast to Savigny's idea that law grows naturally from the people's spirit.\n\nOption D, \"Law is an integral element of the social fabric.\" This seems consistent with Savigny's perspective because he saw law as an organic part of a society's development, intertwined with its culture and customs.\n\nSo, if I have to pick the statement that's least likely to follow logically from Savigny's Volksgeist, it would be Option C: \"Law is the deliberate expression of a sovereign's will.\" This is because Savigny emphasized the organic growth of law from the people's spirit, whereas the command theory focuses on law being imposed by a sovereign authority.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a way that Savigny's ideas could accommodate the sovereign's will. Well, Savigny didn't entirely dismiss the role of legislators; he just believed that even when laws are formally enacted, they should be in harmony with the existing Volksgeist. So, while a sovereign might express their will through law, that law would only be legitimate and effective if it aligns with the people's spirit.\n\nTherefore, Option C is still the least likely to follow from Savigny's notion because it places the sovereign's will as the primary source of law, which contradicts Savigny's emphasis on law arising from the people's customs and culture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
