                    "text": "Astrovirus epidemics are primarily controlled through basic knowledge of hand washing and food hygiene. Astroviruses are primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often via contaminated food and water or poor hygiene practices. Therefore, promoting hand hygiene, especially before handling food and after using the toilet, is crucial. Additionally, ensuring that food is properly cooked and water is safe to drink can significantly reduce the spread of astroviruses.\n\nVaccination (option A) is not currently available for astroviruses, as there are no licensed vaccines against them. Passive antibody therapy (option B) is also not a standard or practical method for controlling astrovirus epidemics due to its high cost and limited availability. Quarantine (option D) can be used in some settings to control the spread of infectious diseases, but for astroviruses, which are common and often cause mild illness, it is not typically employed.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is C: Basic knowledge of hand washing and food hygiene.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
