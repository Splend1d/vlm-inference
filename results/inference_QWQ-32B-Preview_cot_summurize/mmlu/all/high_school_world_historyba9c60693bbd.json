It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called \"cardinals\"? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.\n\u2014Martin Luther, Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation\nIn his letter, Martin Luther avoided speaking about which of the following topics?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this letter from Martin Luther addressed to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation. He's talking about reforming the Christian estate and how things are messed up, especially in Germany. He mentions that the Romanists (which I think refers to the Roman Catholic Church) have protected themselves with three walls: that the temporal power can't judge spiritual matters, that only the Pope can interpret Scriptures, and that only the Pope can call a council.\n\nHe then goes on to talk about what should be discussed in church councils and criticizes the Pope's lifestyle, saying he lives in more pomp than any king or emperor. He also mentions cardinals and how they're used to bring church properties under Roman control, which harms the service of God.\n\nThe question is asking which topic Luther avoided speaking about in his letter, and the options are:\n\nA. The wealth of the church\n\nB. The power of the clergy\n\nC. The sale of indulgences\n\nD. The political nature of the church\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nFirst, option A is about the wealth of the church. In the letter, Luther talks about the Pope's worldly pomp and the riches of cardinals, who control many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices. So, he's clearly discussing the wealth of the church.\n\nOption B is about the power of the clergy. He mentions the three walls the Romanists have built to protect their power: jurisdiction over spirituality, exclusive interpretation of Scriptures, and the sole authority to call councils. So, he's definitely addressing the power of the clergy.\n\nOption C is about the sale of indulgences. Now, indulgences were a big issue that triggered the Reformation, and Luther was famous for protesting against them. However, in this particular letter, I don't see any mention of indulgences. He talks about the misuse of church wealth and power, but specifically regarding the Pope's lifestyle and the role of cardinals.\n\nOption D is about the political nature of the church. Luther discusses the separation between temporal and spiritual powers, mentioning that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over the spirituality. He's delving into how church and state relate, which is definitely about the political nature of the church.\n\nSo, comparing all these, it seems that the sale of indulgences is the topic that Luther avoided speaking about in this letter. He focuses on the wealth and power of the church, and the political aspects, but doesn't mention indulgences specifically.\n\nMaybe he addressed indulgences in other writings, but in this particular letter, it's not mentioned.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. The sale of indulgences.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
