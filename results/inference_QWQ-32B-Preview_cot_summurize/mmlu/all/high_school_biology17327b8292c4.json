                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand what happens when a potato, which is made up of cells containing water and dissolved substances (solutes), is placed in pure water. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, it's important to know about the concept of osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration through a semi-permeable membrane, aiming to equalize the solute concentrations on both sides.\n\nIn this scenario, the potato cells have a certain concentration of solutes inside them, and the surrounding water is pure, meaning it has no solutes (or a very low concentration compared to the potato cells).\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\n- Inside the potato cells: higher solute concentration\n\n- Surrounding water: lower solute concentration\n\nGiven this, water will move from the area of low solute concentration (the pure water) to the area of high solute concentration (the potato cells) through the cell membranes, which are semi-permeable.\n\nThis movement of water into the potato cells will cause the cells to swell and become turgid, which is a good thing for the potato, keeping it firm and crisp.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Water moves from the potato into the surrounding water.\n\nThis would be the case if the surrounding water had a higher solute concentration than the potato cells, but in this case, the water is pure, so this is unlikely.\n\nB. Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.\n\nThis aligns with our understanding of osmosis, where water moves from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration.\n\nC. Potato cells plasmolyze.\n\nPlasmolysis is when a cell loses water and the plasma membrane pulls away from the cell wall in a hypertonic environment (where the surrounding solution has a higher solute concentration than the cell). Since we have pure water here, which is hypotonic to the potato cells, plasmolysis wouldn't occur; instead, the cells would gain water.\n\nD. Solutes in the water move into the potato.\n\nThe water is pure, so there are no solutes to move into the potato. The movement is primarily of water molecules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Water moves from the surrounding water into the potato.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
