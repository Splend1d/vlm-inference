                    "text": "I think I know this one, but let me make sure. Parvovirus is a serious disease that affects animals, and I believe it's mostly associated with dogs. So, out of the options given\u2014hamster, cat, dog, and bird\u2014I'm going to guess that dogs should be vaccinated for parvovirus.\n\nBut wait, I remember that cats can also get a form of parvovirus. In fact, there's something called feline panleukopenia, which is caused by a type of parvovirus. So, maybe both cats and dogs should be vaccinated for it.\n\nLet me think about hamsters and birds. I don't recall hearing about parvovirus in hamsters or birds. Maybe they don't get it, or maybe it's not a concern for them. So, perhaps only cats and dogs need to be vaccinated for parvovirus.\n\nBut to be honest, I'm a bit unsure about cats. I know that dogs are commonly vaccinated against parvovirus, and it's a core vaccine for them. For cats, the feline panleukopenia vaccine might cover parvovirus, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nMaybe I should look up a little bit about parvovirus in different animals. I know that there are different strains of parvovirus that affect different species. For example, canine parvovirus affects dogs, and feline parvovirus affects cats. There might be parvoviruses that affect other animals too, like hamsters or birds, but I don't know.\n\nIn any case, since the question is about household pets and which ones should be vaccinated for parvovirus, I think the answer is probably dogs and possibly cats. Maybe the correct answer is C. dog, but since cats can also get parvovirus, perhaps B. cat is also correct.\n\nWait, the question says \"which of these household pets,\" and there are four options: hamster, cat, dog, and bird. If I have to choose one, I would go with dog, but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nLet me consider the severity of parvovirus in dogs. It's a highly contagious and life-threatening disease that can cause severe gastrointestinal issues, among other problems. Vaccination is crucial for puppies and dogs to prevent this disease. So, definitely, dogs should be vaccinated for parvovirus.\n\nNow, for cats, feline panleukopenia is caused by feline parvovirus, which is similar to canine parvovirus. It's also a serious disease that can be prevented through vaccination. So, cats should also be vaccinated for their version of parvovirus.\n\nBut perhaps the question is specifically about canine parvovirus, and that's why dog is the correct answer. Or maybe it's referring to both canine and feline parvoviruses, in which case both cat and dog would be correct answers.\n\nHmm, but looking back at the options, only one can be chosen: A. hamster, B. cat, C. dog, D. bird. So, I need to pick one.\n\nGiven that parvovirus is more commonly associated with dogs, and that canine parvovirus is a well-known and serious disease, I think C. dog is the correct answer.\n\nAlthough cats also get parvovirus, it might be that the question is focusing on the more common understanding of parvovirus in dogs. Plus, feline panleukopenia might not be referred to as parvovirus in common parlance.\n\nSo, my final answer is C. dog.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
