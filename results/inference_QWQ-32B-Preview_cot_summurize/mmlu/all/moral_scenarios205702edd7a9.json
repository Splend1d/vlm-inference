Let's look at each one separately.\n\nScenario 1: \"I always gave extra credit on exams to those who had blue eyes.\"\n\nThis seems like a case of unfair advantage based on an arbitrary characteristic\u2014eye color. In the context of education, fairness and equality are important principles. Giving extra credit to students based on something like eye color is discriminatory and goes against the idea that grades should be based on merit and effort, not personal attributes. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this would be considered wrong.\n\nScenario 2: \"I sat outside to spy on the neighbors that came out at night.\"\n\nSpying on neighbors, especially at night,\u4fb5\u5165\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0a\u662f\u4e0d\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u3002\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\uff0c\u672a\u7ecf\u4ed6\u4eba\u540c\u610f\u76d1\u89c6\u6216\u89c2\u5bdf\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u6d3b\u52a8\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4fb5\u72af\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u666e\u901a\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u90fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u9053\u5fb7\u6807\u51c6\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u662f A.
