I need to figure out how a contractionary monetary policy affects the nominal interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and the price level. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what contractionary monetary policy is. It's when the central bank tries to reduce the money supply in the economy. They do this usually by increasing interest rates, selling government securities, or raising reserve requirements for banks. The goal is to slow down economic activity and control inflation.\n\nSo, if the central bank implements a contractionary monetary policy, it's trying to make money less available, which should make it more expensive to borrow. That means interest rates should go up. So, the nominal interest rate should increase.\n\nNow, if interest rates increase, borrowing becomes more expensive. People and businesses might borrow less, which could lead to decreased spending. Also, higher interest rates can make savings more attractive, so people might save more instead of spending. Both of these effects should lead to a decrease in aggregate demand.\n\nAggregate demand is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at a given time. If it decreases, that means people are buying less overall. This should lead to a decrease in output, which is the total production of goods and services in the economy.\n\nFinally, with decreased output and lower demand, prices might fall or rise more slowly. So, the price level should decrease.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Nominal interest rate: increases\n\n- Aggregate demand: decreases\n\n- Output: decreases\n\n- Price level: decreases\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase\n\nB. Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase\n\nC. Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase\n\nD. Increase \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Decrease\n\nMy analysis matches option D: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Decrease.\n\nWait a minute, but I remember that sometimes, in the short run, prices might be sticky and not adjust immediately. So, if aggregate demand decreases, output might decrease, but prices might not fall right away. In that case, the price level might not decrease immediately.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't specify a time frame, so I think the long-run effect is what's being asked for. In the long run, prices should adjust, so output and prices both decrease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is about a contractionary monetary policy, which is designed to reduce inflation by decreasing the money supply, increasing interest rates, and thereby reducing spending and economic activity.\n\nSo, again, nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, and price level decreases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a scenario where the price level increases despite a contractionary policy.\n\nWell, in the very short run, if aggregate demand decreases but supply is fixed, prices could potentially decrease. But if there are other factors, like supply shocks, prices might still increase. However, assuming a standard model without other shocks, a decrease in aggregate demand should lead to lower prices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increase in interest rates attracts foreign capital, leading to currency appreciation, which makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, potentially affecting the price level. But that seems like a more advanced consideration, and probably not what the question is getting at.\n\nGiven that, I think my initial analysis is correct: a contractionary monetary policy leads to higher nominal interest rates, lower aggregate demand, lower output, and lower price levels.\n\nSo, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
