It says the firm contracts with clients to conduct a complete marketing research project, which includes data collection, analysis, and reporting. So, it's handling the whole process from start to finish.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Consultant.\n\nB. Field agency.\n\nC. Full-service agency.\n\nD. Tabulation agency.\n\nFirst, what's a consultant in marketing research? I think a consultant is someone who provides expert advice based on their knowledge and experience. They might help with strategy or interpretation of data, but they might not necessarily handle the entire research process.\n\nA field agency, option B, sounds like it might be involved in the data collection phase. Maybe they handle surveys or interviews in the field, but probably not the full analysis and reporting.\n\nOption C is a full-service agency. This sounds promising because it suggests that the agency provides comprehensive services covering the entire research process.\n\nLastly, a tabulation agency, option D, probably specializes in organizing and summarizing data, maybe creating tables and statistics, but likely not doing the full data collection and analysis.\n\nGiven that the firm is contracted to do the entire marketing research project, including data collection, analysis, and reporting, it seems like they are providing full-service capabilities.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. Full-service agency.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe there's a specific definition I should recall.\n\nIn marketing research, different types of firms specialize in various aspects of the research process. A full-service agency typically offers a complete range of services, from designing the research methodology to collecting data, analyzing it, and presenting the findings in a report.\n\nConsultants might be more focused on providing strategic insights or interpreting the data, but not necessarily doing the entire research project.\n\nField agencies are usually involved in the data collection phase, such as conducting surveys or observations in the field.\n\nTabulation agencies are more about processing and summarizing the data collected.\n\nSo, based on this, a firm that handles the complete project from data collection to analysis and reporting is indeed a full-service agency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Full-service agency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
