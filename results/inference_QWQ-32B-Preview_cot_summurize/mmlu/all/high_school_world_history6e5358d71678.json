                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two sources: a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal in 1526, and instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo in 1512. The question is about the tone of the first letter and what it best reflects in terms of developments in early modern Africa.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the tone of King Afonso's letter. He's talking about how his people are being kidnapped and sold to white men in his kingdoms. He seems concerned and perhaps upset about this practice, calling it an \"inconvenience\" that is \"of little service to God.\" He mentions that his people are being seized, even freed and exempt men, and sometimes even noblemen and relatives are being kidnapped and sold. So, the tone seems serious, concerned, and maybe even a bit frustrated or angry about this situation.\n\nNow, I need to see which of the options this tone best reflects.\n\nOption A: A growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods. Well, he does mention that his people are keenly desirous of European wares and things, which suggests that there is some dependence or desire for European goods. But the main focus of his letter is on the negative consequences of this trade, specifically the kidnapping and selling of his people. So, while there is a mention of trade, the tone is more about the negative aspects rather than the dependence itself.\n\nOption B: Vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest. This seems a bit different from what's in the letter. King Afonso doesn't seem to be resisting European expeditions directly; he's more concerned about the harmful effects of the trade on his people. He's not explicitly resisting conquest, so this might not be the best fit.\n\nOption C: The establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline. Again, while trade is mentioned, the main concern is about the kidnapping and selling of his people. There's no direct mention of trading posts here, so this might not be the primary reflection of the tone.\n\nOption D: The consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast of Africa. This seems a bit removed from the content of the letter. King Afonso is talking about internal issues within his kingdom related to trade and the treatment of his people, not about the consolidation of states.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem to directly match the tone of concern and frustration about the kidnapping and selling of his people. Maybe I need to look deeper.\n\nWait, perhaps the tone reflects the growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, as indicated in option A. He mentions that his people are voraciously desirous of European wares, which leads them to participate in activities like kidnapping for trade. So, perhaps the tone reflects the negative consequences of this growing dependence on European trade.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it reflects the consolidation of states, as in option D, but I don't see a direct connection there.\n\nLet me look back at the letter. He's addressing the kidnapping of his people, including noblemen and relatives, which suggests that this is a widespread problem affecting all levels of society. He's writing to the King of Portugal, perhaps seeking some action or understanding about this issue.\n\nNow, considering the time period, early modern Africa, around the 16th century, there were indeed developments such as increasing trade with Europe, the establishment of trading posts, and the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the tone best reflects the negative impacts of increasing trade with Europe, specifically the slave trade.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none directly mention the slave trade. Option A talks about dependence on trade for manufactured goods, but as I thought earlier, the tone is more about the negative consequences rather than the dependence itself.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the letter is reflecting the internal struggles within the Kingdom of Kongo due to external pressures from European trade.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's reflecting the consolidation of states, as in option D, but I don't see a clear link there.\n\nWait, maybe option D is about the consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast, which might be related to responding to European trade and influence. But again, the letter is more about the internal problems caused by the trade.\n\nPerhaps the best answer is A, growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, because that dependence is leading to these negative consequences that King Afonso is complaining about.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is not directly obvious, and I need to consider the context more carefully.\n\nLet me look at Source 2, the instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo in 1512. He's saying that the expedition has cost a lot, and it would be unreasonable to send it back empty-handed. He instructs the envoy to make the King of Kongo understand that he should fill the ships with slaves, copper, or ivory.\n\nThis shows that the Portuguese are pushing for trade, specifically for slaves, copper, and ivory, which were valuable commodities at the time.\n\nComparing this with King Afonso's letter in 1526, it seems that the trade that was being encouraged by the Portuguese in 1512 has led to the problematic situation described by King Afonso 14 years later.\n\nSo, the tone of King Afonso's letter is likely reflecting the negative impacts of this growing trade, particularly the slave trade, on his kingdom.\n\nGiven that, option A, about growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, might be partially correct, but it doesn't fully capture the tone of concern about the treatment of his people.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tone best reflects the consolidation of states, as in option D, but I don't see a direct connection there.\n\nWait, perhaps the establishment of Portuguese trading posts, option C, is relevant here. If Portuguese trading posts were established along the coastline, that could be leading to the kinds of problems King Afonso is describing.\n\nBut again, his letter is more about the internal effects on his kingdom rather than the presence of trading posts.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the tone is one of frustration with the Portuguese activities and their impact on his kingdom, and that this frustration is best reflected in option A, the growing dependence on trade.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tone is one of resistance to European expeditions, as in option B, but again, it's more about the consequences of the trade than direct resistance to conquest.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nLet me consider the time period again. In the early 16th century, the transatlantic slave trade was beginning to develop, and European powers like Portugal were establishing trade relationships with African kingdoms.\n\nKing Afonso's letter suggests that while there is trade between Kongo and Portugal, there are also abuses associated with it, such as kidnapping and selling of his people.\n\nSo, perhaps the tone best reflects the growing dependence on trade with Europe, as in option A, because it's that trade that is leading to these problems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's reflecting the consolidation of states, as in option D, but I don't see a direct link there.\n\nWait, perhaps the consolidation of states along the Atlantic coast is related to responding to European trade, and King Afonso's letter is reflecting the internal tensions caused by this external pressure.\n\nBut still, that seems a bit of a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is none of the above, but since I have to choose, perhaps A is the best fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tone best reflects vigorous resistance to European expeditions, as in option B, but again, the letter doesn't seem to be actively resisting; it's more about expressing concern about the current state of affairs.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the tone is one of pleading or appealing to the King of Portugal to address these issues, which could suggest that there is a dependency on the trade, and King Afonso is trying to manage its negative effects.\n\nIn that case, option A makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the establishment of Portuguese trading posts, as in option C, but again, that's not directly addressed in the letter.\n\nSo, after considering all options, I think A is the best answer: a growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, which is leading to these problematic consequences that King Afonso is addressing in his letter.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
