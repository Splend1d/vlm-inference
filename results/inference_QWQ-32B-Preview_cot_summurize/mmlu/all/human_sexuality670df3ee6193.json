Let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says, \"They are generally middle-aged.\" Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I think voyeurs can be of any age, really. It's more about their interests and behaviors rather than their age group. So, I'm going to put a question mark next to that.\n\nOption B says, \"They are usually dangerous.\" Now, this one makes me a bit uneasy. Are voyeurs dangerous? Well, voyeurism is about observing others without their knowledge, usually for sexual gratification. While it's definitely a problematic behavior and\u4fb5\u72af\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eba\u7684\u9690\u79c1\uff0cbut does that make them dangerous? I guess it depends on the context. Some voyeurs might engage in more harmful behaviors, but not all of them are necessarily dangerous. So, maybe this isn't always true.\n\nOption C says, \"They typically want to view friends' sexual behaviors.\" Hmm, that seems unlikely. Voyeurs usually want to observe people without their knowledge, right? So, it's more about strangers or people they don't know well. Observing friends' sexual behaviors would probably require some level of consent or knowledge, which contradicts the nature of voyeurism. So, I don't think this is correct.\n\nOption D says, \"They typically want to observe strangers' activities.\" This seems more accurate. Voyeurs are generally interested in observing people they don't know, often in private moments, without those people's awareness. That aligns with the typical definition of voyeurism.\n\nLet me think about this again. Maybe I should consider what voyeurism is really about. Voyeurism is a paraphilia where individuals derive sexual pleasure from observing others who are naked, in the process of undressing, or engaging in sexual activities. The key here is that the observed persons are unaware of being observed.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the most accurate. They want to observe strangers' activities, typically in private moments.\n\nOption A about being middle-aged doesn't seem relevant. Age isn't a determining factor in voyeurism. People of all ages can exhibit voyeuristic behaviors.\n\nOption B about being dangerous is too vague. While some voyeurs might engage in harmful actions, it's not a universal trait of voyeurs.\n\nOption C about wanting to view friends' sexual behaviors contradicts the secretive nature of voyeurism.\n\nTherefore, I believe the correct answer is D: They typically want to observe strangers' activities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
