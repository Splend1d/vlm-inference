So, when we talk about micromarketing, we're focusing on reaching potential buyers who share similar traits, rather than trying to appeal to a broad, general audience.\n\nLet's look at each option to see which one best describes the target of micromarketing.\n\nOption A says: \"have excess disposable income.\" While having more disposable income can make someone a more attractive target for certain types of marketing, micromarketing isn't exclusively directed at people with excess disposable income. It's more about targeting specific groups based on various factors, not just their financial status.\n\nOption B: \"are between the ages of 8 and 14.\" This seems too narrow and age-specific. Micromarketing can target any age group, depending on the product or service. It's not limited to children aged 8 to 14.\n\nOption C: \"share similar attitudes and behaviors.\" This sounds right. Micromarketing involves segmenting the market into smaller groups that have common characteristics, such as similar attitudes, interests, behaviors, or needs. By understanding these similarities, marketers can create more targeted and personalized campaigns that resonate with each group.\n\nOption D: \"have opted out of customized marketing.\" This seems counterintuitive. Micromarketing is all about customization and personalization. If someone has opted out of customized marketing, they probably don't want to receive targeted advertisements, so it wouldn't make sense for micromarketing to be directed at them.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C seems to be the most accurate description of who micromarketing is directed at: potential buyers who share similar attitudes and behaviors.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
