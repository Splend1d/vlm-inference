                    "text": "Let's see. I remember watching \"The Hogan Family\" when I was younger, but I don't recall all the characters off the top of my head. I do know that it was a sitcom that aired in the 1990s, and it was about a Irish-American family living in Brooklyn.\n\nNow, the question is asking about a former \"Today\" show personality who played a neighbor on \"The Hogan Family.\" So, I need to think about who among these options was involved in both \"The Today Show\" and this particular sitcom.\n\nOption A is Jane Pauley. She was indeed a \"Today\" show personality, co-hosting for many years. But I don't recall her being on \"The Hogan Family.\" Maybe she was a guest or something, but not a regular cast member, I think.\n\nOption B is Willard Scott. Ah, Willard Scott. He was also a \"Today\" show personality, known for his weather forecasts and his folksy personality. I think he might have had a role on \"The Hogan Family,\" but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption C is Deborah Norville. She was a \"Today\" show anchor as well, but again, I don't recall her being on \"The Hogan Family.\"\n\nOption D is Joe Garagiola. Hmm, Joe Garagiola is known more for his work in sports broadcasting, particularly on baseball games. I'm not sure if he was on \"The Hogan Family.\"\n\nLet me try to recall more about \"The Hogan Family.\" The main characters were the Hogan family, and they had neighbors, right? I think there was a neighbor named Mr. Scanlon, but I'm not sure if any of these options played that role.\n\nWait, I remember that Willard Scott played a character on \"The Hogan Family.\" I think he played a neighbor named Father Barry, a friendly priest who was always helping out the Hogan family. That sounds right.\n\nLet me double-check the other options quickly. Jane Pauley, as far as I know, didn't act on sitcoms besides \"The Morning Show,\" which was a different show. Deborah Norville has done some acting, but I don't think she was on \"The Hogan Family.\" Joe Garagiola is more known for sports, so maybe not.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. Willard Scott.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
