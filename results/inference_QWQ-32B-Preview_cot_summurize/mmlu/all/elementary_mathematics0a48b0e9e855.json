                    "text": "Let's see. Marguerite has been scoring between 75 and 89 on her previous spelling tests, and she just got a 100 on her next test. We need to figure out which statement is true regarding the mode, mean, and median of her test scores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring score in the set.\n\n- **Mean**: The average of the scores.\n\n- **Median**: The middle value when the scores are ordered from least to greatest.\n\nGiven that she has been scoring between 75 and 89, and now she has a 100, which is higher than her previous scores, I need to see how this new score affects the mode, mean, and median.\n\nLet's consider each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: The mode will increase.**\n\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring score. If she has been scoring between 75 and 89, and now she has a 100, which is only one score, it's unlikely that 100 becomes the new mode unless she had multiple scores of 100 before, which she didn't. So, adding one 100 might not change the mode, or if it does, it wouldn't necessarily increase it because the previous mode was between 75 and 89, and 100 is higher. But since it's just one score, it's more likely that the mode remains the same or there is no mode if all scores are unique. Therefore, this option is probably not correct.\n\n**Option B: The mean will increase.**\n\nThe mean is the average of the scores. If she adds a score that is higher than her previous scores, the average should increase. Let's think about this with an example.\n\nSuppose she had three previous scores: 75, 80, and 85. The mean would be (75 + 80 + 85)/3 = 240/3 = 80.\n\nNow, she adds a 100. The new mean would be (75 + 80 + 85 + 100)/4 = 340/4 = 85.\n\nSo, the mean increased from 80 to 85. This makes sense because she added a score higher than the previous average.\n\nBut let's consider if all her previous scores were 89, the highest of the previous range.\n\nSuppose she had three 89s. Mean = (89 + 89 + 89)/3 = 267/3 = 89.\n\nAdding a 100: (89 + 89 + 89 + 100)/4 = 367/4 = 91.75.\n\nAgain, the mean increases.\n\nSo, it seems that adding a score higher than the previous scores will increase the mean. Therefore, option B is likely correct.\n\n**Option C: The mean will decrease.**\n\nThis is the opposite of option B. Since we've established that adding a higher score increases the mean, this option is not correct.\n\n**Option D: The median will decrease.**\n\nThe median is the middle value when the scores are ordered. If she adds a score higher than her previous scores, it should be the new highest score, which might shift the median, but likely not decrease it.\n\nLet's use the same examples as before.\n\nFirst example:\n\nPrevious scores: 75, 80, 85. Median = 80.\n\nAdd 100: 75, 80, 85, 100. Median is the average of 80 and 85, which is 82.5.\n\nSo, the median increased from 80 to 82.5.\n\nSecond example:\n\nPrevious scores: 89, 89, 89. Median = 89.\n\nAdd 100: 89, 89, 89, 100. Median is the average of the two middle values, 89 and 89, which is still 89.\n\nSo, the median didn't change.\n\nIn both cases, the median didn't decrease; it either increased or stayed the same.\n\nTherefore, option D is not correct.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct statement is that the mean will increase.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
