                    "text": "Down Syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality. Specifically, it results from the presence of all or part of an extra copy of chromosome 21. This additional genetic material disrupts the normal development of the body and brain, leading to the characteristic features of Down Syndrome.\n\nTo provide more context:\n\n- **Option A: a dominant gene** - Down Syndrome is not caused by a single dominant gene. Genetic conditions caused by dominant genes are inherited from one parent who has the condition.\n\n- **Option B: two recessive genes** - Down Syndrome is also not caused by two recessive genes. Recessive genetic conditions typically require both parents to be carriers of the recessive gene for a child to be affected.\n\n- **Option C: a chromosomal abnormality** - This is correct. Down Syndrome is caused by trisomy 21, which means there are three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two. This can occur due to errors in cell division during the development of the egg or sperm, or during early embryonic development.\n\n- **Option D: an X-linked gene** - Down Syndrome is not X-linked. X-linked conditions are those in which the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and they typically affect males more frequently than females.\n\nUnderstanding that Down Syndrome is caused by a chromosomal abnormality is crucial for accurate diagnosis, genetic counseling, and managing the condition.\n\n**Reference:**\n\n- National Down Syndrome Society.
