The options are:\n\nA. result in lower domestic prices.\n\nB. sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.\n\nC. lower the amount of the product sold domestically.\n\nD. raise the amount of the product sold domestically.\n\nI need to think about what tariffs and quotas actually do. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, right? So, when a country imposes a tariff, it makes imported products more expensive. Quotas, on the other hand, limit the quantity of a product that can be imported.\n\nSo, if tariffs make imports more expensive, that should affect domestic prices. Maybe domestic producers can charge higher prices because the imported alternatives are now more expensive. That might mean domestic prices go up, not down. So, option A says \"result in lower domestic prices,\" but that doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says \"sometimes raise and sometimes lower the amount of the product sold domestically.\" Hmm, that seems possible. If tariffs make imports more expensive, maybe people buy more domestic products, increasing the amount sold domestically. But if the domestic supply is limited, prices might go up, which could reduce the quantity sold. So, it's a bit unclear.\n\nOption C says \"lower the amount of the product sold domestically.\" If tariffs make imports more expensive, people might buy more domestic products, which would mean more is sold domestically, not less. So, this seems opposite.\n\nOption D says \"raise the amount of the product sold domestically.\" That makes sense because if imports are taxed or limited, people might buy more from domestic producers.\n\nWait, but I remember that tariffs and quotas can have different effects depending on the elasticity of demand and supply. Maybe sometimes they raise domestic sales, sometimes they don't.\n\nLet me think about quotas specifically. If there's a quota on imports, only a certain amount can come in. That might mean that domestic producers can sell more because there's less competition from imports.\n\nBut, if the quota is high, maybe it doesn't affect domestic sales much. If the quota is low, domestic sales might increase more.\n\nSo, overall, it seems like tariffs and quotas generally tend to increase the amount of the product sold domestically by making imports more expensive or less available.\n\nBut option B says they sometimes raise and sometimes lower domestic sales, which might be possible in certain scenarios, but generally, I think they raise domestic sales.\n\nWait, maybe it's different for tariffs and quotas. Tariffs make imports more expensive, which should shift the demand towards domestic products. Quotas limit the quantity, which might also make imports more expensive if there's high demand.\n\nSo, both tariffs and quotas tend to make imports less attractive, leading to higher domestic sales.\n\nTherefore, option D seems the most correct.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe there are cases where domestic sales decrease.\n\nFor example, if the domestic industry can't meet the demand, and imports are restricted, maybe total consumption decreases, which could mean domestic sales don't necessarily rise.\n\nOr, if the domestic product is of lower quality compared to imports, and imports are restricted, people might buy less of the domestic product.\n\nBut, generally, I think domestic sales increase when imports are restricted or made more expensive.\n\nSo, I think the answer is D. raise the amount of the product sold domestically.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
