So, the question is: \"Which Guru donned the two swords symbolizing temporal and spiritual authority?\" and the options are Guru Nanak, Guru Arjan, Guru Hargobind, and Guru Ram Das.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about the Sikh Gurus and their contributions to Sikhism. There were ten Sikh Gurus, starting with Guru Nanak and ending with Guru Gobind Singh. Each Guru played a significant role in shaping the religion and its practices.\n\nGuru Nanak was the founder of Sikhism. He emphasized the importance of one God and the equality of all humans. He traveled far and wide, spreading his message of peace and devotion.\n\nGuru Arjan was the fifth Guru. He compiled the Adi Granth, which is the holy scripture of Sikhism, and installed it in the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. He also constructed the Akal Takht, which is the highest seat of earthly authority of the Khalsa Panth.\n\nGuru Hargobind was the sixth Guru. He introduced the concept of Miri and Piri, which represent temporal (political) and spiritual authority, respectively. He wore two swords, one representing Miri and the other Piri, to symbolize that both aspects are important and interconnected.\n\nGuru Ram Das was the fourth Guru. He established the city of Amritsar and excavated the sacred pool that became the Sarovar of the Golden Temple.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that Guru Hargobind is the one who donned two swords symbolizing temporal and spiritual authority. So, the answer should be C. Guru Hargobind.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me double-check. Guru Nanak was the founder, focusing on spiritual teachings. Guru Arjan compiled the Adi Granth and built the Akal Takht, which is related to temporal authority, but it was Guru Hargobind who explicitly wore the two swords to symbolize both Miri and Piri.\n\nGuru Ram Das, being the fourth Guru, established Amritsar but didn't introduce the concept of Miri and Piri.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Guru Hargobind.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
