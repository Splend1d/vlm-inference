                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about finding the surface area of a right rectangular prism. The formula given is S = 2(lw + wh + hl), where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. The dimensions provided are length l = 12 inches, width w = 9 inches, and height h = 2 inches. I need to find the surface area in square inches and choose the correct answer from the options: A. 300, B. 258, C. 150, D. 92.\n\nAlright, first things first, I should make sure I understand what a right rectangular prism is. I think it's just a box shape, with all angles being right angles, and the faces being rectangles. The surface area should be the sum of the areas of all its faces, and the formula given seems to reflect that.\n\nThe formula is S = 2(lw + wh + hl). This makes sense because there are three pairs of opposite faces: the front and back (each with area lw), the left and right (each with area wh), and the top and bottom (each with area hl). So, multiplying the sum of these areas by 2 gives the total surface area.\n\nOkay, so plugging in the values:\n\nl = 12 inches\n\nw = 9 inches\n\nh = 2 inches\n\nSo, S = 2*(12*9 + 9*2 + 2*12)\n\nFirst, calculate each product inside the parentheses:\n\n12*9 = 108\n\n9*2 = 18\n\n2*12 = 24\n\nNow, add them up: 108 + 18 + 24 = 150\n\nThen, multiply by 2: 2*150 = 300\n\nSo, the surface area is 300 square inches.\n\nLooking back at the options, A is 300, B is 258, C is 150, and D is 92. So, 300 seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 12*9 is indeed 108.\n\n9*2 is 18.\n\n2*12 is 24.\n\nAdding those up: 108 + 18 is 126, plus 24 is 150.\n\nThen, 2*150 is indeed 300.\n\nSeems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should visualize the prism to ensure I understand the formula properly.\n\nImagine a box with length 12 inches, width 9 inches, and height 2 inches.\n\nThe front and back faces would each have an area of length times height, which is 12*2 = 24 square inches each. But wait, no. Actually, the front and back faces would have dimensions length by height, so that's 12 inches by 2 inches, area 24 square inches each. Similarly, the left and right faces would have dimensions width by height, so 9 inches by 2 inches, area 18 square inches each. And the top and bottom faces would have dimensions length by width, so 12 inches by 9 inches, area 108 square inches each.\n\nSo, total surface area would be:\n\n2*(108 + 18 + 24) = 2*150 = 300 square inches.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. The surface area of a rectangular prism is the sum of the areas of all six faces. Since opposite faces are equal, it's 2 times the sum of the areas of three different faces.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that for each pair of opposite faces, there are two faces with the same area.\n\nSo, again, 2*(lw + wh + hl) makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to unfold the prism into a net, I would see all six faces laid out, and their areas would add up to the total surface area.\n\nBut, in any case, my calculation seems consistent, and 300 square inches is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations, so I'm confident that A. 300 is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\n**Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{300} \\]"
