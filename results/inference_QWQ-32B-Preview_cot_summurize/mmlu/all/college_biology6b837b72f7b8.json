                    "text": "Let's see. I need to figure out which of these facts was known before 1859, when Darwin published his big book on evolution. Okay, let's look at each one:\n\nA. DNA provides the macromolecular basis of heredity.\n\nHmm, DNA was discovered later, right? I think Friedrich Miescher first isolated nucleic acids in the late 19th century, but the structure and function of DNA as the molecule carrying genetic information was figured out much later, in the 20th century. So, this one probably wasn't known before 1859.\n\nB. Mendelian principles explain why some traits are dominant and others are recessive.\n\nMendel did his pea plant experiments in the mid-19th century, but he published his work in 1866, which is after 1859. And besides, his work wasn't widely recognized until the early 1900s. So, this can't be the answer.\n\nC. Prokaryotes include two major domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea.\n\nThis is even more recent. The distinction between Bacteria and Archaea was made in the late 20th century, based on molecular biology and genetic studies. So, definitely not known before 1859.\n\nD. There exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.\n\nNow, this seems plausible. Fossils have been known for a long time, and the concept of extinction was becoming accepted before Darwin's time. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, scientists like Georges Cuvier were arguing for the reality of extinction based on fossil evidence. So, this must have been established before 1859.\n\nLet me double-check. Was the idea of extinction accepted before Darwin's publication? Yes, Cuvier's work in the early 19th century established that some species had indeed disappeared from the earth. And fossil collections were being studied well before 1859.\n\nSo, among the options given, the only one that was established prior to 1859 is D: there exist fossilized remains of species that have become extinct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
