                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about Supreme Court justices. It says, \"The majority of Supreme Court justices...\" and then it gives four options. Let me read them again to make sure I understand each one.\n\nOption A: \"are appointed by presidents of the same political party.\" Hmm, that seems plausible. Presidents usually try to appoint justices who share their political views, right? So, maybe most justices are appointed by presidents from their own party.\n\nOption B: \"have no prior judicial experience.\" I'm not sure about this one. I think many Supreme Court justices have had experience in lower courts before being appointed to the Supreme Court. But maybe some don't have any judicial experience. I need to think about that.\n\nOption C: \"switch party affiliation during their term.\" Now, this one sounds unlikely. Supreme Court justices are appointed for life, and I don't recall any instances where justices changed their party affiliation while on the court. Parties don't really apply in the same way to justices since they are supposed to be independent once appointed.\n\nOption D: \"stay on the court for only a decade.\" Decade means ten years. I know that Supreme Court justices serve for life, unless they choose to retire or are impeached. Historically, justices have served for many years, often well beyond a decade. So, this option seems incorrect.\n\nLet me consider option A again. Presidents do try to appoint justices who align with their political views, but over time, with different presidents from different parties appointing justices, the court should have a mix of justices from different parties. However, it's possible that, at any given time, the majority of justices were appointed by presidents from the same party.\n\nWait a minute, Supreme Court justices don't technically have party affiliations. They are supposed to be independent judges, not partisan officials. But in practice, their decisions often align with the political party of the president who appointed them.\n\nBut the question is about who appointed them, not their decisions. So, if most justices were appointed by presidents of the same party, that would mean that the appointing presidents were mostly from one party.\n\nBut considering that there have been presidents from both parties over time, and they have appointed justices accordingly, it's possible that at certain times, the majority of justices were appointed by presidents from one party.\n\nHowever, the court is supposed to represent a balance of perspectives, and presidents are aware of the political leanings of the court when appointing justices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to test whether the majority of current justices were appointed by presidents of the same party.\n\nBut since the composition of the court changes over time with appointments and retirements, it's possible that currently, the majority of justices were appointed by presidents of one party.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is more general, referring to the overall history of the court.\n\nBut considering the options, option A seems the most plausible.\n\nOption B says that most justices have no prior judicial experience. While it's true that some justices come from legal backgrounds outside of judgeships, like being lawyers or law professors, many do have prior judicial experience, especially from lower courts.\n\nSo, I don't think option B is correct.\n\nOption C suggests that justices switch party affiliation during their term. Again, since justices are supposed to be independent and not aligned with any party once appointed, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption D says that justices stay on the court for only a decade. But historically, justices have served much longer than that. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nTherefore, I think the best answer is option A: the majority of Supreme Court justices are appointed by presidents of the same political party.\n\nBut I should double-check this. Maybe there's a pattern where justices appointed by different presidents balance each other out, and there isn't a majority from one party.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps at certain times in history, one party has dominated the appointments, leading to a majority of justices appointed by presidents of that party.\n\nGiven that, maybe the answer depends on the current composition of the court.\n\nBut since this is a general question, probably expecting a general answer, I'll go with option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
