                    "text": "This question is about a situation where a police officer suspected a woman of dealing in stolen credit cards and conducted a search that led to the seizure of some credit cards. The woman is now trying to have that evidence thrown out because she says her Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.\n\nLet's break down what happened:\n\n1. **Undercover Operation**: The officer posed as someone interested in buying usable credit cards and went to the woman's house.\n\n2. **Deception for Entry**: When the woman asked if he was a police officer, he said no and gave a false name, also suggesting she could call someone named Harvey to verify his credibility.\n\n3. **Entry into the House**: The woman let him in after this interaction.\n\n4. **Discovery of Evidence**: While the woman was away making a call, the officer moved some papers and found three credit cards under them, which he seized.\n\n5. **Arrest**: The officer then arrested the woman.\n\nNow, the woman is arguing that the way the evidence was obtained violated her Fourth Amendment rights, and she wants the evidence suppressed. The court has to decide whether to grant this motion.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\n\nB. No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\n\nC. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\n\nD. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\nTo answer this, we need to consider a few key points:\n\n- **Consent to Enter**: The officer obtained entry into the woman's house by deception, saying he wasn't a police officer and providing a false name. Generally, consent to search obtained through deception might still be valid, but it depends on the circumstances.\n\n- **Plain View Doctrine**: If evidence is in plain view, officers can seize it without a warrant. However, they must be lawfully present to observe the evidence in the first place.\n\n- **Fourth Amendment Protections**: The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and generally, a warrant is required for a search of a person's home.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A**: No, because it was immediately apparent that the cards were stolen.\n\n- This option suggests that since the cards were clearly stolen, the evidence should not be suppressed. However, the legality of the seizure doesn't depend on the clarity of the evidence's illicit nature but on how it was obtained. So, this might not be the strongest argument.\n\n**Option B**: No, because the woman assumed the risk that the officer would seize items in plain sight.\n\n- This option implies that by allowing the officer into her home, the woman took the risk that he might see and seize incriminating evidence. However, the issue here is whether the officer had the right to be there in the first place and whether the consent was obtained through deception.\n\n**Option C**: Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer lifted the papers.\n\n- This suggests that the act of moving the papers was a search that required justification. However, if the officer was lawfully in the home, and the cards were in plain view once the papers were moved, this might be acceptable under the plain view doctrine.\n\n**Option D**: Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\n- This option focuses on the manner in which the officer obtained consent to enter the home. If the consent was obtained through deception, was it still valid?\n\nIn legal terms, consent to search must be voluntary, and deception can sometimes invalidate consent. However, the law allows for some level of deception in law enforcement operations, especially in undercover work. The key question is whether the deception was such that it overbore the woman's will to consent or if it was inherently coercive.\n\nIn this case, the officer misrepresented his identity and gave a false name, which might be considered deceptive but is common in undercover operations. The woman was told she could call someone to verify the officer's credibility, which suggests that there was an opportunity for her to confirm his legitimacy before allowing him in.\n\nGiven that, the court might find that the consent to enter was still voluntary despite the deception, and therefore the officer's presence in the home was lawful. From there, if the cards were in plain view once the papers were moved, the seizure would be acceptable under the plain view doctrine.\n\nHowever, some might argue that moving the papers was an active search, which requires a higher level of justification. But if the officer had a lawful right to be in the area where the papers were and the cards were immediately apparent as contraband, the plain view doctrine could still apply.\n\nConsidering these points, options A and B seem less compelling than C and D. Option C focuses on the act of moving the papers, which might be seen as a search, but if the officer was lawfully present and the cards were in plain view, this might not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n\nOption D, however, questions the validity of the consent to enter due to the deception used by the officer. If the court finds that the consent was invalid because of the deception, then the officer's presence in the home was unlawful, and anything seized as a result would be fruit of the poisonous tree and subject to suppression.\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible argument for suppressing the evidence is that the officer obtained entry through deceit, which invalidated the consent and made the subsequent seizure unlawful under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Yes, because the woman's rights were violated when the officer obtained entry by deceit.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
