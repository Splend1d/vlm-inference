A residual is the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable (y) and the value predicted by the regression equation for a given value of the independent variable (x). In other words, it tells us how far off the prediction is from the actual observation.\n\nThe formula for calculating the residual is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{residual} = y_{\\text{observed}} - y_{\\text{predicted}}\n\\]\n\nGiven the least squares regression equation:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = -2.29 + 1.70x\n\\]\n\nAnd the data point:\n\n\\[\nx = 5, \\quad y = 6\n\\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the predicted value of y (\\(\\hat{y}\\)) when x is 5.\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = -2.29 + 1.70(5)\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = -2.29 + 8.50 = 6.21\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the residual by subtracting the predicted y from the observed y:\n\n\\[\n\\text{residual} = y - \\hat{y} = 6 - 6.21 = -0.21\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the residual for this point is -0.21.\n\nSo, the correct choice is:\n\nD. \u20130.21\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
