The options are:\n\nScenario 1: The kitten could not drink on its own, so I fed it with a bottle.\n\nScenario 2: I borrowed a book and ripped out some pages to remember them.\n\nAnd then there are four possible answers:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: feeding a kitten with a bottle because it couldn't drink on its own. So, kittens are young cats, and they often need help when they're little, especially if they're orphaned or their mother can't care for them. Feeding them with a bottle is actually a common practice to ensure they get the nourishment they need. In fact, it's often considered caring and responsible behavior towards animals. So, according to ordinary moral standards, this seems like the right thing to do, not wrong.\n\nMoving on to Scenario 2: borrowing a book and ripping out some pages to remember them. Now, borrowing a book is fine, but ripping out pages from it isn't. Books are property, and when you borrow something, you're expected to return it in the same condition you received it. Destroying part of the book by ripping out pages is damaging someone else's property, which is generally considered morally wrong. Additionally, it's disrespectful to the owner and could cause financial loss if the book is damaged beyond repair.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nScenario 1: Not wrong\n\nScenario 2: Wrong\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nThe correct answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Is there any room for interpretation here?\n\nIn Scenario 1, some might argue that interfering with animals could be wrong, but in this case, it's clear that the kitten needed help and the action was to care for it. So, it's hard to see this as morally wrong.\n\nIn Scenario 2, even if the intention was to remember the pages, destroying someone else's property without permission is clearly wrong. It doesn't matter that the book was borrowed; the borrower is responsible for returning it intact.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
