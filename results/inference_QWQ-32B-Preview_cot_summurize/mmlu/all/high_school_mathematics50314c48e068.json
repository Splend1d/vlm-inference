                    "text": "Let's tackle this probability problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty on probability, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nSo, the problem is: If I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the numbers on their faces, what's the probability that the product is a composite number?\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than one and itself. In other words, it's not a prime number and not 1.\n\nNow, I'm dealing with the product of 5 dice rolls. Each die has faces showing numbers 1 through 6. So, the possible products range from 1 (if all dice show 1) up to 6^5, which is 7776.\n\nI need to find the probability that this product is a composite number. Probability is generally calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice is 6^5, which is 7776, as each die is independent of the others.\n\nNow, I need to find out how many of these outcomes result in a composite number when multiplied together.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to find the probability that the product is NOT a composite number, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that it is a composite number.\n\nSo, the product is not a composite number if it is either 1 or a prime number.\n\nLet's consider when the product is 1. That only happens if all five dice show 1. So, there's only one way for that to happen.\n\nNext, when is the product a prime number? A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. So, for the product of five numbers (each between 1 and 6) to be prime, most of those numbers must be 1, and exactly one of them must be a prime number.\n\nWait, actually, if you have more than one number greater than 1, their product will likely be composite, except in special cases like 1*1*1*1*prime.\n\nWait, no. Let's think carefully.\n\nIf I have five numbers, each being 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and I multiply them together, the product is prime only if exactly one die shows a prime number and the other four dice show 1.\n\nBecause if more than one die shows a number greater than 1, their product will be composite.\n\nWait, but 1 is not a prime number, and multiplying 1 by a prime gives the prime itself, which is still prime. But if I multiply two primes together, that's a composite number.\n\nSimilarly, if I have a 4 (which is 2*2), even if the other dice are 1, the product is 4, which is composite.\n\nSo, to have the product be prime, I need exactly one die to show a prime number (which are 2, 3, or 5), and the other four dice to show 1.\n\nLet me calculate how many outcomes satisfy this condition.\n\nFirst, choose which one of the five dice shows the prime number. There are 5 choices for which die shows the prime.\n\nThen, that die can show either 2, 3, or 5. So, 3 choices for that die.\n\nThe other four dice must all show 1. Only one choice for each of them.\n\nSo, total number of outcomes where the product is prime is 5 * 3 * 1^4 = 15.\n\nAdditionally, there's the one outcome where all five dice show 1, resulting in a product of 1, which is neither prime nor composite.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where the product is not composite is 15 (for primes) + 1 (for 1) = 16.\n\nTherefore, the number of outcomes where the product is composite is total outcomes minus non-composite outcomes: 7776 - 16 = 7760.\n\nSo, the probability that the product is composite is 7760 / 7776.\n\nSimplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 16.\n\n7760 \u00f7 16 = 485\n\n7776 \u00f7 16 = 486\n\nSo, 485/486.\n\nLooking back at the options, option A is 485/486. So, that seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there are any other scenarios I might have missed.\n\nIs there any way the product could be composite besides being a prime or 1?\n\nWell, yes, because composite numbers are all positive integers greater than 1 that are not prime.\n\nBut in this case, since we're multiplying dice rolls, the only non-composite products are 1 and primes.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the earlier analysis, I considered only products that are 1 or primes as non-composite, which seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Maybe there are some products that are neither prime nor composite, but that's only 1, since by definition composite numbers are greater than 1 and not prime.\n\nSo, yes, only 1 and primes are non-composite, and everything else is composite.\n\nTherefore, my calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach to this problem.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to note that a product is composite if it has at least one prime factor with multiplicity greater than or equal to 1, and it's greater than 1.\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the probability that the product is not composite, which is the probability that the product is 1 or a prime, and subtract that from 1.\n\nWe already did that and got 16/7776 for non-composite products, so 1 - 16/7776 = 7760/7776 = 485/486.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the exponents of the prime factors in the product.\n\nEach die roll contributes to the exponents of the primes 2, 3, and 5 in the prime factorization of the product.\n\nFor the product to be composite, it must have at least one prime exponent greater than or equal to 1, and the product must be greater than 1.\n\nBut again, this seems more complicated than the initial approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here, but I don't see an immediate benefit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the probability that the product is divisible by at least one prime, which would make it composite, except for the cases where the product is prime or 1.\n\nBut again, that seems to lead back to the initial approach.\n\nTherefore, I believe my initial calculation is correct, and the probability is 485/486.\n\nSo, the answer is A. 485/486.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{485}{486}} \\]"
