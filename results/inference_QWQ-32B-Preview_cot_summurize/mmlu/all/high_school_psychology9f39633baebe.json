The options are cognitive social, behavioral, psychoanalytic, or systems approach. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, the psychologist is considering the family dynamics, which means they're looking at how the child interacts with other family members and how those interactions might be influencing the child's behavior. It's not just about the child alone, but about the system that the child is a part of.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Cognitive social approach: This sounds like it might involve thoughts and social interactions, but I'm not sure if it specifically looks at the family system.\n\nB. Behavioral approach: This typically focuses on observable behaviors and how they're shaped by reinforcements and punishments. It might not consider the family dynamics as a whole system.\n\nC. Psychoanalytic approach: This is more about unconscious processes and early childhood experiences. It might not directly address the current family dynamics.\n\nD. Systems approach: This seems to fit because it looks at the individual within the context of their environment, specifically the family system here.\n\nSo, the systems approach appears to be the best fit because it considers the child's behavior as influenced by and influencing the family system.\n\nBut let me double-check. Maybe another approach also considers family dynamics.\n\nThe behavioral approach could consider family interactions, but it's more focused on specific behaviors and their reinforcements. It might not look at the family as a system with its own patterns and processes.\n\nThe cognitive social approach might involve social learning, where the child learns behaviors by observing others in the family, but again, it might not consider the family as a whole system.\n\nThe psychoanalytic approach is more inward-focused, on the child's unconscious mind and past experiences, rather than current family interactions.\n\nTherefore, the systems approach seems to be the most appropriate because it explicitly looks at the interrelationships and interactions within the family unit and how they affect the child's behavior.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Systems approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
