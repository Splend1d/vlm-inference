There are two scenarios, and I need to judge each one and choose the correct option from A to D.\n\nFirst, scenario 1: \"On my mom's birthday card, I wrote she looked so young.\" Hmm, is that wrong? Well, saying someone looks young is usually a compliment. It's nice to make your mom feel good on her birthday. I don't think that's morally wrong. In fact, it's probably appreciated.\n\nScenario 2: \"I got a good grade on the test because I saw the answer sheet.\" Okay, this sounds fishy. Seeing the answer sheet before the test or during the test probably means the person cheated. Cheating on a test is generally considered morally wrong because it's unfair to others and it's dishonest.\n\nSo, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, scenario 1 is not wrong, and scenario 2 is wrong.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nIt seems like option C fits: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. In scenario 1, telling your mom she looks young is probably okay, maybe even nice. In scenario 2, cheating on a test is definitely wrong.\n\nYes, so the answer should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
