                    "text": "I'm trying to figure out which of these genetic conditions can be identified using an enzyme assay, specifically looking at options A through D. Let's see what each one is about and how enzyme assays might relate to them.\n\nStarting with A, cystic fibrosis. I know that cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which affects the production of a protein that regulates the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. This leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and other organs. But I don't recall if there's a specific enzyme deficiency associated with cystic fibrosis that could be assayed.\n\nMoving on to B, fragile X syndrome. This is a condition caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. It's the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome is related to the expansion of a CGG repeat in the gene, which can lead to methylation and silencing of the gene. Again, I don't think there's a specific enzyme deficiency here that would be detected by an enzyme assay.\n\nOption C is oculocutaneous albinism. This is a group of disorders that result in little or no melanin production, leading to pale skin, hair, and eyes. Oculocutaneous albinism can be caused by mutations in several genes involved in melanin production, such as TYR, OCA2, or TYRP1. While these genes are essential for melanin synthesis, I'm not sure if there's an enzyme activity that can be assayed to diagnose carriers of these conditions.\n\nNow, option D, Tay-Sachs disease. I remember that Tay-Sachs is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hexosaminidase A. This enzyme is necessary for breaking down a particular lipid in brain cells, and without it, these lipids accumulate and cause neurological damage. There are different forms of Tay-Sachs, but the infantile form is the most common, leading to severe neurological impairment and early death.\n\nGiven that Tay-Sachs is due to a deficiency in hexosaminidase A, it makes sense that an enzyme assay could be used to measure the activity of this enzyme in blood samples. Carriers of Tay-Sachs would have reduced but not completely absent enzyme activity, while affected individuals would have very little or no activity.\n\nComparing this with the other options, none of them seem to have a direct enzyme deficiency that could be assayed in the same way. Cystic fibrosis is related to a protein that functions as a channel, fragile X syndrome is due to a gene that affects protein synthesis, and oculocutaneous albinism involves genes related to melanin production, but not necessarily enzyme activities that can be assayed in blood.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D, Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
