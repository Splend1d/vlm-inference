Light switch\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a digital device is. A digital device is something that operates on digital signals, which are basically signals that are represented by discrete values, often in binary form\u2014like on or off, 1 or 0.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nA. Regulator of a fan: A fan regulator is usually a device that controls the speed of the fan. Some regulators might be analog, where you turn a knob to adjust the speed continuously. But these days, there are also digital fan regulators that have buttons or a display showing the speed settings. So, this could be either analog or digital depending on the type.\n\nB. Microphone: A microphone is a transducer that converts sound waves into electrical signals. These signals are usually analog, meaning they vary continuously with the sound input. However, there are digital microphones that output digital signals. But generally, microphones are considered analog devices.\n\nC. Resistance of a material: Resistance is a property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current. It's a passive component in electronic circuits and doesn't process or generate signals; it just affects the current flowing through it. So, resistance isn't a device that processes digital signals.\n\nD. Light switch: A light switch is a mechanical or electrical device used to turn lights on or off. It's basically a switch that connects or disconnects the circuit. This seems like a digital device because it has two states: on or off.\n\nComparing all these options, the light switch seems to be the most straightforward example of a digital device, as it has discrete states without any continuous variation.\n\nBut wait, maybe the regulator of a fan could also be digital if it has discrete settings. For example, if it has buttons to set the fan speed to low, medium, or high, that's like discrete levels, which could be considered digital.\n\nOn the other hand, a microphone, especially a traditional one, is analog. And resistance is just a property, not a device that processes signals.\n\nSo, between A and D, which one is more clearly digital?\n\nA digital device typically processes or handles digital signals. A light switch is essentially a binary device: on or off. That's digital.\n\nA digital fan regulator might have multiple discrete settings, but even then, the primary function is to control the speed, which could be analog or digital depending on the implementation.\n\nGiven that, I think the light switch is the most straightforward example of a digital device among the options provided.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
