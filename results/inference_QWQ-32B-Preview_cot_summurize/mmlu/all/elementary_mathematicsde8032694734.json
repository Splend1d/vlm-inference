That means that both the width and the length are increased by the same scale factor to keep the aspect ratio the same.\n\nThe original picture is 4 cm wide and 6 cm long. The new picture is 10 cm wide, and we need to find out what its length is.\n\nFirst, I need to find out by what factor the width was enlarged. The original width is 4 cm, and the new width is 10 cm. So, the scale factor for the width is 10 divided by 4, which is 2.5. That means the width was multiplied by 2.5.\n\nSince the enlargement is proportional, the length should also be multiplied by the same scale factor of 2.5.\n\nThe original length is 6 cm, so the new length should be 6 cm multiplied by 2.5.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 times 2.5 is 15 cm.\n\nSo, the length of the new picture should be 15 cm.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 8 cm\n\nB. 12 cm\n\nC. 15 cm\n\nD. 20 cm\n\nOption C, 15 cm, matches my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion to solve this.\n\nThe proportion would be:\n\noriginal width / original length = new width / new length\n\nSo, 4 / 6 = 10 / x\n\nWhere x is the new length.\n\nTo solve for x, I can cross-multiply:\n\n4 * x = 6 * 10\n\n4x = 60\n\nNow, divide both sides by 4:\n\nx = 60 / 4\n\nx = 15 cm\n\nAgain, this confirms that the new length is 15 cm.\n\nI can also check if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAnother approach is to find the ratio of the new width to the original width and apply that ratio to the length.\n\nThe ratio is 10 / 4, which is 2.5, just like before.\n\nSo, multiplying the original length by 2.5 gives 15 cm.\n\nOr, if I consider the percentage increase.\n\nThe width increased from 4 cm to 10 cm, which is an increase of 6 cm, but that's not really necessary because it's proportional enlargement, not an absolute increase.\n\nSo, sticking with the proportional method is the way to go.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 15 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
