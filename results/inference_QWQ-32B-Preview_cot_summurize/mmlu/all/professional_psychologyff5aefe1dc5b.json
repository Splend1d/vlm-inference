And self-disclosure is when the therapist shares personal information with the client. I need to figure out how that fits together from a feminist perspective.\n\nOption A says that self-disclosure is contraindicated because it puts the client in a passive role. That sounds plausible because in feminist therapy, the focus is on making the client active and empowered. If the therapist discloses too much about themselves, maybe the client might feel like they have to take care of the therapist's issues, which could make them passive.\n\nOption B says that self-disclosure is necessary during the early stages to encourage the client's participation. Hmm, maybe sharing some personal information could help build rapport and make the client feel more comfortable. But I'm not sure if that aligns with feminist principles.\n\nOption C suggests that self-disclosure is a means of fostering a special bond between the client and the therapist. Well, in feminist therapy, the relationship is supposed to be collaborative, but I'm not sure if \"fostering a special bond\" is the goal. It might lead to dependency, which isn't empowering for the client.\n\nOption D says that self-disclosure is useful for promoting an egalitarian relationship between the therapist and the client. Ah, egalitarianism is important in feminist therapy. If both parties are equal, then sharing personal information might help level the playing field, since therapy can sometimes be seen as hierarchical.\n\nLet me think about this. In feminist therapy, the power dynamic is crucial. Traditionally, the therapist holds more power, and the client is in a passive role. Feminist therapy aims to shift that dynamic to make it more equal.\n\nIf the therapist discloses personal information, it might make the therapist seem more human and relatable, which could help in building a partnership where both parties are sharing and working together. That sounds like it could promote an egalitarian relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, if the therapist discloses too much, it could also be distracting or even problematic, as the therapist might be focusing too much on their own issues instead of the client's. But the question is about the perspective of feminist therapy, and from what I know, feminist therapy encourages a more equal relationship.\n\nComparing options A and D, A says self-disclosure is contraindicated because it makes the client passive, whereas D says it's useful for promoting equality. Given that feminist therapy is about empowering the client and making the relationship equal, option D seems more aligned with those principles.\n\nOption B mentions that self-disclosure is necessary during early stages to encourage participation. While building rapport is important, I'm not sure if self-disclosure is considered necessary in feminist therapy specifically. It might vary, but it's not highlighted as a key component in my understanding.\n\nOption C talks about fostering a special bond, which might not be the focus of feminist therapy. Feminist therapy emphasizes a collaborative relationship, but not necessarily a special bond beyond that.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, I think the best answer is D: useful for promoting an egalitarian relationship between the therapist and client.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
