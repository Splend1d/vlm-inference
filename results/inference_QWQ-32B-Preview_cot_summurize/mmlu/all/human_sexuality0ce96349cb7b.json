                    "text": "I'm trying to answer this question about how much the cervix needs to dilate for a baby to be born. The options are 5, 10, 15, or 20 centimeters. I remember something about the cervix dilating during labor, but I'm not sure exactly how many centimeters it needs to reach.\n\nFirst, I know that the cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. During pregnancy, it's closed and plugged to keep the baby safe inside the uterus. When labor starts, the cervix begins to dilate, or open up, to allow the baby to pass through into the birth canal.\n\nI think the process of dilation is measured in centimeters, and there's a specific amount it needs to reach for delivery to occur. I recall that doctors talk about cervical dilation during labor checks, and they mention numbers like 1 cm, 2 cm, up to a certain point.\n\nI'm pretty sure that full dilation is required for the baby to be born vaginally. But I can't recall the exact number. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nOption A is 5 cm. I don't think that's full dilation because I've heard that labor is often divided into different stages based on cervical dilation. I think 4-6 cm might be considered the active stage of labor, but not yet fully dilated.\n\nOption B is 10 cm. This sounds familiar. I believe that full dilation is around 10 cm, which is often described as being completely open to allow the baby's head to pass through.\n\nOption C is 15 cm. That seems too much. The cervix isn't that large. I don't think it dilates to 15 cm.\n\nOption D is 20 cm. That's even larger, which is definitely not possible for the cervix.\n\nSo, between the options given, 10 cm makes the most sense. I'm fairly confident that the answer is B. 10 cm.\n\nJust to double-check, I recall that during labor, the cervix dilates gradually. It starts from being closed and dilates to about 10 cm, which is considered fully dilated and ready for the baby to be born.\n\nI don't think it's possible for the cervix to dilate to 15 or 20 cm because that would exceed the physical limits of the cervical tissue. So, options C and D can probably be ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. 10 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
