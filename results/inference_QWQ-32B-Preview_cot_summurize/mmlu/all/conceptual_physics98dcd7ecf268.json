                    "text": "So I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure out what happens to the kinetic energy of a moving body when its speed increases enough to double its momentum. The options are that the kinetic energy increases but less than doubles, doubles, more than doubles, or it depends on factors not stated. Hmm, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the relationships between momentum and kinetic energy. Momentum (p) is mass (m) times velocity (v), so p = m*v. Kinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)*m*v^2. So, momentum depends on both mass and velocity, and kinetic energy depends on mass and the square of velocity.\n\nThe question says that the speed increases in such a way that the momentum doubles. So, if initial momentum is p = m*v, and final momentum is p' = m*v', and p' = 2*p, then m*v' = 2*m*v, which simplifies to v' = 2*v. So, the velocity doubles.\n\nNow, if velocity doubles, what happens to kinetic energy? Initial KE is (1/2)*m*v^2, and final KE is (1/2)*m*(2*v)^2 = (1/2)*m*4*v^2 = 4*(1/2)*m*v^2, which is 4 times the initial KE. So, if velocity doubles, KE quadruples.\n\nWait a minute, that seems to suggest that KE more than doubles, it quadruples. But the question says that the momentum doubles due to the increase in speed, and we just concluded that velocity doubles, leading to KE quadrupling. But is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check. If momentum doubles by increasing speed, and assuming mass remains constant, then indeed velocity doubles, because p = m*v. So, if p doubles and m is constant, v must double.\n\nNow, KE = (1/2)*m*v^2. If v doubles, KE becomes (1/2)*m*(2*v)^2 = (1/2)*m*4*v^2 = 4*(1/2)*m*v^2, which is 4 times the original KE. So, KE quadruples.\n\nBut the question is presented in a way that might be trying to relate the change in momentum directly to the change in KE. Let's think about that differently.\n\nMaybe I should express KE in terms of momentum. Since p = m*v, then v = p/m. So, KE = (1/2)*m*(p/m)^2 = (1/2)*m*(p^2/m^2) = (1/2)*(p^2/m). So, KE = (p^2)/(2*m).\n\nNow, if momentum p doubles, then new KE = ( (2*p)^2 ) / (2*m) = (4*p^2) / (2*m) = 2*(p^2/m). So, it seems like KE doubles when momentum doubles.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if velocity doubles, KE quadruples. But according to this, if momentum doubles, KE doubles. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's think carefully.\n\nIf p = m*v, and KE = (1/2)*m*v^2, then expressing KE in terms of p:\n\nKE = (1/2)*m*v^2 = (1/2)*m*(p/m)^2 = (1/2)*(p^2/m).\n\nSo, KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nNow, if p doubles, new KE = (2*p)^2 / (2*m) = 4*p^2 / (2*m) = 2*(p^2/m) = 2*KE.\n\nSo, according to this, KE doubles when momentum doubles.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that if velocity doubles, KE quadruples. But according to this, when momentum doubles, KE doubles. So, perhaps my initial assumption that velocity doubles when momentum doubles is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. If momentum doubles and mass is constant, then velocity must double. But according to the KE equation, KE should quadruple when velocity doubles. However, expressing KE in terms of momentum shows that KE doubles when momentum doubles.\n\nThis seems contradictory. What's going on here?\n\nLet me check the units to see if I'm making a silly mistake.\n\nMomentum p = m*v, with units of kg*m/s.\n\nKE = (1/2)*m*v^2, with units of Joules (kg*m^2/s^2).\n\nExpressing KE in terms of p: KE = p^2 / (2*m), which is (kg^2*m^2/s^2)/kg = kg*m^2/s^2, which is Joules. So, units check out.\n\nSo, if p doubles, KE doubles. But if v doubles, KE quadruples. But if p doubles with m constant, v doubles, which should quadruple KE. So, this is confusing.\n\nMaybe the mass is not constant. Perhaps the mass changes in such a way that when velocity increases, mass changes to keep momentum doubling correctly.\n\nWait, in classical physics, mass is constant. In relativistic physics, mass increases with velocity, but I don't think that's relevant here.\n\nAssuming classical mechanics, mass is constant. So, if p = m*v, and m is constant, then p is directly proportional to v.\n\nTherefore, if p doubles, v doubles.\n\nThen, KE = (1/2)*m*v^2. If v doubles, KE quadruples.\n\nBut according to KE = p^2 / (2*m), if p doubles, KE doubles.\n\nThis suggests that in classical mechanics, these two perspectives should agree. But they don't seem to agree based on my calculations.\n\nLet me try plugging in some numbers to see what happens.\n\nSuppose initial mass m = 1 kg, initial velocity v = 1 m/s.\n\nThen, p = 1*1 = 1 kg*m/s, KE = (1/2)*1*1^2 = 0.5 J.\n\nNow, double the momentum to p' = 2 kg*m/s.\n\nSince m is constant at 1 kg, v' = p'/m = 2/1 = 2 m/s.\n\nThen, KE' = (1/2)*1*(2)^2 = (1/2)*1*4 = 2 J.\n\nSo, initial KE was 0.5 J, final KE is 2 J, which is 4 times the initial KE. So, it quadrupled.\n\nBut according to KE = p^2 / (2*m), initial KE = (1)^2 / (2*1) = 1/2 = 0.5 J.\n\nFinal KE = (2)^2 / (2*1) = 4/2 = 2 J, which is indeed double the initial KE.\n\nWait a minute, in this example, KE quadrupled when momentum doubled. But according to the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), it should double.\n\nBut in my numerical example, it quadrupled. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.\n\nLet me derive KE in terms of p again.\n\nKE = (1/2)*m*v^2.\n\nBut p = m*v, so v = p/m.\n\nSubstitute v into KE: KE = (1/2)*m*(p/m)^2 = (1/2)*m*(p^2/m^2) = (1/2)*(p^2/m).\n\nSo, KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nNow, in my numerical example, m = 1 kg, p = 1 kg*m/s, so KE = 1^2 / (2*1) = 0.5 J.\n\nWhen p doubles to 2 kg*m/s, KE = 2^2 / (2*1) = 4/2 = 2 J, which is indeed double the initial KE.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it quadrupled because 2 J is 4 times 0.5 J.\n\nBut 2 is double of 1, not quadruple. Wait, 2 is quadruple of 0.5, but according to the formula, it's double.\n\nWait, no, 2 is quadruple of 0.5 because 0.5 * 4 = 2.\n\nBut according to the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), if p doubles, KE doubles.\n\nBut in the numerical example, it seems to quadruple.\n\nI must be misunderstanding something here.\n\nLet me try to express KE in terms of p and m.\n\nKE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nNow, if p doubles, new KE = (2*p)^2 / (2*m) = 4*p^2 / (2*m) = 2*(p^2 / m).\n\nBut original KE is p^2 / (2*m), so new KE is 2 times original KE.\n\nIn the numerical example, initial KE is 0.5 J, final KE is 2 J, which is indeed double, not quadruple.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nInitial KE: 0.5 J, final KE: 2 J, which is indeed double, not quadruple.\n\nI must have misremembered. So, according to both the formula and the numerical example, when momentum doubles, KE doubles.\n\nEarlier, I thought that if velocity doubles, KE quadruples, but in this case, since momentum doubles and mass is constant, velocity doubles, and KE quadruples, but according to the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), KE doubles.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that in the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), m is constant.\n\nIn the numerical example, m is constant, and when p doubles, v doubles, and KE quadruples.\n\nBut according to the formula, KE should double.\n\nThis suggests that there's an error in the formula.\n\nWait, let's re-derive the formula.\n\nKE = (1/2)*m*v^2.\n\nBut p = m*v, so v = p/m.\n\nSubstitute v into KE: KE = (1/2)*m*(p/m)^2 = (1/2)*m*(p^2/m^2) = (1/2)*(p^2/m).\n\nSo, KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nIn the numerical example, KE = p^2 / (2*m) = 1^2 / (2*1) = 0.5 J initially.\n\nWhen p doubles to 2, KE = 2^2 / (2*1) = 4/2 = 2 J, which is double the initial KE.\n\nSo, it does double.\n\nEarlier, I thought KE quadrupled, but actually, it doubled from 0.5 J to 2 J.\n\nWait, 2 is indeed double of 1, but 2 is quadruple of 0.5.\n\nWait, 2 is double of 1, but in this case, 2 J is double of 1 J, but in the numerical example, initial KE is 0.5 J, and final is 2 J, which is quadruple.\n\nWait, no, 0.5 * 2 = 1, and 0.5 * 4 = 2.\n\nSo, 2 is quadruple of 0.5, but according to the formula, it should be double of something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look back at the formula.\n\nKE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nInitial p = 1, m = 1, KE = 1/2 = 0.5 J.\n\nFinal p = 2, m = 1, KE = 4/2 = 2 J.\n\nSo, 2 J is indeed double of 1 J, but 1 J is p^2 / m, which is 1 J.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf p doubles, KE new = (2*p)^2 / (2*m) = 4*p^2 / (2*m) = 2*(p^2 / m).\n\nBut original KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nSo, new KE is 2*(p^2 / m) = 4*(p^2 / (2*m)) = 4*original KE.\n\nWait, now it seems like KE quadruples.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right.\n\nLet me see: new KE = 2*(p^2 / m).\n\nOriginal KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nSo, new KE / original KE = [2*(p^2 / m)] / [p^2 / (2*m)] = [2*(p^2 / m)] * [2*m / p^2] = 4.\n\nSo, new KE is 4 times original KE.\n\nBut in the numerical example, initial KE is 0.5 J, final is 2 J, which is 4 times, so it quadruples.\n\nBut according to the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), if p doubles, KE should double.\n\nBut in reality, it quadruples.\n\nThis suggests that the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m) is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, let's check the derivation again.\n\nKE = (1/2)*m*v^2.\n\np = m*v, so v = p/m.\n\nSubstitute v into KE: KE = (1/2)*m*(p/m)^2 = (1/2)*m*(p^2/m^2) = (1/2)*(p^2/m).\n\nSo, KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut according to this, when p doubles, KE should double.\n\nBut in the numerical example, it quadruples.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nLet me consider that when p doubles, v doubles, and since KE is proportional to v^2, KE quadruples.\n\nBut according to KE = p^2 / (2*m), when p doubles, KE should double.\n\nThis suggests that the formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that m changes when p changes, but in classical physics, m is constant.\n\nWait, perhaps in relativistic physics, m increases with velocity, but that's probably not relevant here.\n\nAssuming classical physics, m is constant.\n\nSo, if p doubles, v doubles, and KE quadruples.\n\nBut according to KE = p^2 / (2*m), KE should double.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m) is only approximate or under certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship between p and v.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that p can change due to changes in m or v.\n\nBut in this problem, it's specified that the increase in speed doubles the momentum, assuming m is constant.\n\nSo, p = m*v, and if p doubles with m constant, v doubles.\n\nThen, KE = (1/2)*m*v^2, so if v doubles, KE quadruples.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, KE quadruples when momentum doubles.\n\nBut according to KE = p^2 / (2*m), it should double.\n\nThis suggests that the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m) is not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to relate KE and p differently.\n\nLet me recall that in work-energy theorem, work equals change in KE.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the momentum-velocity relationship more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to express KE in terms of p and m.\n\nKE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nBut earlier derivations suggest that.\n\nGiven that, and in the numerical example, when p doubles, KE should double.\n\nBut in the numerical example, it quadruples.\n\nWait, in the numerical example, with m=1, p=1, KE=0.5 J.\n\nWhen p doubles to 2, KE=2 J, which is indeed double of 1 J, not quadruple.\n\nWait, wait, 0.5 J to 2 J is quadruple, but according to the formula, it should be double of 1 J.\n\nWait, no, according to the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), initial KE is 1^2 / (2*1) = 0.5 J, and final KE is 2^2 / (2*1) = 2 J, which is quadruple of 0.5 J, but double of 1 J.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m) is incorrect.\n\nLet me look it up.\n\nActually, in physics, the kinetic energy can be expressed as KE = p^2 / (2*m), but only under certain conditions.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct.\n\nLet me check a reliable source.\n\nActually, the correct expression is KE = p^2 / (2*m), but in reality, it's KE = (p^2)/(2*m) only if m is constant and p is small compared to mc (in relativistic terms), but in classical mechanics, it should hold.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the work done to increase momentum is related to KE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is KE = p^2 / (2*m) is not the standard formula.\n\nWait, the standard formula is KE = (1/2)*m*v^2, and p = m*v.\n\nSo, KE = p^2 / (2*m).\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nGiven that, when p doubles, KE should quadruple, but according to the formula, it doubles.\n\nBut according to the formula, KE = p^2 / (2*m), so if p doubles, KE becomes 4*p^2 / (2*m) = 2*(p^2 / m), which is double the original KE.\n\nWait, no, original KE is p^2 / (2*m), so new KE is 4*p^2 / (2*m) = 2*p^2 / m = 4*(p^2 / (2*m)) = 4*original KE.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 4 times original KE.\n\nWait, no, 2*p^2 / m is not 4 times p^2 / (2*m).\n\nWait, 2*p^2 / m divided by p^2 / (2*m) is [2*p^2 / m] / [p^2 / (2*m)] = [2*p^2 / m] * [2*m / p^2] = 4.\n\nSo, new KE is 4 times original KE.\n\nBut according to the formula KE = p^2 / (2*m), if p doubles, KE should be 4 times original KE.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it should double, but according to this calculation, it's 4 times.\n\nSo, the formula is consistent with the numerical example.\n\nTherefore, when momentum doubles, KE quadruples.\n\nSo, in the options given:\n\nA. increases but less than doubles\n\nB. doubles\n\nC. more than doubles\n\nD. depends on factors not stated\n\nSince KE quadruples, which is more than doubling,"
