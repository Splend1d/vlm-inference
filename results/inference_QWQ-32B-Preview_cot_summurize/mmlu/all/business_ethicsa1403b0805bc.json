The options are Ethical splicing, Moral framing, Ethical window dressing, and Moral splicing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms might mean.\n\nEthical splicing sounds like combining different ethical elements, but I'm not sure.\n\nMoral framing seems like presenting something in a certain way to influence its moral perception.\n\nEthical window dressing sounds like making something look better ethically than it is, maybe covering up unethical practices.\n\nMoral splicing is similar to ethical splicing, perhaps combining moral elements.\n\nGiven the question is about using language to mask or expose ethical nature, I think moral framing might be the best answer because it involves how we present or describe actions to shape their moral interpretation.\n\nEthical window dressing could also be a candidate since it suggests covering up unethical behavior with superficial ethical appearances.\n\nBut the question mentions \"to mask or expose,\" so it's about both hiding and revealing ethical nature. Moral framing could be used to either present something in a positive light to mask unethical aspects or to highlight ethical considerations.\n\nEthical window dressing seems more about masking unethical behavior by making it seem ethical.\n\nHmm, maybe it's moral framing because it can be used to either mask or expose ethical nature, depending on how it's applied.\n\nLet me think about examples.\n\nIf a company describes its labor practices in a way that emphasizes worker well-being, it's using moral framing to present its actions in an ethical light, possibly masking any unethical aspects.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone points out the unethical treatment of workers by highlighting poor working conditions and low wages, they're using moral framing to expose the unethical nature of the company's actions.\n\nSo, moral framing can be used both to mask and expose ethical nature.\n\nEthical window dressing seems more one-sided, focusing on masking unethical practices.\n\nEthical splicing and moral splicing don't sound familiar, and they seem similar, perhaps referring to combining different ethical elements, but the question is about using language to mask or expose ethical nature.\n\nI think moral framing is the most appropriate answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
