The formula for NPV is:\n\n\\[ NPV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t} - C_0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( C_t \\) is the cash inflow at the end of period t,\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate,\n- \\( n \\) is the number of periods,\n- \\( C_0 \\) is the initial investment.\n\nIn this problem:\n- The discount rate \\( r \\) is 10% or 0.10,\n- The cash inflow \\( C_t \\) is $3,000 per year for 5 years,\n- The initial investment \\( C_0 \\) is $11,000.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the present value of each of the five $3,000 cash inflows and then sum them up.\n\nThe present value of a cash inflow at the end of year t is:\n\n\\[ PV_t = \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t} \\]\n\nSo, for each year:\n\n1. Year 1: \\( PV_1 = \\frac{3000}{(1+0.10)^1} = \\frac{3000}{1.10} \\approx 2727.27 \\)\n\n2. Year 2: \\( PV_2 = \\frac{3000}{(1+0.10)^2} = \\frac{3000}{1.21} \\approx 2479.34 \\)\n\n3. Year 3: \\( PV_3 = \\frac{3000}{(1+0.10)^3} = \\frac{3000}{1.331} \\approx 2254.03 \\)\n\n4. Year 4: \\( PV_4 = \\frac{3000}{(1+0.10)^4} = \\frac{3000}{1.4641} \\approx 2049.12 \\)\n\n5. Year 5: \\( PV_5 = \\frac{3000}{(1+0.10)^5} = \\frac{3000}{1.61051} \\approx 1862.84 \\)\n\nNow, sum these present values:\n\n\\[ PV_{\\text{total}} = 2727.27 + 2479.34 + 2254.03 + 2049.12 + 1862.84 \\]\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\nFirst, add the first two:\n\n\\[ 2727.27 + 2479.34 = 5206.61 \\]\n\nNext, add the third:\n\n\\[ 5206.61 + 2254.03 = 7460.64 \\]\n\nThen, add the fourth:\n\n\\[ 7460.64 + 2049.12 = 9509.76 \\]\n\nFinally, add the fifth:\n\n\\[ 9509.76 + 1862.84 = 11372.60 \\]\n\nSo, the total present value of the cash inflows is approximately $11,372.60.\n\nNow, subtract the initial investment:\n\n\\[ NPV = PV_{\\text{total}} - C_0 = 11372.60 - 11000 = 372.60 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest dollar, the NPV is approximately $373.\n\nHowever, the closest option provided is $370, so I would go with that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. $370.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
