I need to figure out which one isn't a primary facial expression.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what primary facial expressions are. I remember that there are some basic emotions that are universally recognized through facial expressions. I think they are like happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, and anger. Maybe contempt is sometimes included as well. So, from the options given, surprise, disgust, and anger are definitely part of these primary expressions.\n\nNow, love is mentioned here as option D. I'm not sure if love is considered a primary facial expression. I think love might be more of a complex emotion, and the primary expressions are more basic, innate emotions that are universally expressed in the same way across different cultures.\n\nLet me think about this. In psychology, particularly in the work of Paul Ekman, there are six basic emotions that are thought to be universally expressed through facial expressions: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, and anger. Love isn't typically included in this list of primary emotions.\n\nSo, compared to the other options, love seems different. Surprise, disgust, and anger are all part of the basic emotional expressions, whereas love is more of a secondary or complex emotion that might involve a combination of other expressions.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D. love, as it is not considered a primary facial expression.\n\nBut just to make sure, maybe I should double-check this. Perhaps there are different theories about primary facial expressions. Maybe some include love as a basic emotion. I don't recall any that do, but it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe love has a distinct facial expression that is universally recognized. I'm not sure about that. I think expressions of love might vary more across cultures and individuals.\n\nIn contrast, expressions like surprise, disgust, and anger have been shown to be recognized across different cultures, which supports the idea that they are primary or basic emotions.\n\nSo, based on this, I'm confident that the answer is D. love.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
