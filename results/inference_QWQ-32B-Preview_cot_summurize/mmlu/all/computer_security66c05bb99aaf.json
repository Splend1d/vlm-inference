No string boundary checks in predefined functions\n\nB. No storage check in the external memory\n\nC. No processing power check\n\nD. No database check\n\nI need to figure out which one is the correct reason for buffer overflows in C and C++.\n\nFirst off, I know that buffer overflows are a big issue in C and C++ because these languages allow direct manipulation of memory. Unlike higher-level languages, they don't have built-in protections against accessing memory outside of allocated buffers.\n\nOption A says, \"No string boundary checks in predefined functions.\" Hmm, that sounds familiar. In C, functions like `strcpy` and `sprintf` don't check the boundaries of the buffers they're writing to. If you tell `strcpy` to copy a string into a buffer that's too small, it will happily write past the end of the buffer, overwriting whatever is next in memory. This can lead to all sorts of problems, including crashes and even code execution if an attacker can control what's being written.\n\nSo, option A seems relevant. But let's look at the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B says, \"No storage check in the external memory.\" I'm not entirely sure what this means. External memory might refer to disk storage or maybe memory that's not directly managed by the program. But buffer overflows typically occur in RAM, not in external storage. So, this option seems less likely.\n\nOption C, \"No processing power check.\" What does processing power have to do with buffer overflows? Not much, as far as I can tell. Buffer overflows are about memory access, not about how much CPU power the program is using. So, I can probably rule this one out.\n\nOption D, \"No database check.\" Again, databases are unrelated to buffer overflows in the context of memory management. So, this doesn't seem relevant either.\n\nComparing all the options, option A makes the most sense. It's directly related to how C and C++ handle strings and memory, and it's a well-known issue that leads to buffer overflows.\n\nTo confirm, I recall that in C++, you can use safer functions like `std::strcpy_s` or `std::string` class, which do handle string boundaries more safely. But in standard C, functions like `strcpy` and `sprintf` are unsafe because they don't perform boundary checks.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. No string boundary checks in predefined functions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
