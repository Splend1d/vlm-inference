The boat owner was navigating his craft toward shore when heavy rain and wind gusts began to rock the boat. Unable to reach his own slip, the boat owner docked his boat on a pier owned by a resident who lived in a nearby house. The resident objected to the boat owner's entry onto his private property. The boat owner explained that due to the storm it would be highly dangerous to be at sea. He requested permission to temporarily dock his boat until the storm subsided. The resident refused and cut the rope tying the boat to the dock. As a result, the boat drifted out to sea. The boat was battered by the rocky waves and high winds. Trying to prevent the boat from capsizing, the boat owner fell and broke his leg. The boat was extensively damaged in the storm, as well. The boat owner has sued the resident, seeking to recover damages for his personal injury, as well as damage to the boat.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal scenario. So, there's a boat owner who was sailing when a storm warning came up. He was heading to shore, but the storm got bad with heavy rain and wind, making it dangerous. He couldn't make it to his own slip, so he docked his boat on a pier that belongs to a resident living nearby. The resident didn't want him there and even cut the rope holding the boat to the dock, which caused the boat to drift out to sea and get damaged in the storm. The boat owner also got hurt in the process. Now, the boat owner is suing the resident for both his personal injuries and the damage to the boat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal principles involved here. It seems like the boat owner was seeking shelter from the storm and docked on the resident's private pier without permission. The resident didn't allow it and took action to remove the boat.\n\nI think the boat owner might have a claim based on necessity. The doctrine of necessity allows someone to use another's property without permission when facing an imminent danger, as long as the harm avoided is greater than the damage caused to the property.\n\nIn this case, the boat owner was facing a dangerous storm at sea, which posed a risk to his life and the boat. Docking on the resident's pier was likely necessary to avoid that danger. So, perhaps the boat owner can argue that his actions were justified under the doctrine of necessity.\n\nNow, regarding the damage to the boat and the personal injury. If the resident interfered by cutting the rope, which led to the boat drifting out to sea and getting damaged, and the boat owner getting hurt, then the resident's actions might be considered negligent or intentional interference.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nA. Recover for the damage to the boat, but not for his personal injury.\n\nB. Recover for his personal injury, but not for the damage to the boat.\n\nC. Recover for both damage to the boat and for his personal injury.\n\nD. Not recover for either damage to the boat or his personal injury.\n\nI need to think about whether the resident's actions caused both the boat damage and the personal injury.\n\nIf the resident cut the rope knowing that it would cause the boat to drift into dangerous waters, and that could lead to damage and harm to the boat owner, then it seems like there's a direct causal link.\n\nMoreover, if the boat owner had a right to be there under the doctrine of necessity, then the resident's interference might be unlawful.\n\nOn the other hand, perhaps the resident had a right to protect his private property and didn't want the boat there. But given the emergency situation, I think the necessity defense might override that.\n\nI recall that in cases of necessity, the person who used another's property without permission may have to pay for the damage caused, but they are allowed to use the property to avoid greater harm.\n\nIn this scenario, the boat owner probably would have to compensate the resident for any damage to the pier or other property caused by docking the boat there. However, the resident's action of cutting the rope seems excessive and potentially harmful.\n\nSo, if the resident knew that cutting the rope would lead to the boat being damaged and the boat owner getting hurt, then he might be liable for those consequences.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the boat owner should be able to recover for both the damage to the boat and his personal injury.\n\nBut let me consider if there are any other factors. Maybe the storm was so severe that even if the boat remained docked, it would have been damaged anyway. Or perhaps the resident didn't know about the storm or the danger the boat owner was in.\n\nHowever, according to the scenario, the storm was already happening, with heavy rain and wind gusts, and the boat owner explained the danger to the resident. So, it's possible that the resident was aware of the situation.\n\nAdditionally, cutting the rope seems like an intentional act, which could make the resident liable for the foreseeable consequences.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. Recover both for damage to the boat and for his personal injury.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there are any other legal principles that might apply.\n\nPerhaps trespassing comes into play, since the boat owner was on the resident's private property without permission. However, under the doctrine of necessity, the trespass may be excused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the resident had a right to remove the boat from his property, but perhaps there are better ways to do so without causing harm.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, there might be specific laws regarding docking during emergencies or storm sheltering for boats.\n\nBut assuming general common law principles apply here, the doctrine of necessity seems most relevant.\n\nTherefore, I believe the boat owner should be able to recover for both the damage to the boat and his personal injury.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
