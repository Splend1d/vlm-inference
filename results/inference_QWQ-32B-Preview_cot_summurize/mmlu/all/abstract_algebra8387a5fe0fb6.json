                    "text": "Let's see. I have this question about an abelian group (G, 0), and I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is true for G. First, I need to recall what an abelian group is. An abelian group is a group where the operation is commutative, meaning that for any two elements g and h in G, g o h equals h o g. That's the key property here.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A says: g = g^-1 for every g in G. This means that every element is its own inverse. Is that necessarily true for every abelian group? Well, consider the group of integers under addition, which is abelian. In that group, the inverse of an element n is -n. So, for example, 1 + (-1) = 0, which is the identity element. But 1 is not equal to -1 unless 1 = 0, which only happens in the trivial group with one element. So, in general, this isn't true. Therefore, option A is not necessarily true.\n\nOption B says: g = g^2 for every g in G. This would mean that every element is idempotent under the group operation, meaning that applying the operation to the element with itself gives the element back. Again, considering the group of integers under addition, g + g = 2g, which is not equal to g unless g = 0. So, only the identity element satisfies this, not every element. Therefore, option B is not true.\n\nOption C says: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g, h in G. Let's expand this. First, (g o h)^2 means (g o h) o (g o h). Since the group is abelian, we can rearrange the terms. So, (g o h) o (g o h) = g o h o g o h. Because it's abelian, h o g equals g o h, so this becomes g o g o h o h, which is g^2 o h^2. So, indeed, in an abelian group, (g o h)^2 equals g^2 o h^2 for all g and h in G. This seems to hold true.\n\nOption D says: G is of finite order. Does being abelian imply that the group has a finite number of elements? Well, no. There are infinite abelian groups, like the group of integers under addition. So, this isn't necessarily true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, it seems that option C is the correct choice. But let me double-check.\n\nI'll consider another example to confirm. Take the group of real numbers under addition, which is also abelian. For any two real numbers a and b, (a + b)^2 should equal a^2 + b^2. Wait a minute, in real numbers, (a + b)^2 equals a^2 + 2ab + b^2, not just a^2 + b^2. So, does this contradict option C?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to be careful here. In group theory, the operation is not necessarily multiplication or addition in the usual sense. The operation is denoted by \"o\", and the exponentiation is defined in terms of repeated application of the operation. So, g^2 means g o g, not necessarily g multiplied by itself.\n\nIn the case of the group of real numbers under addition, g^2 would mean g + g, which is 2g. So, (g + h)^2 means (g + h) + (g + h) = 2g + 2h, and g^2 + h^2 means 2g + 2h. So, in this case, (g + h)^2 equals g^2 + h^2.\n\nWait, earlier I thought of (a + b)^2 in the field of real numbers, where multiplication is involved, but in the group under addition, exponentiation to the second power is just adding the element to itself. So, in that context, option C holds.\n\nLet me consider another example. Take the group of non-zero real numbers under multiplication, which is also abelian. In this group, g^2 means g * g, and (g * h)^2 means (g * h) * (g * h) = g^2 * h^2, which matches option C.\n\nSo, in both additive and multiplicative abelian groups, option C holds true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g, h in G.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
