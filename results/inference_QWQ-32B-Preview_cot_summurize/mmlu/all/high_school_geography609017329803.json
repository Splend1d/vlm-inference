It seems like it's talking about a process involving migration, and it's asking about what happens when new residents move into areas occupied by older resident groups.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. New residents tear down and rebuild housing units.\n\nB. New residents live peacefully with old residents.\n\nC. New residents assimilate completely with old residents.\n\nD. New residents move into areas occupied by older resident groups.\n\nHmm, the question is saying that invasion and succession is a process involving migration, and it's best described when... and then it gives these options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what invasion and succession mean in this context. Invasion probably refers to new groups moving into an area, and succession might refer to the changes that occur over time as a result of this migration.\n\nOption A talks about tearing down and rebuilding housing units. While this might happen as part of migration, it doesn't seem to capture the essence of invasion and succession as a process.\n\nOption B says that new residents live peacefully with old residents. Peaceful coexistence is possible, but is that the main characteristic of invasion and succession? Maybe not necessarily.\n\nOption C mentions complete assimilation. Assimilation could be a part of the process, but saying it's complete might not always be the case. Also, is assimilation the key feature of invasion and succession?\n\nOption D states that new residents move into areas occupied by older resident groups. This seems to directly relate to the idea of invasion, where new groups are entering areas already inhabited by others.\n\nConsidering the options, D seems to be the most accurate description of the process of invasion and succession as it involves migration into areas already occupied by other groups.\n\nBut let me think deeper. Maybe the question is trying to get at something more than just moving in. Perhaps it's about the impact of new residents on the area or the older residents.\n\nOption A mentions tearing down and rebuilding, which could be a consequence of invasion, but it's too specific.\n\nOption B is too optimistic; in reality, invasion and succession might not always be peaceful.\n\nOption C assumes complete assimilation, which might not always happen.\n\nOption D is straightforward and matches the definition of invasion.\n\nI think D is the best answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
