A boy and a girl, both 12-year-old youngsters at the bonanza, were looking at each other's cards when they were approached by a 32-year-old collector. The collector asked the boy and girl if he could look through their baseball cards. The boy and girl nodded affirmatively. As the collector was flipping through the boy's cards, he found a 1948 card featuring Branch Rickey, the former owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The collector, who knew the card was worth more than $500, offered the boy 50 cents for the card. The boy thought the card had very little value because he knew that Rickey was not a major league baseball player. The boy accepted the 50 cents and gave the Rickey baseball card to the collector. The next day the boy found out that the baseball card was worth$600. If the boy asserts a claim against the collector for deceit, will the boy prevail?\n\nA. Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\nB. Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\nC.

                    "text": "This question is about a situation where a young boy sells a valuable baseball card for much less than its worth, and now he's trying to claim that the person who bought it from him did something wrong, specifically that it was deceitful. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what deceit is in legal terms. Deceit generally involves someone making a false statement with the intention to mislead another person, and that person relies on that false statement to their detriment.\n\nIn this scenario, the collector found a 1948 Branch Rickey baseball card in the boy's collection. The collector knew the card was worth more than $500, but offered the boy only 50 cents for it. The boy accepted the offer, thinking the card wasn't worth much because Rickey wasn't a major league player.\n\nNow, the boy found out the card is worth $600 and wants to claim deceit against the collector. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. Yes, because the collector did not disclose the true value of the card.\n\nB. Yes, because the boy was the true owner of the card and was entitled to the benefit of the bargain.\n\nC. No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\n\nD. No, because the boy was not justified in relying on the collector's offer.\n\nOption A suggests that the collector should have disclosed the true value of the card. However, in most transactions, there's no obligation to disclose the value of an item unless there's a specific relationship that requires disclosure, like in cases of fiduciary duty. Here, the collector and the boy are strangers, so there's no such obligation.\n\nOption B says the boy was the true owner and entitled to the benefit of the bargain. While that's true, it doesn't directly address whether the collector committed deceit.\n\nOption C states that the collector made no false representations of fact. This seems key. Deceit requires a false statement. Did the collector make any statements about the card's value? The collector offered 50 cents for the card but didn't make any statements about its actual value. Offering a price doesn't imply that the price reflects the true value; it's just what the collector is willing to pay.\n\nOption D says the boy wasn't justified in relying on the collector's offer. This ties into the concept that, in transactions, people are generally expected to do their own due diligence, especially with valuable items.\n\nConsidering these points, it seems that the collector didn't make any false statements about the card's value. He simply offered to buy it for 50 cents, and the boy agreed. The boy's misunderstanding about the card's value is his own mistake, not deceit on the collector's part.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely C. No, because the collector made no false representations of fact.\n\nTo further support this, let's think about what would constitute deceit in this context. If the collector had said something like, \"This card is only worth 50 cents,\" that would be a false representation of fact, assuming he knew it was worth much more. But in this case, he didn't make any statement about the card's value beyond offering to buy it for 50 cents.\n\nAdditionally, the boy should have been cautious about selling a potentially valuable item without verifying its worth, especially since it's a collectible item like a baseball card from 1948.\n\nIn conclusion, since there was no false representation of fact by the collector regarding the card's value, the boy wouldn't prevail in a deceit claim.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
