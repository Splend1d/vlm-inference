                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have three steel containers of the same size and temperature, each containing different gases: helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, with masses of 4.0 g, 28.0 g, and 44.0 g, respectively. We need to identify which statement among the given options is false.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic principles of gas behavior, particularly the ideal gas law, which is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.\n\nSince all containers are the same size and temperature, volume (V) and temperature (T) are constant for all three. This means that the pressure (P) in each container depends on the number of moles (n) of gas present, as per the ideal gas law.\n\nLet's calculate the number of moles for each gas:\n\n1. Helium (He):\n\n- Molar mass of He: approximately 4.0 g/mol\n\n- Moles of He: 4.0 g / 4.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n\n2. Nitrogen (N2):\n\n- Molar mass of N2: approximately 28.0 g/mol\n\n- Moles of N2: 28.0 g / 28.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n\n3. Carbon Dioxide (CO2):\n\n- Molar mass of CO2: approximately 44.0 g/mol\n\n- Moles of CO2: 44.0 g / 44.0 g/mol = 1.0 mol\n\nSurprisingly, each container has exactly 1.0 mole of its respective gas.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement one by one:\n\nA. The densities increase in the order helium < nitrogen < carbon dioxide.\n\nDensity (\u03c1) is mass per unit volume (\u03c1 = m/V). Since all containers have the same volume and different masses, the density is directly proportional to the mass of the gas.\n\nGiven the masses:\n\n- He: 4.0 g\n\n- N2: 28.0 g\n\n- CO2: 44.0 g\n\nThus, density order: He < N2 < CO2.\n\nThis statement seems true.\n\nB. The number of molecules in all the containers is the same.\n\nSince each container has 1.0 mole of gas, and one mole contains Avogadro's number of molecules (approximately 6.022 x 10^23 molecules), the number of molecules is the same in all three containers.\n\nThis statement is true.\n\nC. The pressure in all three containers is the same.\n\nAccording to the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Since V, n, R, and T are the same for all containers, P must be the same for all.\n\nThis statement is true.\n\nD. The average speed of all the molecules is the same.\n\nThe average speed of gas molecules is related to temperature and molar mass. Specifically, the root-mean-square speed (vrms) is given by:\n\nvrms = sqrt((3RT)/M)\n\nwhere R is the gas constant, T is temperature, and M is molar mass.\n\nSince temperature is the same for all gases but molar masses are different, the average speeds should differ.\n\nHe has the lowest molar mass, so its molecules should have the highest average speed, while CO2 has the highest molar mass and thus the lowest average speed.\n\nTherefore, the average speed of molecules is not the same for all gases.\n\nThis statement is false.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nThe question mentions that all containers are at the same temperature. In kinetic theory, the average kinetic energy of gas molecules is proportional to temperature. Since temperature is the same, the average kinetic energy is the same for all gases.\n\nKinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2, where m is mass and v is speed.\n\nSo, for the same kinetic energy, lighter molecules (like He) will have higher speeds than heavier molecules (like CO2).\n\nTherefore, even though the average kinetic energy is the same, the average speeds are different due to different masses.\n\nHence, statement D is indeed false.\n\nSo, the false statement is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
