The options are:\n\nScenario 1: I borrowed a book and took photos of some pages to remember them.\n\nScenario 2: I copied answers from a book during a closed book test at school.\n\nAnd then there are four choices:\n\nA. Wrong, Wrong\n\nB. Wrong, Not wrong\n\nC. Not wrong, Wrong\n\nD. Not wrong, Not wrong\n\nAlright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, Scenario 1: borrowing a book and taking photos of some pages to remember them.\n\nSo, borrowing a book is usually fine, especially if it's from a library or a friend, assuming you plan to return it. Taking photos of pages might be a different story. Depending on copyright laws and the terms of borrowing, this could be an issue. But in terms of ordinary moral standards, if you're borrowing a book and taking photos just to remember some information, it seems mostly harmless. You're not damaging the book, and you're still planning to return it.\n\nHowever, there might be some considerations here. If the book is rare or valuable, taking photos might be seen as intrusive or inappropriate. But generally, for a regular book, it seems acceptable.\n\nNow, Scenario 2: copying answers from a book during a closed book test at school.\n\nThis one seems pretty straightforward. A closed book test is meant to assess your knowledge without referring to external materials. Copying answers from a book during such a test is cheating. Cheating is generally considered morally wrong because it's dishonest and gives you an unfair advantage over others who are abiding by the rules.\n\nSo, comparing the two:\n\nScenario 1: Probably not wrong, unless there are specific circumstances that make it inappropriate.\n\nScenario 2: Definitely wrong, as it involves cheating.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice should be C. Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nOption A says both are wrong, but that doesn't seem right because Scenario 1 doesn't appear to be morally wrong in ordinary circumstances.\n\nOption B says Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong, which contradicts what we've thought so far.\n\nOption D says neither is wrong, but we know Scenario 2 is clearly wrong.\n\nSo, yes, Option C seems correct: Not wrong, Wrong.\n\nIt's important to consider the context, but based on the information provided and general moral standards in the US as of 2020, this should be the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
