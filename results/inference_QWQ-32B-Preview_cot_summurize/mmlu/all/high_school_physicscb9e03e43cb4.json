                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between work, heat, and internal energy in an isothermal process for an ideal gas.\n\nFirst, recall that in an isothermal process, the temperature of the system remains constant. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. Therefore, in an isothermal process, the change in internal energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) is zero.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta U = Q - W\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(Q\\) is the heat added to the system and \\(W\\) is the work done by the system.\n\nSince \\(\\Delta U = 0\\) for an isothermal process, we can write:\n\n\\[\n0 = Q - W\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(Q\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nQ = W\n\\]\n\nIn this problem, the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. Therefore, \\(W = 150 \\, \\text{J}\\).\n\nSubstituting this into the equation \\(Q = W\\), we find:\n\n\\[\nQ = 150 \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 150 J of heat was added to the gas to compensate for the work it did, keeping the internal energy constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 150 J of heat was added to the gas.\n\n**Additional Explanation:**\n\n- **Option B:** This would imply that heat was removed from the gas, which would decrease the internal energy. However, since \\(\\Delta U = 0\\), heat cannot be removed without adding an equivalent amount of work.\n\n- **Options C and D:** These suggest heat transfers of 300 J, which is not consistent with the work done being 150 J in an isothermal process.\n\nThus, only option A correctly describes the heat transfer during this isothermal expansion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
