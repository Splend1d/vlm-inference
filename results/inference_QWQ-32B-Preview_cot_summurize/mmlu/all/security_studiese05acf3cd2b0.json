The roles that women played in violence, be it as victims, perpetrators or otherwise, was framed in terms of what effect their roles had on the state, rather than as individuals or as women.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, security studies mostly focused on traditional aspects like military power, diplomacy, and international relations. The role of women in warfare and security was largely overlooked or marginalized. Here's why option B seems the most accurate:\n\nOption A suggests that women didn't actively engage in warfare as combatants, so their roles weren't considered important in security studies. However, even if women weren't prominent combatants, they have played significant roles in supporting warfare, as nurses, workers in war industries, and in other capacities. So, ignoring their roles isn't justified solely on the basis of not being combatants.\n\nOption B aligns well with the idea that when women's roles were considered, it was often in terms of how they affected the state or the war effort, rather than examining their experiences and roles from a gendered perspective or considering them as individuals with agency. This fits with the broader trend in traditional security studies of viewing security primarily at the level of the state, often neglecting the human security dimension.\n\nOption C contradicts the premise of the question, which states that the role of women was neglected. If their roles were given appropriate consideration, as option C suggests, then there wouldn't be a need to highlight their neglect.\n\nOption D portrays women as generally unsupportive of warfare, which is a stereotype and not universally true. Moreover, even if some women were opposed to warfare, their contributions to anti-war movements could still be significant and relevant to security studies. Ignoring their roles because they weren't supporting warfare wouldn't make sense, especially since peace and conflict studies do consider the roles of both supporters and opponents of warfare.\n\nTherefore, option B seems to best explain why the role of women in war was neglected in security studies prior to the late 20th century."
