                    "text": "So I've got this question here about agricultural practices, and it's asking about planting and harvesting the same crop more than once a year. The options are swidden, double cropping, pastoralism, and intertillage. I need to figure out which one of these corresponds to planting and harvesting the same crop multiple times a year.\n\nFirst, I should probably understand what each of these terms means. Let's start with swidden. I think swidden is related to slash-and-burn agriculture, where forests are cut down and burned to create fields. After a few years, the land is left to revert back to forest, and farmers move to a new area. So, that doesn't sound like planting the same crop multiple times a year; it seems more like a rotational system with long fallow periods.\n\nNext, double cropping: This sounds like it might be the answer. If you're double cropping, you're harvesting two crops from the same field in one year. That fits the description of planting and harvesting the same crop more than once a year, or perhaps even different crops in succession.\n\nPastoralism, I believe, is related to raising livestock, like herding animals from one grazing area to another. So, that doesn't involve planting and harvesting crops at all.\n\nLastly, intertillage\u2014I'm not sure what this is. Maybe it's something related to planting different crops together in the same field, like intercropping. But the term \"intertillage\" isn't familiar to me. Maybe it's a typo or an obscure term. I'll need to look that up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's \"intertillage\" as in tilling between rows or something like that. But that doesn't seem directly related to planting and harvesting the same crop multiple times a year.\n\nGiven that, double cropping seems like the most likely answer. It's a practice where farmers plant and harvest two crops in the same field within one growing season, which is typically within a year.\n\nTo confirm, maybe I should think about why someone would double crop. Well, in areas with a long growing season, or where the climate allows for multiple harvests, farmers can take advantage of that to increase their yield per year. For example, in some regions, after harvesting wheat in June, they might plant soybeans that can be harvested in September or October.\n\nSo, double cropping is efficient use of land to maximize production within a year. It makes sense.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, I should make sure that none of the other options fit better.\n\nSwidden, as I recall, is more about clearing land for temporary agriculture and then moving on, which isn't the same as intensively planting and harvesting the same crop multiple times a year.\n\nPastoralism is about livestock, so that's irrelevant here.\n\nIntertillage is unclear to me, but it doesn't sound like it refers to multiple harvests of the same crop.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be double cropping, which is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
