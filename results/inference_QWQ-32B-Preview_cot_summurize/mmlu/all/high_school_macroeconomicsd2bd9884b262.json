                    "text": "So I've got this question here: \"A decrease in the price of a particular product will result in...\" and there are four options: A) an increase in demand, B) a decrease in demand, C) an increase in the quantity demanded, or D) a decrease in the quantity demanded.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand the difference between \"demand\" and \"quantity demanded.\" Demand refers to the entire relationship between price and the quantity that people are willing and able to buy. It's the whole demand curve. Quantity demanded, on the other hand, is a specific point on that demand curve; it's the amount of the product that people are willing and able to buy at a particular price.\n\nSo, when the price of a product decreases, what happens?\n\nWell, according to the law of demand, there's an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. That means, generally, when the price goes down, the quantity demanded goes up, and vice versa.\n\nBut let's think about demand itself. If the price changes, does that shift the entire demand curve? Not really. A shift in the demand curve happens when something other than the price changes, like consumer preferences, income levels, or the prices of related goods.\n\nSo, in this case, since only the price of the product is changing, and not any of those other factors, the demand curve stays the same. What changes is the quantity demanded.\n\nTherefore, a decrease in price leads to an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing.\n\nLet's consider an example. Suppose the price of apples decreases. Assuming everything else stays the same, more people would be willing and able to buy apples at the lower price. So, the quantity of apples demanded would increase.\n\nBut demand is different. If suddenly everyone decides they love apples more (maybe a new study says apples are really healthy), then the demand for apples increases, and the demand curve shifts to the right.\n\nIn our original scenario, it's just the price that's changing, not these underlying factors that would shift the demand curve.\n\nSo, going back to the options:\n\nA) an increase in demand - that would involve a shift in the demand curve, which isn't happening here.\n\nB) a decrease in demand - same issue, no shift in the demand curve.\n\nC) an increase in the quantity demanded - that makes sense, because the price\u4e0b\u964d leads to more being bought, according to the law of demand.\n\nD) a decrease in the quantity demanded - that would be the opposite of what's expected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C) an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any exceptions or special cases where a decrease in price might not lead to an increase in quantity demanded.\n\nOne possible exception is with Giffen goods or Veblen goods.\n\nGiffen goods are inferior goods for which demand increases as the price increases, but these are rare and mostly theoretical. In practice, it's hard to find examples that fit this description perfectly.\n\nVeblen goods are luxury items where higher prices can signal higher quality or status, so demand might increase as price increases. But again, these are exceptions rather than the rule.\n\nIn most normal cases, a decrease in price leads to an increase in quantity demanded.\n\nSo, unless specified that the product is a Giffen or Veblen good, which it's not in this question, I think C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should look back at the definitions.\n\nDemand is the entire relationship between price and quantity, while quantity demanded is the specific amount at a specific price.\n\nA change in price causes a movement along the demand curve, not a shift of the curve itself.\n\nSo, if price decreases, and we're moving along the same demand curve, that means quantity demanded increases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C) an increase in the quantity demanded.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
