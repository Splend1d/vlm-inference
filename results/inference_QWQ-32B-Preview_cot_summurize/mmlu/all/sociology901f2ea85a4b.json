                    "text": "Let's see what Judith Butler had to say about gender. I remember that she's a really important thinker in this area. So, the question is asking about her suggestion in 1999. Let's look at each option and see which one aligns with her ideas.\n\nOption A says that sexual characteristics are the biological determinants of gender. Hmm, I think Butler would disagree with this. She's known for arguing that gender is not simply determined by biology but is something that is performed and constructed socially. So, this doesn't seem right.\n\nOption B says that heterosexuality and homosexuality are essential, opposing identities. Again, I don't think Butler would see identities as essential or fixed. She's more about the idea that these identities are constructed through social practices and performances. So, probably not this one.\n\nOption C mentions that the 'two-sex' model replaced the 'one-sex' model in the eighteenth century. I'm not sure about the historical accuracy of this statement, but even if it's true, I don't recall Butler specifically discussing this in her work. So, maybe not this one.\n\nOption D says that gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex.' This sounds more like Butler's ideas. She is famous for her concept of \"gender performativity,\" which suggests that gender is not something we are, but something we do through our actions and behaviors. So, this seems to align with her thoughts.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check. In her book \"Gender Trouble,\" which was published in 1990, Butler introduced the idea that gender is performed rather than inherent. She argues that gender identity is constructed through repeated performances of gender norms. So, option D seems to capture that idea.\n\nBut let's make sure. The phrase \"to create 'sex'\" might be a bit misleading. Butler distinguishes between sex and gender, arguing that sex is also constructed rather than purely biological. So, perhaps the option is trying to say that through performance, we create the notion of sex as well.\n\nOverall, I think option D is the best choice here, as it reflects Butler's perspective on gender performativity.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
