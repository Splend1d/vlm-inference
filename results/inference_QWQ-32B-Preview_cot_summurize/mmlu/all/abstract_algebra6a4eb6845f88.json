                    "text": "Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\n**Statement 1:** If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)+g(x)) = maximum (deg f(x), deg g(x)).\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the degree of a polynomial is. The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x with a non-zero coefficient. So, for polynomials f(x) and g(x) in R[x], their sum f(x) + g(x) will have terms up to the maximum degree of f and g, provided that the leading coefficients do not cancel each other out.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose R is the ring of integers, and let f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1 and g(x) = -x^2 + 3x + 4. Then, f(x) + g(x) = (x^2 - x^2) + (2x + 3x) + (1 + 4) = 5x + 5. Here, deg f(x) = 2, deg g(x) = 2, but deg (f(x) + g(x)) = 1, which is less than the maximum degree of f and g. This contradicts the statement.\n\nAnother example: Let f(x) = x^3 + x and g(x) = x^2 + 1. Then f(x) + g(x) = x^3 + x^2 + x + 1. Here, deg f(x) = 3, deg g(x) = 2, and deg (f(x) + g(x)) = 3, which equals the maximum degree. So in this case, the statement holds.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that the statement is not always true because the degrees can cancel out. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n**Statement 2:** If F is a field, then every ideal of F[x] is principal.\n\nI need to recall what an ideal is and what it means for an ideal to be principal. An ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition and under multiplication by any element of the ring. A principal ideal is one that can be generated by a single element.\n\nIn the case of F[x], where F is a field, it is a well-known result that every ideal in F[x] is principal. This is because F[x] is a principal ideal domain (PID). The proof relies on the fact that F[x] is an Euclidean domain, meaning there is a division algorithm, and in Euclidean domains, every ideal is principal.\n\nTo see why, consider any ideal I in F[x]. If I is the zero ideal, it is generated by 0. If I is not zero, let g(x) be a non-zero polynomial in I of minimal degree. I claim that I is generated by g(x). Take any f(x) in I. By the division algorithm, we can write f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x), where r(x) has degree less than g(x) or is zero. Since f(x) and g(x) are in I, and I is an ideal, r(x) must also be in I. But since g(x) has minimal degree in I, r(x) must be zero. Therefore, f(x) = q(x)g(x), which means f(x) is in the ideal generated by g(x). Hence, I is principal.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n\n- Statement 2: True\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D. False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
