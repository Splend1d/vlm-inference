                    "text": "So I've got this question here about tax rates, and I need to figure out what kind of tax system this is based on the information given. Let's see:\n\n- For a single person with $25,000 in taxable income, the tax rate is 24 percent.\n\n- For a single person with $20,000 in taxable income, the tax rate is 20 percent.\n\nAnd I need to determine whether this tax rate over this income range is regressive, progressive, proportional, or revenue-neutral.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Regressive tax**: This is a tax where the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases. In other words, lower-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to higher-income individuals.\n\n2. **Progressive tax**: This is a tax where the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases. So, higher-income individuals pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower-income individuals.\n\n3. **Proportional tax**: Also known as a flat tax, this is a tax where the tax rate remains the same regardless of the taxable amount. So, everyone pays the same percentage of their income in taxes.\n\n4. **Revenue-neutral tax**: This term usually refers to a tax change that is designed to neither increase nor decrease overall government revenue. It's more about the impact on the budget rather than the rate structure.\n\nNow, looking at the information provided:\n\n- At $20,000 income, the tax rate is 20%.\n\n- At $25,000 income, the tax rate is 24%.\n\nSo, as income increases from $20,000 to $25,000, the tax rate increases from 20% to 24%. This seems like a progressive tax because the tax rate goes up as income goes up.\n\nBut let's make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should calculate the actual tax amounts to see the difference.\n\nFor $20,000 at 20%:\n\nTax = 20,000 * 0.20 = $4,000\n\nFor $25,000 at 24%:\n\nTax = 25,000 * 0.24 = $6,000\n\nSo, the tax amount increases from $4,000 to $6,000 as income increases from $20,000 to $25,000.\n\nMoreover, the tax rate increases from 20% to 24%, which again suggests a progressive tax system.\n\nLet me consider if this could be a proportional tax. In a proportional tax system, the tax rate should be the same regardless of income. Here, the tax rates are different at different income levels, so it's not proportional.\n\nCould it be regressive? In a regressive tax system, higher-income individuals pay a lower percentage in taxes. Here, higher income corresponds to a higher tax rate, so that's the opposite of regressive.\n\nAnd revenue-neutral isn't really about the rate structure but about the overall effect on government revenue, so that doesn't fit here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that the tax rate over this income range is progressive.\n\nWait a minute, but I should consider whether this is actually a marginal tax rate or an average tax rate. In many tax systems, taxes are calculated based on marginal rates, where different portions of income are taxed at different rates.\n\nHowever, in this question, it seems like the tax rate applies to the entire income amount. For example, for $20,000, it's 20% on the whole amount, and for $25,000, it's 24% on the whole amount. If that's the case, then yes, it's progressive because the rate increases with income.\n\nBut perhaps I should think about it in terms of average tax rate. The average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by the total income. In this case, it's given directly as 20% for $20,000 and 24% for $25,000.\n\nSo, based on that, it's clear that as income increases, the average tax rate also increases, which is the definition of a progressive tax system.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. progressive.\n\nJust to double-check, let's think about how this would look in a marginal tax system. Suppose there are tax brackets where different portions of income are taxed at different rates. But in this question, it seems like the tax rate applies to the entire income, not just the portion above certain thresholds.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the tax rate over this income range is progressive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
