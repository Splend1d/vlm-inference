So, the development of an egg without fertilization is known as... let's see the options: meiosis, parthenogenesis, embryogenesis, or vegetative propagation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these terms means.\n\nMeiosis is a type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half, creating gametes like sperm and eggs. So, that's how eggs are formed in the first place, but it involves fertilization later on.\n\nParthenogenesis sounds familiar; I think it has something to do with eggs developing without being fertilized. Isn't that how some insects or certain animals reproduce asexually?\n\nEmbryogenesis is the process of an embryo developing into a fetus or a fully formed organism. That seems to happen after fertilization.\n\nVegetative propagation is a type of asexual reproduction in plants, where new individuals are generated from vegetative parts like stems or roots, not from seeds.\n\nSo, if I'm thinking about an egg developing without being fertilized, that sounds like parthenogenesis to me. Some species can do this, right? Like certain insects, lizards, or even some birds.\n\nLet me double-check. Meiosis is the cell division that produces eggs, but that requires fertilization from sperm to develop further. Embryogenesis follows fertilization. Vegetative propagation is specific to plants and doesn't involve eggs in the same way.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. parthenogenesis.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if any of the other options could fit. For example, is meiosis involved in unfertilized egg development? Well, meiosis produces the egg, but without fertilization, the egg doesn't develop further, does it? In parthenogenesis, the egg starts developing without being fertilized, so that seems different from meiosis.\n\nEmbryogenesis typically requires fertilization to begin, so that probably isn't it.\n\nVegetative propagation is unrelated to egg development.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident that parthenogenesis is the right answer here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
