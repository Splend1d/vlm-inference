                    "text": "So here's this legal scenario involving a man and a woman who are tennis partners. The man had an accident at work last January when he slipped and fell while restocking grocery shelves. Now, he's suing the grocery store for damages because he says he has pain in his back and legs due to that accident.\n\nAt the trial, the woman, his tennis partner, testified something interesting. Five days before the accident, she said the man told her, \"I can't complete the tennis match because of pains in my back and legs.\" Now, the question is, should the trial judge allow this testimony or not? And we have four options: A, B, C, and D.\n\nLet's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what hearsay is. Hearsay is when someone testifies about something they heard someone else say, and that statement is offered to prove the truth of what was said. So, if the woman is testifying about what the man said about his pains, and that's to prove that he actually had pains before the accident, that could be considered hearsay.\n\nBut there are exceptions to the hearsay rule, and one of them is for statements of bodily condition. Statements like \"I feel pain\" or \"I'm sick\" are generally admissible because they are about the declarant's own physical condition at the time they were made.\n\nIn this case, the man said, \"I can't complete the tennis match because of pains in my back and legs.\" This seems like a statement about his physical condition at that time.\n\nNow, why is this relevant in a lawsuit about an accident that happened five days later? Well, if the man is claiming that the accident caused pain in his back and legs, and it turns out he was already experiencing such pain before the accident, that could be crucial to the case. It might suggest that the accident wasn't the cause of his current condition, or at least not the sole cause.\n\nSo, option D says the testimony is admissible as a statement of bodily condition. That seems plausible.\n\nOption A says it's inadmissible as hearsay. But given that there's an exception for statements of bodily condition, maybe it's admissible.\n\nOption B says it's inadmissible as opinion testimony. But the man isn't stating an opinion; he's stating a fact about his own physical condition. So, maybe this isn't the right choice.\n\nOption C says it's admissible as proper lay opinion. Lay opinions are general observations that don't require special knowledge. But again, the man is stating his own condition, which is more about fact than opinion.\n\nWait a minute, is he stating a fact or expressing an opinion? When he says, \"I can't complete the tennis match because of pains in my back and legs,\" he's describing his own sensations and abilities, which are subjective but directly experienced by him.\n\nIn law, statements about one's own physical condition are generally considered admissible because the person has first-hand knowledge of their own feelings and sensations.\n\nMoreover, in legal proceedings, especially in personal injury cases, the pre-existing condition of the plaintiff is often relevant. If the plaintiff was already experiencing pain before the accident, that could affect the damages they can recover.\n\nSo, in this context, the woman's testimony about what the man said five days before the accident is relevant to show that he may have had pre-existing pains in his back and legs.\n\nNow, is this hearsay? It certainly seems like it, because she's testifying about something the man said out of court, and it's being offered to prove that he actually had pains before the accident.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, there's an exception to the hearsay rule for statements of bodily condition. These are considered reliable because people are generally trustworthy when reporting their own sensations.\n\nIn the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803(3) allows for statements of then-existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition. So, the man's statement about his pains would fall under this exception.\n\nTherefore, the testimony should be admissible as a statement of bodily condition.\n\nBut let's double-check why it wouldn't be inadmissible as hearsay or opinion testimony.\n\nFirst, hearsay: Yes, it is hearsay, but it's excepted under the statements of bodily condition exception.\n\nSecond, opinion testimony: The man isn't giving an opinion; he's stating his own sensations and abilities. So, it's not opinion testimony in that sense.\n\nLay opinion: Lay opinions are allowed when they're rationally based on the witness's perception. But in this case, it's not the woman giving an opinion; it's her reporting what the man said.\n\nTherefore, option D seems to be the correct choice: the testimony is admissible as a statement of bodily condition.\n\nHowever, it's worth considering that the timing is five days before the accident. The relevance might be questioned, but that's a separate issue from admissibility. The court might still consider it relevant to show the man's condition shortly before the accident.\n\nIn conclusion, the trial judge should rule this testimony admissible as a statement of bodily condition.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
