                    "text": "So I have this problem here about functions and their properties. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it.\n\nWe have two sets, A and B, and two functions between them: f from A to B, and g from B back to A. The condition given is that for every element a in A, applying f and then g gets us back to a. In other words, g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.\n\nNow, there are two statements I need to evaluate:\n\n1. The function g must necessarily be injective.\n\n2. The function g must necessarily be surjective.\n\nAnd I have to choose between four options: both true, both false, first true and second false, or first false and second true.\n\nAlright, let's tackle injectivity first. A function is injective if different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain. So, for g to be injective, whenever g(b1) = g(b2), it must be that b1 = b2.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, let's see if this implies that g is injective.\n\nSuppose g(b1) = g(b2) for some b1, b2 in B. I need to show that b1 = b2.\n\nBut wait, I only have information about g composed with f, not about g applied to arbitrary elements of B.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that f is surjective or something like that.\n\nActually, let's think of a counterexample where g is not injective.\n\nSuppose A has fewer elements than B. For example, let A = {1}, B = {a, b}, f(1) = a, and g(a) = 1, g(b) = 1.\n\nThen, g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1, which satisfies the condition. But g is not injective because both a and b map to 1.\n\nSo, in this case, g is not injective, yet the condition holds.\n\nTherefore, statement 1 is false.\n\nNow, let's consider surjectivity. A function is surjective if every element in the codomain is mapped to by some element in the domain.\n\nSo, for g to be surjective, for every a in A, there must exist some b in B such that g(b) = a.\n\nGiven that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it seems like for each a in A, there is at least one b in B (specifically, b = f(a)) such that g(b) = a.\n\nTherefore, g is surjective.\n\nWait, but in my previous counterexample, g was surjective because the only element in A was 1, and g(a) = 1 and g(b) = 1, so every element in A is covered.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where g is not surjective.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, actually, in the condition g(f(a)) = a, for all a in A, it ensures that for every a in A, there is at least one b in B (namely, f(a)) that maps to a under g. Therefore, g is surjective.\n\nSo, statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: False, True.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nIs there any scenario where g is not surjective, even if g(f(a)) = a for all a in A?\n\nSuppose A = {1, 2}, B = {a, b, c}, f(1) = a, f(2) = b, and g(a) = 1, g(b) = 2, g(c) = 2.\n\nThen, g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1, and g(f(2)) = g(b) = 2, which satisfies the condition.\n\nBut g is surjective because both 1 and 2 are covered: 1 is covered by a, and 2 is covered by b and c.\n\nWait, but what if I have A = {1}, B = {a, b}, f(1) = a, g(a) = 1, g(b) = 1.\n\nIn this case, g is surjective because the only element in A, which is 1, is covered by both a and b.\n\nSo, in all these cases, g seems to be surjective.\n\nIs there a way for g not to be surjective while still having g(f(a)) = a for all a in A?\n\nSuppose A = {1}, B = {a, b}, f(1) = a, g(a) = 1, g(b) = some element not in A?\n\nWait, but g is from B to A, so g(b) must be in A.\n\nWait, A is the codomain of g.\n\nWait, no, actually, g: B -> A, so g maps from B to A.\n\nIn my earlier example, A = {1}, B = {a, b}, f(1) = a, g(a) = 1, g(b) = 1.\n\nThis satisfies g(f(1)) = g(a) = 1.\n\nAnd g is surjective because both a and b map to 1, which is the only element in A.\n\nSo, I can't have g not being surjective while satisfying g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is indeed true.\n\nSo, the answer should be D: False, True.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no trick here.\n\nIs there any possibility that g is not surjective?\n\nI don't think so, because the condition g(f(a)) = a ensures that for every a in A, there is at least one b in B (f(a)) that maps back to a under g.\n\nHence, g is surjective.\n\nBut g is not necessarily injective, as shown in the counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D: False, True.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
