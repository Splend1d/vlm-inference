She parked in the store's parking lot, and while walking toward the building two masked males assaulted and raped her. The lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. The police had several incident reports in the past 12 months documenting prior criminal activities, including some personal robberies and assaults, in the lot.

Yes, a business will be liable for known conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that are a danger to the personal safety and security of its customers.\nB. No, the store owes no special duty of care to eliminate crime on the parking lot; it was up to the police to perform that task.\nC. No, the occurrence of a rape of a customer was not a foreseeable event and the store had no duty to try and discover that such a potential danger could exist.\nD. Yes, a store owner is the guarantor to every customer that he or she will be protected and safe when walking in the parking lot.\n"

                    "text": "I'm going to try to figure out this legal question. So, there's a woman who was raped in a supermarket parking lot late at night. She's suing the store for not keeping the premises safe. There are some details given: the parking lot was poorly lit, had no security personnel, and was frequented by gang members. Also, the police had reports of criminal activities in the past year, and the store had even more reports.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the legal standard is here. The question mentions \"duty to make the premises reasonably safe for its customers.\" That sounds like premises liability. In general, property owners have a duty to keep their premises safe for invitees, which in this case, the customers are invitees to the supermarket.\n\nOption A says yes, the business is liable for known dangerous conditions in the building or adjoining parking areas that pose a danger to customers' safety and security. That seems plausible. If the store knew or should have known about the dangerous conditions in the parking lot, they might be liable for not addressing them.\n\nOption B says no, the store owes no special duty to eliminate crime; it's the police's job. Well, that might have been the case in the past, but I think nowadays, businesses are expected to take reasonable steps to ensure customer safety, especially if there's a history of crime in the area.\n\nOption C says no, a rape was not foreseeable, so no duty to discover that danger. But the question mentions that there were prior incident reports, including assaults and robberies. If there's a pattern of criminal activity, especially violent crimes, isn't it more foreseeable that something like a rape could happen?\n\nOption D says yes, the store guarantees the safety of customers in the parking lot. That seems a bit extreme. I don't think businesses are guarantors of absolute safety, but they do have a responsibility to take reasonable measures to ensure safety.\n\nLet me think about this. The store had more reports of incidents than the police did. That suggests they were aware of the problems in the parking lot. If they knew about the poor lighting, the lack of security, and the presence of gang members, and didn't take steps to improve safety, they might be negligent.\n\nIn premises liability, foreseeability is key. If the store should have foreseen the risk of criminal acts based on past incidents, they have a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent them.\n\nIn this scenario, with multiple reports of criminal activity, poor lighting, and no security, it seems like the store failed to act reasonably to protect its customers.\n\nSo, I think the woman is likely to prevail, which aligns with option A.\n\nBut let me consider option C again. It says that a rape was not foreseeable. However, if there were prior assaults and robberies, perhaps a court would find that sexual assaults are foreseeable in such an environment.\n\nAdditionally, the store had more reports than the police, which suggests they had more knowledge of the problems.\n\nOn the other hand, option B argues that it's the police's responsibility to eliminate crime, not the store's. But I think that's too narrow. While the police have a general duty to maintain public safety, businesses still have a specific duty to their invitees to provide a reasonably safe environment.\n\nOption D goes too far by implying a guarantee of safety, which isn't realistic. No one can guarantee complete safety anywhere.\n\nSo, balancing all this, I believe option A is the correct answer: yes, the business will be liable for known dangerous conditions in the parking lot that pose a danger to customers.\n\nThis seems consistent with legal principles of premises liability, where businesses are expected to take reasonable steps to protect customers from foreseeable harms, especially if they have knowledge of prior similar incidents.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
