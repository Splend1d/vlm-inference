                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have the function f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 9x - 18, and we need to determine which of the given statements is true. The statements are:\n\nA. f(x) = 0 has three real solutions.\n\nB. f(x) \u2265 \u201318 for all x \u2265 0.\n\nC. f(x) \u2264 \u201318 for all x \u2264 0.\n\nD. The function f(x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.\n\nFirst, I'll consider statement A: f(x) = 0 has three real solutions.\n\nTo find the number of real solutions to f(x) = 0, I need to find the roots of the cubic equation. One way to approach this is to try to factor the cubic polynomial.\n\nLet's see if I can factor f(x) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 - 9x - 18.\n\nI can try to factor by grouping:\n\nf(x) = (x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2) + (-9x - 18)\n\n= x\u00b2(x + 2) - 9(x + 2)\n\n= (x\u00b2 - 9)(x + 2)\n\nNow, x\u00b2 - 9 is a difference of squares, which factors as (x - 3)(x + 3).\n\nSo, f(x) = (x - 3)(x + 3)(x + 2)\n\nTherefore, the roots are x = 3, x = -3, and x = -2.\n\nSince all three roots are real numbers, statement A is true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check the other statements as well, because there might be more than one true statement, and I need to pick only one.\n\nStatement B: f(x) \u2265 \u201318 for all x \u2265 0.\n\nLet's test this by plugging in some values of x \u2265 0.\n\nFirst, x = 0:\n\nf(0) = 0\u00b3 + 2(0)\u00b2 - 9(0) - 18 = -18\n\nSo, f(0) = -18, which satisfies f(x) \u2265 -18.\n\nNext, x = 1:\n\nf(1) = 1 + 2 - 9 - 18 = -24\n\n-24 is not greater than or equal to -18.\n\nSo, f(1) = -24 < -18, which contradicts statement B.\n\nTherefore, statement B is false.\n\nStatement C: f(x) \u2264 \u201318 for all x \u2264 0.\n\nAgain, let's test this with some values of x \u2264 0.\n\nWe already have f(0) = -18, which satisfies f(x) \u2264 -18.\n\nNow, x = -1:\n\nf(-1) = (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 - 9(-1) - 18 = -1 + 2 + 9 - 18 = -8\n\n-8 is not less than or equal to -18.\n\nSo, f(-1) = -8 > -18, which contradicts statement C.\n\nTherefore, statement C is false.\n\nStatement D: The function f(x) is decreasing for x \u2264 \u20133.\n\nTo determine if the function is decreasing for x \u2264 -3, I need to look at its derivative.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) is:\n\nf'(x) = 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 9\n\nTo find where the function is decreasing, I need to find where f'(x) < 0.\n\nSo, I need to solve 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 9 < 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic inequality. First, find the roots of 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 9 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 108)] / 6\n\n= [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(124)] / 6\n\n= [-4 \u00b1 2*sqrt(31)] / 6\n\n= [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(31)] / 3\n\nLet's approximate sqrt(31) \u2248 5.57\n\nSo, x \u2248 [-2 + 5.57]/3 \u2248 1.19/3 \u2248 0.397\n\nAnd x \u2248 [-2 - 5.57]/3 \u2248 -7.57/3 \u2248 -2.523\n\nSo, the roots are approximately x \u2248 0.397 and x \u2248 -2.523.\n\nThe quadratic 3x\u00b2 + 4x - 9 opens upwards (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive), so it is negative between its roots.\n\nTherefore, f'(x) < 0 for x between approximately -2.523 and 0.397.\n\nThis means that f(x) is decreasing in the interval (-2.523, 0.397).\n\nTherefore, for x \u2264 -3, which is to the left of -2.523, f'(x) > 0, meaning the function is increasing, not decreasing.\n\nTherefore, statement D is false.\n\nSo, among the given statements, only statement A is true.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
