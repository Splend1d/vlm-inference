The green hues range from light to dark, adding depth and dimension. The overall composition suggests a harmonious blend of these two colors.\n\nTo determine the color scheme represented, let's consider the options given:\n\nA. Analogous Color Scheme: This involves colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. For example, blue and green are neighboring colors, so this could be a possibility.\n\nB. Complementary Color Scheme: This involves colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, such as blue and orange. Since green is not directly opposite blue, this seems less likely.\n\nC. Monochromatic Color Scheme: This involves various shades and tints of a single color. The description mentions both blue and green, so this doesn't fit.\n\nD. Triadic Color Scheme: This involves three colors evenly spaced on the color wheel, such as red, yellow, and blue. Since only blue and green are mentioned, this doesn't seem to apply.\n\nGiven that blue and green are adjacent on the color wheel and the description emphasizes a harmonious blend of these two colors, the most appropriate color scheme is the Analogous Color Scheme.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Analogous Color Scheme.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
