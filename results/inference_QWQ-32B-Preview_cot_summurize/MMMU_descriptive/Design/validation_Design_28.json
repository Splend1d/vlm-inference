The kitchen features a sink, stove, and refrigerator arranged in an L-shape. There is a dashed line labeled \"WORK TRIANGLE\" connecting these three appliances, indicating the primary workflow area in the kitchen. Additionally, there is another dashed line labeled \"TRAFFIC PATTERN\" that runs from one side of the kitchen to the other, suggesting the path people might take when moving through the space. The traffic pattern does not intersect the work triangle, which is important for efficient kitchen design.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nNo major _____ should cross through the basic work triangle.<image 1>\n\nA.

Traffic.\n\nThe description mentions that there is a \"WORK TRIANGLE\" connecting the sink, stove, and refrigerator, which are the primary workflow areas in the kitchen. It also mentions a \"TRAFFIC PATTERN\" that runs from one side of the kitchen to the other but does not intersect the work triangle. This indicates that the design aims to keep the traffic flow separate from the work triangle to ensure efficiency and prevent congestion in the workspace.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"No major _____ should cross through the basic work triangle\" is referring to traffic, meaning that the main paths people take through the kitchen should not interfere with the areas where cooking tasks are performed.\n\nOption A, Appliance, doesn't make sense in this context because appliances are part of the work triangle.\n\nOption C, Cabinet, isn't directly addressed in the description.\n\nOption D, Utensil, is irrelevant to the layout and traffic flow in the kitchen.\n\nHence, the most appropriate answer is B. Traffic."
