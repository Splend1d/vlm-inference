The scene features two figures: one is an angel with large wings, dressed in a flowing robe, and the other is a woman seated on a stool, wearing a dark cloak over a lighter garment. The angel appears to be in a posture of reverence or announcement, while the woman listens attentively. The overall composition, use of halos around the heads of the figures, and the serene, almost sacred atmosphere suggest a religious context. The architectural elements, including the columns and arches, are reminiscent of a cloister or a church courtyard.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe work (<image 1>) on the left was made for a\n\nA. royal palace\nB. religious institution\nC. private home\nD. civic building\n"
