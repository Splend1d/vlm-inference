The description mentions that the artwork features multiple panels with detailed carvings of religious figures, and that the carvings are highly detailed with fine lines and textures. It also explicitly states that the medium used for this artwork is carved ivory.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. carved ivory\n\nTo provide a bit more context, The Harbaville Triptych is a significant example of medieval art, specifically from the Ottonian period in Europe. It is named after the village of Harbaville in France, where it was discovered. The triptych is made of ivory and consists of three folding panels, each adorned with intricate carvings that depict scenes from the life of Christ and other religious figures. The level of detail and craftsmanship in the carvings is remarkable, which aligns with the description provided.\n\nFresco secco (option B) is a painting technique where pigments are applied to dry plaster, which is not consistent with the carved nature described. Marble (option C) is another medium used in sculpture, but the description specifies carvings in ivory. Mosaic (option D) involves assembling small pieces of material like glass or stone to create an image, which again does not match the description of carved panels.\n\nHence, option A, carved ivory, is the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
