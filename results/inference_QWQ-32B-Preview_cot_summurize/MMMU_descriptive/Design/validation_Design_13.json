The question is: \"The use of over one million small tiles to make the Alexander Mosaic allowed its creator to...\" and then it gives four options.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a mosaic is. I know that a mosaic is an art form where small pieces, like tiles, are arranged to create a larger image. These tiles can be made of various materials like glass, stone, or ceramic, and they're often arranged to create patterns or represent scenes.\n\nNow, the Alexander Mosaic is specifically a large artwork that depicts a battle scene, probably from ancient times since it's named after Alexander, who I believe is Alexander the Great. From the description, it sounds like it's a detailed and chaotic scene with many figures in various poses, some on horseback and some on foot, all engaged in combat.\n\nThe mosaic is made up of over one million small tiles, which suggests that it's very detailed and intricate. Each tile likely contributes to the overall image, perhaps allowing for shading and texture that you might not get with larger tiles.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. depict a disorganized scene that overwhelms the viewer\n\nB. model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically\n\nC. modify and transport the composition easily\n\nD. reduce the figures into abstract forms\n\nI need to think about which of these was likely enabled or enhanced by using such a large number of small tiles.\n\nOption A says \"depict a disorganized scene that overwhelms the viewer.\" While the description mentions that the scene is chaotic and intense, I don't think the use of small tiles is directly related to making the scene disorganized or overwhelming. The chaos is probably in the composition and the subject matter rather than the medium itself.\n\nOption B is \"model the anatomy of the figures naturalistically.\" This seems plausible because smaller tiles could allow for more detailed rendering of the figures' bodies, muscles, and movements. Naturalistic modeling would require fine details, which smaller tiles could provide.\n\nOption C is \"modify and transport the composition easily.\" I'm not sure about this one. Mosaics are typically fixed in place; they're often set into floors or walls and aren't easily movable. Using smaller tiles might make it easier to make changes during the creation process, but transporting a mosaic with over a million tiles would seem difficult, not easier.\n\nOption D is \"reduce the figures into abstract forms.\" Abstract forms are simplified or stylized representations that don't necessarily resemble the actual objects. Using smaller tiles might allow for more detailed and realistic representations, which contradicts the idea of abstraction.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems the most logical choice. The use of over one million small tiles would allow the creator to model the anatomy of the figures in a more naturalistic way, capturing finer details and perhaps more realistic movements and expressions.\n\nI think the answer is B."
