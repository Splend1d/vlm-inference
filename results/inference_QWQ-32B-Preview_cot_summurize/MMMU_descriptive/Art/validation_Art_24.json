The sculpture is characterized by its smooth, flowing lines and minimalistic design. The figures are stylized with exaggerated proportions, emphasizing the bond between the mother and child. The wood has a rich, warm tone, and the craftsmanship highlights the simplicity and elegance of the piece. The overall composition conveys a sense of tenderness and intimacy.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRead the paragraph below regarding <image 1> and then answer the questions that follow. Elizabeth Catlett's sculpture tells a warm and tender story. It is a story of the unbreakable bond that unites a mother and her child. Like a good storyteller, Catlett is economical in her use of imagery. There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail. There is little more than fluidity of line and grace. Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships. Personification is a literary device in which human qualities are ascribed to a nonhuman subject. Which statement best captures the personification in the passage?\n\nA. The bond between mother and child is described as unbreakable.\nB. A sculpture is described as speaking.\nC. The artist is described as a storyteller.\nD. A sculpture is without frills.\n"

                    "text": "I've got this passage about a sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett, and I need to find which statement best captures the personification in the text. First, I need to remember what personification is. It's when you give human qualities to non-human things, right? So, in this passage, I need to look for instances where the author attributes human traits or actions to something that isn't human.\n\nLet's read the passage again carefully.\n\n\"Elizabeth Catlett's sculpture tells a warm and tender story. It is a story of the unbreakable bond that unites a mother and her child. Like a good storyteller, Catlett is economical in her use of imagery. There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail. There is little more than fluidity of line and grace. Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships.\"\n\nOkay, so the sculpture is described as \"telling a story,\" which is something that typically people do. So, the sculpture is being given the ability to communicate, which is a human quality. That seems like personification to me.\n\nAlso, it says \"the sculpture speaks volumes.\" Again, speaking is something humans do, so attributing that ability to a sculpture is personification.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. The bond between mother and child is described as unbreakable.\n\nIs \"unbreakable\" a human quality? Well, no, it's more of a descriptive term for something that can't be broken. So, I don't think this is personification.\n\nB. A sculpture is described as speaking.\n\nYes, this directly refers to the sculpture \"speaking volumes,\" which is personification.\n\nC. The artist is described as a storyteller.\n\nWell, the artist is a person, so attributing human qualities to a person isn't personification. Personification is about giving human traits to non-human things.\n\nD. A sculpture is without frills.\n\n\"Without frills\" might describe simplicity, but it doesn't attribute a human action or quality to the sculpture.\n\nSo, between options B and C, and considering that C is attributing a human role to a person, which is appropriate, and B is attributing a human action (speaking) to a non-human object (the sculpture), I think B is the best answer.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. Is there any other instance of personification in the passage?\n\nThe bond between mother and child is described as \"unbreakable.\" Is \"unbreakable\" a human quality? No, it's more of a characteristic that can apply to both objects and relationships.\n\nAnother part: \"Like a good storyteller, Catlett is economical in her use of imagery.\" Here, the artist is being compared to a storyteller, which is appropriate since she is a sculptor creating a narrative through her art.\n\n\" There are no visual frills or adornments, no reliance on gaudy color or superfluous detail.\" This describes the simplicity of the sculpture.\n\n\"Yet the sculpture speaks volumes about the deepest and most profound of all human relationships.\" Again, \"speaks volumes\" is personification.\n\nSo, overall, option B seems to be the best capture of personification in the passage.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
