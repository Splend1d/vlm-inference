The first photo shows three figures dressed in dark clothing walking on a paved surface with geometric patterns. The background is mostly empty, creating a sense of negative space around the figures.\n\n2. The second photo features a series of cylindrical pendant lights hanging from the ceiling. The lights have a pattern of small holes that allow light to pass through, creating a dotted effect. The background is dark, which emphasizes the illuminated areas and creates a contrast with the negative space.\n\n3. The third photo depicts two large, cone-shaped structures made of interlocking bricks or blocks. The structures are set against a clear blue sky, with the negative space between them and the sky being prominent.\n\nBased on this description, the image that features a strong use of negative space is:\n\nD. Photo 3\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich of these images in <image 1> features a strong use of negative space?\n\nA. Photo 1\nB. Photo 2\nC. Photos 2 & 3\nD. Photo 3\n"

The negative space between them and the sky is described as being prominent. This suggests that there is a significant amount of empty space around and between the structures, which is a characteristic of strong negative space usage in art and photography. \n\nIn contrast, Photo 1 shows three figures walking on a paved surface with geometric patterns, and the background is mostly empty, but it doesn't specify if the empty space is a significant part of the composition. Photo 2 features pendant lights with a pattern of small holes, hanging in a dark background, emphasizing the illuminated areas. While there is contrast between light and dark, it doesn't necessarily indicate a strong use of negative space in the same way Photo 3 does.\n\nTherefore, based on the description provided, Photo 3 is the one that features a strong use of negative space."
