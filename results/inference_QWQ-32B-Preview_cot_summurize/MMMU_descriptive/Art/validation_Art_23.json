The child is dressed in a red garment and appears to be holding something in their hands. To the left of the child, there is a black pig grazing on the grass. In the background, there is a building with a tiled roof and an open balcony where two figures can be seen. One figure is lying down, while the other is standing and looking outwards. The overall style of the painting is delicate and detailed, with soft colors and fine brushwork. The medium used for this artwork is likely watercolor, given the transparency and fluidity of the colors.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nMargaret Gere's <image 1> was made in which medium?\n\nA.
