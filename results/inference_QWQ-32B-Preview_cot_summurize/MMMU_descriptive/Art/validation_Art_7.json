The figure is dressed in flowing robes with intricate drapery, holding a book. Surrounding the figure are smaller figures, possibly cherubs or angels, and architectural elements such as columns and pilasters. The overall style is highly detailed and realistic, characteristic of Renaissance art. The name \"ESAIAH\" is inscribed below the figure, indicating a biblical or prophetic theme. The painting's composition, use of perspective, and attention to human anatomy suggest it was created by a master artist from the Renaissance period.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nTrue or False: <image 1> is painted by Michelangelo\n\nA. True\nB. False\nC. No enough evidence\n"
