This type of sculpture is known for its unique posture and has been influential in the development of modern sculpture.\n\nAmong the options provided, Henry Moore is the sculptor who is most heavily influenced by pre-Columbian art, including Mayan sculptures. Moore was particularly drawn to the forms and postures found in ancient sculptures, incorporating elements of abstraction and organic forms into his own work. His reclining figures and mother-and-child themes often reflect influences from pre-Columbian art.\n\nLouise Bourgeois is known for her work in sculpture, drawing, and printmaking, often exploring themes of sexuality, family, and trauma. While her work is powerful and influential, it is not primarily associated with direct influence from Mayan art.\n\nBarbara Hepworth was a British sculptor who was part of the modernist movement. Her work often featured abstract forms and was influenced by natural shapes and landscapes. While her sculptures can be compared to organic forms, there is no direct link to Mayan art influencing her work.\n\nConstantin Brancusi was a Romanian sculptor who is famous for his abstract sculptures that often depict simplified forms of birds, heads, and other subjects. His work is highly abstract and while it may have been influenced by various cultural sources, there is no specific connection to Mayan art.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Henry Moore.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
