The portrait is painted on a piece of cloth or linen, which has been preserved over time. The face of the woman is visible, showing her features in detail. Below the portrait, there is an inscription written in Greek letters. The text reads \"\u03a3\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a9\u039d\u0397 \u0393\u03a1\u0391\u039c\u039c\u0391\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u0397,\" which translates to \"Semion\u0113 Grammatik\u0113.\" This indicates the name and possibly the profession of the woman depicted in the portrait. The portrait was discovered in Cairo, Egypt, and is now part of the collection at Girton College, University of Cambridge.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThis Roman portrait mummy <image 1> from the 1st century AD was discovered in Cairo, Egypt, and now belongs in the collection of Girton College, University of Cambridge.

                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about the Roman portrait mummy. So, the description says that the portrait has an inscription that reads \"\u03a3\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a9\u039d\u0397 \u0393\u03a1\u0391\u039c\u039c\u0391\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u0397,\" which translates to \"Semion\u0113 Grammatik\u0113.\" So, the woman's name is Semion\u0113, and she had some kind of profession related to grammar, I guess.\n\nNow, the question is asking which well-known fictional character shares her name with this woman. The options are Aurelia, Matilda, Hermione, and Juno. Hmm, none of these names immediately sound like Semion\u0113, so maybe there's a connection I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about Hermione first because that's a name I recognize from Harry Potter. Hermione Granger is a character in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. But Hermione doesn't sound like Semion\u0113 at all.\n\nAurelia\u2014Aurelia is the name of a character in the TV show \"American Horror Story.\" She's a witch from the 17th century. Again, not similar to Semion\u0113.\n\nMatilda\u2014Matilda is a character in Roald Dahl's book \"Matilda,\" which was also made into a movie. Her full name is Matilda Wormwood, but that doesn't relate to Semion\u0113.\n\nJuno\u2014Juno is the title character in the movie \"Juno,\" about a teenage girl who gets pregnant and decides to give the baby up for adoption. Juno MacGuff is her name, but again, no connection to Semion\u0113.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"shares her name with,\" but Semion\u0113 isn't matching up with any of these names directly. Perhaps there's a character whose real name is Semion\u0113, but I don't recall any famous fictional character with that name.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, and none of the options share her name. But that seems unlikely because it says \"which well-known fictional character.\"\n\nLet me double-check the inscription. It says \"\u03a3\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a9\u039d\u0397 \u0393\u03a1\u0391\u039c\u039c\u0391\u03a4\u0399\u039a\u0397,\" which is Semion\u0113 Grammatik\u0113. Grammatik\u0113 might indicate that she was a teacher of grammar or literature, perhaps.\n\nMaybe the connection is with Hermione, who is known for her intelligence and love of learning, which could relate to being a grammatic\u0113. But that seems like a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a character named Semion\u0113 in some lesser-known work, but the question specifies \"well-known fictional character,\" so it should be one that most people would recognize.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that \"Semion\u0113\" could be a variant spelling or an alternative form of one of these names. For example, Hermione could be related to Hermiona, but that doesn't sound similar to Semion\u0113.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a character who has a similar name in a different language or culture.\n\nWait, perhaps Semion\u0113 is similar to Simone, which is a name used in various cultures. Is there a well-known fictional character named Simone? I can think of Simone in \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" but that's not particularly well-known compared to the options given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a name that's similar to Semira or Semira, but again, not matching the options.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the question is misworded or that I'm missing some connection here.\n\nLet me consider the context again. The portrait is from Roman Egypt in the 1st century AD, and it was discovered in Cairo. So, it's from a time when Greek was widely spoken in Egypt, which fits with the Greek inscription.\n\nPerhaps the name Semion\u0113 is a Greek name, and there's a fictional character with a similar name in Greek mythology or literature, but none come to mind immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the profession \"Grammatik\u0113\" is significant. Could there be a fictional character who is a grammar teacher or something related?\n\nHmm, that seems unlikely to be the connection.\n\nMaybe I need to look at the name \"Semion\u0113\" more closely. In English, it might be transliterated differently, but \u03a3\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03b7 would be Semion\u0113 in Latin script.\n\nIs there a character whose name is similar to Semion\u0113? Looking at the options:\n\n- Aurelia: not similar.\n\n- Matilda: not similar.\n\n- Hermione: not similar.\n\n- Juno: not similar.\n\nUnless there's some indirect connection, I'm not seeing it.\n\nPerhaps the answer is none of the above, but that doesn't seem right given the question's phrasing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing knowledge of the Harry Potter series, and Hermione is associated with Semion\u0113 in some way that I'm not aware of.\n\nWait, in the Harry Potter series, Hermione's mother is a dentist named Jacqueline Granger, and her father is a computer scientist named Maxine Granger, but I don't recall any connection to Semion\u0113.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a character in one of Roald Dahl's books named Semion\u0113, but I don't think so.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that \"Grammatik\u0113\" indicates that she was a scholar or educator, and among the options, Hermione is known for her intelligence and love of learning, so perhaps that's the connection.\n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be Hermione.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Matilda, who is also known for her intelligence, could be connected in a similar way.\n\nBut again, that seems like a loose connection.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is none of the above, but since that's not an option, I might have to choose the one that seems most related.\n\nGiven that, I would probably go with Hermione, as she is associated with learning and intelligence, which could relate to the profession of Grammatik\u0113.\n\nSo, my answer is C. Hermione.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
