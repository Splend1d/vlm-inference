There must be a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the formula. The prismoidal formula for multiple layers is actually:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_n + 4 \\sum_{i=1,3,5,\\ldots} A_i + 2 \\sum_{i=2,4,6,\\ldots} A_i \\right) \\]\n\nThis is Simpson's rule for volume calculation, where we use the areas at the even and odd levels differently.\n\nGiven that, let's apply Simpson's rule correctly.\n\nIn Simpson's rule:\n\n- The first and last terms are \\( A_0 \\) and \\( A_n \\).\n- The sum of the even-numbered terms (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) is multiplied by 4.\n- The sum of the odd-numbered terms (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) is multiplied by 2.\n\nBut wait, in the standard Simpson's rule for volume, it's applied to an even number of intervals. Here, we have 8 intervals, which is even, so the rule applies directly.\n\nLet's identify the terms:\n\n- \\( A_0 = 5200 \\)\n- \\( A_1 = 9400 \\)\n- \\( A_2 = 16300 \\)\n- \\( A_3 = 22400 \\)\n- \\( A_4 = 40700 \\)\n- \\( A_5 = 61500 \\)\n- \\( A_6 = 112200 \\)\n- \\( A_7 = 198100 \\)\n- \\( A_8 = 272400 \\)\n\nNow, apply Simpson's rule:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_8 + 4(A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + A_7) + 2(A_2 + A_4 + A_6) \\right) \\]\n\nCalculate the sums:\n\nFirst, sum the even-numbered terms (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th):\n\n\\[ A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + A_7 = 9400 + 22400 + 61500 + 198100 = 301400 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 301400 = 1205600 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNext, sum the odd-numbered terms (2nd, 4th, 6th):\n\n\\[ A_2 + A_4 + A_6 = 16300 + 40700 + 112200 = 169200 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nMultiply by 2:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 169200 = 338400 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, add all the terms:\n\n\\[ A_0 + A_8 + 4(A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + A_7) + 2(A_2 + A_4 + A_6) = 5200 + 272400 + 1205600 + 338400 = 1821600 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nFinally, multiply by \\( \\frac{h}{3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\):\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 1821600 = \\frac{9108000}{3} = 3036000 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nAgain, this result seems inconsistent with the options provided, which are in the order of tens of millions. It appears there might be a misunderstanding in the application of the formula or in the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet me consider an alternative approach. Perhaps the prismoidal formula should be applied differently, or maybe there's a mistake in identifying which areas correspond to which levels.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula should be applied between each pair of consecutive levels and then summed up.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nCalculate the volume between each pair of consecutive levels using the prismoidal formula:\n\n\\[ V_{i} = \\frac{h}{3} (A_{i-1} + A_{i} + 4A_m) \\]\n\nBut wait, in the standard prismoidal formula for multiple layers, the mid-area \\( A_m \\) is not directly provided. Instead, the formula I initially used is a simplified version for multiple layers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial approach using Simpson's rule is correct, and the discrepancy lies in the units or in the problem's expectations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_n + 4 \\sum_{i=odd} A_i + 2 \\sum_{i even} A_i \\right) \\]\n\nWait, in Simpson's rule, the first and last terms are full, the even terms (considering the numbering starts at 0) are multiplied by 4, and the odd terms are multiplied by 2.\n\nGiven that, let's re-express the sums correctly.\n\nIn Simpson's rule for n intervals (where n is even):\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( A_0 + A_n + 4 \\sum_{i=1,3,5,\\ldots} A_i + 2 \\sum_{i=2,4,6,\\ldots} A_i \\right) \\]\n\nSo, for our data:\n\n- \\( A_0 = 5200 \\)\n- \\( A_1 = 9400 \\)\n- \\( A_2 = 16300 \\)\n- \\( A_3 = 22400 \\)\n- \\( A_4 = 40700 \\)\n- \\( A_5 = 61500 \\)\n- \\( A_6 = 112200 \\)\n- \\( A_7 = 198100 \\)\n- \\( A_8 = 272400 \\)\n\nSum of even terms (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th):\n\n\\[ A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + A_7 = 9400 + 22400 + 61500 + 198100 = 301400 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nSum of odd terms (2nd, 4th, 6th):\n\n\\[ A_2 + A_4 + A_6 = 16300 + 40700 + 112200 = 169200 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nNow, plug into Simpson's formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{5}{3} \\left( 5200 + 272400 + 4 \\times 301400 + 2 \\times 169200 \\right) \\]\n\nCalculate inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ 5200 + 272400 = 277600 \\]\n\\[ 4 \\times 301400 = 1205600 \\]\n\\[ 2 \\times 169200 = 338400 \\]\n\\[ 277600 + 1205600 + 338400 = 1821600 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 1821600 = 3036000 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nThis matches the previous calculation. However, this volume seems too small compared to the options provided. There might be a mistake in the application of Simpson's rule or in the understanding of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the prismoidal formula should be applied differently, considering the volume between each pair of consecutive levels and summing them up.\n\nLet's try that approach.\n\nCalculate the volume between each pair of consecutive levels using the prismoidal formula:\n\n\\[ V_{i} = \\frac{h}{3} (A_{i-1} + A_i + 4A_m) \\]\n\nBut in this case, since we don't have the mid-area \\( A_m \\), perhaps the formula being referred to is the average end area formula, which is:\n\n\\[ V = h \\times \\frac{A_1 + A_2}{2} \\]\n\nHowever, the problem specifies the prismoidal formula, which is more accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula being referred to is:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{h}{3} (A_0 + A_n + 4 \\sum A_\\text{odd} + 2 \\sum A_\\text{even}) \\]\n\nWhich is what I've applied above.\n\nGiven that, and considering the discrepancy in magnitude, perhaps there's a mistake in the units. The options are in \\( 10^6 \\) m\u00b3, whereas my calculation gives 3,036,000 m\u00b3, which is 3.036 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3. However, this still doesn't match any of the provided options.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the number of intervals or misapplied the formula.\n\nLet me try recalculating the sum inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[ A_0 + A_8 + 4(A_1 + A_3 + A_5 + A_7) + 2(A_2 + A_4 + A_6) \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ 5200 + 272400 + 4(9400 + 22400 + 61500 + 198100) + 2(16300 + 40700 + 112200) \\]\n\nCalculate the sums:\n\n\\[ 9400 + 22400 = 31800 \\]\n\\[ 31800 + 61500 = 93300 \\]\n\\[ 93300 + 198100 = 291400 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 4 \\times 291400 = 1,165,600 \\)\n\nNext,\n\n\\[ 16300 + 40700 = 57000 \\]\n\\[ 57000 + 112200 = 169200 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 2 \\times 169200 = 338,400 \\)\n\nNow, sum all parts:\n\n\\[ 5200 + 272400 + 1,165,600 + 338,400 = 1,781,600 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 1,781,600 = \\frac{8,908,000}{3} \\approx 2,969,333.333 \\, \\text{m}^3 \\]\n\nThis is approximately 2.969 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3, which matches option D: 29.693 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3.\n\nWait, but that would imply the volume is 29.693 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3, but my calculation gives approximately 2.969 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3. There seems to be a discrepancy in the decimal placement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are miswritten, and they should be in \\( 10^5 \\) m\u00b3 instead of \\( 10^6 \\) m\u00b3.\n\nHowever, given the options as provided, the closest match to my calculation is option D: 29.693 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3, but my calculation suggests approximately 2.969 \\( \\times 10^6 \\) m\u00b3.\n\nGiven"
