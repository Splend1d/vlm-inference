                    "text": "Based on the information provided in the description, the table lists five samples of soil with their corresponding moisture content and bulk density values. The task is to determine the optimum moisture content by identifying the sample with the highest bulk density, as this corresponds to the most compacted state of the soil.\n\nLet's look at the data provided:\n\n1. Sample No. 1: Moisture Content = 4.8%, Bulk Density = 2.164 g/cc\n\n2. Sample No. 2: Moisture Content = 7.5%, Bulk Density = 2.322 g/cc\n\n3. Sample No. 3: Moisture Content = 7.8%, Bulk Density = 2.351 g/cc\n\n4. Sample No. 4: Moisture Content = 8.9%, Bulk Density = 2.345 g/cc\n\n5. Sample No. 5: Moisture Content = 9.7%, Bulk Density = 2.327 g/cc\n\nTo find the optimum moisture content, we need to find the moisture content corresponding to the highest bulk density.\n\nLet's compare the bulk densities:\n\n- Sample 1: 2.164 g/cc\n\n- Sample 2: 2.322 g/cc\n\n- Sample 3: 2.351 g/cc\n\n- Sample 4: 2.345 g/cc\n\n- Sample 5: 2.327 g/cc\n\nThe highest bulk density is 2.351 g/cc, which corresponds to Sample No. 3 with a moisture content of 7.8%.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the optimum moisture content, and the options provided are:\n\nA. 10%\n\nB. 8%\n\nC. 9%\n\nNone of these options match the moisture content of Sample No. 3, which is 7.8%. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimum moisture content is determined differently. In soil compaction tests, the optimum moisture content is often defined as the moisture content at which the maximum dry density is achieved. However, in this case, we are given bulk density, which includes the moisture content.\n\nTo find the dry density, we would need to calculate the density of the solid particles alone, excluding the water. The formula for dry density (\u03c1d) is:\n\n\u03c1d = \u03c1b / (1 + w)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c1b is the bulk density\n\n- w is the moisture content (expressed as a decimal)\n\nLet's calculate the dry density for each sample:\n\n1. Sample 1:\n\nw = 4.8% = 0.048\n\n\u03c1d = 2.164 / (1 + 0.048) = 2.164 / 1.048 \u2248 2.065 g/cc\n\n2. Sample 2:\n\nw = 7.5% = 0.075\n\n\u03c1d = 2.322 / (1 + 0.075) = 2.322 / 1.075 \u2248 2.160 g/cc\n\n3. Sample 3:\n\nw = 7.8% = 0.078\n\n\u03c1d = 2.351 / (1 + 0.078) = 2.351 / 1.078 \u2248 2.182 g/cc\n\n4. Sample 4:\n\nw = 8.9% = 0.089\n\n\u03c1d = 2.345 / (1 + 0.089) = 2.345 / 1.089 \u2248 2.153 g/cc\n\n5. Sample 5:\n\nw = 9.7% = 0.097\n\n\u03c1d = 2.327 / (1 + 0.097) = 2.327 / 1.097 \u2248 2.122 g/cc\n\nNow, looking at the dry densities:\n\n- Sample 1: 2.065 g/cc\n\n- Sample 2: 2.160 g/cc\n\n- Sample 3: 2.182 g/cc\n\n- Sample 4: 2.153 g/cc\n\n- Sample 5: 2.122 g/cc\n\nThe highest dry density is 2.182 g/cc, which corresponds to Sample No. 3 with a moisture content of 7.8%.\n\nHowever, the options provided are 10%, 8%, and 9%. Since 7.8% is not among the options, it's possible that there's a different approach expected here.\n\nAnother consideration is that in compaction tests, sometimes the optimum moisture content is where the peak of the compaction curve occurs, and sometimes it's interpreted differently based on the specific standards or methods being used in the project.\n\nGiven that the options are 10%, 8%, and 9%, and the data shows that the highest dry density is at 7.8%, which is closest to 8%, it's possible that the answer is intended to be 8%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the calculation or in the interpretation of the data.\n\nLet me double-check the dry density calculations.\n\nFor Sample 3:\n\n\u03c1b = 2.351 g/cc\n\nw = 7.8% = 0.078\n\n\u03c1d = 2.351 / (1 + 0.078) = 2.351 / 1.078 \u2248 2.182 g/cc\n\nFor Sample 4:\n\n\u03c1b = 2.345 g/cc\n\nw = 8.9% = 0.089\n\n\u03c1d = 2.345 / (1 + 0.089) = 2.345 / 1.089 \u2248 2.153 g/cc\n\nFor Sample 5:\n\n\u03c1b = 2.327 g/cc\n\nw = 9.7% = 0.097\n\n\u03c1d = 2.327 / (1 + 0.097) = 2.327 / 1.097 \u2248 2.122 g/cc\n\nThe dry density decreases from Sample 3 to Sample 4 to Sample 5, indicating that the peak dry density is at Sample 3 with 7.8% moisture content.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, 8% is the closest to 7.8%, so perhaps the answer is intended to be 8%.\n\nAlternatively, if there is a different method or if there is additional information in the image that isn't described here, the answer might be different.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the moisture content where the bulk density is maximum, but in this case, the bulk density is highest at Sample 3 with 7.8% moisture content.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a standard proctor test or modified proctor test, where the optimum moisture content is defined based on the standard curves for those tests.\n\nHowever, based on the data provided and the calculations, the optimum moisture content is 7.8%, which is closest to 8%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nB. 8%\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\%} \\]"
