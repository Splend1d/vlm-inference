                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the side widths \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) and the cross-sectional area of an embankment given specific dimensions and slopes. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Road width (\\( b \\)) = 20 meters\n- Existing ground slope = 1 in 10 (10%)\n- Side slopes = 1 in 2 (50%)\n- Centre height (\\( h \\)) = 10 meters\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Understand the Geometry:**\n   - The embankment has a road width of 20 meters.\n   - The side slopes are 1 in 2, meaning for every 1 meter of height, the slope extends 2 meters horizontally.\n   - The existing ground has a slope of 1 in 10.\n   - The centre height is 10 meters.\n\n2. **Determine the Side Widths:**\n   - We need to find the side widths \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) at the base of the embankment.\n   - Considering the existing ground slope, the base widths will differ on either side.\n\n3. **Calculate the Cross-Sectional Area:**\n   - Once the side widths are known, we can calculate the area of the cross-section using the trapezoidal formula.\n\n### Solution Steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Determine the Side Widths\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( w_1 \\): side width on one side\n- \\( w_2 \\): side width on the other side\n\nGiven the side slopes are 1 in 2, the slope factor \\( m \\) is 2.\n\nThe formula for side widths considering the existing ground slope is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\frac{b + 2h m}{1 + m \\times \\text{slope}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( b \\) is the road width\n- \\( h \\) is the centre height\n- \\( m \\) is the side slope factor\n- \\(\\text{slope}\\) is the existing ground slope\n\nGiven the existing ground slope is 1 in 10, which is 0.1.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nw_1 = \\frac{20 + 2 \\times 10 \\times 2}{1 + 2 \\times 0.1} = \\frac{20 + 40}{1 + 0.2} = \\frac{60}{1.2} = 50 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent with the provided options. Let's re-examine the approach.\n\nAlternatively, considering the existing ground slope affects the base widths differently on each side, we need to account for the horizontal and vertical components.\n\nLet's consider the following approach:\n\n1. **Calculate the horizontal projection of the side slopes:**\n\n   For side slope 1 in 2, the horizontal distance for each side is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{horizontal distance} = h \\times m = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Account for the existing ground slope:**\n\n   The existing ground slope is 1 in 10, meaning for every 10 meters horizontally, there is a 1 meter vertical rise.\n\n   To find the base widths \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\), we need to consider how the ground slope affects the horizontal projections.\n\n   Let\u2019s denote:\n   - \\( d \\) as the horizontal distance along the ground due to the slope.\n\n   For a vertical height \\( h \\), the horizontal distance along the slope is:\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{h}{\\text{slope}} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n   However, this seems too large and likely incorrect. Let's reconsider.\n\n   Perhaps a better approach is to use the rate of approach calculation.\n\n#### Step 2: Rate of Approach Calculation\n\nThe rate of approach is the ratio of the horizontal distance to the vertical distance.\n\nGiven:\n- Side slope = 1 in 2 (horizontal to vertical)\n- Ground slope = 1 in 10 (horizontal to vertical)\n\nThe rate of approach \\( R \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{1}{m} - \\text{slope}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m \\) is the side slope (2 in this case)\n- \\(\\text{slope}\\) is the ground slope (0.1)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{1}{2} - 0.1 = 0.5 - 0.1 = 0.4 \\text{ per meter height}\n\\]\n\nThe total horizontal distance added due to the side slope and ground slope for a height \\( h \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{horizontal distance} = R \\times h = 0.4 \\times 10 = 4 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the side width \\( w \\) is:\n\n\\[\nw = \\text{road width} + 2 \\times (\\text{side slope horizontal distance} + \\text{additional horizontal distance due to ground slope})\n\\]\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let's try a different method.\n\n#### Step 3: Using Similar Triangles\n\nConsider the cross-section of the embankment.\n\n- The center height is 10 meters.\n- The side slopes are 1 in 2, meaning for every 1 meter up, it extends 2 meters out.\n- The existing ground has a slope of 1 in 10.\n\nLet's sketch the cross-section:\n\n1. **Top of the embankment:**\n   - Width: 20 meters\n\n2. **Sides:**\n   - Slope: 1 in 2\n\n3. **Base:**\n   - One side has a wider base due to the existing ground slope.\n\nTo find the base widths \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\), we need to consider the intersection of the side slopes with the existing ground slope.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\( h = 10 \\) meters (center height)\n- \\( m = 2 \\) (side slope factor)\n- \\( s = 0.1 \\) (ground slope)\n\nThe horizontal projection of the side slope is \\( h \\times m = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\) meters.\n\nHowever, because the ground is sloping at 1 in 10, the base width will be affected.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the horizontal distance along the ground for the side slope.\n\nUsing the formula for the base width:\n\n\\[\nw = b + 2 \\times \\left( h \\times m - h \\times s \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( b \\) is the road width\n- \\( h \\) is the center height\n- \\( m \\) is the side slope factor\n- \\( s \\) is the ground slope\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\nw = 20 + 2 \\times (10 \\times 2 - 10 \\times 0.1) = 20 + 2 \\times (20 - 1) = 20 + 2 \\times 19 = 20 + 38 = 58 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThis seems inconsistent with the provided options. Let's try another approach.\n\n#### Step 4: Considering the Trapezoidal Cross-Section\n\nThe cross-section is a trapezoid with:\n- Top base: road width \\( b = 20 \\) meters\n- Height: \\( h = 10 \\) meters\n- Side slopes: 1 in 2\n\nGiven the existing ground slope of 1 in 10, the base widths will differ on each side.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\( w_1 \\): base width on one side\n- \\( w_2 \\): base width on the other side\n\nThe area of the trapezoid is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (b + w) \\times h\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( w = w_1 + w_2 \\)\n\nBut since the ground is sloping, \\( w_1 \\) and \\( w_2 \\) are different.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the horizontal projections considering the ground slope.\n\n#### Step 5: Calculating Individual Side Widths\n\nFor side 1:\n- The side slope is 1 in 2, so for 10 meters height, the horizontal projection is 20 meters.\n- The ground slope is 1 in 10, so for 10 meters vertical, the horizontal distance is 100 meters.\n\nHowever, this seems too large. Let's use the rate of change.\n\nThe rate of approach \\( R \\) is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{1}{m} - s = \\frac{1}{2} - 0.1 = 0.4 \\text{ meters per meter height}\n\\]\n\nThus, for a height of 10 meters:\n\n\\[\n\\text{horizontal distance} = R \\times h = 0.4 \\times 10 = 4 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the side width \\( w \\) is:\n\n\\[\nw = b + 2 \\times (h \\times m - h \\times s) = 20 + 2 \\times (20 - 1) = 20 + 2 \\times 19 = 20 + 38 = 58 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the options. Perhaps there's a different method.\n\n#### Step 6: Using Coordinate Geometry\n\nLet's define coordinates for the points in the cross-section.\n\nAssume the center of the road is at the origin (0,0).\n\n- Top of the embankment:\n  - Left edge: (-10, 10)\n  - Right edge: (10, 10)\n\n- Base of the embankment:\n  - Left edge: (-10 - \\( w_1 \\), 0)\n  - Right edge: (10 + \\( w_2 \\), 0)\n\nThe side slopes are 1 in 2, so the slopes of the sides are -0.5 and 0.5.\n\nThe existing ground has a slope of 1 in 10, so the ground line has a slope of 0.1.\n\nEquation of the left side slope:\n\n\\[\ny - 10 = -0.5 (x + 10)\n\\]\n\nEquation of the right side slope:\n\n\\[\ny - 10 = 0.5 (x - 10)\n\\]\n\nEquation of the ground:\n\n\\[\ny = 0.1 x + c\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( c \\), we need a point on the ground. Let's assume at x = 0, y = 0 (base at center).\n\nThus, \\( c = 0 \\), so ground equation is \\( y = 0.1 x \\).\n\nNow, find the intersection points of the side slopes with the ground.\n\n**Left side intersection:**\n\nSet \\( y = -0.5 (x + 10) + 10 = 0.1 x \\)\n\n\\[\n-0.5x - 5 + 10 = 0.1x \\\\\n-0.5x + 5 = 0.1x \\\\\n5 = 0.6x \\\\\nx = \\frac{5}{0.6} \\approx 8.333 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( y = 0.1 \\times 8.333 \\approx 0.833 \\) meters\n\nBut since it's at the base, y should be 0. There's inconsistency here.\n\nWait, perhaps I set the ground equation incorrectly.\n\nIf the ground slope is 1 in 10, and assuming the center is at y = 0, then the ground equation should pass through (0,0).\n\nSo, \\( y = 0.1 x \\)\n\nNow, set the left side slope equation equal to the ground equation:\n\n\\[\n-0.5(x + 10) + 10 = 0.1x \\\\\n-0.5x - 5 + 10 = 0.1x \\\\\n5 - 0.5x = 0.1x \\\\\n5 = 0.6x \\\\\nx = \\frac{5}{0.6} \\approx 8.333 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is at x = -8.333 meters (since it's the left side).\n\nSimilarly, for the right side:\n\nSet \\( y = 0.5(x - 10) + 10 = 0.1x \\)\n\n\\[\n0.5x - 5 + 10 = 0.1x \\\\\n0.5x + 5 = 0.1x \\\\\n5 = -0.4x \\\\\nx = \\frac{5}{-0.4} = -12.5 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThis doesn't make sense because it should be on the right side (positive x).\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me re-define the equations.\n\nLeft side slope:\n\nFrom point (-10, 10), slope = -0.5\n\nEquation: \\( y - 10 = -0.5(x + 10) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\ny = -0.5x - 5 + 10 = -0.5x + 5\n\\]\n\nGround equation: \\( y = 0.1x \\)\n\nSet equal:\n\n\\[\n-0.5x + 5 = 0.1x \\\\\n5 = 0.6x \\\\\nx = \\frac{5}{0.6} \\approx 8.333 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSo, the intersection point is at x = 8.333 meters.\n\nSimilarly, for the right side:\n\nFrom point (10, 10), slope = 0.5\n\nEquation: \\( y - 10 = 0.5(x - 10) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\ny = 0.5x - 5 + 10 = 0.5x + 5\n\\]\n\nSet equal to ground equation:\n\n\\[\n0.5x + 5 = 0.1x \\\\\n5 = -0.4x \\\\\nx = \\frac{5}{-0.4} = -12.5 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThis negative x doesn't make sense because the right side should have positive x values.\n\nThere must be an error in the coordinate system setup.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the center of the road is at x = 0, y = h = 10 meters.\n\nThe ground is sloping up to the right with a slope of 1 in 10.\n\nSo, the ground equation should be y = 0.1x.\n\nWait, but if y increases with x, then on the left side (x negative), y should be less, which makes sense.\n\nBut the earlier calculation for the right side gives a negative x, which is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps I need to adjust the coordinate system.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAssume the center of the road is at x = 0, y = 10 meters.\n\nGround slope is 1 in 10 to the right, so y = 0.1x.\n\nLeft side slope: from (-10, 10), slope = -0.5, so y = -0.5x + c.\n\nFind c:\n\n\\[\n10 = -0.5(-10) + c \\implies 10 = 5 + c \\implies c = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, left side equation: y = -0.5x + 5\n\nSet equal to ground: y = 0.1x\n\n\\[\n-0.5x + 5 = 0.1x \\implies 5 = 0.6x \\implies x = \\frac{5}{0.6} \\approx 8.333 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, right side slope: from (10, 10), slope = 0.5, so y = 0.5x + c.\n\nFind c:\n\n\\[\n10 = 0.5(10) + c \\implies 10 = 5 + c \\implies c = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, right side equation: y = 0.5x + 5\n\nSet equal to ground: y = 0.1x\n\n\\[\n0.5x + 5 = 0.1x \\implies 5 = -0.4x \\implies x = \\frac{5}{-0.4} = -12.5 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThis negative x for the right side is inconsistent. Perhaps the ground slope is in the opposite direction.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the ground slope is 1 in 10 to the left.\n\nSo, ground equation: y = -0.1x\n\nNow, left side slope: y = -0.5x + 5\n\nSet equal to ground: y = -0.1x\n\n\\[\n-0.5x + 5 = -0.1x \\implies 5 = 0.4x \\implies x = \\frac{5}{0.4} = 12.5 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nRight side slope: y = 0.5x + 5\n\nSet equal to ground: y = -0.1x\n\n\\[\n0.5x + 5 = -0.1x \\implies 5 = -0.6x \\implies x = \\frac{5}{-0.6} \\approx -8.333 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nNow, the right side has x = -8.333 meters.\n\nSo, base widths:\n\n- Left side: from x = 12.5 meters to x = 0 (center), width = 12.5 meters\n\n- Right side: from x = 0 to x = -8.333 meters, width = 8.333 meters\n\nTotal base width: 12.5 + 8.333 = 20.833 meters\n\nThis doesn't match the options provided. It seems there is a mistake in the approach.\n\n#### Step 7: Reviewing the Approach\n\nGiven the inconsistency in the coordinate system, perhaps a better method is to use the rate of filling formula.\n\nThe rate of filling \\( R_f \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nR_f = m - s\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( m \\) is the side slope (2 in this case)\n- \\( s \\) is the ground slope (0.1)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nR_f = 2 - 0.1 = 1"
