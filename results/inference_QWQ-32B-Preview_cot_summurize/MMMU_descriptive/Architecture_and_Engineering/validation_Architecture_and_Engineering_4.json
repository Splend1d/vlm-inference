The level instrument is initially placed at point M, where the readings on the staffs at the center crosshair are recorded as \\(a'_M = 1.355\\) meters for staff A and \\(b'_M = 1.455\\) meters for staff B. The distance between points M and N is given as 70 meters. When the level instrument is moved to point N, the new readings on the staffs are \\(a'_N = 1.585\\) meters for staff A and \\(b'_N = 1.485\\) meters for staff B.

                    "text": "To determine the correct height difference \\( h_{AB} \\) between points A and B, we need to use the principles of differential leveling. In differential leveling, the height difference between two points is determined by taking readings on leveling staffs placed at these points from different instrument positions.\n\nGiven data:\n- At point M:\n  - Reading on staff A: \\( a'_M = 1.355 \\) m\n  - Reading on staff B: \\( b'_M = 1.455 \\) m\n\n- At point N:\n  - Reading on staff A: \\( a'_N = 1.585 \\) m\n  - Reading on staff B: \\( b'_N = 1.485 \\) m\n\n- Distance between M and N: 70 meters\n\nFirst, we need to understand that in differential leveling, the height difference between two points can be determined by taking the difference between the backsight and foresight readings. However, in this problem, we have two instrument positions (M and N), and we need to consider the readings from both positions to find the height difference \\( h_{AB} \\).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( h_{AM} \\): height difference between A and M\n- \\( h_{BM} \\): height difference between B and M\n- \\( h_{AN} \\): height difference between A and N\n- \\( h_{BN} \\): height difference between B and N\n\nFrom the leveling principle:\n\\[ h_{AM} = \\text{instrument height at M} - a'_M \\]\n\\[ h_{BM} = \\text{instrument height at M} - b'_M \\]\n\nSimilarly:\n\\[ h_{AN} = \\text{instrument height at N} - a'_N \\]\n\\[ h_{BN} = \\text{instrument height at N} - b'_N \\]\n\nThe height difference between A and B can be expressed as:\n\\[ h_{AB} = h_{AM} - h_{BM} = (h_M - a'_M) - (h_M - b'_M) = b'_M - a'_M \\]\n\\[ h_{AB} = h_{AN} - h_{BN} = (h_N - a'_N) - (h_N - b'_N) = b'_N - a'_N \\]\n\nHowever, since the instrument heights \\( h_M \\) and \\( h_N \\) at points M and N are different, we need to consider the movement of the instrument and the collimation error, if any.\n\nBut in this problem, it seems we are to assume that the level instrument is properly calibrated and there is no collimation error. Therefore, the height difference \\( h_{AB} \\) can be directly calculated from the readings at either position, and should be consistent.\n\nLet's calculate \\( h_{AB} \\) from both positions and see if they agree.\n\nFrom position M:\n\\[ h_{AB} = b'_M - a'_M = 1.455 - 1.355 = 0.100 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nFrom position N:\n\\[ h_{AB} = b'_N - a'_N = 1.485 - 1.585 = -0.100 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nWait, these give opposite signs, which suggests there might be an error in the approach. This discrepancy indicates that there is likely a collimation error or that the instrument is not perfectly leveled.\n\nTo account for this, we can use the method of collimation correction. The collimation error \\( c \\) can be determined from the two sets of readings.\n\nThe collimation error \\( c \\) is the error per unit distance due to the inclination of the instrument's line of sight.\n\nThe formula for collimation error is:\n\\[ c = \\frac{(h_{AB})_M - (h_{AB})_N}{2 \\times \\text{distance between M and N}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ c = \\frac{0.100 - (-0.100)}{2 \\times 70} = \\frac{0.200}{140} = 0.00142857 \\, \\text{m/m} \\]\n\nNow, to find the corrected height difference \\( h_{AB} \\), we can apply the collimation correction to one of the measurements.\n\nLet's correct the height difference from position M:\n\nThe correction to be applied is:\n\\[ \\text{correction} = c \\times \\text{distance from M to A or B} \\]\n\nHowever, since we don't have the exact distances from M to A and M to B, we can assume that the distances are approximately equal, given that the staffs are placed at A and B, and the instrument is placed at M and N, which are 70 meters apart.\n\nAlternatively, since the collimation error affects the readings proportionally to the distance, and we have two positions, we can take the average of the two height differences as the corrected value.\n\nSo, the corrected \\( h_{AB} \\) is:\n\\[ h_{AB} = \\frac{(h_{AB})_M + (h_{AB})_N}{2} = \\frac{0.100 + (-0.100)}{2} = 0 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct height difference between points A and B is 0 meters.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. -0.01m\nB. +0.02m\nC. 0\nD. +0.01m\n\nThe answer should be C. 0\n\nHowever, let's double-check the calculations to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\nFirst, from position M:\n\\[ h_{AB} = b'_M - a'_M = 1.455 - 1.355 = 0.100 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nFrom position N:\n\\[ h_{AB} = b'_N - a'_N = 1.485 - 1.585 = -0.100 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nCollimation error:\n\\[ c = \\frac{0.100 - (-0.100)}{2 \\times 70} = \\frac{0.200}{140} = 0.00142857 \\, \\text{m/m} \\]\n\nCorrected \\( h_{AB} \\):\n\\[ h_{AB} = \\frac{0.100 + (-0.100)}{2} = 0 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThis seems consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
