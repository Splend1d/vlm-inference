The standard formula for the area using D.M.D. is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{D.M.D.} \\times \\text{Departure})}{2} \\]\n\nSo, we need to calculate the product of D.M.D. and departure for each line and then sum them up, finally dividing by 2.\n\nLet's calculate the product for each line:\n\n- Line AB: D.M.D. = 0 m, Departure = -44.4 m \u2192 Product = 0 * (-44.4) = 0 m\u00b2\n- Line BC: D.M.D. = -232.2 m, Departure = +58.2 m \u2192 Product = -232.2 * 58.2 = -13542.84 m\u00b2\n- Line CD: D.M.D. = -218.6 m, Departure = +17.2 m \u2192 Product = -218.6 * 17.2 = -3762.32 m\u00b2\n- Line DA: D.M.D. = -57.6 m, Departure = -31.0 m \u2192 Product = -57.6 * (-31) = +1785.6 m\u00b2\n\nNow, sum these products:\n\n\\[ \\sum (\\text{D.M.D.} \\times \\text{Departure}) = 0 + (-13542.84) + (-3762.32) + 1785.6 = -15519.56 \\, m\u00b2 \\]\n\nFinally, the area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{-15519.56}{2} = -7759.78 \\, m\u00b2 \\]\n\nSince area cannot be negative, we take the absolute value:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 7759.78 \\, m\u00b2 \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options. It seems there is a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck the steps.\n\n### Rechecking the calculations\n\nFirst, verify the M.D. calculations:\n\n- Line AB: M.D. = 0\n- Line BC: M.D. = -116.1 m\n- Line CD: M.D. = -116.1 m + 6.8 m = -109.3 m\n- Line DA: M.D. = -116.1 m + 6.8 m + 80.5 m = -28.8 m\n\nNow, D.M.D.:\n\n- Line AB: 0 m\n- Line BC: -232.2 m\n- Line CD: -218.6 m\n- Line DA: -57.6 m\n\nNow, the products:\n\n- Line AB: 0 * (-44.4) = 0 m\u00b2\n- Line BC: -232.2 * 58.2 = -13542.84 m\u00b2\n- Line CD: -218.6 * 17.2 = -3762.32 m\u00b2\n- Line DA: -57.6 * (-31) = 1785.6 m\u00b2\n\nSum of products: 0 + (-13542.84) + (-3762.32) + 1785.6 = -15519.56 m\u00b2\n\nArea: |-15519.56 / 2| = 7759.78 m\u00b2\n\nThis still does not match the given options. Perhaps there is a mistake in the approach.\n\n### Alternative approach\n\nLet's try using the formula for the area of a traverse using coordinates.\n\nFirst, compute the coordinates of each point.\n\nAssume starting coordinates for point A are (0,0).\n\nThen:\n\n- For Line AB: Latitude = -116.1 m (northing), Departure = -44.4 m (easting)\n  - Coordinates of B: Easting = 0 + (-44.4) = -44.4 m, Northing = 0 + (-116.1) = -116.1 m\n\n- For Line BC: Latitude = +6.8 m, Departure = +58.2 m\n  - Coordinates of C: Easting = -44.4 + 58.2 = 13.8 m, Northing = -116.1 + 6.8 = -109.3 m\n\n- For Line CD: Latitude = +80.5 m, Departure = +17.2 m\n  - Coordinates of D: Easting = 13.8 + 17.2 = 31 m, Northing = -109.3 + 80.5 = -28.8 m\n\n- For Line DA: Latitude = +28.8 m, Departure = -31 m\n  - Coordinates of A: Easting = 31 + (-31) = 0 m, Northing = -28.8 + 28.8 = 0 m\n\nNow, use the coordinate method to find the area.\n\nThe formula for area using coordinates is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\sum (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i) \\right| \\]\n\nWhere \\( x \\) is easting and \\( y \\) is northing.\n\nSo, list the coordinates in order:\n\n- A: (0, 0)\n- B: (-44.4, -116.1)\n- C: (13.8, -109.3)\n- D: (31, -28.8)\n- Back to A: (0, 0)\n\nNow, compute each term \\( x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i \\):\n\n1. A to B: \\( 0 * (-116.1) - (-44.4) * 0 = 0 - 0 = 0 \\)\n2. B to C: \\( -44.4 * (-109.3) - 13.8 * (-116.1) = 4858.92 - (-1603.98) = 4858.92 + 1603.98 = 6462.9 \\)\n3. C to D: \\( 13.8 * (-28.8) - 31 * (-109.3) = -397.44 - (-3388.3) = -397.44 + 3388.3 = 2990.86 \\)\n4. D to A: \\( 31 * 0 - 0 * (-28.8) = 0 - 0 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, sum these values: \\( 0 + 6462.9 + 2990.86 + 0 = 9453.76 \\)\n\nFinally, area is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} * |9453.76| = 4726.88 \\, m\u00b2 \\]\n\nThis is close to option A: 4725 m\u00b2, but not exact. Maybe there is a rounding error.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the calculations, the area is approximately 4726.88 m\u00b2, which is closest to option A: 4725 m\u00b2. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{4725 \\, m^{2}} \\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{4725 \\, m^{2}}\\]"
