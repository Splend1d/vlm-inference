                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine two things: the scale of the photographs and the length of the air base. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Scale of the Photographs\n\nThe scale of a photograph is the ratio of the distance on the photograph to the corresponding distance on the ground. It can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scale} = \\frac{\\text{focal length}}{\\text{flying height above ground}}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Focal length (\\(f\\)) = 200 mm\n- Flying height above ground = 1500 m (since the airplane is flying at 1500 m above the ground, which is 250 m above sea level)\n\nFirst, we need to ensure that both measurements are in the same units. Let's convert the focal length to meters:\n\n\\[\nf = 200 \\text{ mm} = 0.2 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the scale:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scale} = \\frac{0.2 \\text{ m}}{1500 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{0.2}{1500} = \\frac{1}{7500}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 1 unit on the photograph corresponds to 7500 units on the ground. To express this in a more familiar format, such as 1 cm = X meters:\n\n\\[\n1 \\text{ cm on photo} = 7500 \\text{ cm on ground} = 75 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't match any of the options. Let's double-check the calculation.\n\nActually, the flying height should be the height above the ground, which is given as 1500 m. But the ground is 250 m above sea level, so the total height above sea level is 1500 m + 250 m = 1750 m. However, the flying height above the ground is still 1500 m, so my initial calculation seems correct.\n\nBut let's see the options again. They have different scales, so maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the scale is affected by the overlap or the print size. Let's think about that.\n\n### Step 2: Considering the Overlap and Print Size\n\nThe photographs have an overlap of 60%, meaning that 60% of the area covered by the first photograph is also covered by the second photograph.\n\nThe print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, but I'm not sure if this directly affects the scale, as the scale is determined by the focal length and the flying height.\n\nWait, perhaps the print size is related to the size of the photograph on the ground.\n\nLet's consider the air base, which is the distance on the ground corresponding to the base of the camera's field of view.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Air Base\n\nThe air base (\\(b\\)) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{\\text{focal length} \\times \\text{base on photo}}{\\text{flying height}}\n\\]\n\nBut I need to find the base on the photo first.\n\nGiven that the print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, assuming that the base on the photo corresponds to the length covered on the ground, we can use the scale to find the air base.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to use the ratio of the overlap to find the air base.\n\nFrom the description, the total length covered by both photographs combined is \\(L\\), with the first photograph covering 0.4L and the second covering 0.6L.\n\nGiven that there is a 60% overlap, the overlap length on the ground would be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{overlap length} = 0.6 \\times \\text{air base}\n\\]\n\nBut I'm getting confused here. Let's try another approach.\n\n### Step 4: Using Similar Triangles\n\nLooking back at the description, it mentions two triangles representing the field of view of the camera for each photograph. The base of each triangle represents the air base, which is the distance on the ground covered by each photograph.\n\nGiven that the flying height is 1500 m and the focal length is 200 mm, we can use similar triangles to find the air base.\n\nThe relationship in similar triangles is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{focal length}}{\\text{flying height}} = \\frac{\\text{base on photo}}{\\text{air base}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, assuming that the base on the photo is 250 mm, we can solve for the air base.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1500 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{250 \\text{ mm}}{b}\n\\]\n\nFirst, convert all units to meters:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.2 \\text{ m}}{1500 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{0.25 \\text{ m}}{b}\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\(b\\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{0.25 \\times 1500}{0.2} = \\frac{375}{0.2} = 1875 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nWait, but the options have an air base of 625 m, not 1875 m. So maybe my assumption about the base on the photo is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the 250 mm is the diagonal of the print, not the base. Let's check that.\n\nIf the print is 250 mm x 250 mm, then it's a square, so the base is 250 mm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the air base is related to the overlap.\n\n### Step 5: Considering the Overlap in Photographs\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, meaning that 60% of the first photograph is covered by the second photograph, we can relate the air bases of the two photographs.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(b_1\\) = air base of the first photograph\n\n- \\(b_2\\) = air base of the second photograph\n\nFrom the description, \\(b_1 = 0.4L\\) and \\(b_2 = 0.6L\\), where \\(L\\) is the total length covered by both photographs combined.\n\nThe overlap between the two photographs is 60% of \\(b_1\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{overlap} = 0.6 \\times b_1 = 0.6 \\times 0.4L = 0.24L\n\\]\n\nBut also, the overlap is the part of \\(b_1\\) that is covered by \\(b_2\\). Since \\(b_2 = 0.6L\\), the overlap is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{overlap} = b_1 + b_2 - L = 0.4L + 0.6L - L = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet me try another way. If the overlap is 60% of the area covered by the first photograph, then the overlap length on the ground would be 60% of the air base of the first photograph.\n\nBut I'm getting more confused. Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Scale to Find the Air Base\n\nFrom Step 1, I calculated the scale as 1 cm = 75 m, but that doesn't match any options. Maybe I need to reconsider the flying height.\n\nWait, the airplane is flying at 1500 m above the ground, which is 250 m above sea level. So the actual height above sea level is 1500 m + 250 m = 1750 m. But the flying height above the ground is still 1500 m, so my initial calculation should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the scale needs to account for the fact that the ground is 250 m above sea level, but I think the scale is based on the height above the ground, not above sea level.\n\nLet me try calculating the scale again:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scale} = \\frac{f}{H} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1500 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1,500,000 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{1}{7500}\n\\]\n\nSo, 1 mm on the photo corresponds to 7500 mm on the ground, which is 7.5 m. Therefore, 1 cm on the photo corresponds to 75 m.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider the print size in the scale calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the scale is determined by the print size and the air base.\n\n### Step 7: Relating Print Size and Air Base\n\nGiven that the print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, and assuming that this print size represents the air base on the photograph, we can set up a ratio.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(b\\) = air base on the ground in meters\n\n- \\(b_{\\text{photo}}\\) = base on the photograph in millimeters = 250 mm\n\nThen, the scale is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scale} = \\frac{b_{\\text{photo}}}{b} = \\frac{250 \\text{ mm}}{b \\text{ m}}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't seem right because scale should relate the photograph to the ground, considering the flying height and focal length.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for scale:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scale} = \\frac{f}{H} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1500 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{200}{1,500,000} = \\frac{1}{7500}\n\\]\n\nThis means that 1 mm on the photo represents 7500 mm on the ground, or 1 cm on the photo represents 750 cm on the ground, which is 7.5 m.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the options provided. Maybe there's a mistake in the options or in my understanding.\n\n### Step 8: Revisiting the Problem Statement\n\nLet's carefully read the problem statement again:\n\n\"Two consecutive photographs were taken with a camera of focal length 200 mm mounted on an airplane flying at a height of 1500 m. The overlap was exactly 60% and the size of prints was 250 mm x 250 mm. The flying height was same in case of both the exposures and the flight was balanced so that there was no drift. The ground was flat and was 250 m above the mean sea level. Determine the scale of the photograph and the length of the air base.\"\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, perhaps the scale needs to be adjusted for the overlap.\n\nWait, maybe the scale is affected by the overlap percentage.\n\n### Step 9: Considering the Overlap in Scale Calculation\n\nIf there is a 60% overlap between the two photographs, it means that 60% of the area covered by the first photograph is also covered by the second photograph. This overlap can be used to find the relationship between the air bases of the two photographs.\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, the distance between the centers of the two photographs (the air base) can be related to the individual air bases.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to incorporate this into the scale calculation.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the principle of photogrammetry, where the overlap affects the stereo coverage and thus the scale.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to accept that my initial scale calculation is correct and see if the options have a typo.\n\n### Step 10: Accepting the Calculated Scale\n\nGiven that my calculation consistently gives a scale of 1 cm = 75 m, but the options suggest scales around 1 cm = 62.5 m to 1 cm = 68.5 m, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the flying height should be considered differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the flying height should be the height above sea level, not above the ground.\n\nLet\u2019s try that:\n\nFlying height above sea level = 1500 m + 250 m = 1750 m\n\nThen, scale = \\(\\frac{200 \\text{ mm}}{1750 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{200}{1,750,000} = \\frac{1}{8750}\\)\n\nSo, 1 mm on photo = 8750 mm on ground = 8.75 m\n\nThus, 1 cm on photo = 87.5 m\n\nThis still doesn't match the options.\n\nI'm stuck here. Maybe I need to consider a different approach entirely.\n\n### Step 11: Considering the Air Base Directly\n\nLet\u2019s try to find the air base directly.\n\nThe air base (\\(b\\)) is the distance on the ground corresponding to the base of the camera's field of view.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{f \\times a}{H}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(f\\) = focal length = 200 mm\n\n- \\(a\\) = base on the photograph\n\n- \\(H\\) = flying height above ground = 1500 m\n\nBut what is \\(a\\)? Is it the print size?\n\nGiven that the print size is 250 mm x 250 mm, perhaps \\(a\\) = 250 mm.\n\nThen:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{200 \\text{ mm} \\times 250 \\text{ mm}}{1500 \\text{ m}} = \\frac{50,000 \\text{ mm}^2}{1,500,000 \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{50}{1500} \\text{ m} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ m} = 3.\\overline{3} \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThis can't be right; the air base should be much larger.\n\nI must be misunderstanding what \\(a\\) represents.\n\nPerhaps \\(a\\) is the distance between the optical centers of the two photographs, but that seems related to the overlap.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different formula to find the air base.\n\n### Step 12: Using the Overlap to Find the Air Base\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, perhaps I can use that to find the air base.\n\nIn photogrammetry, the air base (\\(b\\)) is related to the overlap percentage.\n\nThe formula for the air base when there is an overlap is:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{(1 - \\text{overlap percentage}) \\times \\text{focal length} \\times \\text{photo width}}{\\text{flying height} \\times \\text{overlap percentage}}\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't seem right. Maybe I need to recall the correct formula for air base with overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the air base is simply the distance between the centers of the two photographs, which can be related to the overlap.\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, the distance between the centers would be 40% of the air base of one photograph.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused.\n\n### Step 13: Considering the Total Length Covered\n\nFrom the description, the total length covered by both photographs combined is \\(L\\), with the first photograph covering 0.4L and the second covering 0.6L.\n\nThis suggests that the air base for the first photograph is 0.4L and for the second is 0.6L.\n\nGiven that the overlap is 60%, the overlapping area is 0.6 * 0.4L = 0.24L.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to use this to find the air base.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the total length \\(L\\) is the sum of the non-overlapping parts of the two photographs.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nL = 0.4L + 0.6L - \\text{overlap}\n\\]\n\nBut since overlap is 60% of the first photograph's coverage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{overlap} = 0.6 \\times 0.4L = 0.24L\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nL = 0.4L + 0.6L - 0.24L = 0.76L\n\\]\n\nThis implies that \\(L = 0\\), which doesn't make sense. There must be an error in this approach.\n\n### Step 14: Seeking a Different Approach\n\nGiven that all my previous attempts are not leading to the correct answer, perhaps I need to consider that the scale is already provided in the options, and I just need to select the correct one.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Scale: 1 cm = 62.5 m; Air base = 625 m\n\nB. Scale: 1 cm = 68.5 m; Air base = 625 m\n\nC. Scale: 1 cm = 66.5 m; Air base = 625 m\n\nD. Scale: 1 cm = 64.5 m; Air base = 625 m\n\nGiven that my calculations consistently give a scale of 1 cm = 75 m, which doesn't match any options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the scale is calculated differently when considering the overlap.\n\n### Step 15: Considering the Stereoscopic Coverage\n\nIn photogrammetry, when two photographs have an overlap, it affects the stereoscopic coverage, which might influence the scale.\n\nThe stereoscopic overlap is typically 60%, which is given in the problem.\n\nThe air base in this context can be related to the height and the focal length using the formula:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{H \\times \\text{overlap percentage}}{1 - \\text{overlap percentage}} \\times \\frac{f}{p}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\(H\\) = flying height\n\n- overlap percentage = 0.6\n\n- \\(f\\) = focal length\n\n- \\(p\\) = photo width\n\nBut I'm not sure about this formula. Maybe I need to look up the correct formula for air base with overlap.\n\n### Step 16: Using the Correct Formula for Air Base\n\nAfter some research, I recall that the air base (\\(b\\)) is related to the flying height (\\(H\\)), the focal length (\\(f\\)), and the photo width (\\(p\\)) by the"
