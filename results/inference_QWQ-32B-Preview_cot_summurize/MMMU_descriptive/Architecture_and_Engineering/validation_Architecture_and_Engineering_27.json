The distances from point A to points B and C are given as follows:\n- Distance AB (c) = 566.81 feet\n- Distance AC (b) = 591.13 feet\n\nThe angle at point A between lines AB and AC is given as 80\u00b030'.

                    "text": "To determine the distance between points C and B (distance CB), we can use the Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. In this case, we have a triangle ABC with sides AB = c = 566.81 feet, AC = b = 591.13 feet, and angle A = 80\u00b030'. We need to find side a, which is the distance between points C and B.\n\nThe Law of Cosines states:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc * cos(A)\n\nFirst, we need to convert angle A from degrees and minutes to decimal degrees for calculation purposes.\n\nAngle A = 80\u00b030'\n\nSince there are 60 minutes in a degree, 30 minutes is equal to 30/60 = 0.5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, angle A in decimal degrees is:\n\nA = 80 + 0.5 = 80.5\u00b0\n\nNow, we can plug the values into the Law of Cosines formula:\n\na\u00b2 = (591.13)\u00b2 + (566.81)\u00b2 - 2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * cos(80.5\u00b0)\n\nFirst, calculate the squares of b and c:\n\n(591.13)\u00b2 = 349.430.7769\n\n(566.81)\u00b2 = 321.286.5761\n\nNow, calculate the product of b, c, and the cosine of angle A:\n\ncos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.17101 (using a calculator)\n\n2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101 \u2248 2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101\n\nFirst, multiply 591.13 * 566.81:\n\n591.13 * 566.81 \u2248 335,277.4613\n\nNow, multiply by 2:\n\n2 * 335,277.4613 \u2248 670,554.9226\n\nThen, multiply by 0.17101:\n\n670,554.9226 * 0.17101 \u2248 114,657.984\n\nNow, sum b\u00b2 and c\u00b2:\n\n349,430.7769 + 321,286.5761 = 670,717.353\n\nSubtract the product from the sum:\n\n670,717.353 - 114,657.984 \u2248 556,059.369\n\nNow, take the square root to find a:\n\na = \u221a556,059.369 \u2248 745.69 feet\n\nWait a minute, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nFirst, confirm the squares:\n\n(591.13)^2 = 349,430.7769 \u2192 Correct.\n\n(566.81)^2 = 321,286.5761 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNext, confirm the cosine of 80.5\u00b0:\n\ncos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.17101 \u2192 Let's verify this.\n\nUsing a calculator, cos(80.5\u00b0) is approximately 0.17101, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the product:\n\n2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101\n\nFirst, 591.13 * 566.81 = 335,277.4613 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 2 * 335,277.4613 = 670,554.9226 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 670,554.9226 * 0.17101 \u2248 114,657.984 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, sum of squares:\n\n349,430.7769 + 321,286.5761 = 670,717.353 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSubtract the product:\n\n670,717.353 - 114,657.984 = 556,059.369 \u2192 Correct.\n\nFinally, square root:\n\n\u221a556,059.369 \u2248 745.69 feet\n\nThis result doesn't match any of the provided options (748.50', 748.70', 748.60', 748.40'). There must be an error in the calculations.\n\nLet me re-calculate the product 2 * b * c * cos(A):\n\n2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101\n\nFirst, calculate 591.13 * 566.81:\n\n591.13 * 566.81 = 335,277.4613 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 2 * 335,277.4613 = 670,554.9226 \u2192 Correct.\n\nThen, 670,554.9226 * 0.17101 = 114,657.984 \u2192 Correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the cosine value is not accurate enough. Let's use more decimal places for cos(80.5\u00b0).\n\nUsing a more precise value: cos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.17101007166283435\n\nLet's use more decimal places: 0.17101007166283435\n\nNow, calculate 2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101007166283435\n\nFirst, 591.13 * 566.81 = 335,277.4613\n\nThen, 2 * 335,277.4613 = 670,554.9226\n\nThen, 670,554.9226 * 0.17101007166283435 \u2248 114,658.027\n\nNow, sum of squares: 349,430.7769 + 321,286.5761 = 670,717.353\n\nSubtract the product: 670,717.353 - 114,658.027 = 556,059.326\n\nSquare root: \u221a556,059.326 \u2248 745.69 feet\n\nStill not matching the options. Maybe there's a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps there's a different triangle or another consideration due to the building's position.\n\nLooking back at the description, the building is between points B and C, which might imply that points A, B, and C form a triangle with the building obstructing the direct line between B and C.\n\nHowever, based on the given information, we're to find distance CB using the Law of Cosines with sides AB, AC, and angle at A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at A is not 80\u00b030', but perhaps it's another angle, and we need to find angle A first.\n\nWait, the description says \"the interior angle at A\" is given as 80\u00b030'. So, it's angle A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle needs to be converted to radians for the cosine function, but typically, calculators have degree mode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the addition or subtraction.\n\nLet me re-calculate the sum of squares:\n\n(591.13)^2 = 349,430.7769\n\n(566.81)^2 = 321,286.5761\n\nSum: 349,430.7769 + 321,286.5761 = 670,717.353 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, the product: 2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * cos(80.5\u00b0)\n\nUsing cos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.17101\n\n2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101 = 114,657.984 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSubtract: 670,717.353 - 114,657.984 = 556,059.369 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSquare root: \u221a556,059.369 \u2248 745.69 feet\n\nThis suggests that either the options provided are incorrect, or there's a mistake in the given distances or angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is exterior instead of interior, or maybe it's angle B or C.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the angle. If angle at A is 80\u00b030', and points A, B, and C form triangle ABC, then the Law of Cosines should apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the building's presence affects the calculation, but the description doesn't provide any additional information about the building's dimensions or position along BC.\n\nAssuming the building is a straight line between B and C, and points A, B, and C form a triangle, the Law of Cosines should still apply.\n\nGiven that my calculations are consistent and leading to 745.69 feet, which doesn't match any of the options, I might have to consider rounding errors or consider more decimal places.\n\nLet me try calculating with more decimal places.\n\nFirst, angle A = 80\u00b030' = 80.5\u00b0\n\ncos(80.5\u00b0) \u2248 0.17101007166283435\n\nNow, calculate the product:\n\n2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101007166283435 = 2 * 591.13 * 566.81 * 0.17101007166283435\n\nFirst, 591.13 * 566.81 = 335,277.4613\n\nThen, 2 * 335,277.4613 = 670,554.9226\n\nThen, 670,554.9226 * 0.17101007166283435 \u2248 114,658.027\n\nNow, sum of squares: 349,430.7769 + 321,286.5761 = 670,717.353\n\nSubtract: 670,717.353 - 114,658.027 = 556,059.326\n\nSquare root: \u221a556,059.326 \u2248 745.69 feet\n\nStill not matching. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distances AB and AC are not as given, or the angle is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use a different formula or consider the building's dimensions.\n\nGiven the information provided, and assuming the building doesn't affect the triangle's properties, the Law of Cosines should give the correct distance.\n\nTherefore, the desired distance CB is approximately 745.69 feet.\n\nHowever, since this doesn't match any of the provided options, I might have to select the closest one, which is 748.50 feet (option A).\n\nBut this is not accurate based on my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the conversion of angle A.\n\nWait, 80\u00b030' is indeed 80.5\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is in radians, but that's unlikely, as 80\u00b030' is given in degrees and minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the surveyor measured the exterior angle instead of the interior angle.\n\nIf angle A is an exterior angle, then the formula would be different.\n\nHowever, the problem states it's the interior angle at A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distances AB and AC are not directly measurable due to the building, but that contradicts the description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trigonometric leveling or other surveying techniques need to be considered, but the problem seems to suggest using the Law of Cosines directly.\n\nGiven that, and sticking to the provided information, the calculation leads to approximately 745.69 feet.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that there is an error in the problem's options or given data.\n\nHowever, since that's not helpful for selecting an answer, I'll choose the closest option, which is A. Distance CB = 748.50 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{748.50'} \\]"
