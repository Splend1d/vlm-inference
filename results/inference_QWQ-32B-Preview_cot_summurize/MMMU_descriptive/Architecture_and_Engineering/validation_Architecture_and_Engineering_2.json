                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to determine how many photographs Camera A would take to cover a strip that is 16 kilometers long at a flying height of 1350 meters, given a longitudinal overlap of 60%. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the terms and what they represent:\n\n1. **Format**: This refers to the size of the photograph. For Camera A, it's 180 mm \u00d7 180 mm.\n\n2. **Focal length**: This is the distance from the lens to the image sensor when the lens is focused at infinity. For Camera A, it's 210 mm.\n\n3. **Flying height**: This is the altitude at which the camera is flying above the ground. Here, it's 1350 meters.\n\n4. **Longitudinal overlap**: This is the overlap between consecutive photographs in the direction of flight. It's given as 60%.\n\n5. **Strip width**: This is the width of the area covered by the photograph on the ground.\n\n6. **Scale of photography**: This is the ratio of the image size to the actual size on the ground.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the scale of photography\n\nThe scale of photography (S) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{f}{H} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( f \\) is the focal length of the camera.\n\n- \\( H \\) is the flying height.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( f = 210 \\) mm\n\n- \\( H = 1350 \\) m = 1,350,000 mm (since 1 m = 1000 mm)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ S = \\frac{210}{1,350,000} = \\frac{210}{1,350,000} = \\frac{7}{45,000} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the ground coverage (strip width)\n\nThe strip width (W) can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{\\text{format} \\times H}{f} \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Format = 180 mm\n\n- \\( H = 1,350,000 \\) mm\n\n- \\( f = 210 \\) mm\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ W = \\frac{180 \\times 1,350,000}{210} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n\n\\[ 180 \\times 1,350,000 = 243,000,000 \\]\n\nThen, divide by the denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{243,000,000}{210} = 1,157,142.857 \\] mm\n\nConvert this to kilometers:\n\n\\[ 1,157,142.857 \\] mm = 1,157.142857 m = 1.157142857 km\n\nSo, the strip width is approximately 1.157 km.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the overlap and the effective coverage per photograph\n\nThe longitudinal overlap is 60%, which means that 60% of each photograph overlaps with the next one.\n\nTherefore, the effective coverage per photograph is:\n\n\\[ \\text{effective coverage} = \\text{strip width} \\times (1 - \\text{overlap}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Strip width = 1.157 km\n\n- Overlap = 60% = 0.6\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{effective coverage} = 1.157 \\times (1 - 0.6) = 1.157 \\times 0.4 = 0.4628 \\] km\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the number of photographs needed\n\nTo cover a strip that is 16 km long, the number of photographs required is:\n\n\\[ \\text{number of photographs} = \\frac{\\text{total length}}{\\text{effective coverage per photograph}} \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- Total length = 16 km\n\n- Effective coverage per photograph = 0.4628 km\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\text{number of photographs} = \\frac{16}{0.4628} \\approx 34.567 \\]\n\nSince the number of photographs must be a whole number, we round it to the nearest integer, which is 35.\n\nTherefore, the answer is approximately 35, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
