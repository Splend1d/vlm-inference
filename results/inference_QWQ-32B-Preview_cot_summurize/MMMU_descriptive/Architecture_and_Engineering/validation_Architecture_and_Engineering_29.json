                    "text": "To determine the gradient from point P to point Q using the tacheometer data provided, we need to calculate the horizontal distance and the vertical difference between the two points. The gradient can then be expressed as the ratio of the vertical difference to the horizontal distance.\n\nGiven that the tacheometer has constants of 100 and 0, and the staff is held vertical, we can use the formula for horizontal distance and vertical difference in tacheometric measurements.\n\nFirst, let's recall the tacheometric formulas for horizontal distance (D) and vertical difference (d):\n\n1. **Horizontal Distance (D):**\n\n   \\[\n   D = k \\times S \\times \\cos^2 \\theta\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n   - \\( k \\) is the multiplying constant (100 in this case),\n   - \\( S \\) is the staff interval (difference between staff readings),\n   - \\( \\theta \\) is the vertical angle.\n\n2. **Vertical Difference (d):**\n\n   \\[\n   d = k \\times S \\times \\sin \\theta \\times \\cos \\theta\n   \\]\n\nHowever, for an anallactic lens, the formula for vertical difference is simplified to:\n\n   \\[\n   d = k \\times S \\times \\sin \\theta\n   \\]\n\nGiven that the instrument constants are 100 and 0, and the staff is held vertical, we can proceed with these formulas.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine Staff Interval (S) for P and Q:**\n\n   For point P:\n   - Staff readings: 1.255 m, 1.810 m, 2.365 m\n   - Staff interval \\( S_P = 2.365 - 1.255 = 1.110 \\) m\n\n   For point Q:\n   - Staff readings: 1.300 m, 2.120 m, 2.940 m\n   - Staff interval \\( S_Q = 2.940 - 1.300 = 1.640 \\) m\n\n2. **Calculate Horizontal Distances (D_P and D_Q):**\n\n   For point P:\n   - Vertical angle \\( \\theta_P = +10^\\circ 32' \\)\n   - Convert to decimal degrees: \\( 10 + \\frac{32}{60} = 10.5333^\\circ \\)\n   - Horizontal distance:\n     \\[\n     D_P = 100 \\times 1.110 \\times \\cos^2(10.5333^\\circ)\n     \\]\n     First, calculate \\( \\cos(10.5333^\\circ) \\approx 0.9826 \\)\n     \\[\n     D_P = 100 \\times 1.110 \\times (0.9826)^2 = 100 \\times 1.110 \\times 0.9655 = 100 \\times 1.0717 = 107.17 \\text{ m}\n     \\]\n\n   For point Q:\n   - Vertical angle \\( \\theta_Q = +5^\\circ 06' \\)\n   - Convert to decimal degrees: \\( 5 + \\frac{6}{60} = 5.1^\\circ \\)\n   - Horizontal distance:\n     \\[\n     D_Q = 100 \\times 1.640 \\times \\cos^2(5.1^\\circ)\n     \\]\n     First, calculate \\( \\cos(5.1^\\circ) \\approx 0.9962 \\)\n     \\[\n     D_Q = 100 \\times 1.640 \\times (0.9962)^2 = 100 \\times 1.640 \\times 0.9924 = 100 \\times 1.6277 = 162.77 \\text{ m}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Vertical Differences (d_P and d_Q):**\n\n   For point P:\n   - Vertical difference:\n     \\[\n     d_P = 100 \\times 1.110 \\times \\sin(10.5333^\\circ)\n     \\]\n     First, calculate \\( \\sin(10.5333^\\circ) \\approx 0.1832 \\)\n     \\[\n     d_P = 100 \\times 1.110 \\times 0.1832 = 100 \\times 0.2034 = 20.34 \\text{ m}\n     \\]\n\n   For point Q:\n   - Vertical difference:\n     \\[\n     d_Q = 100 \\times 1.640 \\times \\sin(5.1^\\circ)\n     \\]\n     First, calculate \\( \\sin(5.1^\\circ) \\approx 0.0890 \\)\n     \\[\n     d_Q = 100 \\times 1.640 \\times 0.0890 = 100 \\times 0.14596 = 14.596 \\text{ m}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Elevation Differences:**\n\n   Since the instrument is at point R, and staff is at P and Q, the elevation difference between R and P is \\( d_P \\), and between R and Q is \\( d_Q \\).\n\n   Therefore, the elevation difference between P and Q is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta h_{PQ} = d_Q - d_P = 14.596 - 20.34 = -5.744 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n   This indicates that point Q is lower than point P by 5.744 meters.\n\n5. **Calculate Horizontal Distance Between P and Q:**\n\n   The horizontal distance between P and Q can be found using the law of cosines, given the bearings from R to P and R to Q.\n\n   - Bearing from R to P: 130\u00b0\n   - Bearing from R to Q: 220\u00b0\n   - Angle between P and Q at R: \\( 220^\\circ - 130^\\circ = 90^\\circ \\)\n\n   Using the law of cosines:\n   \\[\n   D_{PQ} = \\sqrt{D_P^2 + D_Q^2 - 2 \\times D_P \\times D_Q \\times \\cos(\\text{angle between})}\n   \\]\n   Here, angle between is 90\u00b0, and \\( \\cos(90^\\circ) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   D_{PQ} = \\sqrt{107.17^2 + 162.77^2} = \\sqrt{11485.4089 + 26494.4729} = \\sqrt{37979.8818} \\approx 194.88 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the Gradient:**\n\n   The gradient is the ratio of the vertical difference to the horizontal distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Gradient} = \\frac{|\\Delta h_{PQ}|}{D_{PQ}} = \\frac{5.744}{194.88} \\approx 0.0295\n   \\]\n\n   To express this as \"1 in x\", we take the reciprocal:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1}{0.0295} \\approx 33.898\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the gradient is approximately 1 in 33.90.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. Gradient = 1 in 35.95 m fall  \nB. Gradient = 1 in 33.95 m fall  \nC. Gradient = 1 in 34.95 m fall  \nD. Gradient = 1 in 36.95 m fall\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value is:\n\n**B. Gradient = 1 in 33.95 m fall**\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
