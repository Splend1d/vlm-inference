There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\n### Correct Approach\n\nLet's recall that the bulk specific gravity of the mixture (G_b) is related to the bulk specific gravity of aggregates (G_a) and the specific gravity of asphalt cement (G_c) through the mix composition.\n\nThe correct formula to use is:\n\n\\[ G_{\\text{b}} = \\frac{G_{\\text{a}} \\times (1 - p) + G_{\\text{c}} \\times p}{1} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( p \\) is the percentage of asphalt cement by total mix weight (expressed as a decimal).\n\nWait, but this seems too simplistic. Let's consider a more detailed approach using the weighted average of specific gravities.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the weighted specific gravity of aggregates\n\nFirst, note that aggregates consist of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and mineral filler.\n\nLet's calculate the weighted average specific gravity of aggregates (G_a):\n\n\\[ G_{\\text{a}} = \\frac{(G_{\\text{ca}} \\times \\text{percentage of coarse aggregate}) + (G_{\\text{fa}} \\times \\text{percentage of fine aggregate}) + (G_{\\text{f}} \\times \\text{percentage of mineral filler})}{\\text{total percentage of aggregates}} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the total percentage of aggregates:\n\n\\[ \\text{total aggregates} = 52.35\\% + 33.45\\% + 7.80\\% = 93.60\\% \\]\n\nNow, calculate the weighted average:\n\n\\[ G_{\\text{a}} = \\frac{(2.51 \\times 52.35) + (2.74 \\times 33.45) + (2.69 \\times 7.80)}{93.60} \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n\\[ 2.51 \\times 52.35 = 131.2485 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.74 \\times 33.45 = 91.673 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.69 \\times 7.80 = 20.982 \\]\n\nSum these products:\n\n\\[ 131.2485 + 91.673 + 20.982 = 243.9035 \\]\n\nNow, divide by the total percentage of aggregates:\n\n\\[ G_{\\text{a}} = \\frac{243.9035}{93.60} = 2.605 \\]\n\nSo, the bulk specific gravity of aggregates is approximately 2.605.\n\nHowever, the options provided are:\n\nA. 2.603\n\nB. 2.703\n\nC. 2.803\n\nGiven that, the closest answer is A. 2.603.\n\nBut let's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Verification\n\nRe-calculate the products:\n\n\\[ 2.51 \\times 52.35 = 131.2485 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.74 \\times 33.45 = 91.673 \\]\n\n\\[ 2.69 \\times 7.80 = 20.982 \\]\n\nSum:\n\n\\[ 131.2485 + 91.673 + 20.982 = 243.9035 \\]\n\nDivide by 93.60:\n\n\\[ \\frac{243.9035}{93.60} = 2.605 \\]\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nGiven the options, the closest answer is A. 2.603.\n\nHowever, considering the precision of the given data, the difference between 2.605 and 2.603 is minimal and could be due to rounding during calculations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 2.603.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
