                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem step by step. It seems a bit complicated at first, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nSo, we have a traverse ABCDEFG, and BA is taken as the reference meridian. We're given the coordinates (\u0394N and \u0394E) for the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, and EF. Also, we're told that the bearing of FG is 284\u00b013' and its length is 896.0 m. We need to find the length and bearing of GA.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a traverse is. A traverse is a series of connected lines, like a path, and in surveying, it's used to establish control points. Each line has a direction and a length, and by measuring these, we can determine the positions of points.\n\nGiven that BA is the reference meridian, that means all bearings are measured relative to BA. Normally, bearings are measured from north, but here, it's from BA.\n\nWe have the increments in northing (\u0394N) and easting (\u0394E) for each side from AB to EF. I think I need to use these to find the coordinates of each point, starting from a known point.\n\nLet's assume point A has coordinates (XA, YA). Since it's a traverse, we can set A at any coordinate, but to simplify, let's set A at (0,0).\n\nThen, for each line, I can calculate the coordinates of the next point.\n\nFor AB:\n\n\u0394N = -1190.0\n\n\u0394E = 0\n\nSo, coordinates of B:\n\nXB = XA + \u0394E = 0 + 0 = 0\n\nYB = YA + \u0394N = 0 + (-1190.0) = -1190.0\n\nSimilarly, for BC:\n\n\u0394N = -565.3\n\n\u0394E = 736.4\n\nCoordinates of C:\n\nXC = XB + \u0394E = 0 + 736.4 = 736.4\n\nYC = YB + \u0394N = -1190.0 + (-565.3) = -1755.3\n\nContinuing this for CD:\n\n\u0394N = 590.5\n\n\u0394E = 796.8\n\nCoordinates of D:\n\nXD = XC + \u0394E = 736.4 + 796.8 = 1533.2\n\nYD = YC + \u0394N = -1755.3 + 590.5 = -1164.8\n\nFor DE:\n\n\u0394N = 606.9\n\n\u0394E = -468.0\n\nCoordinates of E:\n\nXE = XD + \u0394E = 1533.2 + (-468.0) = 1065.2\n\nYE = YD + \u0394N = -1164.8 + 606.9 = -557.9\n\nFor EF:\n\n\u0394N = 1017.2\n\n\u0394E = 370.4\n\nCoordinates of F:\n\nXF = XE + \u0394E = 1065.2 + 370.4 = 1435.6\n\nYF = YE + \u0394N = -557.9 + 1017.2 = 459.3\n\nNow, we have the coordinates of points A to F.\n\nNext, we have FG with a bearing of 284\u00b013' and length 896.0 m. We need to find the coordinates of G.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a bearing of 284\u00b013' means. Bearings are usually measured clockwise from north. So, 284\u00b013' is in the southwest direction.\n\nTo find the increments \u0394N and \u0394E for FG, I can use the bearing and length.\n\n\u0394N = length * cos(bearing)\n\n\u0394E = length * sin(bearing)\n\nBut I need to make sure that the bearing is in the correct quadrant.\n\nGiven that bearing is 284\u00b013', which is in the fourth quadrant (between 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0), cosine will be negative, and sine will be negative.\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * cos(284\u00b013') \n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * sin(284\u00b013')\n\nFirst, convert 284\u00b013' to decimal degrees:\n\n284\u00b013' = 284 + 13/60 = 284.2167\u00b0\n\nNow, calculate cos and sin:\n\ncos(284.2167\u00b0) = cos(284.2167) \u2248 0.2079\n\nsin(284.2167\u00b0) = sin(284.2167) \u2248 -0.9781\n\nSo,\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * 0.2079 \u2248 186.8 m\n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * (-0.9781) \u2248 -876.4 m\n\nNow, coordinates of G:\n\nXG = XF + \u0394E = 1435.6 + (-876.4) = 559.2 m\n\nYG = YF + \u0394N = 459.3 + 186.8 = 646.1 m\n\nNow, we need to find the length and bearing of GA.\n\nWe have coordinates of G (559.2, 646.1) and A (0,0).\n\nFirst, find \u0394N and \u0394E from G to A:\n\n\u0394N = YA - YG = 0 - 646.1 = -646.1 m\n\n\u0394E = XA - XG = 0 - 559.2 = -559.2 m\n\nNow, the length of GA is:\n\nLength = sqrt((\u0394N)^2 + (\u0394E)^2) = sqrt((-646.1)^2 + (-559.2)^2) = sqrt(417,455.21 + 312,704.64) = sqrt(729,159.85) \u2248 854.1 m\n\nWait, but the options are around 945.8 m, 947.8 m, etc. So, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the reference meridian BA.\n\nEarlier, I assumed coordinates with A at (0,0), but BA is the reference meridian, which might imply a different coordinate system.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIf BA is the reference meridian, then bearings are measured from BA, not from north.\n\nSo, I need to determine the direction of BA to properly calculate bearings.\n\nFrom the coordinates:\n\nBA: from B to A.\n\nCoordinates of A: (0,0)\n\nCoordinates of B: (0, -1190.0)\n\nSo, BA is from (0,-1190.0) to (0,0), which is directly north.\n\nBecause there's no change in easting, and northing increases by 1190.0.\n\nSo, BA is due north.\n\nTherefore, the reference meridian is due north.\n\nSo, bearings are measured clockwise from north (BA).\n\nNow, in that case, my earlier assumption that north is the +Y direction seems correct.\n\nBut then, why do I have a discrepancy in the length of GA?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the coordinates earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the coordinates calculation.\n\nStarting from A (0,0)\n\nAB: \u0394N = -1190.0, \u0394E = 0\n\nSo, B: (0, -1190.0)\n\nBC: \u0394N = -565.3, \u0394E = 736.4\n\nSo, C: (0 + 736.4, -1190.0 - 565.3) = (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nCD: \u0394N = 590.5, \u0394E = 796.8\n\nSo, D: (736.4 + 796.8, -1755.3 + 590.5) = (1533.2, -1164.8)\n\nDE: \u0394N = 606.9, \u0394E = -468.0\n\nSo, E: (1533.2 - 468.0, -1164.8 + 606.9) = (1065.2, -557.9)\n\nEF: \u0394N = 1017.2, \u0394E = 370.4\n\nSo, F: (1065.2 + 370.4, -557.9 + 1017.2) = (1435.6, 459.3)\n\nFG: bearing 284\u00b013', length 896.0 m\n\nFirst, confirm that bearings are measured from north, clockwise.\n\nGiven that, 284\u00b013' is in the southwest direction.\n\nCalculate \u0394N and \u0394E:\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * cos(284\u00b013') \u2248 896.0 * 0.2079 \u2248 186.8 m\n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * sin(284\u00b013') \u2248 896.0 * (-0.9781) \u2248 -876.4 m\n\nSo, G: (1435.6 - 876.4, 459.3 + 186.8) = (559.2, 646.1)\n\nNow, GA: from G to A, which is from (559.2, 646.1) to (0,0)\n\n\u0394N = 0 - 646.1 = -646.1 m\n\n\u0394E = 0 - 559.2 = -559.2 m\n\nLength of GA:\n\nsqrt((-646.1)^2 + (-559.2)^2) = sqrt(417,455.21 + 312,704.64) = sqrt(729,159.85) \u2248 854.1 m\n\nBut the options are around 945.8 m, 947.8 m, etc. So, there's a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the bearings are relative to the reference meridian BA, which is north, but maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinates need to be calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the \u0394N and \u0394E are not directly the changes in Y and X, but are related to the local coordinate system based on the reference meridian.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf BA is the reference meridian and it's due north, then the coordinate system is likely set such that north is positive \u0394N and east is positive \u0394E.\n\nSo, my earlier assignment of coordinates might be correct.\n\nBut then, why is the length of GA coming out to be 854.1 m, while the options suggest around 945.8 m?\n\nMaybe I need to compute the coordinates differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the total traverse and close it, considering that it's a closed traverse ABCDEFGA.\n\nIn that case, the sum of the increments should bring me back to the starting point.\n\nBut in my calculations, G is at (559.2, 646.1), and A is at (0,0), so GA is from G to A.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the coordinate calculations.\n\nLet me recompute the coordinates step by step.\n\nStarting from A (0,0)\n\nAB:\n\n\u0394N = -1190.0\n\n\u0394E = 0\n\nSo, B: (0, -1190.0)\n\nBC:\n\n\u0394N = -565.3\n\n\u0394E = 736.4\n\nSo, C: (0 + 736.4, -1190.0 - 565.3) = (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nCD:\n\n\u0394N = 590.5\n\n\u0394E = 796.8\n\nSo, D: (736.4 + 796.8, -1755.3 + 590.5) = (1533.2, -1164.8)\n\nDE:\n\n\u0394N = 606.9\n\n\u0394E = -468.0\n\nSo, E: (1533.2 - 468.0, -1164.8 + 606.9) = (1065.2, -557.9)\n\nEF:\n\n\u0394N = 1017.2\n\n\u0394E = 370.4\n\nSo, F: (1065.2 + 370.4, -557.9 + 1017.2) = (1435.6, 459.3)\n\nFG:\n\nBearing 284\u00b013', length 896.0 m\n\nFirst, find \u0394N and \u0394E.\n\nBearing is measured clockwise from north (BA).\n\nSo, bearing of FG is 284\u00b013'.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u0394N = 896.0 * cos(284\u00b013') \u2248 896.0 * 0.2079 \u2248 186.8 m\n\n\u0394E = 896.0 * sin(284\u00b013') \u2248 896.0 * (-0.9781) \u2248 -876.4 m\n\nSo, G: (1435.6 - 876.4, 459.3 + 186.8) = (559.2, 646.1)\n\nNow, GA:\n\nFrom G (559.2, 646.1) to A (0,0)\n\n\u0394N = 0 - 646.1 = -646.1 m\n\n\u0394E = 0 - 559.2 = -559.2 m\n\nLength of GA:\n\nsqrt((-646.1)^2 + (-559.2)^2) = sqrt(417,455.21 + 312,704.64) = sqrt(729,159.85) \u2248 854.1 m\n\nBut the options are around 945.8 m, 947.8 m, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption that A is at (0,0).\n\nMaybe I need to compute the coordinates relative to a different point or consider the traverse is not closed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinates need to be adjusted for the reference meridian.\n\nWait, maybe the bearings are relative to the reference meridian BA, which is north, but perhaps the \u0394N and \u0394E are not directly northing and easting but are in a local coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the azimuth of GA and then find its bearing.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I need to find the bearing relative to the reference meridian BA, which is north.\n\nLet me try to compute the azimuth of GA.\n\nAzimuth is the angle measured clockwise from north.\n\nFor GA:\n\n\u0394N = -646.1 m\n\n\u0394E = -559.2 m\n\nSince both \u0394N and \u0394E are negative, GA is in the southwest quadrant.\n\nThe angle \u03b8 can be found using:\n\n\u03b8 = arctan(|\u0394E| / |\u0394N|) = arctan(559.2 / 646.1) \u2248 arctan(0.865) \u2248 40.75\u00b0\n\nSince it's in the southwest quadrant, the azimuth is 180\u00b0 + 40.75\u00b0 = 220.75\u00b0\n\nBut the options have bearings, which might be different.\n\nWait, bearing is usually the angle measured from north clockwise to the line.\n\nSo, the bearing of GA would be 220.75\u00b0.\n\nBut the options have bearings like 216\u00b045'.\n\nHmm, close but not exact.\n\nBut the length is still not matching.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the traverse should close, meaning that GA should bring me back to A, but in my calculations, there's a discrepancy.\n\nPerhaps I need to compute the linear misclosure and adjust the coordinates accordingly.\n\nIn surveying, traverses often have errors due to measurements, and a correction is applied.\n\nBut that might be beyond the scope here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the coordinate calculations.\n\nLet me check the coordinates again.\n\nStarting from A (0,0)\n\nAB: \u0394N = -1190.0, \u0394E = 0 \u2192 B (0, -1190.0)\n\nBC: \u0394N = -565.3, \u0394E = 736.4 \u2192 C (736.4, -1755.3)\n\nCD: \u0394N = 590.5, \u0394E = 796.8 \u2192 D (1533.2, -1164.8)\n\nDE: \u0394N = 606.9, \u0394E = -468.0 \u2192 E (1065.2, -557.9)\n\nEF: \u0394N = 1017.2, \u0394E = 370.4 \u2192 F (1435.6, 459.3)\n\nFG: bearing 284\u00b013', length 896.0 m \u2192 \u0394N = 186.8 m, \u0394E = -876.4 m \u2192 G (559.2, 646.1)\n\nNow, GA: \u0394N = -646.1 m, \u0394E = -559.2 m \u2192 length \u2248 854"
