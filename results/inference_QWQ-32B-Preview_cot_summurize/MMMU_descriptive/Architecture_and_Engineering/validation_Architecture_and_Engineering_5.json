                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the coordinate bearing angles of the sides of the pentagon, given the internal angles at each vertex and the coordinate bearing angle of one side.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in a polygon, the sum of the internal angles can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of internal angles} = (n - 2) \\times 180\u00b0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of internal angles} = (5 - 2) \\times 180\u00b0 = 3 \\times 180\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n\\]\n\nGiven the internal angles:\n\n- Angle at vertex 1: \\( 70\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Angle at vertex 2: \\( 145\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Angle at vertex 3: \\( 85\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Angle at vertex 4: \\( 120\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Angle at vertex 5: \\( 120\u00b0 \\)\n\nLet's verify that their sum is indeed \\( 540\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n70\u00b0 + 145\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 540\u00b0\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the given angles are correct.\n\nNext, we need to understand the relationship between the internal angles and the coordinate bearing angles of the sides. The coordinate bearing angle of a side is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the side.\n\nGiven that the coordinate bearing angle of side \\( L_{12} \\) is \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\), we can use this as a starting point to find the coordinate bearing angles of the other sides.\n\nTo find the coordinate bearing angles of the subsequent sides, we need to consider the internal angles at each vertex and how they affect the direction of the next side.\n\nLet's denote the coordinate bearing angle of side \\( L_{ij} \\) as \\( \\alpha_{ij} \\).\n\nWe can use the following approach:\n\n1. Start with the given coordinate bearing angle \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\).\n\n2. At each vertex, the change in direction from one side to the next is related to the internal angle at that vertex.\n\n3. The coordinate bearing angle of the next side can be calculated by adding the external angle to the current coordinate bearing angle.\n\n4. The external angle is equal to \\( 180\u00b0 - \\) (internal angle).\n\nLet's proceed step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the external angles at each vertex.**\n\nThe external angle at a vertex is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{External angle} = 180\u00b0 - \\text{internal angle}\n\\]\n\nSo, for each vertex:\n\n- Vertex 1: \\( 180\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 110\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 2: \\( 180\u00b0 - 145\u00b0 = 35\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 3: \\( 180\u00b0 - 85\u00b0 = 95\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 4: \\( 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 5: \\( 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0 \\)\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the coordinate bearing angles for each side.**\n\nWe start with \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\).\n\nTo find \\( \\alpha_{23} \\), we add the external angle at vertex 2 to \\( \\alpha_{12} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{23} = \\alpha_{12} + \\text{external angle at vertex 2} = 30\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 65\u00b0\n\\]\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the options provided. Let's reconsider the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coordinate bearing angle changes by the internal angle rather than the external angle. Let's try this approach.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\nConsider that the coordinate bearing angle changes by the internal angle as we move from one side to the next.\n\nSo, starting from \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\), the coordinate bearing angle for \\( \\alpha_{23} \\) would be:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{23} = \\alpha_{12} + \\text{internal angle at vertex 2} = 30\u00b0 + 145\u00b0 = 175\u00b0\n\\]\n\nBut this also doesn't match any of the options. Maybe we need to consider the direction of rotation.\n\nLet's think about the geometry of the pentagon. At each vertex, the direction of the next side is determined by turning through the internal angle.\n\nIn other words, the change in direction from one side to the next is equal to the internal angle.\n\nTherefore, the coordinate bearing angle for the next side is:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{\\text{next}} = \\alpha_{\\text{current}} + \\text{internal angle}\n\\]\n\nBut we need to ensure that we are measuring the angles correctly, considering the orientation of the pentagon.\n\nLet's try this approach again, being careful with the calculations.\n\nStarting with \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\).\n\nAt vertex 2, internal angle is \\( 145\u00b0 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{23} = \\alpha_{12} + 145\u00b0 = 30\u00b0 + 145\u00b0 = 175\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 3, internal angle is \\( 85\u00b0 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{34} = \\alpha_{23} + 85\u00b0 = 175\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 = 260\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 4, internal angle is \\( 120\u00b0 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{45} = \\alpha_{34} + 120\u00b0 = 260\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 380\u00b0\n\\]\n\nBut \\( 380\u00b0 \\) is equivalent to \\( 20\u00b0 \\) (since \\( 380\u00b0 - 360\u00b0 = 20\u00b0 \\)).\n\nAt vertex 5, internal angle is \\( 120\u00b0 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{51} = \\alpha_{45} + 120\u00b0 = 20\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\\]\n\nFinally, at vertex 1, internal angle is \\( 70\u00b0 \\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_{51} + 70\u00b0 = 140\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 = 210\u00b0\n\\]\n\nBut this contradicts our initial \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\). There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet's consider another method.\n\nPerhaps we should use the fact that the sum of the external angles of any polygon is \\( 360\u00b0 \\).\n\nGiven the external angles we calculated earlier:\n\n- Vertex 1: \\( 110\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 2: \\( 35\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 3: \\( 95\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 4: \\( 60\u00b0 \\)\n\n- Vertex 5: \\( 60\u00b0 \\)\n\nSum of external angles:\n\n\\[\n110\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 360\u00b0\n\\]\n\nThis confirms the external angles are correct.\n\nNow, to find the coordinate bearing angles of the sides, we can consider that each side's coordinate bearing angle is related to the cumulative sum of the external angles up to that point.\n\nStarting with \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\), we can think of the coordinate bearing angles as:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{23} = \\alpha_{12} + \\text{external angle at vertex 1} = 30\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{34} = \\alpha_{23} + \\text{external angle at vertex 2} = 140\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 175\u00b0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{45} = \\alpha_{34} + \\text{external angle at vertex 3} = 175\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 = 270\u00b0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{51} = \\alpha_{45} + \\text{external angle at vertex 4} = 270\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 330\u00b0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_{51} + \\text{external angle at vertex 5} = 330\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 390\u00b0 \\equiv 30\u00b0 \\pmod{360\u00b0}\n\\]\n\nThis brings us back to the starting coordinate bearing angle, which is consistent.\n\nHowever, comparing these results with the options provided:\n\nA. \\( \\alpha_{23}=75\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nB. \\( \\alpha_{23}=95\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nC. \\( \\alpha_{23}=65\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nD. \\( \\alpha_{23}=85\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nNone of these match the coordinate bearing angles we calculated (\\( \\alpha_{23}=140\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=175\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=270\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=330\u00b0 \\)).\n\nThis suggests that our approach might be incorrect.\n\nLet's consider a different method, perhaps using vectors or complex numbers to represent the directions of the sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinate bearing angles are calculated differently, taking into account the actual geometry of the pentagon.\n\nLet's try to visualize the pentagon and see if there is a pattern or a relationship that can help us find the coordinate bearing angles.\n\nAssuming the pentagon is convex (which it likely is, given the internal angles are less than \\( 180\u00b0 \\)), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Start with side \\( L_{12} \\) having a coordinate bearing angle of \\( 30\u00b0 \\).\n\n2. At vertex 2, turn through the internal angle of \\( 145\u00b0 \\) to get to side \\( L_{23} \\).\n\n3. The direction of side \\( L_{23} \\) can be found by adding the internal angle to the coordinate bearing angle of side \\( L_{12} \\), but adjusted for the turn direction.\n\nThis seems similar to our earlier approach, but perhaps we need to consider the turn direction more carefully.\n\nIn surveying and navigation, the coordinate bearing angle is measured clockwise from the north direction. When moving from one side to the next, the turn is either to the left or to the right, depending on the internal angle.\n\nIn a convex polygon, the turns are all to the same side (either all left or all right). Given that, let's assume that we are turning to the right at each vertex.\n\nTherefore, to find the coordinate bearing angle of the next side, we can add the internal angle to the current coordinate bearing angle and take modulo \\( 360\u00b0 \\).\n\nWait, but earlier this led to inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to add the external angle instead.\n\nLet's try again.\n\nStarting with \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\).\n\nAt vertex 2, turn right through the internal angle \\( 145\u00b0 \\), so the new direction is:\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{23} = \\alpha_{12} + 145\u00b0 = 30\u00b0 + 145\u00b0 = 175\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 3, turn right through \\( 85\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{34} = \\alpha_{23} + 85\u00b0 = 175\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 = 260\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 4, turn right through \\( 120\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{45} = \\alpha_{34} + 120\u00b0 = 260\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 380\u00b0 \\equiv 20\u00b0 \\pmod{360\u00b0}\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 5, turn right through \\( 120\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{51} = \\alpha_{45} + 120\u00b0 = 20\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\\]\n\nFinally, at vertex 1, turn right through \\( 70\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_{51} + 70\u00b0 = 140\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 = 210\u00b0\n\\]\n\nBut this does not match the initial \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\), indicating an inconsistency.\n\nThis suggests that simply adding the internal angles to the coordinate bearing angles does not yield the correct result.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the external angle instead.\n\nStarting again with \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\).\n\nAt vertex 2, turn right through the external angle \\( 35\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{23} = \\alpha_{12} + 35\u00b0 = 30\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 65\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 3, turn right through the external angle \\( 95\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{34} = \\alpha_{23} + 95\u00b0 = 65\u00b0 + 95\u00b0 = 160\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 4, turn right through the external angle \\( 60\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{45} = \\alpha_{34} + 60\u00b0 = 160\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 220\u00b0\n\\]\n\nAt vertex 5, turn right through the external angle \\( 60\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{51} = \\alpha_{45} + 60\u00b0 = 220\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 280\u00b0\n\\]\n\nFinally, at vertex 1, turn right through the external angle \\( 110\u00b0 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\alpha_{12} = \\alpha_{51} + 110\u00b0 = 280\u00b0 + 110\u00b0 = 390\u00b0 \\equiv 30\u00b0 \\pmod{360\u00b0}\n\\]\n\nThis time, the coordinate bearing angle returns to the starting value of \\( 30\u00b0 \\), which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the coordinate bearing angles of the sides are:\n\n- \\( \\alpha_{12} = 30\u00b0 \\)\n\n- \\( \\alpha_{23} = 65\u00b0 \\)\n\n- \\( \\alpha_{34} = 160\u00b0 \\)\n\n- \\( \\alpha_{45} = 220\u00b0 \\)\n\n- \\( \\alpha_{51} = 280\u00b0 \\)\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. \\( \\alpha_{23}=75\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nB. \\( \\alpha_{23}=95\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nC. \\( \\alpha_{23}=65\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nD. \\( \\alpha_{23}=85\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{34}=160\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{45}=220\u00b0 \\), \\( \\alpha_{51}=280\u00b0 \\)\n\nOption C matches our calculated values.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
