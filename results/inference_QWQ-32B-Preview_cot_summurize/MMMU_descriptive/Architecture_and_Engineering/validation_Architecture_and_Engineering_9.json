                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem step by step. It seems a bit complex, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's being asked. We have a railway embankment that is 400 meters long, 12 meters wide at the formation level, with side slopes of 2:1. The formation level at zero chainage (which I think means at the start, or at 0 meters) is 107.00 meters. There's a rising gradient of 1 in 100, and the ground is level across the centerline. We need to calculate the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule, and we're given some observations in Image 1, which is described in the previous text.\n\nFrom the description, the image shows a table with distances from 0 to 400 meters in 100-meter increments and corresponding Reduced Levels (R.L.) at those points. The R.L. values are:\n\n- 0 m: 104.8 m\n\n- 100 m: 106.2 m\n\n- 200 m: 107.5 m\n\n- 300 m: 107.2 m\n\n- 400 m: 108.3 m\n\nWait a minute, the formation level at zero chainage is given as 107.00 m, but the R.L. at 0 m is 104.8 m. Are these two different things? Maybe formation level is the designed level, and R.L. is the existing ground level.\n\nAssuming that, I need to find the difference between the designed formation level and the existing ground level at each point, then calculate the volume of earthwork required to bring the ground up to the formation level.\n\nGiven that, let's first find the designed formation levels at each point along the embankment, considering the rising gradient of 1 in 100.\n\nA gradient of 1 in 100 means that for every 100 meters in distance, the level rises by 1 meter.\n\nSo, from 0 to 400 meters:\n\n- At 0 m: formation level is 107.00 m\n\n- At 100 m: 107.00 + (100/100) = 107.00 + 1.00 = 108.00 m\n\n- At 200 m: 107.00 + (200/100) = 107.00 + 2.00 = 109.00 m\n\n- At 300 m: 107.00 + (300/100) = 107.00 + 3.00 = 110.00 m\n\n- At 400 m: 107.00 + (400/100) = 107.00 + 4.00 = 111.00 m\n\nNow, the existing ground levels are:\n\n- 0 m: 104.8 m\n\n- 100 m: 106.2 m\n\n- 200 m: 107.5 m\n\n- 300 m: 107.2 m\n\n- 400 m: 108.3 m\n\nSo, the differences (depths to be filled) are:\n\n- At 0 m: 107.00 - 104.8 = 2.2 m\n\n- At 100 m: 108.00 - 106.2 = 1.8 m\n\n- At 200 m: 109.00 - 107.5 = 1.5 m\n\n- At 300 m: 110.00 - 107.2 = 2.8 m\n\n- At 400 m: 111.00 - 108.3 = 2.7 m\n\nNow, we need to calculate the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule. The prismoidal rule for volume calculation between two stations is:\n\nVolume = (distance/3) * (A1 + A2 + 4Am)\n\nBut in this case, since we have multiple stations, we can use the extended prismoidal formula:\n\nVolume = (distance between stations/3) * (A1 + An + 2*(sum of A2 to An-1) + 4*(sum of Am))\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the trapezoidal rule for volume calculation between stations.\n\nActually, for earthwork volume, the prismoidal formula is often used, which is:\n\nVolume = (d/3) * (A1 + An + 4*(sum of even sections) + 2*(sum of odd sections))\n\nBut in this problem, since the intervals are regular (100 m), and there are 5 stations (even number), we can adjust accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's consider the areas at each station.\n\nGiven that the embankment is 12 m wide at formation level, with side slopes of 2:1.\n\nSo, the base width can be calculated.\n\nSide slope is 2:1, meaning for every 2 units horizontal, there is 1 unit vertical.\n\nGiven the height (fill height) at each station, we can find the base width.\n\nWait, but the fill heights are different at each station.\n\nPerhaps it's better to calculate the cross-sectional area at each station and then use the prismoidal formula to sum them up.\n\nLet's recall that the cross-section of the embankment is a trapezoid (or possibly a triangle if the fill height is zero at some points, but in this case, it's all positive).\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is (top width + bottom width) / 2 * height.\n\nHere, the top width is the formation width, which is 12 m.\n\nThe side slopes are 2:1, meaning for every 1 m of height, the base extends 2 m horizontally on each side.\n\nTherefore, the bottom width is: formation width + 2 * (side slope * height)\n\nSo, bottom width = 12 + 2*(2*height) = 12 + 4*height\n\nTherefore, area = (top + bottom)/2 * height = (12 + 12 + 4*height)/2 * height = (24 + 4*height)/2 * height = (12 + 2*height) * height\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me recast that.\n\nArea of trapezoid = (a + b)/2 * h\n\nwhere a is the top width (12 m), b is the bottom width (12 + 4*height), and h is the height.\n\nSo, area = (12 + (12 + 4*height))/2 * height = (24 + 4*height)/2 * height = (12 + 2*height) * height\n\nWait, that still seems off.\n\nWait, no, that's correct.\n\nArea = (a + b)/2 * h = (12 + 12 + 4*height)/2 * height = (24 + 4*height)/2 * height = (12 + 2*height) * height\n\nBut that simplifies to: 12*height + 2*height\u00b2\n\nHmm, is there another way to look at it?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the area is the area of a rectangle plus two triangles (or two trapezoids, depending on the slope).\n\nBut I think the previous formula is correct.\n\nSo, for each station, given the height (difference between formation level and ground level), we can calculate the area.\n\nLet's calculate the area at each station.\n\nAt 0 m: height = 2.2 m\n\nArea = 12*2.2 + 2*(2.2)^2 = 26.4 + 2*4.84 = 26.4 + 9.68 = 36.08 m\u00b2\n\nAt 100 m: height = 1.8 m\n\nArea = 12*1.8 + 2*(1.8)^2 = 21.6 + 2*3.24 = 21.6 + 6.48 = 28.08 m\u00b2\n\nAt 200 m: height = 1.5 m\n\nArea = 12*1.5 + 2*(1.5)^2 = 18 + 2*2.25 = 18 + 4.5 = 22.5 m\u00b2\n\nAt 300 m: height = 2.8 m\n\nArea = 12*2.8 + 2*(2.8)^2 = 33.6 + 2*7.84 = 33.6 + 15.68 = 49.28 m\u00b2\n\nAt 400 m: height = 2.7 m\n\nArea = 12*2.7 + 2*(2.7)^2 = 32.4 + 2*7.29 = 32.4 + 14.58 = 46.98 m\u00b2\n\nNow, applying the prismoidal formula for volume:\n\nVolume = (d/3) * (A1 + An + 2*(A2 + A3 + ... + An-1) + 4*(A_avg))\n\nWait, actually, for multiple stations, the prismoidal formula is:\n\nVolume = (d/3) * (A1 + An + 2*(sum of even stations) + 4*(sum of odd stations))\n\nBut in this case, with 5 stations, it's better to use the extended formula.\n\nAlternatively, since the intervals are equal, we can use the Simpson's rule, which is similar to the prismoidal formula.\n\nSimpson's rule for n intervals (n even):\n\nVolume = (d/3) * (A1 + An + 4*(A2 + A4 + ...) + 2*(A3 + A5 + ...))\n\nIn this case, n=4 intervals (0 to 100, 100 to 200, 200 to 300, 300 to 400), which is even.\n\nSo, Volume = (100/3) * (A1 + An + 4*(A2 + A4) + 2*A3)\n\nPlugging in the areas:\n\nA1 = 36.08 m\u00b2\n\nA2 = 28.08 m\u00b2\n\nA3 = 22.5 m\u00b2\n\nA4 = 49.28 m\u00b2\n\nA5 = 46.98 m\u00b2\n\nVolume = (100/3) * (36.08 + 46.98 + 4*(28.08 + 49.28) + 2*22.5)\n\nWait, hold on. I think I misapplied the formula.\n\nActually, Simpson's rule for n even is:\n\nVolume = (d/3) * (A1 + An + 4*(A2 + A4 + ... + A_{n-2}) + 2*(A3 + A5 + ... + A_{n-1}))\n\nIn this case, with 5 stations, it's:\n\nVolume = (100/3) * (A1 + A5 + 4*(A2 + A4) + 2*A3)\n\nSo,\n\nVolume = (100/3) * (36.08 + 46.98 + 4*(28.08 + 49.28) + 2*22.5)\n\nFirst, calculate inside the parentheses:\n\nA1 + A5 = 36.08 + 46.98 = 83.06 m\u00b2\n\n4*(A2 + A4) = 4*(28.08 + 49.28) = 4*(77.36) = 309.44 m\u00b2\n\n2*A3 = 2*22.5 = 45 m\u00b2\n\nSum = 83.06 + 309.44 + 45 = 437.5 m\u00b2\n\nThen, Volume = (100/3) * 437.5 = (100/3)*437.5 \u2248 14583.33 m\u00b3\n\nRounding to the nearest integer, that's 14583 m\u00b3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 14563 m\u00b3\n\nB. 14583 m\u00b3\n\nC. 14553 m\u00b3\n\nD. 14573 m\u00b3\n\nSo, the closest answer is B. 14583 m\u00b3.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirming the areas:\n\nAt 0 m: height = 2.2 m\n\nArea = 12*2.2 + 2*(2.2)^2 = 26.4 + 2*4.84 = 26.4 + 9.68 = 36.08 m\u00b2\n\nAt 100 m: height = 1.8 m\n\nArea = 12*1.8 + 2*(1.8)^2 = 21.6 + 2*3.24 = 21.6 + 6.48 = 28.08 m\u00b2\n\nAt 200 m: height = 1.5 m\n\nArea = 12*1.5 + 2*(1.5)^2 = 18 + 2*2.25 = 18 + 4.5 = 22.5 m\u00b2\n\nAt 300 m: height = 2.8 m\n\nArea = 12*2.8 + 2*(2.8)^2 = 33.6 + 2*7.84 = 33.6 + 15.68 = 49.28 m\u00b2\n\nAt 400 m: height = 2.7 m\n\nArea = 12*2.7 + 2*(2.7)^2 = 32.4 + 2*7.29 = 32.4 + 14.58 = 46.98 m\u00b2\n\nNow, applying Simpson's rule:\n\nVolume = (100/3) * (A1 + A5 + 4*(A2 + A4) + 2*A3)\n\n= (100/3) * (36.08 + 46.98 + 4*(28.08 + 49.28) + 2*22.5)\n\n= (100/3) * (83.06 + 4*77.36 + 45)\n\n= (100/3) * (83.06 + 309.44 + 45)\n\n= (100/3) * 437.5\n\n= 14583.33 m\u00b3\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be B. 14583 m\u00b3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{14583 \\text{ } m^{3}} \\]"
