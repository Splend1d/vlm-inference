This kind of basic design is often used to represent a simple dwelling or a small building.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Temple: Temples can vary in design, but they often have more intricate details and specific architectural features depending on the religion. A simple rectangular base with a triangular roof might be too basic to represent a temple specifically.\n\nB. Mosque: Mosques typically have distinct features such as a minaret (a tall tower), a dome, or other Islamic architectural elements. The described image doesn't mention any of these features, so it seems unlikely to represent a mosque.\n\nC. Hut: A hut is a small, simple dwelling, often found in rural or traditional settings. It typically has a basic structure with a rectangular base and a sloping roof, which matches the description provided. Huts are also often depicted in simple line drawings without many details.\n\nD. Church: Churches usually have specific architectural features such as a cross on the top, stained glass windows, or a particular shape like a cross or a rectangle with a tower. The described image doesn't mention any of these features, making it less likely to represent a church.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer seems to be C. Hut, as it aligns best with the description of a simple structure with a rectangular base and a triangular roof, lacking intricate details.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
