The table lists various cost factors for each alternative:\n\n- **Alternative I:**\n  - First Cost: $75,000\n  - Annual Maintenance Cost: $3,000\n  - Service Life (years): 15\n  - Salvage Value: $45,000\n  - Annual Wetland Costs: $7,500\n  - Annual Lighting Costs: $1,500\n\n- **Alternative II:**\n  - First Cost: $125,000\n  - Annual Maintenance Cost: $2,000\n  - Service Life (years): 15\n  - Salvage Value: $25,000\n  - Annual Wetland Costs: $2,500\n  - Annual Lighting Costs: $2,500\n\nThe table provides the necessary data to perform an equivalent annual cost analysis for both alternatives, considering an annual interest rate of 7 percent.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA road is being proposed to facilitate a housing development on a scenic lake. Two alternatives have been suggested. One of the roadway alignments is to go around the lake  and slightly impact a wetland. The second alternative will also go around the lake and  will significantly impact two wetlands. The following table shows the anticipated costs  for each alternative. Assuming that the annual interestrate is 7 percent, determine which alternative is preferred using equivalent annual cost analysis.<image 1>\n\nA. EUAW1=$18,444, EUAW2=$19,730\nB.

                    "text": "To determine which alternative is preferred using equivalent annual cost (EUAC) analysis, we need to calculate the equivalent annual worth (EUAW) for both alternatives and then compare them. The alternative with the lower EUAW is preferred since it has a lower equivalent annual cost.\n\nGiven data for both alternatives:\n\n**Alternative I:**\n\n- First Cost: \\$75,000\n\n- Annual Maintenance Cost: \\$3,000\n\n- Service Life: 15 years\n\n- Salvage Value: \\$45,000\n\n- Annual Wetland Costs: \\$7,500\n\n- Annual Lighting Costs: \\$1,500\n\n**Alternative II:**\n\n- First Cost: \\$125,000\n\n- Annual Maintenance Cost: \\$2,000\n\n- Service Life: 15 years\n\n- Salvage Value: \\$25,000\n\n- Annual Wetland Costs: \\$2,500\n\n- Annual Lighting Costs: \\$2,500\n\n**Annual Interest Rate:** 7%\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total annual cost for each alternative by summing up the annual maintenance, wetland, and lighting costs.\n\n**Alternative I:**\n\nTotal Annual Cost = Annual Maintenance + Annual Wetland Costs + Annual Lighting Costs\n\n= \\$3,000 + \\$7,500 + \\$1,500 = \\$12,000\n\n**Alternative II:**\n\nTotal Annual Cost = \\$2,000 + \\$2,500 + \\$2,500 = \\$7,000\n\nNext, we need to calculate the equivalent annual cost (EUAC) for both the first cost and the salvage value.\n\nThe formula for EUAC is:\n\nEUAC = (First Cost - Salvage Value * (P/F, i%, n)) * (A/P, i%, n) + Salvage Value * (A/F, i%, n) + Total Annual Cost\n\nWhere:\n\n- (P/F, i%, n) is the present worth factor for a single payment\n\n- (A/P, i%, n) is the capital recovery factor\n\n- (A/F, i%, n) is the sinking fund factor\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following simplified formula for EUAC:\n\nEUAC = (First Cost - Salvage Value) * (A/P, i%, n) + Salvage Value * (A/F, i%, n) + Total Annual Cost\n\nBut since salvage value is received at the end of the service life, it's better to use the first formula.\n\nFirst, let's find the required factors:\n\nGiven:\n\n- Interest rate, i = 7%\n\n- Service life, n = 15 years\n\nCalculate the factors:\n\n1. (P/F, 7%, 15)\n\n(P/F, 7%, 15) = 1 / (1 + 0.07)^15 = 1 / 2.759031541 = 0.362446\n\n2. (A/P, 7%, 15)\n\n(A/P, 7%, 15) = [0.07*(1 + 0.07)^15] / [(1 + 0.07)^15 - 1] = [0.07*2.759031541]/[2.759031541 - 1] = 0.1931322079 / 1.759031541 = 0.11\n\n3. (A/F, 7%, 15)\n\n(A/F, 7%, 15) = [0.07] / [(1 + 0.07)^15 - 1] = 0.07 / 1.759031541 = 0.04\n\nNow, let's calculate EUAC for Alternative I:\n\nEUAC1 = [First Cost - Salvage Value * (P/F, 7%, 15)] * (A/P, 7%, 15) + Salvage Value * (A/F, 7%, 15) + Total Annual Cost\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nEUAC1 = [75,000 - 45,000 * 0.362446] * 0.11 + 45,000 * 0.04 + 12,000\n\nFirst, calculate 45,000 * 0.362446 = 16,309.57\n\nThen, 75,000 - 16,309.57 = 58,690.43\n\nNow, 58,690.43 * 0.11 = 6,455.95\n\nNext, 45,000 * 0.04 = 1,800\n\nFinally, EUAC1 = 6,455.95 + 1,800 + 12,000 = 20,255.95\n\nWait, this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, EUAC can be calculated as:\n\nEUAC = First Cost * (A/P, i%, n) - Salvage Value * (A/F, i%, n) + Total Annual Cost\n\nLet's try this formula.\n\nSo,\n\nEUAC1 = 75,000 * 0.11 - 45,000 * 0.04 + 12,000\n\n= 8,250 - 1,800 + 12,000 = 18,450\n\nThis is close to option A: EUAW1=$18,444\n\nNow, let's calculate EUAC for Alternative II similarly.\n\nEUAC2 = 125,000 * 0.11 - 25,000 * 0.04 + 7,000\n\n= 13,750 - 1,000 + 7,000 = 19,750\n\nThis is close to option A: EUAW2=$19,730\n\nSo, the correct choice is A.\n\nBut wait, option A has EUAW1=$18,444 and EUAW2=$19,730, which matches our calculations closely (18,450 and 19,750). Probably, the slight difference is due to rounding of the factors.\n\nTherefore, the preferred alternative is Alternative I, since it has a lower equivalent annual cost.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
