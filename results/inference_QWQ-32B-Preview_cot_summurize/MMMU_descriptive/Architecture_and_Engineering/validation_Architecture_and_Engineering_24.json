Use trapezoidal rule, area = 0.5010 hectares; Use trapezoidal rule, area = 0.5560 hectares**\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nDetermine the area in hectares between the line AB and a meandering stream for offsets taken at a regular interval of 20 m along the line AB (Fig. 12.5). Use both the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule.<image 1><image 2>\n\nA. Use trapezoidal rule,area = 0.5010 hectares;Use trapezoidal rule,area = 0.5560 hectares\nB.
