The placenta appears to have extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, indicating severe damage. The tissue is darkened and discolored, suggesting bleeding and possibly infarction. The overall appearance is consistent with a pathological condition affecting the placenta.\n\nBased on this description, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\nE. Abruptio placenta\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA 29-year-old G3 P2 woman has an uncomplicated pregnancy, and an ultrasound scan at 18 weeks gestation is completely normal. At 37 weeks she has the sudden onset of pelvic pain accompanied by passage of blood per vagina. Her membranes have not ruptured nor is she having labor contractions. Fetal monitoring reveals that the baby is in distress, and an emergent cesarean section is performed. The gross appearance of the placenta is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> \n\nA. Ectopic pregnancy\nB. Placenta previa\nC. Placenta accreta\nD. Molar pregnancy\nE. Abruptio placenta\nF.

Abruptio placenta.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Patient Details:**\n   - 29-year-old, gravida 3, para 2 (G3P2)\n   - Uncomplicated pregnancy\n   - Normal ultrasound at 18 weeks\n\n2. **Presentation:**\n   - At 37 weeks: sudden onset of pelvic pain and passage of blood per vagina\n   - Membranes not ruptured\n   - No labor contractions\n   - Fetal monitoring shows distress, leading to emergent cesarean section\n\n3. **Placental Appearance:**\n   - Extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis\n   - Darkened and discolored tissue\n   - Consistent with severe damage and possible infarction\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. **Ectopic pregnancy:**\n   - Ectopic pregnancies typically present in early gestation, not at 37 weeks.\n   - Symptoms include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, but at this stage, it's unlikely.\n\nB. **Placenta previa:**\n   - Placenta previa involves the placenta covering the cervical os.\n   - It usually presents with painless vaginal bleeding, especially in the third trimester.\n   - However, in this case, there is pelvic pain accompanying the bleeding, which is less typical for placenta previa.\n\nC. **Placenta accreta:**\n   - Placenta accreta is when the placenta invades the uterine wall abnormally.\n   - It often presents with postpartum hemorrhage due to difficulty in placental separation.\n   - Preceded by placenta previa in most cases.\n   - The presentation here is different, with pain and bleeding before delivery.\n\nD. **Molar pregnancy:**\n   - Molar pregnancies are characterized by abnormal placental tissue and usually present in the first trimester.\n   - Symptoms include vaginal bleeding and enlarged uterus.\n   - Ultrasound would show characteristic findings like a \"snowstorm\" appearance.\n   - Given the normal ultrasound at 18 weeks, this is unlikely.\n\nE. **Abruptio placenta:**\n   - Abruptio placenta is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall.\n   - It can present with abdominal or pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding.\n   - The placenta may show areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, matching the description.\n   - Fetal distress is common due to reduced blood flow.\n\nF. **Pregnancy-induced hypertension:**\n   - While hypertension can be associated with placental abruption, it's not a direct diagnosis for the described symptoms.\n   - Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) can lead to abruption, but the primary issue here seems to be the placental separation.\n\nGiven the sudden onset of pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding at 37 weeks, accompanied by fetal distress and a placenta showing extensive hemorrhage and necrosis, abruptio placenta is the most likely diagnosis.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
