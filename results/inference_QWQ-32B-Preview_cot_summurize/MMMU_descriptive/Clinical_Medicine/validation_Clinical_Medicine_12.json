The tissue appears to have a rough, irregular texture with a reddish-orange coloration. There are areas of induration and thickening, suggesting a pathological process. The overall appearance is consistent with a malignancy affecting the breast tissue.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA 61-year-old woman comes to her physician because of a change in the appearance of her right breast over the past 7 months. On physical examination the skin overlying the breast is indurated, roughened, and reddish-orange. There is nipple retraction. The gross appearance of the cut surface of her subsequent mastectomy specimen is shown here. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> \n\nA. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma\nB. Intraductal carcinoma\nC. Phyllodes tumor\nD. Lobular carcinoma in situ\n"

Infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Clinical Presentation:**\n   - The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a 7-month history of breast changes.\n   - Physical examination reveals indurated, roughened, and reddish-orange skin overlying the breast, along with nipple retraction.\n   - These findings are suggestive of breast cancer, particularly given the skin changes and nipple retraction, which can be signs of advanced disease.\n\n2. **Pathological Appearance:**\n   - The image description mentions a close-up view of a cut surface of a mastectomy specimen.\n   - The tissue has a rough, irregular texture with a reddish-orange coloration.\n   - There are areas of induration and thickening, indicating a pathological process.\n   - The overall appearance is consistent with malignancy affecting the breast tissue.\n\n3. **Differential Diagnosis:**\n   - **A. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC):** This is the most common type of breast cancer and can present with skin changes such as peau d'orange (orange peel-like texture) due to lymphatic involvement, and nipple retraction.\n   - **B. Intraductal carcinoma (DCIS):** This is a non-invasive cancer that remains within the ducts. It typically does not cause skin changes or nipple retraction unless it progresses or is associated with other lesions.\n   - **C. Phyllodes tumor:** These are rare breast tumors that can be benign, borderline, or malignant. They often present as a rapid-growing mass but may not typically cause the skin changes described.\n   - **D. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):** This is a condition where abnormal cells form in the lobules of the breast. It is not considered a true cancer and usually does not cause noticeable symptoms or structural changes in the breast.\n\n4. **Correlation with Presentation:**\n   - Given the patient's symptoms of skin induration, roughening, reddish-orange color, and nipple retraction, along with the pathological appearance of the mastectomy specimen, infiltrating ductal carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis.\n   - The skin changes suggest involvement of the dermal lymphatics, which is consistent with the invasive nature of IDC.\n   - The other options either do not typically present with these symptoms or are less likely given the clinical presentation.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is A. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma."
