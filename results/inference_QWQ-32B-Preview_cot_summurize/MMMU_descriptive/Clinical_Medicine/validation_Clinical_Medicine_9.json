The tissue appears to have glandular structures, which are indicative of epithelial cells. The staining reveals a mixture of pink and purple hues, with some areas showing more densely packed cells and others showing more dispersed cells. The presence of glandular formations suggests that the tissue is from an organ with glandular components, such as the stomach. The overall architecture and cellular arrangement do not resemble the typical appearance of benign adenomas or squamous cell carcinomas. Instead, the pattern is more consistent with adenocarcinoma, particularly one that exhibits features of intestinal differentiation.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe picture shows the microscopy of Mr Tan's gastric tumour. Which of the following statements is CORRECT?  <image 1> \n\nA. The findings show an adenoma\nB. The findings show a squamous cell carcinoma\nC. The findings show intestinal type adenocarcinoma\nD. The findings show diffuse signet ring cell adenocarcinoma\n"

Instead, the pattern is more consistent with adenocarcinoma, particularly one that exhibits features of intestinal differentiation.\n\nTherefore, option C is the correct choice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the description explicitly states that the findings do not resemble benign adenomas.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the description rules out squamous cell carcinomas.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while it is a type of adenocarcinoma, the description specifies intestinal type adenocarcinoma, not diffuse signet ring cell adenocarcinoma.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
