The tissue appears to be from the gastrointestinal tract, likely the colon or small intestine, given the presence of circular structures that resemble crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn. These crypts are lined with columnar epithelial cells and are surrounded by a connective tissue stroma.\n\nIn the center of the image, labeled as \"A,\" there is a distinct cluster of cells that form a rounded structure. This structure is characterized by a central area of necrosis surrounded by a layer of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells. This type of cellular arrangement is indicative of a non-caseating granuloma, which is a hallmark feature of Crohn's disease.\n\nBased on this description, the histological feature consistent with Crohn's disease highlighted in part A is:\n\nD. Non-caseating granuloma\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich histological feature consistent with Crohn's disease is highlighted in part A? <image 1> \n\nA. Fissuring ulcer\nB. Sinus tract\nC. Fistula formation\nD. Non-caseating granuloma\n"
