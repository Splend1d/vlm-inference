The skin appears to be covered with a significant amount of hair. There are several small, dark spots scattered across the chest. These spots vary in size but are generally small and round. A ruler is placed at the bottom of the image, indicating that the spots are relatively small, with some measuring less than a centimeter in diameter. The overall appearance suggests benign skin lesions.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA 33-year-old man goes to his physician for a routine check of his health status. On physical examination he has the skin lesions seen here. These lesions have not increased in size since childhood. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? <image 1> \n\nA. Keratoacanthomas\nB. Seborrheic keratoses\nC. Fibroepithelial polyps\nD. Nevocellular nevi\nE. Epidermal inclusion cysts\n"

These lesions have been present since childhood and have not increased in size. The options provided for diagnosis are:\n\nA. Keratoacanthomas  \nB. Seborrheic keratoses  \nC. Fibroepithelial polyps  \nD. Nevocellular nevi  \nE. Epidermal inclusion cysts\n\nLet's evaluate each option one by one:\n\nA. **Keratoacanthomas**: These are typically fast-growing skin lesions that can resemble squamous cell carcinomas. They often have a central crater filled with keratin and can occur in adults, but they usually present later in life and tend to grow rapidly, which doesn't match the description of lesions present since childhood that haven't increased in size.\n\nB. **Seborrheic keratoses**: These are benign skin growths that can appear in various sizes and colors, often looking like they are stuck on the skin. They can occur at any age but are more common in older adults. While they can be present in younger individuals, their presence since childhood is less typical.\n\nC. **Fibroepithelial polyps** (also known as skin tags): These are small, soft skin growths that hang off the skin and are usually flesh-colored or slightly darker. They are common in adults, especially in areas where the skin folds or rubs together. While they can be present on the chest, they are typically skin-colored and not dark spots.\n\nD. **Nevocellular nevi** (moles): Moles can be present at birth or develop during childhood and adolescence. They can vary in color from light brown to black and can be flat or raised. The description mentions small, dark, round spots that have been present since childhood and haven't increased in size, which is consistent with stable moles.\n\nE. **Epidermal inclusion cysts**: These are benign cysts that form when skin cells become enclosed within the skin and continue to multiply. They are usually round, movable, and can be filled with a cheese-like substance. They are typically skin-colored or yellowish and not dark spots.\n\nGiven the description of small, dark, round spots on the chest that have been present since childhood and haven't increased in size, the most likely diagnosis is **nevocellular nevi** (option D). These are common benign melanocytic tumors that can appear in various colors and sizes and are often stable over time.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD"
