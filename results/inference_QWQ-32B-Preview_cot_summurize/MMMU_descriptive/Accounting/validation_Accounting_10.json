                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a list of financial transactions with their amounts in dollars, and I need to find two things: first, the net cash provided by or used in investing activities; and second, the net increase or decrease in cash for the year. The options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what investing activities are. Investing activities typically involve the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and investments. So, from the list provided:\n\n- Cash dividend: $80,000\n\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000\n\n- Interest paid on debt: $25,000\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\n- Repurchase of stock: $55,000\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000\n\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000\n\nI need to identify which of these are investing activities. Let's see:\n\n- Purchase of bus: This sounds like acquiring a long-term asset, so it's likely an investing activity.\n\n- Sales of old equipment: Disposing of a long-term asset, so that's also an investing activity.\n\n- The others seem like operating activities or financing activities, but I'm not entirely sure about some of them. For now, I'll consider only the purchase of bus and sales of old equipment as investing activities.\n\nSo, net cash provided by or used in investing activities would be the sum of these two:\n\nSales of old equipment: $72,000 (this is cash inflow)\n\nPurchase of bus: $33,000 (this is cash outflow)\n\nSo, net investing cash flow = $72,000 - $33,000 = $39,000\n\nThat matches option A for the first part.\n\nNow, for the net increase or decrease in cash for the year, I need to consider all the cash flows, not just investing activities. I need to look at operating activities and financing activities as well.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide a clear classification of these activities. Maybe I need to categorize them myself.\n\nLet's try to classify each transaction:\n\n- Cash dividend: This is typically a distribution to shareholders, so it's a financing activity.\n\n- Purchase of bus: As we already decided, investing activity.\n\n- Interest paid on debt: This is usually an operating activity, as it's part of the ongoing operations.\n\n- Sales of old equipment: Investing activity.\n\n- Repurchase of stock: This is a financing activity, as it involves shares of the company.\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: Operating activity, as it's related to the main business operations.\n\n- Cash collections from customers: Operating activity, again part of main business operations.\n\nSo, to find the net increase or decrease in cash for the year, I need to sum up all these cash flows.\n\nLet's list them with their signs:\n\n- Cash dividend: -$80,000 (outflow)\n\n- Purchase of bus: -$33,000 (outflow)\n\n- Interest paid on debt: -$25,000 (outflow)\n\n- Sales of old equipment: +$72,000 (inflow)\n\n- Repurchase of stock: -$55,000 (outflow)\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: -$95,000 (outflow)\n\n- Cash collections from customers: +$300,000 (inflow)\n\nNow, let's add them up:\n\n$300,000 (collections) + $72,000 (sales of equipment) = $372,000 (total inflows)\n\n-$80,000 (dividend) - $33,000 (bus) - $25,000 (interest) - $55,000 (repurchase) - $95,000 (suppliers) = -$288,000 (total outflows)\n\nNet change in cash = $372,000 - $288,000 = $84,000\n\nSo, the net increase in cash for the year is $84,000.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (1)$39,000 ; (2)$84,000\n\nB. (1)$36,000 ; (2)$77,000\n\nC. (1)$38,650 ; (2)$82,910\n\nMy calculations match option A.\n\nWait a minute, in the problem statement, it says \"Use the following cash flow data for Rocket Transport to find Rocket's (1)net cash provided by or used in investing activities (2)Net increase or decrease in cash for the year. <image 1>\" but there is no actual image provided here. However, based on the description, I used the amounts given to perform the calculations.\n\nI think my approach is correct, but I should double-check if any of the transactions should be classified differently.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n\n- Cash dividend: Definitely financing activity.\n\n- Purchase of bus: Definitely investing activity.\n\n- Interest paid on debt: This could be argued. Sometimes interest paid is considered an operating activity, as it's part of the cost of doing business. However, sometimes it might be classified under financing activities. But according to standard cash flow classification, interest paid is usually an operating activity.\n\n- Sales of old equipment: Definitely investing activity.\n\n- Repurchase of stock: Definitely financing activity.\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: Definitely operating activity.\n\n- Cash collections from customers: Definitely operating activity.\n\nSo, my classification seems correct.\n\nNow, perhaps I should verify the calculations again.\n\nTotal inflows:\n\n- Cash collections from customers: $300,000\n\n- Sales of old equipment: $72,000\n\nTotal inflows = $372,000\n\nTotal outflows:\n\n- Cash dividend: $80,000\n\n- Purchase of bus: $33,000\n\n- Interest paid on debt: $25,000\n\n- Repurchase of stock: $55,000\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: $95,000\n\nTotal outflows = $80,000 + $33,000 + $25,000 + $55,000 + $95,000 = $288,000\n\nNet change in cash = $372,000 - $288,000 = $84,000\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interest paid should be considered part of financing activities, but according to standard classifications, it's an operating activity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repurchase of stock should be considered an operating activity, but no, it's a financing activity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the purchase of bus should be considered an operating activity, but no, it's an investing activity.\n\nWait, perhaps the sales of old equipment should be considered a gain or loss, but in cash flow terms, it's an investing activity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the amounts.\n\nWait, perhaps \"sales of old equipment\" is actually a negative cash flow, but no, selling equipment would bring in cash, so it's positive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repurchase of stock should be positive, but no, repurchasing stock means the company is paying out cash to buy back shares, so it's an outflow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cash dividend is an inflow, but no, paying dividends is an outflow.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's confusion about the sign of the cash flows.\n\nIn some contexts, cash flows are presented with negative signs for outflows, but in net change, it's inflows minus outflows.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me try to categorize the cash flows:\n\nOperating activities:\n\n- Cash collections from customers: +$300,000\n\n- Cash payments to suppliers: -$95,000\n\n- Interest paid on debt: -$25,000\n\nNet operating cash flow: $300,000 - $95,000 - $25,000 = $180,000\n\nInvesting activities:\n\n- Purchase of bus: -$33,000\n\n- Sales of old equipment: +$72,000\n\nNet investing cash flow: $72,000 - $33,000 = $39,000\n\nFinancing activities:\n\n- Cash dividend: -$80,000\n\n- Repurchase of stock: -$55,000\n\nNet financing cash flow: -$80,000 - $55,000 = -$135,000\n\nNow, net change in cash = net operating + net investing + net financing\n\n= $180,000 + $39,000 - $135,000 = $180,000 + $39,000 = $219,000 - $135,000 = $84,000\n\nThis confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: (1) $39,000; (2) $84,000\n\nI think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
