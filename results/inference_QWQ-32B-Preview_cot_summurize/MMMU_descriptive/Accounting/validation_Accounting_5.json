                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about how to calculate the equivalent units for conversion costs using the weighted-average method. I understand that materials are added at the beginning, but conversion costs are applied gradually throughout the process. The table provides data for four quarters, and I need to find the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter independently.\n\nLet's focus on one quarter at a time. Starting with Quarter 1:\n\n- Beginning Work in Process: None\n\n- Started: 255,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 235,000 units\n\n- Ending Work in Process: Since beginning WIP is none and 255,000 units were started, with 235,000 transferred out, the ending WIP should be 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units.\n\n- Conversion % complete: 50%\n\nUsing the weighted-average method, the equivalent units for conversion costs would be:\n\nEquivalent units = Units transferred out + (Ending WIP units \u00d7 Percentage complete for conversion)\n\nSo for Quarter 1:\n\nEquivalent units = 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 0.50) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nWait, but the question mentions that the quarters are independent, and I need to consider only the data provided for each quarter. Maybe I need to calculate for each quarter separately and then sum them up?\n\nLet me check Quarter 2:\n\n- Beginning Work in Process: 2,500 units\n\n- Started: 275,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 250,000 units\n\n- Conversion % complete: 40%\n\nFirst, find the ending WIP:\n\nEnding WIP = Beginning WIP + Started - Transferred Out = 2,500 + 275,000 - 250,000 = 27,500 units\n\nEquivalent units = Transferred Out + (Ending WIP \u00d7 % complete for conversion)\n\n= 250,000 + (27,500 \u00d7 0.40) = 250,000 + 11,000 = 261,000\n\nQuarter 3:\n\n- Beginning WIP: 3,600 units\n\n- Started: 290,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 275,000 units\n\n- Conversion % complete: 45%\n\nEnding WIP = 3,600 + 290,000 - 275,000 = 18,600 units\n\nEquivalent units = 275,000 + (18,600 \u00d7 0.45) = 275,000 + 8,370 = 283,370\n\nQuarter 4:\n\n- Beginning WIP: 6,500 units\n\n- Started: 300,000 units\n\n- Transferred Out: 280,000 units\n\n- Conversion % complete: 60%\n\nEnding WIP = 6,500 + 300,000 - 280,000 = 26,500 units\n\nEquivalent units = 280,000 + (26,500 \u00d7 0.60) = 280,000 + 15,900 = 295,900\n\nNow, if I sum up the equivalent units for all four quarters:\n\nQuarter 1: 245,000\n\nQuarter 2: 261,000\n\nQuarter 3: 283,370\n\nQuarter 4: 295,900\n\nTotal = 245,000 + 261,000 + 283,370 + 295,900 = 1,085,270\n\nBut the options provided are:\n\nA. 132,625\n\nB. 134,485\n\nC. 135,332\n\nD. 132,685\n\nThese numbers are much smaller than my total, which suggests I've misunderstood the question. It says to assume that the quarters are independent, so maybe I need to calculate the equivalent units for each quarter separately and then choose the one that matches one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for one specific quarter, but it doesn't specify which one. Maybe it's referring to a particular quarter shown in the image, but since I don't have the image, I have to work with the description provided.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to calculate the equivalent units for conversion costs for the entire year, considering all four quarters. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, sum up the units transferred out for all quarters:\n\n235,000 + 250,000 + 275,000 + 280,000 = 1,040,000 units\n\nNext, calculate the ending WIP for each quarter and then find the total equivalent units for conversion costs.\n\nFrom earlier calculations:\n\nQuarter 1 ending WIP: 20,000 units at 50% complete\n\nQuarter 2 ending WIP: 27,500 units at 40% complete\n\nQuarter 3 ending WIP: 18,600 units at 45% complete\n\nQuarter 4 ending WIP: 26,500 units at 60% complete\n\nTotal ending WIP equivalent units for conversion:\n\n(20,000 \u00d7 0.50) + (27,500 \u00d7 0.40) + (18,600 \u00d7 0.45) + (26,500 \u00d7 0.60)\n\n= 10,000 + 11,000 + 8,370 + 15,900 = 45,270\n\nTherefore, total equivalent units for conversion costs for the year:\n\nUnits transferred out + ending WIP equivalent units = 1,040,000 + 45,270 = 1,085,270\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for a single quarter, and the image shows data for one quarter, but in the description, it shows data for four quarters. There might be a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about calculating the equivalent units for conversion costs using the weighted-average method for a specific quarter, and the options are for that quarter's equivalent units.\n\nLet me consider Quarter 1 again:\n\nUnits transferred out: 235,000\n\nEnding WIP: 20,000 units at 50% complete for conversion\n\nEquivalent units for conversion = 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 0.50) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question is about calculating the equivalent units for conversion costs for the entire year, but considering the beginning WIP for each quarter as part of the current quarter's work.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, for each quarter, the equivalent units for conversion costs would be:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\n- Units started and completed: 235,000 (transferred out)\n\n- Ending WIP: 20,000 units at 50% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 0.50) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nQuarter 2:\n\n- Units started and completed: 250,000 - 2,500 (beginning WIP) = 247,500\n\n- Ending WIP: 27,500 units at 40% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 247,500 + (27,500 \u00d7 0.40) = 247,500 + 11,000 = 258,500\n\nQuarter 3:\n\n- Units started and completed: 275,000 - 3,600 (beginning WIP) = 271,400\n\n- Ending WIP: 18,600 units at 45% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 271,400 + (18,600 \u00d7 0.45) = 271,400 + 8,370 = 279,770\n\nQuarter 4:\n\n- Units started and completed: 280,000 - 6,500 (beginning WIP) = 273,500\n\n- Ending WIP: 26,500 units at 60% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 273,500 + (26,500 \u00d7 0.60) = 273,500 + 15,900 = 289,400\n\nNow, summing these up:\n\n245,000 + 258,500 + 279,770 + 289,400 = 1,072,670\n\nStill not matching any of the options.\n\nI must be misinterpreting the question or misunderstanding the weighted-average method in this context.\n\nLet me recall the formula for equivalent units under the weighted-average method:\n\nEquivalent units = Units completed and transferred out + (Ending WIP units \u00d7 Percentage complete for conversion)\n\nAnd since materials are added at the beginning, their equivalent units would be different, but the question specifically asks for conversion costs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for the ending WIP only, not including the units transferred out.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the equivalent units should include both the units transferred out (which are 100% complete) and the ending WIP (at their percentage of completion).\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in how I'm calculating the ending WIP units.\n\nLet me double-check the ending WIP for each quarter:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\nBeginning WIP: None\n\nStarted: 255,000\n\nTransferred out: 235,000\n\nEnding WIP: 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units\n\nQuarter 2:\n\nBeginning WIP: 2,500\n\nStarted: 275,000\n\nTransferred out: 250,000\n\nEnding WIP: 2,500 + 275,000 - 250,000 = 27,500 units\n\nQuarter 3:\n\nBeginning WIP: 3,600\n\nStarted: 290,000\n\nTransferred out: 275,000\n\nEnding WIP: 3,600 + 290,000 - 275,000 = 18,600 units\n\nQuarter 4:\n\nBeginning WIP: 6,500\n\nStarted: 300,000\n\nTransferred out: 280,000\n\nEnding WIP: 6,500 + 300,000 - 280,000 = 26,500 units\n\nThese calculations seem correct.\n\nPerhaps the question is not about summing up all the quarters but about calculating the equivalent units for a specific quarter.\n\nLooking back at the question:\n\n\"What are the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method? Assume that the quarters are independent.\"\n\nGiven that, I should calculate the equivalent units for each quarter separately and then maybe select the one that matches one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for the ending WIP only, not including the units transferred out.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nQuarter 1: 20,000 \u00d7 0.50 = 10,000\n\nQuarter 2: 27,500 \u00d7 0.40 = 11,000\n\nQuarter 3: 18,600 \u00d7 0.45 = 8,370\n\nQuarter 4: 26,500 \u00d7 0.60 = 15,900\n\nNow, summing these up: 10,000 + 11,000 + 8,370 + 15,900 = 45,270\n\nStill not matching any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for the units started and completed during the quarter.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because units started and completed would be 100% complete for conversion costs.\n\nI'm getting more confused. Maybe I need to look at this differently.\n\nLet me consider that the quarters are independent, meaning that the beginning WIP for each quarter is considered as if it's the starting point, and the ending WIP for one quarter becomes the beginning WIP for the next quarter.\n\nBut the question says to assume that the quarters are independent, so perhaps beginning WIP for each quarter should not be considered as coming from the previous quarter's ending WIP.\n\nWait, but in process costing, typically, beginning WIP is from the previous period, but if the quarters are independent, maybe each quarter is treated in isolation.\n\nLet me try treating each quarter separately, ignoring the beginning WIP from previous quarters.\n\nSo, for each quarter, beginning WIP is as given, and started units are as given.\n\nThen, ending WIP is beginning WIP plus started minus transferred out.\n\nAnd equivalent units are transferred out plus ending WIP times percentage complete for conversion.\n\nWait, but that's what I did earlier, and I got totals that don't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the equivalent units for conversion costs for the ending WIP only, not including the units transferred out.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as equivalent units typically include both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about calculating the equivalent units for conversion costs using the weighted-average method, considering that the beginning WIP is zero for all quarters except Quarter 1.\n\nWait, but in the data provided, Quarter 1 has no beginning WIP.\n\nWait, actually, Quarter 1 has no beginning WIP, but Quarter 2 has beginning WIP of 2,500 units, Quarter 3 has 3,600, and Quarter 4 has 6,500.\n\nBut if the quarters are independent, perhaps beginning WIP should be treated as zero for each quarter.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nIf I treat beginning WIP as zero for each quarter, then:\n\nQuarter 1:\n\n- Started: 255,000\n\n- Transferred out: 235,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 255,000 - 235,000 = 20,000 units at 50% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 235,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 0.50) = 235,000 + 10,000 = 245,000\n\nQuarter 2:\n\n- Started: 275,000\n\n- Transferred out: 250,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 275,000 - 250,000 = 25,000 units at 40% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 250,000 + (25,000 \u00d7 0.40) = 250,000 + 10,000 = 260,000\n\nQuarter 3:\n\n- Started: 290,000\n\n- Transferred out: 275,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 290,000 - 275,000 = 15,000 units at 45% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 275,000 + (15,000 \u00d7 0.45) = 275,000 + 6,750 = 281,750\n\nQuarter 4:\n\n- Started: 300,000\n\n- Transferred out: 280,000\n\n- Ending WIP: 300,000 - 280,000 = 20,000 units at 60% complete\n\n- Equivalent units: 280,000 + (20,000 \u00d7 0.60) = 280,000 + 12,000 = 292,000\n\nNow, summing these up: 245,000 + 260,000 + 281,750 + 292,000 = 1,078,750\n\nStill not matching any of the options.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here.\n\nPerhaps the question is not about summing the equivalent units for all quarters but about calculating it for a specific quarter.\n\nLooking back at the question, it says: \"what are the equivalent units for conversion costs for each quarter using the weighted-average method?
