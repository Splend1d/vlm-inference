                    "text": "I'm going to try to answer this question about which projects would be incorrectly accepted or rejected based on the firm's overall cost of capital being used as a hurdle rate. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's given:\n\n- There's an all-equity firm considering four projects: W, X, Y, and Z.\n\n- Each project has a beta and an IRR (Internal Rate of Return).\n\n- The T-bill rate is 3.5%, and the expected return on the market is 11%.\n\nThe table provides:\n\n- Project W: Beta = 0.80, IRR = 9.4%\n\n- Project X: Beta = 0.95, IRR = 10.9%\n\n- Project Y: Beta = 1.15, IRR = 13.0%\n\n- Project Z: Beta = 1.45, IRR = 14.2%\n\nThe question is asking about whether projects would be incorrectly accepted or rejected if the firm uses its overall cost of capital as the hurdle rate instead of using the project-specific required rates of return based on their betas.\n\nSo, I need to find out what the firm's overall cost of capital is and then compare it to each project's required rate of return (based on its beta) and IRR.\n\nFirst, since it's an all-equity firm, the cost of capital should be equal to the required return on equity, which can be calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return} = R_f + \\beta (R_m - R_f) \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate (T-bill rate = 3.5%)\n\n- \\( R_m \\) is the expected return on the market (11%)\n\n- \\( \\beta \\) is the beta of the project\n\nBut since the firm is all-equity, its overall beta is likely the weighted average of the betas of the projects it's considering, weighted by their market values. However, since we don't have information about the market values or the proportions of each project, I might need to consider another approach.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the firm's overall cost of capital is based on its current portfolio of projects. But since it's considering new projects, it might be using its current cost of capital as the hurdle rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the firm is using the CAPM to determine its overall cost of capital based on its average beta.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate each project's required return based on its beta and compare it to the firm's overall cost of capital.\n\nLet me calculate each project's required return using CAPM:\n\nFor Project W:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_W = 3.5\\% + 0.80 \\times (11\\% - 3.5\\%) = 3.5\\% + 0.80 \\times 7.5\\% = 3.5\\% + 6\\% = 9.5\\% \\]\n\nFor Project X:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_X = 3.5\\% + 0.95 \\times 7.5\\% = 3.5\\% + 7.125\\% = 10.625\\% \\]\n\nFor Project Y:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_Y = 3.5\\% + 1.15 \\times 7.5\\% = 3.5\\% + 8.625\\% = 12.125\\% \\]\n\nFor Project Z:\n\n\\[ \\text{Required return}_Z = 3.5\\% + 1.45 \\times 7.5\\% = 3.5\\% + 10.875\\% = 14.375\\% \\]\n\nNow, the firm's overall cost of capital would likely be based on the beta of its current portfolio. But since it's considering new projects, perhaps it uses its current cost of capital as the hurdle rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it uses the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), but since it's all-equity, WACC should be equal to the required return on equity, which is based on the average beta.\n\nHowever, without specific information on how the firm calculates its overall cost of capital, perhaps I should assume that it uses the CAPM with the firm's average beta.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the firm uses the same cost of capital for all projects, regardless of their individual risks.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that using the firm's overall cost of capital as the hurdle rate could lead to incorrect acceptance or rejection of projects.\n\nSo, if the firm uses a single hurdle rate for all projects, some projects might be accepted that shouldn't be, or rejected that should be accepted, based on their individual required returns.\n\nLet me try to find the firm's overall cost of capital.\n\nSince it's an all-equity firm, its cost of capital is equal to the required return on equity, which is determined by the CAPM using the firm's beta.\n\nBut what is the firm's overall beta?\n\nIf we assume that the firm currently has projects W, X, Y, and Z in equal proportions, then the overall beta would be the average of their betas.\n\nSo, average beta = (0.80 + 0.95 + 1.15 + 1.45) / 4 = 4.35 / 4 = 1.0875\n\nThen, the firm's overall cost of capital would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Cost of capital} = 3.5\\% + 1.0875 \\times 7.5\\% = 3.5\\% + 8.15625\\% = 11.65625\\% \\]\n\nSo, if the firm uses 11.65625% as the hurdle rate, then it would accept projects with IRR > 11.65625% and reject those with IRR < 11.65625%.\n\nNow, let's look at each project:\n\n- Project W: IRR = 9.4% < 11.65625% \u2192 Rejected\n\n- Project X: IRR = 10.9% < 11.65625% \u2192 Rejected\n\n- Project Y: IRR = 13.0% > 11.65625% \u2192 Accepted\n\n- Project Z: IRR = 14.2% > 11.65625% \u2192 Accepted\n\nBut, based on each project's required return, which we calculated earlier:\n\n- Project W: Required return = 9.5% \u2192 Since IRR = 9.4% < 9.5%, it should be rejected\n\n- Project X: Required return = 10.625% \u2192 IRR = 10.9% > 10.625%, should be accepted\n\n- Project Y: Required return = 12.125% \u2192 IRR = 13.0% > 12.125%, should be accepted\n\n- Project Z: Required return = 14.375% \u2192 IRR = 14.2% < 14.375%, should be rejected\n\nSo, based on the individual required returns:\n\n- Project W: Reject\n\n- Project X: Accept\n\n- Project Y: Accept\n\n- Project Z: Reject\n\nBut using the overall cost of capital as the hurdle rate:\n\n- Project W: Reject\n\n- Project X: Reject\n\n- Project Y: Accept\n\n- Project Z: Accept\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- Project X: Should be accepted based on its own required return, but is rejected using the overall cost of capital hurdle rate \u2192 Incorrectly rejected\n\n- Project Z: Should be rejected based on its own required return, but is accepted using the overall cost of capital hurdle rate \u2192 Incorrectly accepted\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that Project X would be incorrectly rejected and Project Z would be incorrectly accepted.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Project X would be incorrectly rejected; Project Z would be incorrectly accepted.\n\nB. Project Y would be incorrectly rejected; Project X would be incorrectly accepted.\n\nC. Project Z would be incorrectly rejected; Project X would be incorrectly accepted.\n\nD. No project would be incorrectly rejected; Project Z would be incorrectly accepted.\n\nOption A matches our conclusion.\n\nWait, but in option C, it says Project Z would be incorrectly rejected; Project X would be incorrectly accepted. But according to our analysis, Project Z is incorrectly accepted, not rejected.\n\nSimilarly, option D says no project would be incorrectly rejected; Project Z would be incorrectly accepted. But according to our analysis, Project X would be incorrectly rejected.\n\nOption B says Project Y would be incorrectly rejected; Project X would be incorrectly accepted. But Project Y should be accepted in both cases, so no incorrect rejection.\n\nTherefore, option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nProject W: Correctly rejected in both cases.\n\nProject X: Should be accepted based on its own required return but is rejected using the overall cost of capital \u2192 Incorrectly rejected.\n\nProject Y: Correctly accepted in both cases.\n\nProject Z: Should be rejected based on its own required return but is accepted using the overall cost of capital \u2192 Incorrectly accepted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
