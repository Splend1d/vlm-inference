                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the highest possible beta estimate for the project before its Net Present Value (NPV) becomes negative. Let's break down the steps required to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Cash Flows\nThe project has the following cash flows:\n- Initial investment (Year 0): -\\$40 million\n- Annual cash inflows (Years 1-10): \\$15 million per year\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Required Rate of Return\nWe are given:\n- Risk-free rate (rf): 8%\n- Expected market return (E(rM)): 16%\n- Project's beta: 1.8 (initially, but we need to find the highest beta before NPV turns negative)\n\nWe will use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to find the required rate of return (r):\n\n\\[ r = rf + \\beta \\times (E(rM) - rf) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the NPV\nThe NPV is calculated as the sum of the present values of all cash flows minus the initial investment.\n\nFor years 1-10, the cash flows are equal, so we can use the Present Value of an Annuity formula:\n\n\\[ PV = C \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- C = annual cash flow = \\$15 million\n- r = required rate of return\n- n = number of periods = 10 years\n\nThus, NPV is:\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-10}}{r} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Set NPV to Zero and Solve for r\nTo find the highest beta before NPV becomes negative, we set NPV to zero and solve for r:\n\n\\[ 0 = -40 + 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-10}}{r} \\]\n\nThis equation needs to be solved for r, which is the internal rate of return (IRR) of the project.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the IRR\nWe can use a financial calculator or a spreadsheet function to find the IRR. Let's assume we find that the IRR is approximately 17.46%.\n\n### Step 6: Relate IRR to Beta\nUsing the CAPM formula, we can express the required rate of return in terms of beta:\n\n\\[ r = 8\\% + \\beta \\times (16\\% - 8\\%) \\]\n\\[ r = 8\\% + 0.08\\beta \\]\n\nSet this equal to the IRR:\n\n\\[ 8\\% + 0.08\\beta = 17.46\\% \\]\n\n### Step 7: Solve for Beta\n\\[ 0.08\\beta = 17.46\\% - 8\\% \\]\n\\[ 0.08\\beta = 9.46\\% \\]\n\\[ \\beta = \\frac{9.46\\%}{0.08} \\]\n\\[ \\beta = 1.1825 \\]\n\nWait a minute, this result seems off because the initial beta is 1.8, and we are looking for a higher beta that makes NPV zero. Let's re-examine our approach.\n\n### Correct Approach\nActually, we need to find the beta where NPV becomes zero. We have:\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-10}}{r} = 0 \\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[ r = 8\\% + \\beta \\times 8\\% \\]\n\nSubstitute r into the NPV equation:\n\n\\[ -40 + 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + (8\\% + 0.08\\beta))^{-10}}{8\\% + 0.08\\beta} = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a complex equation to solve for beta algebraically, so we can use numerical methods or trial and error.\n\n### Step 8: Use Trial and Error or Numerical Methods\nLet's try plugging in the given options to see which beta makes NPV zero.\n\n**Option A: \u03b2 = 3.31**\n\n\\[ r = 8\\% + 3.31 \\times 8\\% = 8\\% + 26.48\\% = 34.48\\% \\]\n\nCalculate PV of cash flows:\n\n\\[ PV = 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.3448)^{-10}}{0.3448} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate (1 + 0.3448)^-10:\n\n\\[ (1.3448)^{-10} \\approx 0.031 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ PV = 15 \\times \\frac{1 - 0.031}{0.3448} = 15 \\times \\frac{0.969}{0.3448} \\approx 15 \\times 2.81 \\approx 42.15 \\]\n\nNPV:\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + 42.15 = 2.15 \\] (positive)\n\n**Option B: \u03b2 = 3.47**\n\n\\[ r = 8\\% + 3.47 \\times 8\\% = 8\\% + 27.76\\% = 35.76\\% \\]\n\nCalculate PV:\n\n\\[ PV = 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.3576)^{-10}}{0.3576} \\]\n\n\\[ (1.3576)^{-10} \\approx 0.026 \\]\n\n\\[ PV = 15 \\times \\frac{1 - 0.026}{0.3576} = 15 \\times \\frac{0.974}{0.3576} \\approx 15 \\times 2.72 \\approx 40.8 \\]\n\nNPV:\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + 40.8 = 0.8 \\] (still positive)\n\n**Option C: \u03b2 = 3.65**\n\n\\[ r = 8\\% + 3.65 \\times 8\\% = 8\\% + 29.2\\% = 37.2\\% \\]\n\nCalculate PV:\n\n\\[ PV = 15 \\times \\frac{1 - (1 + 0.372)^{-10}}{0.372} \\]\n\n\\[ (1.372)^{-10} \\approx 0.020 \\]\n\n\\[ PV = 15 \\times \\frac{1 - 0.020}{0.372} = 15 \\times \\frac{0.980}{0.372} \\approx 15 \\times 2.63 \\approx 39.45 \\]\n\nNPV:\n\n\\[ NPV = -40 + 39.45 = -0.55 \\] (negative)\n\n### Conclusion\nOption C (\u03b2 = 3.65) is the highest beta where NPV becomes negative. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 3.65.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\ 3.65} \\]"
