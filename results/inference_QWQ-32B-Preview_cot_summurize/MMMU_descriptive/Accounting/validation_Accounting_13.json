                    "text": "Conversion cost is a term used in cost accounting, particularly in manufacturing, to describe the total of direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs. It essentially represents the costs incurred to convert raw materials into finished goods.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Direct Labor**: This is the cost of the labor that is directly involved in the production process. In this case, it's given as $25,000.\n\n2. **Manufacturing Overhead**: These are indirect costs that are incurred in the production process but cannot be directly traced to a specific product. They include things like factory depreciation, factory utilities, and salaries of factory staff not directly involved in production.\n\nFrom the list provided:\n\n- Factory depreciation expense: $45,000\n\n- Factory utilities expense: $2,000\n\n- Payroll staff's salary: $15,000\n\nAssuming \"payroll staff's salary\" refers to the salaries of factory staff not directly involved in production, these would be considered part of manufacturing overhead.\n\nTherefore, total manufacturing overhead would be:\n\n$45,000 (depreciation) + $2,000 (utilities) + $15,000 (staff salary) = $62,000\n\nNow, conversion cost is direct labor plus manufacturing overhead:\n\n$25,000 (direct labor) + $62,000 (overhead) = $87,000\n\nHowever, none of the options match this total. Let's double-check the assumptions.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps \"payroll staff's salary\" does not include salaries directly involved in production. If that's the case, it might not be included in manufacturing overhead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only factory depreciation and utilities are considered overhead, and payroll staff's salary is treated differently.\n\nLet's consider another approach.\n\nSometimes, conversion cost is calculated as direct labor plus factory overhead, where factory overhead excludes non-factory costs.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the question expects only factory depreciation and utilities to be included in overhead.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nConversion cost = direct labor + factory overhead\n\nFactory overhead = factory depreciation + factory utilities = $45,000 + $2,000 = $47,000\n\nThen, conversion cost = $25,000 + $47,000 = $72,000\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. $52,000\n\nB. $62,000\n\nC. $72,000\n\nD. $82,000\n\nOption C matches this calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if payroll staff's salary is included in overhead, then:\n\nConversion cost = $25,000 + ($45,000 + $2,000 + $15,000) = $25,000 + $62,000 = $87,000\n\nWhich isn't an option.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that only factory depreciation and utilities are considered part of factory overhead for the purpose of calculating conversion cost in this context.\n\nHence, the answer should be $72,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
