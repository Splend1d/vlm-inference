                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand the behavior of manufacturing overhead costs, specifically how they change with the level of production. The key here is to distinguish between fixed and variable manufacturing overhead costs and see how they behave when production increases from 25,000 units to 30,000 units.\n\nFirst, let's identify the manufacturing overhead costs from the given data:\n\n- Indirect materials: $3\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: $6\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: $2\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit = Indirect materials + Fixed manufacturing overhead + Variable manufacturing overhead = $3 + $6 + $2 = $11\n\nHowever, the question is asking for the per unit manufacturing overhead costs when 30,000 units are produced. Since the relevant range is between 15,000 and 30,000 units, we can assume that the cost behavior remains the same within this range.\n\nNow, let's consider how these costs behave with changes in production volume:\n\n1. **Variable manufacturing overhead costs**: These costs vary directly with the level of production. So, if production increases from 25,000 to 30,000 units, the total variable manufacturing overhead will increase proportionally, but the per unit cost remains the same. Therefore, the variable manufacturing overhead per unit remains $2.\n\n2. **Fixed manufacturing overhead costs**: These costs remain constant in total within the relevant range, but the per unit cost changes inversely with the level of production. So, if production increases, the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead decreases.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units.\n\nFirst, find the total fixed manufacturing overhead at 25,000 units:\n\nTotal fixed manufacturing overhead = Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units \u00d7 Number of units = $6 \u00d7 25,000 = $150,000\n\nNow, since this total fixed cost remains the same within the relevant range, at 30,000 units, the per unit fixed manufacturing overhead is:\n\nPer unit fixed manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units = Total fixed manufacturing overhead / Number of units = $150,000 / 30,000 = $5\n\nNext, calculate the total per unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units:\n\nPer unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units = Indirect materials + Per unit fixed manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units + Variable manufacturing overhead\n\nAssuming indirect materials are treated as part of variable costs or fixed costs, but based on standard costing practices, indirect materials are often considered variable overhead. However, in this case, it's listed separately from variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nTo clarify, let's consider:\n\n- Indirect materials: $3 (likely variable)\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead: $6 at 25,000 units\n- Variable manufacturing overhead: $2\n\nBut the question is about manufacturing overhead costs, which typically include both fixed and variable overheads excluding direct materials and direct labor.\n\nSo, manufacturing overhead costs = Indirect materials + Fixed manufacturing overhead + Variable manufacturing overhead\n\nBut to avoid confusion, perhaps the indirect materials are considered part of the variable manufacturing overhead. In that case, total variable manufacturing overhead would be $3 (indirect materials) + $2 (other variable overhead) = $5 per unit.\n\nHowever, to stick with the given data, let's consider:\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units = Indirect materials ($3) + Fixed manufacturing overhead ($6) + Variable manufacturing overhead ($2) = $11\n\nBut when production increases to 30,000 units:\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead per unit remains $2\n- Indirect materials per unit remain $3 (assuming they are variable)\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit decreases to $5\n\nTherefore, total per unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units = $3 + $5 + $2 = $10\n\nWait, but this doesn't match any of the options provided (A. $6, B. $7, C. $8, D. $9). Perhaps I need to re-examine the cost components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indirect materials are considered fixed overhead. Let's try that.\n\nIf indirect materials are fixed overhead:\n\nThen, total fixed manufacturing overhead = Indirect materials ($3) + Fixed manufacturing overhead ($6) = $9 per unit at 25,000 units\n\nTotal fixed manufacturing overhead cost = $9 \u00d7 25,000 = $225,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $225,000 / 30,000 = $7.50\n\nAdding variable manufacturing overhead of $2, total manufacturing overhead per unit = $7.50 + $2 = $9.50\n\nBut $9.50 is not an option either.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider only the true fixed manufacturing overhead, excluding indirect materials.\n\nLet's consider that indirect materials are variable overhead.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Variable manufacturing overhead = Indirect materials ($3) + other variable overhead ($2) = $5 per unit\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead = $6 per unit at 25,000 units\n\nTotal fixed manufacturing overhead cost = $6 \u00d7 25,000 = $150,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $150,000 / 30,000 = $5\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units = Variable manufacturing overhead ($5) + fixed manufacturing overhead ($5) = $10\n\nAgain, $10 is not among the options.\n\nWait, maybe the question is only referring to manufacturing overhead excluding direct materials and direct labor, so:\n\nManufacturing overhead = Indirect materials + Fixed manufacturing overhead + Variable manufacturing overhead\n\nGiven that, at 25,000 units, it's $3 + $6 + $2 = $11 per unit\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead cost = $11 \u00d7 25,000 = $275,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, assuming variable costs stay proportional:\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead = ($3 + $2) \u00d7 30,000 = $5 \u00d7 30,000 = $150,000\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead remains $150,000\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead cost = $150,000 (variable) + $150,000 (fixed) = $300,000\n\nPer unit manufacturing overhead at 30,000 units = $300,000 / 30,000 = $10\n\nStill, $10 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed manufacturing overhead is different.\n\nWait, maybe the $6 is already the total fixed manufacturing overhead per unit within the relevant range, meaning it's already spread over the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed manufacturing overhead of $6 per unit at 25,000 units represents a total fixed cost of $150,000, and this remains the same up to 30,000 units.\n\nTherefore, at 30,000 units, fixed manufacturing overhead per unit = $150,000 / 30,000 = $5\n\nThen, variable manufacturing overhead remains $2 per unit\n\nIndirect materials are $3 per unit (assuming variable)\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead = $5 (fixed) + $2 (variable) + $3 (indirect materials) = $10\n\nBut again, $10 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps indirect materials are considered fixed, and the $6 is separate fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nThen, total fixed manufacturing overhead = $6 + $3 = $9 per unit at 25,000 units\n\nTotal fixed cost = $9 \u00d7 25,000 = $225,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $225,000 / 30,000 = $7.50\n\nAdd variable manufacturing overhead of $2\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead = $7.50 + $2 = $9.50\n\nWhich rounds to $10, but the options don't include $10. Maybe it's a typo or misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only fixed manufacturing overhead is considered, excluding indirect materials.\n\nThen, fixed manufacturing overhead is $6 per unit at 25,000 units, total fixed cost = $150,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $150,000 / 30,000 = $5\n\nSo, per unit manufacturing overhead is $5\n\nBut that's option A, which seems too low compared to the initial $6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for total per unit manufacturing overhead, including both fixed and variable components.\n\nIn that case, at 30,000 units:\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit: $5\n- Variable manufacturing overhead per unit: $2\n- Indirect materials: $3\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead: $5 + $2 + $3 = $10\n\nBut $10 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps indirect materials are considered part of variable manufacturing overhead, so total variable manufacturing overhead is $3 (indirect materials) + $2 (other variable overhead) = $5 per unit\n\nThen, at 30,000 units:\n\n- Fixed manufacturing overhead per unit: $5\n- Variable manufacturing overhead per unit: $5\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead: $5 + $5 = $10\n\nStill, $10 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps fixed manufacturing overhead includes indirect materials, and variable manufacturing overhead is only $2.\n\nThen, total fixed manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units is $6 + $3 = $9\n\nTotal fixed cost = $9 \u00d7 25,000 = $225,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $225,000 / 30,000 = $7.50\n\nAdd variable manufacturing overhead of $2\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead = $7.50 + $2 = $9.50, which is closest to option D, $9.\n\nPerhaps the answer is D. $9.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that indirect materials are variable, and fixed manufacturing overhead is only $6 per unit at 25,000 units.\n\nThen, total fixed manufacturing overhead = $6 \u00d7 25,000 = $150,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $150,000 / 30,000 = $5\n\nAdd variable manufacturing overhead of $2 + $3 (indirect materials) = $5\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead = $5 (fixed) + $5 (variable) = $10\n\nBut $10 is not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the indirect materials are considered part of fixed manufacturing overhead.\n\nThen, total fixed manufacturing overhead per unit at 25,000 units is $6 (fixed manufacturing overhead) + $3 (indirect materials) = $9\n\nTotal fixed cost = $9 \u00d7 25,000 = $225,000\n\nAt 30,000 units, per unit fixed manufacturing overhead = $225,000 / 30,000 = $7.50\n\nAdd variable manufacturing overhead of $2\n\nTotal per unit manufacturing overhead = $7.50 + $2 = $9.50, which is closest to $9.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely D. $9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nD. $9"
