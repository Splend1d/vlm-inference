                    "text": "I have this problem here involving two portfolios, X and Y, with given expected returns and betas. The risk-free rate is 8%, and both portfolios are well-diversified. I need to determine whether these portfolios are in equilibrium, offer an arbitrage opportunity, are both underpriced, or are both fairly priced.\n\nFirst, I should recall what equilibrium means in this context. In portfolio theory, particularly with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), equilibrium suggests that the expected return of a portfolio is appropriately compensated for its systematic risk, as measured by beta. The CAPM formula is:\n\nExpected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)\n\nGiven that, I can use this formula to check if the expected returns of portfolios X and Y are consistent with their betas.\n\nBut wait, I don't have the market return specified here. Hmm. Maybe I can still make some comparisons.\n\nLet me list out the given data:\n\n- Portfolio X: Expected Return = 16%, Beta = 1.00\n\n- Portfolio Y: Expected Return = 12%, Beta = 0.25\n\n- Risk-Free Rate = 8%\n\nSince both portfolios are well-diversified, I can assume that their returns are driven by market beta, according to CAPM.\n\nLet me consider the Sharpe ratio, which measures the risk-adjusted return. However, the Sharpe ratio typically requires the standard deviation, not beta. Maybe that's not the right approach here.\n\nAlternatively, I can look at the relationship between expected return and beta for each portfolio and see if they align with what CAPM suggests.\n\nLet me assume that the market portfolio has a beta of 1.0, which is standard. So, Portfolio X has a beta of 1.00 and an expected return of 16%, while Portfolio Y has a beta of 0.25 and an expected return of 12%.\n\nIf I could find the market return, I could plug it into the CAPM formula and see if the expected returns match.\n\nLet me try to solve for the market return using Portfolio X.\n\nUsing CAPM for Portfolio X:\n\n16% = 8% + 1.00 * (Market Return - 8%)\n\nSolving for Market Return:\n\n16% - 8% = Market Return - 8%\n\n8% = Market Return - 8%\n\nMarket Return = 16%\n\nNow, let's check if this market return makes sense for Portfolio Y.\n\nUsing CAPM for Portfolio Y:\n\nExpected Return = 8% + 0.25 * (16% - 8%)\n\n= 8% + 0.25 * 8%\n\n= 8% + 2%\n\n= 10%\n\nBut Portfolio Y's actual expected return is 12%, not 10%. So, according to CAPM, Portfolio Y is offering a higher expected return than what its beta suggests it should.\n\nSimilarly, for Portfolio X, the expected return is 16%, which matches the CAPM required return when Market Return is 16%.\n\nSo, Portfolio X is fairly priced, but Portfolio Y is overperforming relative to its beta.\n\nWait, but the question says both are well-diversified portfolios, and the risk-free rate is 8%.\n\nGiven that, and based on CAPM, Portfolio X is fairly priced, but Portfolio Y is offering a higher return than it should for its level of beta.\n\nSo, Portfolio Y seems to be underpriced, meaning it's offering a higher return for its level of risk.\n\nBut the question asks about both portfolios together. Let's see what the options are:\n\nA. Are in equilibrium.\n\nB. Offer an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nC. Are both underpriced.\n\nD. Are both fairly priced.\n\nOption A: Are in equilibrium.\n\nEquilibrium would mean that expected returns are in line with their betas according to CAPM. But since Portfolio Y is offering a higher return than its beta suggests, it's not in equilibrium.\n\nOption B: Offer an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nArbitrage would involve exploiting mispricings to make a riskless profit. If Portfolio Y is overperforming relative to its beta, one could invest in Y and perhaps hedge appropriately to capture excess returns.\n\nOption C: Are both underpriced.\n\nUnderpriced would mean that both portfolios are offering higher returns than their betas suggest, but Portfolio X is matching its required return, so only Y is underpriced.\n\nOption D: Are both fairly priced.\n\nSince Portfolio Y is not matching its required return according to CAPM, they are not both fairly priced.\n\nGiven this analysis, option B seems plausible because there might be an arbitrage opportunity due to the mispricing of Portfolio Y.\n\nBut let me think deeper. If Portfolio Y has a beta of 0.25 and is offering a 12% expected return when CAPM suggests it should be 10%, that's a positive anomaly.\n\nSimilarly, Portfolio X is fairly priced.\n\nOne could consider borrowing at the risk-free rate, investing in Portfolio Y, and achieving a higher return than the risk-free rate plus the beta-adjusted market risk premium.\n\nHowever, since Portfolio X is fairly priced, and Portfolio Y is overperforming, perhaps one could construct a portfolio that combines them to exploit the mispricing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps shorting Portfolio X and going long on Portfolio Y could capture the difference.\n\nBut I need to be careful because both are well-diversified portfolios, and the only difference is in their expected returns and betas.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I can think in terms of the Security Market Line (SML). The SML plots expected return against beta, and in equilibrium, all portfolios should lie on the SML.\n\nHere, Portfolio X lies on the SML, while Portfolio Y lies above it, suggesting it's overperforming.\n\nIn such a case, theoretically, one could sell Portfolio X (which is fairly priced) and buy Portfolio Y (which is underpriced, but offering a higher return), to capture the excess return.\n\nBut is this arbitrage? It might be, because you're getting more return for less risk.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's not pure arbitrage because market conditions could change.\n\nBut given the information provided, it seems that there's an opportunity to exploit the mispricing between Y and X.\n\nTherefore, option B, \"Offer an arbitrage opportunity,\" seems to be the most appropriate conclusion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
