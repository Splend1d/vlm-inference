materials: $5\n\nVariable overhead: $2\n\nTotal: $17\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nMaybe indirect materials are mixed costs, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only fixed manufacturing overhead is fixed, and indirect materials and variable manufacturing overhead are variable.\n\nIn this case:\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: $10 per unit (at 15,000 units)\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: $2 per unit\n\nIndirect materials: $3 per unit\n\nTotal: $10 + $2 + $3 = $15\n\nBut options don't have $15.\n\nWait, maybe the question is only asking for manufacturing overhead costs, which might exclude indirect materials.\n\nIn some cost classifications, manufacturing overhead excludes direct materials and direct labor, but includes indirect materials.\n\nHowever, to be precise, we need to see the company's cost classification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers manufacturing overhead as only fixed manufacturing overhead and variable manufacturing overhead, excluding indirect materials.\n\nIn this case:\n\nFixed manufacturing overhead: $10 per unit\n\nVariable manufacturing overhead: $2 per unit\n\nTotal manufacturing overhead per unit: $12\n\nWhich matches option C.\n\nBut this assumes that indirect materials are not part of manufacturing overhead, which might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, if indirect materials are included in manufacturing overhead, then total would be $10 + $2 + $3 = $15, which is not an option.\n\nPerhaps the question considers only fixed manufacturing overhead and variable manufacturing overhead as manufacturing overhead, excluding indirect materials.\n\nIn that case, total manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units would be $10 (fixed) + $2 (variable) = $12, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fixed selling and administrative expenses and variable sales commissions are not part of manufacturing overhead, which is correct.\n\nSo, manufacturing overhead typically includes fixed and variable manufacturing overhead, but not selling or administrative costs.\n\nTherefore, total manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units would be $10 (fixed) + $2 (variable) = $12, which is option C.\n\nHowever, indirect materials are usually considered part of manufacturing overhead.\n\nIf we include indirect materials as part of manufacturing overhead, then total would be $10 (fixed) + $2 (variable) + $3 (indirect materials), which is $15, but that's not an option.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question considers only fixed and variable manufacturing overhead as manufacturing overhead, excluding indirect materials.\n\nIn that case, answer would be $12, option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the question or the options.\n\nBut based on standard cost accounting, manufacturing overhead includes indirect materials, indirect labor, and other manufacturing costs not directly attributable to production.\n\nTherefore, indirect materials should be included in manufacturing overhead.\n\nIf that's the case, then total manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units would be $10 (fixed) + $2 (variable) + $3 (indirect materials) = $15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is only considering fixed and variable manufacturing overhead.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed manufacturing overhead of $6 per unit at 25,000 units includes indirect materials, and variable manufacturing overhead is only $2.\n\nIn this case, total fixed manufacturing overhead per unit at 15,000 units would be $10, as calculated earlier, and variable manufacturing overhead remains $2, totaling $12 per unit.\n\nThis aligns with option C.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I would go with option C, $12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nc. $12\n"
