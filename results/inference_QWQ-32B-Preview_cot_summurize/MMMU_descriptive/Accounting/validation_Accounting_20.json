                    "text": "I'm a bit confused about this question. It mentions a multifactor (APT) model and provides a table with betas for two factors and expected returns for two portfolios. But the question is about finding the expected rate of return on a particular stock, given that T-bills offer a 6% yield and the stock is fairly priced. I need to connect these pieces of information to find the correct expected return on the stock.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is. APT is a model that describes the relationship between expected returns and several macroeconomic factors. The expected return on an asset is a linear function of its sensitivities to these factors, represented by its betas.\n\nThe general form of the APT model is:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_{i1} \\lambda_1 + \\beta_{i2} \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\beta_{in} \\lambda_n \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on asset i.\n\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta_{i1}, \\beta_{i2}, \\dots, \\beta_{in} \\) are the sensitivities of asset i to the n factors.\n\n- \\( \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_n \\) are the risk premiums associated with the n factors.\n\nIn this problem, there are two factors, \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\), so the model becomes:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_{i1} \\lambda_1 + \\beta_{i2} \\lambda_2 \\]\n\nWe are given that T-bills offer a 6% yield, which I assume is the risk-free rate, so \\( R_f = 6\\% \\).\n\nWe need to find the expected return on a particular stock, assuming it's fairly priced. Since the stock is fairly priced, its expected return should be consistent with the APT model given the risk-free rate and its betas to the factors.\n\nHowever, the table provided shows two portfolios, A and B, with their betas on \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\), and their expected returns. I think these portfolios can be used to solve for the factor risk premiums, \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\), which can then be used to find the expected return on the stock.\n\nLet's set up equations based on the APT model for portfolios A and B.\n\nFor Portfolio A:\n\n\\[ 31\\% = 6\\% + 1.5 \\lambda_1 + 2.0 \\lambda_2 \\]\n\nFor Portfolio B:\n\n\\[ 27\\% = 6\\% + 2.2 \\lambda_1 - 0.2 \\lambda_2 \\]\n\nWe can simplify these equations:\n\nFor Portfolio A:\n\n\\[ 31\\% - 6\\% = 1.5 \\lambda_1 + 2.0 \\lambda_2 \\]\n\n\\[ 25\\% = 1.5 \\lambda_1 + 2.0 \\lambda_2 \\]\n\nFor Portfolio B:\n\n\\[ 27\\% - 6\\% = 2.2 \\lambda_1 - 0.2 \\lambda_2 \\]\n\n\\[ 21\\% = 2.2 \\lambda_1 - 0.2 \\lambda_2 \\]\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (\\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\)):\n\n1. \\( 1.5 \\lambda_1 + 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 25\\% \\)\n\n2. \\( 2.2 \\lambda_1 - 0.2 \\lambda_2 = 21\\% \\)\n\nI need to solve for \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\).\n\nLet's use the method of elimination or substitution. I'll use elimination.\n\nFirst, I can multiply the first equation by 0.2 and the second equation by 2.0 to make the coefficients of \\( \\lambda_2 \\) opposites:\n\nFirst equation multiplied by 0.2:\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 0.2 \\lambda_1 + 2.0 \\times 0.2 \\lambda_2 = 25\\% \\times 0.2 \\]\n\n\\[ 0.3 \\lambda_1 + 0.4 \\lambda_2 = 5\\% \\]\n\nSecond equation multiplied by 2.0:\n\n\\[ 2.2 \\times 2.0 \\lambda_1 - 0.2 \\times 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 21\\% \\times 2.0 \\]\n\n\\[ 4.4 \\lambda_1 - 0.4 \\lambda_2 = 42\\% \\]\n\nNow, add these two equations together to eliminate \\( \\lambda_2 \\):\n\n\\[ (0.3 \\lambda_1 + 4.4 \\lambda_1) + (0.4 \\lambda_2 - 0.4 \\lambda_2) = 5\\% + 42\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 4.7 \\lambda_1 = 47\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{47\\%}{4.7} \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda_1 = 10\\% \\]\n\nNow that I have \\( \\lambda_1 = 10\\% \\), I can plug this back into one of the original equations to solve for \\( \\lambda_2 \\). Let's use the first simplified equation:\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\lambda_1 + 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 25\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 1.5 \\times 10\\% + 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 25\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 15\\% + 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 25\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 25\\% - 15\\% \\]\n\n\\[ 2.0 \\lambda_2 = 10\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda_2 = 5\\% \\]\n\nSo, \\( \\lambda_1 = 10\\% \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 5\\% \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the expected return on the particular stock, given its betas to \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\). However, the problem doesn't specify the stock's betas. It only provides betas for portfolios A and B.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the question. Let's look back.\n\n\"The image shows a table with three columns and two rows. The columns are labeled \"Portfolio,\" \"Beta on \\( F_1 \\),\" \"Beta on \\( F_2 \\),\" and \"Expected Return.\" The rows correspond to two portfolios, labeled \"A\" and \"B.\"\n\n- For Portfolio A:\n\n- Beta on \\( F_1 \\): 1.5\n\n- Beta on \\( F_2 \\): 2.0\n\n- Expected Return: 31%\n\n- For Portfolio B:\n\n- Beta on \\( F_1 \\): 2.2\n\n- Beta on \\( F_2 \\): -0.2\n\n- Expected Return: 27%\"\n\nThen, the question is:\n\n\"Consider the following multifactor (APT) model of security returns for a particular stock. If T-bills currently offer a 6% yield, find the expected rate of return on this stock if the market views the stock as fairly priced.\"\n\nIt seems that the table provides information about two portfolios, but the question is about a particular stock. Maybe the stock's betas are different and need to be provided or inferred.\n\nWait, perhaps the stock's betas are given elsewhere, but they're not included in the description. Let me check again.\n\nAh, the description says: \"Consider the following multifactor (APT) model of security returns for a particular stock.\" but doesn't provide the stock's betas. It only provides the betas and expected returns for portfolios A and B.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the stock's betas are the same as one of the portfolios, or perhaps I need to use the information from the portfolios to find the stock's expected return.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock's betas are implied or can be derived from the portfolios.\n\nWait, perhaps the stock is a combination of portfolios A and B. But without knowing the weights, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has betas of 1.0 for both \\( F_1 \\) and \\( F_2 \\), but that's just a guess.\n\nI think I need to assume that the stock has betas \\( \\beta_1 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 \\), and then use the APT model to find its expected return.\n\nBut without knowing the stock's betas, I can't compute its expected return.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the stock has betas similar to one of the portfolios, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the stock's betas are implied by the market being in equilibrium, meaning that the expected returns are consistent with the APT model using the factor risk premiums we've already calculated.\n\nGiven that, and knowing \\( \\lambda_1 = 10\\% \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 5\\% \\), and the risk-free rate is 6%, the expected return for the stock would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + \\beta_{i1} \\times 10\\% + \\beta_{i2} \\times 5\\% \\]\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( \\beta_{i1} \\) and \\( \\beta_{i2} \\), I can't compute \\( E(R_i) \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the stock has betas equal to the average of portfolios A and B.\n\nLet's calculate the average betas:\n\nAverage \\( \\beta_1 \\): \\( \\frac{1.5 + 2.2}{2} = 1.85 \\)\n\nAverage \\( \\beta_2 \\): \\( \\frac{2.0 + (-0.2)}{2} = 0.9 \\)\n\nThen, the expected return would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.85 \\times 10\\% + 0.9 \\times 5\\% \\]\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 18.5\\% + 4.5\\% \\]\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 29\\% \\]\n\nBut that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has betas equal to portfolio A or B. If I assume the stock is portfolio A, its expected return is 31%, which isn't an option. If it's portfolio B, it's 27%, which is option B, but the question is about a particular stock, not portfolio B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock has different betas.\n\nWait, maybe the stock has \\( \\beta_1 = 1.0 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 1.0 \\), which is a common assumption for a \"market portfolio.\" Then:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.0 \\times 10\\% + 1.0 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 10\\% + 5\\% = 21\\% \\]\n\nBut that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock has \\( \\beta_1 = 1.5 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 1.0 \\), for example. Then:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.5 \\times 10\\% + 1.0 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 15\\% + 5\\% = 26\\% \\]\n\nStill not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has \\( \\beta_1 = 2.0 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 0.0 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 2.0 \\times 10\\% + 0.0 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 20\\% + 0\\% = 26\\% \\]\n\nAgain, not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the stock has \\( \\beta_1 = 1.2 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 1.5 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.2 \\times 10\\% + 1.5 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 12\\% + 7.5\\% = 25.5\\% \\]\n\nStill not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stock has \\( \\beta_1 = 1.1 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 1.0 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.1 \\times 10\\% + 1.0 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 11\\% + 5\\% = 22\\% \\]\n\nNot an option.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the stock's betas can be derived from the information given about portfolios A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to use the CAPM, not the APT, but that doesn't make sense because it specifically mentions the APT.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock is a combination of the risk-free asset and the market portfolio, but again, without knowing the stock's betas, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that the stock has betas of 1.0 for both factors, which would make its expected return:\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.0 \\times 10\\% + 1.0 \\times 5\\% = 21\\% \\]\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock has betas equal to the weighted average of portfolios A and B, but without knowing the weights, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the information from portfolios A and B to solve for the stock's expected return directly.\n\nWait, perhaps the stock is a combination of portfolios A and B in some proportion, and I need to find the expected return accordingly.\n\nSuppose the stock is a combination of A and B, with weights \\( w_A \\) and \\( w_B \\), where \\( w_A + w_B = 1 \\).\n\nThen, the stock's betas would be:\n\n\\[ \\beta_{stock,1} = w_A \\times 1.5 + w_B \\times 2.2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta_{stock,2} = w_A \\times 2.0 + w_B \\times (-0.2) \\]\n\nAnd its expected return would be:\n\n\\[ E(R_{stock}) = w_A \\times 31\\% + w_B \\times 27\\% \\]\n\nBut without knowing \\( w_A \\) and \\( w_B \\), I can't compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stock's expected return can be expressed in terms of the factor risk premiums without knowing its specific betas.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the stock is fairly priced, meaning that its expected return is equal to the APT model's prediction based on its betas and the factor risk premiums.\n\nBut without knowing the stock's betas, I can't compute its expected return.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the stock has betas equal to the market portfolio, but again, without knowing what that is, I'm stuck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to use the fact that the difference in expected returns between portfolios A and B can be attributed to their differences in betas.\n\nLet me see:\n\nPortfolio A: \\( \\beta_{1A} = 1.5 \\), \\( \\beta_{2A} = 2.0 \\), \\( E(R_A) = 31\\% \\)\n\nPortfolio B: \\( \\beta_{1B} = 2.2 \\), \\( \\beta_{2B} = -0.2 \\), \\( E(R_B) = 27\\% \\)\n\nDifference:\n\n\\( \\Delta \\beta_1 = 2.2 - 1.5 = 0.7 \\)\n\n\\( \\Delta \\beta_2 = -0.2 - 2.0 = -2.2 \\)\n\n\\( \\Delta E(R) = 27\\% - 31\\% = -4\\% \\)\n\nSo, the change in expected return is related to the change in betas by:\n\n\\( -4\\% = 0.7 \\lambda_1 + (-2.2) \\lambda_2 \\)\n\nBut I already have equations for \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) from earlier, so this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the stock's betas are such that its expected return matches one of the options.\n\nLet me look at the options:\n\nA. 17.4%\n\nB. 18.1%\n\nC. 18.5%\n\nSuppose the stock has \\( \\beta_1 = 1.2 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 0.5 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 1.2 \\times 10\\% + 0.5 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 12\\% + 2.5\\% = 20.5\\% \\]\n\nNot an option.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( \\beta_1 = 0.8 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 0.6 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 0.8 \\times 10\\% + 0.6 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 8\\% + 3\\% = 17\\% \\]\n\nClose to option A (17.4%), but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( \\beta_1 = 0.85 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 0.7 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 0.85 \\times 10\\% + 0.7 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 8.5\\% + 3.5\\% = 18\\% \\]\n\nClose to option B (18.1%), but still not exact.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( \\beta_1 = 0.9 \\) and \\( \\beta_2 = 0.7 \\):\n\n\\[ E(R_i) = 6\\% + 0.9 \\times 10\\% + 0.7 \\times 5\\% = 6\\% + 9\\% + 3.5\\% = 18."
