The table is organized into columns for each company and rows for different financial metrics. Here is the detailed description:\n\n- **QuickBrush:**\n  - Beta: 1.35\n  - Market price: $45.00\n  - Intrinsic value: $63.00\n\n- **SmileWhite:**\n  - Beta: 1.15\n  - Market price: $30.00\n  - Intrinsic value: ?\n\n**Notes:**\n- Risk-free rate: 4.50%\n- Expected market return: 14.50%\n\nThe task is to calculate the required rate of return for SmileWhite using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The formula for CAPM is:\n\\[ \\text{Required Rate of Return} = \\text{Risk-Free Rate} + (\\text{Beta} \\times (\\text{Expected Market Return} - \\text{Risk-Free Rate})) \\]\n\nUsing the given values:\n- Risk-Free Rate = 4.50%\n- Beta for SmileWhite = 1.15\n- Expected Market Return = 14.50%\n\nPlugging these values into the CAPM formula:\n\\[ \\text{Required Rate of Return} = 4.50\\% + (1.15 \\times (14.50\\% - 4.50\\%)) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Required Rate of Return} = 4.50\\% + (1.15 \\times 10\\%) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Required Rate of Return} = 4.50\\% + 11.50\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Required Rate of Return} = 16\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the required rate of return for SmileWhite is 16%.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nJanet Ludlow's firm requires all its analysts to use a two-stage dividend discount model (DDM) and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to value stocks. Using the CAPM and DDM, Ludlow has valued QuickBrush Company at $63 per share. She now must value SmileWhite Corporation.  Calculate the required rate of return for SmileWhite by using the information in the following table:.<image 1> \n\nA. 14%\nB. 15%\nC. 16%\n"
