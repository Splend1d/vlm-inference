Among the items listed, the sales revenue is stated as $3,100,000. The question asks for the total revenue, and the options provided are:\n\nA. $3,100,000\nB. $2,616,000\nC. $2,474,000\nD. $484,000\n\nIn financial statements, revenue typically refers to the income generated from the core business activities, which in this case is sales revenue from selling patio furniture. Unless otherwise specified, total revenue in this context would be the sales revenue.\n\nLooking at the list provided:\n\n- Sales revenue: $3,100,000\n\nThe other items listed are expenses or costs:\n\n- Straight-line depreciation on office equipment: $90,000\n- Advertising and marketing expense: $625,000\n- Administrative salaries: $136,000\n- Cost of goods sold: $1,700,000\n- Rent on corporate headquarters: $65,000\n\nThese are all subtracted from the revenue to calculate net income, but they are not part of the revenue itself.\n\nTherefore, the total revenue for Hicks Products in 2017 is $3,100,000, which corresponds to option A.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that sometimes \"total revenue\" might include other income sources beyond sales revenue, such as interest income or gains from investments. But based on the information provided in the description, there are no other revenue sources mentioned besides sales revenue.\n\nMoreover, the description explicitly states: \"Based on this information, the total revenue for Hicks Products in 2017 is $3,100,000.\" This reinforces that sales revenue is the only revenue figure provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. $3,100,000.\n\nBut to ensure there is no misunderstanding, let's consider if any of the other options could make sense in a different context.\n\nOption B: $2,616,000\n\nThis could be calculated by subtracting some of the expenses from the sales revenue. For example:\n\n$3,100,000 (sales revenue) - $1,700,000 (cost of goods sold) = $1,400,000\n\nThen, subtracting the remaining expenses:\n\n$1,400,000 - $90,000 (depreciation) - $625,000 (advertising) - $136,000 (administrative salaries) - $65,000 (rent) = $1,400,000 - $90,000 = $1,310,000\n\n$1,310,000 - $625,000 = $685,000\n\n$685,000 - $136,000 = $549,000\n\n$549,000 - $65,000 = $484,000\n\nWait, that leads to option D. $484,000, which seems to be net income, not total revenue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps option B is calculated differently, but it's not immediately clear how $2,616,000 is derived from the given figures.\n\nOption C: $2,474,000\n\nSimilarly, this doesn't align with any straightforward calculation based on the provided data.\n\nOption D: $484,000\n\nAs shown in the earlier calculation, this might represent net income after subtracting all the expenses from sales revenue.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for total revenue, which should be $3,100,000, as per the description.\n\nIt's possible that the question is testing whether the student can distinguish between revenue and net income or other financial metrics. But based on the information given, total revenue is clearly $3,100,000.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A. $3,100,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
