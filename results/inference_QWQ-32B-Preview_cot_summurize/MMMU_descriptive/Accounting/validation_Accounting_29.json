Each option has four parameters listed: time to maturity (T), strike price (X), current stock price (S), and the price of the option. The details for each option are as follows:\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - Time to maturity (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Current stock price (S): $55\n  - Price of the option: $10\n\n- **Option B**:\n  - Time to maturity (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Current stock price (S): $55\n  - Price of the option: $12\n\nThe risk-free interest rate is assumed to be 6%, and it is stated that the stocks on which these options are written pay no dividends.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nYou are asked to compare two options with parameters as given.

                    "text": "To determine which call option is written on the stock with higher volatility, we need to understand the relationship between option prices and volatility. Generally, higher volatility leads to higher option prices because there is more uncertainty and potential for the stock price to move significantly.\n\nGiven that both options have the same time to maturity (T = 0.5 years), the same strike price (X = $50), and the same current stock price (S = $55), the difference in their prices ($10 for Option A and $12 for Option B) suggests that Option B is more expensive. This higher price for Option B implies that it is written on a stock with higher volatility.\n\nTo confirm this, we can use the Black-Scholes model for pricing European call options. The Black-Scholes formula for a call option is:\n\n\\[ C = S N(d_1) - X e^{-rT} N(d_2) \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( C \\) is the call option price\n\n- \\( S \\) is the current stock price\n\n- \\( X \\) is the strike price\n\n- \\( r \\) is the risk-free interest rate\n\n- \\( T \\) is the time to maturity\n\n- \\( N(\\cdot) \\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n\n- \\( d_1 = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S}{X}\\right) + \\left(r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right) T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} \\)\n\n- \\( d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T} \\)\n\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the volatility of the stock's returns\n\nGiven that all parameters except for the option price and volatility are the same for both options, the option with the higher price must correspond to a higher volatility.\n\nLet's denote the volatility for Option A as \\( \\sigma_A \\) and for Option B as \\( \\sigma_B \\). Since Option B is more expensive ($12 vs. $10), it must be that \\( \\sigma_B > \\sigma_A \\). Therefore, Option B is written on the stock with higher volatility.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
