If the NPV is positive or zero, accepting the offer would be beneficial. If it's negative, I should decline.\n\nFirst, let's list out the cash flows:\n\n- Year 0: +$9,400 (initial inflow)\n\n- Year 1: -$4,500\n\n- Year 2: -$3,100\n\n- Year 3: -$2,400\n\n- Year 4: -$1,800\n\nThe formula for NPV is:\n\n\\[ NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( CF_t \\) is the cash flow at time t\n\n- \\( r \\) is the discount rate\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time period\n\nGiven that the discount rate \\( r \\) is 10%, or 0.10.\n\nLet's calculate the present value of each cash flow:\n\n1. For Year 0:\n\n\\[ PV_0 = \\frac{9,400}{(1+0.10)^0} = \\frac{9,400}{1} = 9,400 \\]\n\n2. For Year 1:\n\n\\[ PV_1 = \\frac{-4,500}{(1+0.10)^1} = \\frac{-4,500}{1.10} \\approx -4,090.91 \\]\n\n3. For Year 2:\n\n\\[ PV_2 = \\frac{-3,100}{(1+0.10)^2} = \\frac{-3,100}{1.21} \\approx -2,561.98 \\]\n\n4. For Year 3:\n\n\\[ PV_3 = \\frac{-2,400}{(1+0.10)^3} = \\frac{-2,400}{1.331} \\approx -1,803.15 \\]\n\n5. For Year 4:\n\n\\[ PV_4 = \\frac{-1,800}{(1+0.10)^4} = \\frac{-1,800}{1.4641} \\approx -1,229.49 \\]\n\nNow, sum up all the present values to get the NPV:\n\n\\[ NPV = PV_0 + PV_1 + PV_2 + PV_3 + PV_4 \\]\n\n\\[ NPV = 9,400 - 4,090.91 - 2,561.98 - 1,803.15 - 1,229.49 \\]\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\nFirst, add the positive cash flow:\n\n\\[ 9,400 \\]\n\nThen, subtract the negative cash flows one by one:\n\n\\[ 9,400 - 4,090.91 = 5,309.09 \\]\n\n\\[ 5,309.09 - 2,561.98 = 2,747.11 \\]\n\n\\[ 2,747.11 - 1,803.15 = 943.96 \\]\n\n\\[ 943.96 - 1,229.49 = -285.53 \\]\n\nSo, the NPV is approximately -\\$285.53.\n\nSince the NPV is negative, accepting the offer would result in a loss. Therefore, I should not accept this offer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B. \\ No} \\]\n\n\n"
