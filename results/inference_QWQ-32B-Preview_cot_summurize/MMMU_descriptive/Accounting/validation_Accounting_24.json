                    "text": "I've got this question here about two stocks, A and B, and their index model regression results. There's a lot of data provided, and I need to calculate something called the \"information ratio.\" But first, I need to make sure I understand all the terms and what's being asked.\n\nLet's start by looking at the data for each stock:\n\n**Stock A:**\n\n- Index model regression estimate: 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f)\n\n- R-square: 0.576\n\n- Residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e): 10.3%\n\n- Standard deviation of excess returns: 21.6%\n\n**Stock B:**\n\n- Index model regression estimate: 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f)\n\n- R-square: 0.436\n\n- Residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e): 19.1%\n\n- Standard deviation of excess returns: 24.9%\n\nAdditional information:\n\n- Risk-free rate (r_f): 6%\n\n- Market's average return (r_M): 14%\n\nPerformance is measured using an index model regression on excess returns.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the information ratio is. I think it's a measure used in finance to evaluate the skill of an investment manager. It compares the active return (the return above the benchmark) to the active risk (the volatility of those excess returns). The formula for the information ratio is:\n\nInformation Ratio = (Expected Active Return) / (Active Risk)\n\nWhere:\n\n- Expected Active Return = Expected excess return of the portfolio minus expected excess return of the benchmark.\n\n- Active Risk = Standard deviation of the active returns.\n\nBut in the context of the index model regression, I might need to approach this differently. Let's see.\n\nThe index model regression estimate provided is in the form:\n\nR_i - r_f = \u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i\n\nWhere:\n\n- R_i is the return of the stock.\n\n- r_f is the risk-free rate.\n\n- r_M is the market return.\n\n- \u03b1_i is the intercept (often interpreted as abnormal return).\n\n- \u03b2_i is the slope coefficient (systematic risk).\n\n- e_i is the residual or idiosyncratic risk.\n\nGiven that, I need to relate this to the information ratio.\n\nWait, actually, the information ratio in the context of the index model might be related to the information coefficient, but I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look it up, but since I'm supposed to answer this based on the given data, I'll try to infer it.\n\nLooking at the options, there are two numbers for each choice, perhaps corresponding to the information ratios of Stock A and Stock B.\n\nLet me consider the Sharpe ratio first, which is a similar concept. The Sharpe ratio is the excess return per unit of deviation in the investment. But the information ratio is specifically about the active return per unit of active risk.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to calculate the active return and active risk for each stock relative to the market.\n\nActive return = R_i - r_M\n\nActive risk = Standard deviation of (R_i - r_M)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's exactly correct in this context.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information ratio is related to the alpha and the residual standard deviation in the regression model.\n\nI recall that the alpha (\u03b1) represents the abnormal return, and the residual standard deviation (\u03c3(e)) represents the unsystematic risk.\n\nSo, maybe the information ratio is alpha divided by the residual standard deviation.\n\nInformation Ratio = \u03b1 / \u03c3(e)\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf I look at the regression equation:\n\nR_i - r_f = \u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i\n\nThen, the expected excess return of the stock is \u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f)\n\nThe benchmark excess return is r_M - r_f\n\nTherefore, the expected active return is:\n\nExpected Active Return = [\u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f)] - (r_M - r_f) = \u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)(r_M - r_f)\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I need to consider that the benchmark is the market, so the expected active return is simply \u03b1_i, assuming that \u03b2_i measures the sensitivity to the market.\n\nAs for the active risk, perhaps it's the residual standard deviation, \u03c3(e).\n\nTherefore, Information Ratio = \u03b1_i / \u03c3(e)\n\nBut I need to make sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information ratio is calculated using the IC (information coefficient) and the square root of the number of periods, but that seems unrelated here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the slope to the standard error of the estimate.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider the definition of the information ratio again.\n\nInformation Ratio = (Mean Active Return) / (Standard Deviation of Active Return)\n\nWhere active return is the difference between the portfolio return and the benchmark return.\n\nIn this case, the benchmark is the market, so active return = R_i - r_M\n\nBut in the regression, we have R_i - r_f = \u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i\n\nSo, R_i - r_M = (\u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i) - (r_M - r_f) = \u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)(r_M - r_f) + e_i\n\nTherefore, the mean active return is E[R_i - r_M] = \u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)(E[r_M] - r_f)\n\nGiven that E[r_M] - r_f is the market risk premium, which is 14% - 6% = 8%.\n\nSo, Mean Active Return = \u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)*8%\n\nAnd the standard deviation of active return is the standard deviation of (R_i - r_M), which is the standard deviation of [\u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)(r_M - r_f) + e_i]\n\nSince \u03b1_i is a constant, and assuming (r_M - r_f) is a known quantity, the standard deviation would mainly come from the residual e_i, which has a standard deviation of \u03c3(e).\n\nTherefore, Standard Deviation of Active Return \u2248 \u03c3(e)\n\nSo, Information Ratio \u2248 [\u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)*8%] / \u03c3(e)\n\nWait, but in the regression, \u03b1_i is estimated, and it's already accounting for the average abnormal return. So, perhaps the mean active return is simply \u03b1_i, and the standard deviation of active return is \u03c3(e).\n\nTherefore, Information Ratio = \u03b1_i / \u03c3(e)\n\nLet me check this with the given data.\n\nFor Stock A:\n\n- \u03b1_i = 1%\n\n- \u03c3(e) = 10.3%\n\nSo, Information Ratio = 1% / 10.3% \u2248 0.09709\n\nSimilarly, for Stock B:\n\n- \u03b1_i = 2%\n\n- \u03c3(e) = 19.1%\n\nInformation Ratio = 2% / 19.1% \u2248 0.1047\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (1) 0.0971 (2)0.01047\n\nB. (1) 0.1134 (2)0.01722\n\nC. (1) 0.1149 (2)0.01322\n\nOption A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B.\n\nWait, but 2% / 19.1% is approximately 0.1047, not 0.01047. There's a discrepancy in the decimal placement.\n\nIt seems like option A has a typo for Stock B's information ratio. It should be 0.1047, not 0.01047.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to calculate the information ratio.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nMaybe the information ratio is calculated using the non-excess returns.\n\nWait, but the question specifies that performance is measured using an index model regression on excess returns, so I think sticking with excess returns is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information ratio is calculated using the correlation of the active returns with the benchmark.\n\nBut that seems unrelated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the alpha to the tracking error.\n\nWait, tracking error is the standard deviation of the active returns, which is \u03c3(e) in this case.\n\nSo, yes, Information Ratio = \u03b1_i / \u03c3(e)\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, for Stock A: 1% / 10.3% \u2248 0.0971\n\nFor Stock B: 2% / 19.1% \u2248 0.1047\n\nBut option A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B, which doesn't match my calculation for Stock B.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the data.\n\nWait, maybe the regression estimates are in decimal form, not percentages.\n\nLet me check the units.\n\nThe regression estimate is given as 1% + 1.2(r_M - r_f) for Stock A and 2% + 0.8(r_M - r_f) for Stock B.\n\nAssuming that 1% and 2% are in decimal form, i.e., 0.01 and 0.02, respectively.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nFor Stock A:\n\n\u03b1_i = 0.01\n\n\u03c3(e) = 0.103\n\nInformation Ratio = 0.01 / 0.103 \u2248 0.0971\n\nFor Stock B:\n\n\u03b1_i = 0.02\n\n\u03c3(e) = 0.191\n\nInformation Ratio = 0.02 / 0.191 \u2248 0.1047\n\nStill, option A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B, which would imply that the second value is 0.01047, but according to my calculation, it should be 0.1047.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the information ratio is calculated differently.\n\nLet me consider another formula.\n\nSometimes, the information ratio is calculated as the risk-adjusted return, which is (R_p - R_b) / \u03c3_p,b, where \u03c3_p,b is the standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio and benchmark returns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the correlation-adjusted ratio.\n\nBut I think sticking with the basic definition of information ratio as (alpha) / (residual standard deviation) is appropriate here.\n\nGiven that, my calculations stand.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nStock A: 0.0971\n\nStock B: 0.1047\n\nBut since option A has 0.0971 for Stock A and 0.01047 for Stock B, which doesn't match, and options B and C have different values, none of them seem to be completely correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the information ratio is calculated using the standard deviation of excess returns, not the residual standard deviation.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf Information Ratio = \u03b1_i / \u03c3(R_i - r_M)\n\nWhere \u03c3(R_i - r_M) is the standard deviation of active returns.\n\nFrom the table, we have the standard deviation of excess returns, which is different from the standard deviation of active returns.\n\nWait, in the table, it's \"standard deviation of excess returns,\" which is R_i - r_f, not R_i - r_M.\n\nSo, \u03c3(R_i - r_f) is given, but we need \u03c3(R_i - r_M).\n\nWe can relate these using the index model.\n\nFrom the index model:\n\nR_i - r_f = \u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i\n\nTherefore, R_i - r_M = (\u03b1_i + \u03b2_i (r_M - r_f) + e_i) - (r_M - r_f) = \u03b1_i + (\u03b2_i - 1)(r_M - r_f) + e_i\n\nSo, \u03c3(R_i - r_M) = sqrt[ (\u03b2_i - 1)^2 * \u03c3(r_M - r_f)^2 + \u03c3(e)^2 ]\n\nAssuming that e_i is uncorrelated with (r_M - r_f), which is a standard assumption in the index model.\n\nBut we don't have \u03c3(r_M - r_f), which is the standard deviation of the market excess returns.\n\nWait, perhaps we can calculate it.\n\nGiven that the average market return is 14% and the risk-free rate is 6%, but we don't have the standard deviation of the market excess returns.\n\nUnless, perhaps, it's provided elsewhere, but it's not in the given data.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll go with option A, acknowledging that there seems to be a typo in the second value.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA"
