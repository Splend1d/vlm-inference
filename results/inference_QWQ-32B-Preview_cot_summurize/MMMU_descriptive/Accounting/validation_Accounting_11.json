                    "text": "So I have this problem here about options and a strangle strategy. Let me see if I can wrap my head around it. So, there's this company, TRT Materials, and its stock is currently at $58 per share. There\u2019s a court decision coming up that could make the stock price move a lot, either up or down. The client doesn\u2019t own any TRT shares right now but is interested in using a strangle strategy to benefit from this potential price movement.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand what a strangle is. From the description, it\u2019s a portfolio consisting of a put and a call option, both with the same expiration date but different exercise prices. So, in this case, Donna has gathered some option pricing data, which is presented in a table. Let\u2019s see what that data is.\n\nAccording to the description, the table has three columns: Characteristic, Call Option, and Put Option. The rows under these columns provide details like price, strike price, and time to expiration.\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- Call Option price: $5\n\n- Put Option price: $4\n\n- Strike price for call: $60\n\n- Strike price for put: $55\n\n- Time to expiration: 90 days for both options\n\nThe question is asking for the maximum possible loss per share for a long strangle strategy at expiration.\n\nOkay, so a long strangle means buying a call option and a put option with different strike prices but the same expiration date. In this case, the call has a strike of $60 and the put has a strike of $55, both expiring in 90 days. The client is paying $5 for the call and $4 for the put, so the total cost is $9 per share.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the maximum possible loss for this strategy.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in a strangle, you\u2019re betting on a big move in either direction. If the stock price moves significantly above the call strike or significantly below the put strike, you can make a profit. However, if the stock price stays between the two strikes, you\u2019ll likely lose money.\n\nThe maximum loss in a long strangle occurs when the stock price at expiration is between the two strike prices. In that case, both the call and the put options will expire worthless, and you\u2019ll lose the entire premium paid for both options.\n\nSo, in this scenario, if the stock price at expiration is between $55 and $60, both options will be worthless, and the loss would be the total amount paid for the options, which is $5 (call) + $4 (put) = $9 per share.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check this.\n\nThe call option has a strike price of $60, and the put has a strike of $55. So, if at expiration the stock price is above $60, the call will be in the money, and the put will be out of the money. If it's below $55, the put will be in the money, and the call will be out of the money. If it's between $55 and $60, both will be out of the money.\n\nSo, yes, the maximum loss is indeed the total premium paid, which is $9 per share.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. $9.00\n\nB. $5.00\n\nC. The maximum possible loss is unlimited\n\nSo, based on my understanding, the correct answer should be A. $9.00.\n\nBut wait, let's make sure there isn't anything I'm missing here. Is there any scenario where the loss could be more than $9 per share?\n\nIn a long strangle, the maximum loss is limited to the premium paid for both options. There is no unlimited loss potential because you\u2019ve already paid the premiums, and the worst that can happen is that both options expire worthless.\n\nSo, option C is incorrect because the loss is limited.\n\nOption B is $5.00, which is only the price of the call option, not the total premium paid for both options.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. $9.00.\n\nI think that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nA. $9.00\n"
