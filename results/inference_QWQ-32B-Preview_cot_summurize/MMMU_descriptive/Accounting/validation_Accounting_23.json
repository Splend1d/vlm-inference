Each option has four parameters listed: time to maturity (T), strike price (X), volatility (\u03c3), and the price of the option. The details for each option are as follows:\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - Time to maturity (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Volatility (\u03c3): 0.2\n  - Price of Option: $10\n\n- **Option B**:\n  - Time to maturity (T): 0.5 years\n  - Strike price (X): $50\n  - Volatility (\u03c3): 0.2\n  - Price of Option: $12\n\nThe risk-free interest rate is assumed to be 6%, and it is stated that the stocks on which these options are written pay no dividends.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nYou are asked to compare two options with parameters as given.

                    "text": "Given the information provided, both options A and B are put options with identical parameters: time to maturity (T) of 0.5 years, strike price (X) of $50, and volatility (\u03c3) of 0.2. The only difference between them is their prices: option A is priced at $10, and option B is priced at $12. The risk-free interest rate is 6%, and the underlying stocks pay no dividends.\n\nTo determine which put option is written on the stock with the lower price, we need to recall the relationship between the put option price and the underlying stock price in the context of put-call parity. For put options, the put price increases as the stock price decreases, assuming all other factors remain constant. This is because a put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying stock at the strike price. Therefore, if the stock price is lower, the put option becomes more valuable because it allows the holder to sell the stock at a higher strike price.\n\nThe put-call parity formula for European options without dividends is:\n\n\\[ P = Ke^{-rT} - S + C \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P \\) is the put option price\n- \\( K \\) is the strike price\n- \\( r \\) is the risk-free interest rate\n- \\( T \\) is the time to maturity\n- \\( S \\) is the stock price\n- \\( C \\) is the call option price\n\nHowever, since we are only dealing with put options here and do not have information about the corresponding call options, we can infer the relationship between the put price and the stock price directly.\n\nGiven that both options have the same strike price, volatility, and time to maturity, the difference in their prices must be due to the difference in the underlying stock prices. Specifically, the put option with the higher price must be written on the stock with the lower price.\n\nLet's denote the stock prices for options A and B as \\( S_A \\) and \\( S_B \\), respectively.\n\nSince option B has a higher price ($12) compared to option A ($10), and all other factors are equal, it must be that \\( S_B < S_A \\). In other words, the stock underlying option B has a lower price than the stock underlying option A.\n\nTherefore, the put option written on the stock with the lower price is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
