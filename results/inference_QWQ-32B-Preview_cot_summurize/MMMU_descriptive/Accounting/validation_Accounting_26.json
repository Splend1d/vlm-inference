The analysis includes the following details:\n\n- **Units sold**: 1,450\n- **Sales price per unit**: $90\n- **Variable cost per unit**: $40\n- **Contribution margin per unit**: $50 (calculated as Sales price per unit - Variable cost per unit)\n- **Fixed costs**: $20,650\n- **Break-even (in units)**: 413 (calculated as Fixed costs / Contribution margin per unit)\n- **Break-even (in dollars)**: $37,170 (calculated as Break-even (in units) * Sales price per unit)\n\nAdditionally, there is a breakdown of sales and costs:\n- **Sales**: $130,500 (calculated as Units sold * Sales price per unit)\n- **Variable costs**: $58,000 (calculated as Units sold * Variable cost per unit)\n- **Contribution margin**: $72,500 (calculated as Sales - Variable costs)\n- **Net income (loss)**: $51,850 (calculated as Contribution margin - Fixed costs)\n\nBased on this information, if the company increases the retail price by 10%, the new sales price per unit would be $99 ($90 + 10% of $90). The variable cost per unit remains unchanged at $40. Therefore, the new contribution margin per unit would be $59 ($99 - $40).\n\nTo find the new break-even point in units, we use the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed costs}}{\\text{Contribution margin per unit}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{20,650}{59} \\approx 350 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTo find the new break-even point in dollars, we multiply the break-even units by the new sales price per unit:\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in dollars)} = 350 \\times 99 = \\$34,650 \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nA. 350 units and $34,647.65\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nBaghdad Company produces a single product. They have recently received the result of a market survey that indicates that they can increase the retail price of their product by 10% without losing customers or market share. All other costs will remain unchanged. If they enact the 10% price increase, what will be their new break-even point in units and dollars? Their most recent CVP analysis is: <image 1> \n\nA. 350 units and $34,647.65\nB. 355 units and $35,647.65\nC. 350 units and $35,647.65\nD. 355 units and $34,647.65\n"

Therefore, the new contribution margin per unit will be:\n\n\\[ \\text{New contribution margin per unit} = \\$99 - \\$40 = \\$59 \\]\n\nTo find the new break-even point in units, we use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{\\text{Fixed costs}}{\\text{Contribution margin per unit}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{20,650}{59} \\approx 350 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nTo find the new break-even point in dollars, we multiply the break-even units by the new sales price per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in dollars)} = 350 \\times 99 = \\$34,650 \\]\n\nHowever, the options provided have slightly different values, particularly in the dollar amount. Let's check the calculation again for precision.\n\nCalculating the break-even in units more precisely:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{20,650}{59} \\approx 350 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nBut to be precise:\n\n\\[ 59 \\times 350 = 20,650 \\]\n\nSo, exactly 350 units.\n\nNow, for break-even in dollars:\n\n\\[ 350 \\times 99 = 34,650 \\]\n\nBut option A says $34,647.65, which is slightly different. Let's see if there's a rounding issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are being considered with more decimal places, but in the given data, fixed costs are $20,650.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the contribution margin per unit is being calculated differently.\n\nLet's recalculate the contribution margin per unit:\n\n\\[ \\text{New sales price} = \\$90 + (0.10 \\times \\$90) = \\$90 + \\$9 = \\$99 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Variable cost} = \\$40 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{New contribution margin} = \\$99 - \\$40 = \\$59 \\]\n\nNow, break-even in units:\n\n\\[ \\text{Break-even (in units)} = \\frac{20,650}{59} \\approx 350 \\text{ units} \\]\n\nBreak-even in dollars:\n\n\\[ 350 \\times 99 = 34,650 \\]\n\nBut option A has $34,647.65, which is $34,650 - $2.35, not sure where the discrepancy comes from.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are not exactly $20,650, but let's assume the given data is accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a rounding in the contribution margin per unit.\n\nLet's check the division:\n\n\\[ 20,650 \\div 59 = 350 \\]\n\nExact, no rounding needed.\n\nSo, the break-even in units is 350, and in dollars, it's $34,650.\n\nBut option A has $34,647.65, which is odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the contribution margin per unit is being calculated with more precision.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial data.\n\nLooking back at the description:\n\n- Sales price per unit: $90\n\n- Variable cost per unit: $40\n\n- Contribution margin per unit: $50\n\nBut with a 10% price increase, new sales price is $99, variable cost remains $40, so new contribution margin is $59.\n\nBreak-even in units: 20,650 / 59 = 350 units.\n\nBreak-even in dollars: 350 * 99 = 34,650.\n\nBut option A has $34,647.65.\n\nPerhaps there's a miscalculation in the option provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are $20,650, and 350 units * $59 = $20,650, which matches.\n\nBut $350 * $99 = $34,650.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a tax consideration or another cost not accounted for in the CVP analysis, but the description doesn't mention any additional costs.\n\nGiven the information provided, the correct answer should be 350 units and $34,650.\n\nHowever, since the options provided have $34,647.65, which is close to $34,650, perhaps there's a rounding difference or a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fixed costs are not exactly $20,650, but slightly less, leading to a break-even point of $34,647.65.\n\nBut based on the provided data, the answer should be 350 units and $34,650.\n\nTherefore, the closest option is A. 350 units and $34,647.65.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 350 \\ \\text{units and} \\ \\$34,647.65} \\]"
