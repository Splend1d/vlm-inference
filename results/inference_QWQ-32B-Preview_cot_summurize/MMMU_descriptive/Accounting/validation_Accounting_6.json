The table includes columns for each month, indicating the costs incurred during those months, as well as columns for when the jobs were completed and when they were sold.\n\nHere are the details from the table:\n\n- **Job AA2**:\n  - January: $2,500\n  - February: $1,200\n  - Completed: February\n  - Sold: Not sold\n\n- **Job AA4**:\n  - January: $4,838\n  - Completed: January\n  - Sold: February\n\n- **Job AA5**:\n  - February: $3,250\n  - Completed: February\n  - Sold: March\n\n- **Job AA3**:\n  - February: $3,409\n  - March: $2,319\n  - Completed: April\n  - Sold: Not sold\n\n- **Total Costs**:\n  - January: $7,338\n  - February: $7,859\n  - March: $2,319\n\nBased on this information, we can determine the balances in the work in process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold for January.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nJob cost sheets show the following information: <image 1> What are the balances in the work in process inventory, finished goods inventory, and cost of goods sold for January?\n\nA. 2,500 4,838 0\nB. 3,409 6,950 4,838\nC. 5,728 3,700 3,250\nD. 5,728 3,409 2,500\n"
