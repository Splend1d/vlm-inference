                    "text": "To solve for the missing account balance of Dividends, we need to use the accounting equation, which is:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity\n\nFirst, let's identify which accounts are assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\n**Assets:**\n\n- Accounts receivable: $16,032\n\n- Cash: $20,450\n\n- Equipment: $29,000\n\n- Prepaid insurance: $9,444\n\n- Land: $34,000\n\n- Supplies: $9,700\n\nTotal assets = $16,032 + $20,450 + $29,000 + $9,444 + $34,000 + $9,700 = $118,626\n\n**Liabilities:**\n\n- Accounts payable: $9,000\n\n- Notes payable: $48,000\n\nTotal liabilities = $9,000 + $48,000 = $57,000\n\n**Equity:**\n\n- Common stock: $24,000\n\n- Retained earnings: $31,315\n\n- Dividends: ?\n\n- Service revenue: $82,500\n\n- Insurance expense: $12,689\n\n- Salaries expense: $51,500\n\nNow, retained earnings are affected by revenues, expenses, and dividends. The general formula for retained earnings is:\n\nRetained earnings = Beginning retained earnings + Net income - Dividends\n\nHowever, since we don't have the beginning retained earnings, we can consider the current retained earnings as the result of the current period's activities.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net income for the period:\n\nNet income = Service revenue - (Insurance expense + Salaries expense)\n\nNet income = $82,500 - ($12,689 + $51,500) = $82,500 - $64,189 = $18,311\n\nNow, assuming that the retained earnings balance of $31,315 includes the net income for the period and less any dividends paid, we can set up the equation:\n\nRetained earnings = Beginning retained earnings + Net income - Dividends\n\nBut since we don't have the beginning retained earnings, we need to find another way to solve for dividends.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the accounting equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity\n\nWe have:\n\n$118,626 = $57,000 + Equity\n\nTherefore, Equity = $118,626 - $57,000 = $61,626\n\nNow, Equity consists of Common stock, Retained earnings, and less Dividends (if any).\n\nBut Dividends is a reduction in retained earnings, so perhaps I need to consider the normal balances.\n\nWait, Dividends is typically a contra-equity account or an expense account, depending on the context.\n\nIn this case, since it's listed separately from retained earnings, it might be considered as a reduction in retained earnings.\n\nSo, perhaps the equation should be:\n\nEquity (total) = Common stock + Retained earnings - Dividends\n\nGiven that, we have:\n\n$61,626 = $24,000 + $31,315 - Dividends\n\nSolving for Dividends:\n\nDividends = $24,000 + $31,315 - $61,626 = $55,315 - $61,626 = -$6,311\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because dividends can't be negative.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nLet me consider the trial balance approach.\n\nIn a trial balance, all debit and credit balances are listed.\n\nAssets are debit balances, liabilities are credit balances, and equity is credit balances.\n\nExpenses are debit balances, revenues are credit balances.\n\nDividends are typically a debit balance in the equity section.\n\nSo, in the trial balance, the total debits should equal the total credits.\n\nLet's list all the debit and credit balances:\n\n**Debit balances (assets and expenses):**\n\n- Accounts receivable: $16,032\n\n- Cash: $20,450\n\n- Equipment: $29,000\n\n- Prepaid insurance: $9,444\n\n- Land: $34,000\n\n- Supplies: $9,700\n\n- Insurance expense: $12,689\n\n- Salaries expense: $51,500\n\n- Dividends: ? (assuming debit balance)\n\nTotal debits = $16,032 + $20,450 + $29,000 + $9,444 + $34,000 + $9,700 + $12,689 + $51,500 + Dividends\n\n**Credit balances (liabilities and equity):**\n\n- Accounts payable: $9,000\n\n- Notes payable: $48,000\n\n- Common stock: $24,000\n\n- Retained earnings: $31,315\n\n- Service revenue: $82,500\n\nTotal credits = $9,000 + $48,000 + $24,000 + $31,315 + $82,500 = $194,815\n\nIn a trial balance, total debits should equal total credits.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$16,032 + $20,450 + $29,000 + $9,444 + $34,000 + $9,700 + $12,689 + $51,500 + Dividends = $194,815\n\nLet's sum up the known debit balances:\n\n$16,032 + $20,450 = $36,482\n\n$36,482 + $29,000 = $65,482\n\n$65,482 + $9,444 = $74,926\n\n$74,926 + $34,000 = $108,926\n\n$108,926 + $9,700 = $118,626\n\n$118,626 + $12,689 = $131,315\n\n$131,315 + $51,500 = $182,815\n\nSo, $182,815 + Dividends = $194,815\n\nTherefore, Dividends = $194,815 - $182,815 = $12,000\n\nThus, the missing account balance of Dividends is $12,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12000} \\]"
