A composite unit is a collection of units from different products, combined in the ratio of their sales mix. Here, the product mix is given as 5:4:1 for Junior, Adult, and Expert models, respectively.\n\nThis means that for every 5 Junior jet skis rented, there are 4 Adult jet skis and 1 Expert jet ski rented.\n\nTo find the sales price per composite unit, we need to calculate the total sales revenue generated by one composite unit.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of units of each model in one composite unit.\n\nGiven the ratio 5:4:1:\n\n- Junior: 5 units\n\n- Adult: 4 units\n\n- Expert: 1 unit\n\nStep 2: Find the sales price per unit for each model from the table.\n\n- Junior: $50\n\n- Adult: $75\n\n- Expert: $110\n\nStep 3: Calculate the total sales revenue for each model in the composite unit.\n\n- Junior: 5 units * $50/unit = $250\n\n- Adult: 4 units * $75/unit = $300\n\n- Expert: 1 unit * $110/unit = $110\n\nStep 4: Sum up the sales revenues from all models to get the total sales price per composite unit.\n\nTotal sales price per composite unit = $250 + $300 + $110 = $660\n\nTherefore, the sales price per composite unit is $660.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. $660\n\nB. $760\n\nC. $650\n\nD. $750\n\nThe correct answer is A. $660.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
