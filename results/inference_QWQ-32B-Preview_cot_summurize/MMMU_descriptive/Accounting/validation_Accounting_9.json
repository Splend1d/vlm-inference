                    "text": "To determine the December 31 cash balance for Forest Company, we need to start with the initial cash balance and then account for all the transactions that affected the cash account during the month of December. Let's go through each transaction step by step.\n\n1. **Cash balance Dec. 1: $4,250**\n   - This is our starting point.\n\n2. **Cash sales: $3,250**\n   - Cash sales increase the cash balance.\n   - New balance: $4,250 + $3,250 = $7,500\n\n3. **Payments for inventory: $1,760**\n   - Payments for inventory decrease the cash balance.\n   - New balance: $7,500 - $1,760 = $5,740\n\n4. **Investments by owners: $3,000**\n   - Investments by owners increase the cash balance.\n   - New balance: $5,740 + $3,000 = $8,740\n\n5. **Supplies used: $175**\n   - Supplies used is an expense, but it doesn't directly affect the cash balance unless it's a cash transaction. Since it's listed here, we'll assume it's a cash payment.\n   - New balance: $8,740 - $175 = $8,565\n\n6. **Cash withdrawals: $260**\n   - Cash withdrawals decrease the cash balance.\n   - New balance: $8,565 - $260 = $8,305\n\n7. **Inventory received: $2,500**\n   - Inventory received likely refers to purchase of inventory on credit, which doesn't affect the cash balance immediately. However, since it's listed here, if it's a cash transaction, it would decrease the cash balance.\n   - Assuming it's a cash transaction:\n   - New balance: $8,305 - $2,500 = $5,805\n\n8. **Wages paid: $2,390**\n   - Wages paid decrease the cash balance.\n   - New balance: $5,805 - $2,390 = $3,415\n\nWait a minute, this doesn't match any of the provided options (A. $6,000, B. $6,150, C. $6,090, D. $6,060). It seems there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting some of the transactions.\n\nLet's re-examine the transactions:\n\n- **Cash sales: $3,250** (increase cash)\n- **Payments for inventory: $1,760** (decrease cash)\n- **Investments by owners: $3,000** (increase cash)\n- **Supplies used: $175** (likely a cash payment, decrease cash)\n- **Cash withdrawals: $260** (decrease cash)\n- **Inventory received: $2,500** (if cash purchase, decrease cash)\n- **Wages paid: $2,390** (decrease cash)\n- **Cash balance Dec. 1: $4,250**\n\nLet's try calculating again:\n\nStarting balance: $4,250\n\n+ Cash sales: $3,250 \u2192 $4,250 + $3,250 = $7,500\n\n- Payments for inventory: $1,760 \u2192 $7,500 - $1,760 = $5,740\n\n+ Investments by owners: $3,000 \u2192 $5,740 + $3,000 = $8,740\n\n- Supplies used: $175 \u2192 $8,740 - $175 = $8,565\n\n- Cash withdrawals: $260 \u2192 $8,565 - $260 = $8,305\n\n- Inventory received: $2,500 (assuming cash purchase) \u2192 $8,305 - $2,500 = $5,805\n\n- Wages paid: $2,390 \u2192 $5,805 - $2,390 = $3,415\n\nThis result ($3,415) doesn't match any options, so perhaps \"Inventory received: $2,500\" doesn't affect cash. Maybe it's a non-cash transaction, like inventory purchased on credit.\n\nLet's try excluding that transaction:\n\nStarting balance: $4,250\n\n+ Cash sales: $3,250 \u2192 $4,250 + $3,250 = $7,500\n\n- Payments for inventory: $1,760 \u2192 $7,500 - $1,760 = $5,740\n\n+ Investments by owners: $3,000 \u2192 $5,740 + $3,000 = $8,740\n\n- Supplies used: $175 \u2192 $8,740 - $175 = $8,565\n\n- Cash withdrawals: $260 \u2192 $8,565 - $260 = $8,305\n\n- Wages paid: $2,390 \u2192 $8,305 - $2,390 = $5,915\n\nThis is closer to the options, but still not matching exactly. Maybe there's a different interpretation needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Inventory received: $2,500\" is inventory purchased and paid for in December, which would be included in \"Payments for inventory: $1,760.\" But $1,760 doesn't match $2,500, so that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Inventory received: $2,500\" is the cost of goods sold, which affects the inventory account but not necessarily cash directly.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let's consider that \"Inventory received: $2,500\" might be a non-cash transaction, such as inventory purchased on credit, which would increase inventory but not affect cash.\n\nIf that's the case, then we can exclude it from the cash calculations.\n\nSo, revised calculations:\n\nStarting balance: $4,250\n\n+ Cash sales: $3,250 \u2192 $4,250 + $3,250 = $7,500\n\n- Payments for inventory: $1,760 \u2192 $7,500 - $1,760 = $5,740\n\n+ Investments by owners: $3,000 \u2192 $5,740 + $3,000 = $8,740\n\n- Supplies used: $175 \u2192 $8,740 - $175 = $8,565\n\n- Cash withdrawals: $260 \u2192 $8,565 - $260 = $8,305\n\n- Wages paid: $2,390 \u2192 $8,305 - $2,390 = $5,915\n\nThis is still not matching any options. Perhaps there's a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nLet's consider that \"Supplies used: $175\" might not be a cash transaction, but rather an adjustment for supplies used up. If supplies were purchased on credit or already paid for, this might not affect the cash balance.\n\nSimilarly, \"Inventory received: $2,500\" might be inventory purchased on credit, which would not affect the cash balance.\n\nIf we exclude both \"Supplies used: $175\" and \"Inventory received: $2,500\" from the cash calculations, then:\n\nStarting balance: $4,250\n\n+ Cash sales: $3,250 \u2192 $4,250 + $3,250 = $7,500\n\n- Payments for inventory: $1,760 \u2192 $7,500 - $1,760 = $5,740\n\n+ Investments by owners: $3,000 \u2192 $5,740 + $3,000 = $8,740\n\n- Cash withdrawals: $260 \u2192 $8,740 - $260 = $8,480\n\n- Wages paid: $2,390 \u2192 $8,480 - $2,390 = $6,090\n\nNow, this gives us $6,090, which matches option C.\n\nAlternatively, if \"Supplies used: $175\" is a cash transaction, then we need to subtract it, leading to:\n\n$6,090 - $175 = $5,915, which doesn't match any options.\n\nTherefore, it's likely that \"Supplies used: $175\" is not a cash transaction and should not be included in the cash balance calculations.\n\nThus, the December 31 cash balance is $6,090.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\, \\$6,090} \\]"
