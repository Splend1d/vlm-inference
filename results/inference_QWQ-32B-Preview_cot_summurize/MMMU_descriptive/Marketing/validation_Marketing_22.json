                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It says that there are 28 homes with square footage data given in thousands of square feet. The sample mean is 2.50, and the sample standard deviation is 0.8302. The distribution is described as X ~ U(1.5, 4.5), which means it's a uniform distribution between 1.5 and 4.5.\n\nThe question is asking for P(x < 3.5 | x < 4). That's the probability that x is less than 3.5 given that x is less than 4.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a uniform distribution is. In a uniform distribution, the probability is equally likely across the entire interval. So, for X ~ U(a, b), the probability density function is f(x) = 1/(b - a) for a \u2264 x \u2264 b, and 0 otherwise.\n\nHere, a = 1.5 and b = 4.5. So, f(x) = 1/(4.5 - 1.5) = 1/3 for 1.5 \u2264 x \u2264 4.5.\n\nNow, I need to find the conditional probability P(x < 3.5 | x < 4).\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A | B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B)\n\nIn this case, A is x < 3.5 and B is x < 4.\n\nSo, P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = P(x < 3.5 \u2229 x < 4) / P(x < 4)\n\nSince if x < 3.5, it's already less than 4, the intersection is just x < 3.5.\n\nTherefore, P(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = P(x < 3.5) / P(x < 4)\n\nNow, I need to find P(x < 3.5) and P(x < 4) for the uniform distribution X ~ U(1.5, 4.5).\n\nFor a uniform distribution, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is:\n\nF(x) = (x - a)/(b - a) for a \u2264 x \u2264 b\n\nSo, P(x < k) = F(k) = (k - 1.5)/(4.5 - 1.5) = (k - 1.5)/3 for 1.5 \u2264 k \u2264 4.5\n\nFirst, find P(x < 3.5):\n\nP(x < 3.5) = (3.5 - 1.5)/3 = 2/3 \u2248 0.6667\n\nNext, find P(x < 4):\n\nP(x < 4) = (4 - 1.5)/3 = 2.5/3 \u2248 0.8333\n\nNow, plug these into the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(x < 3.5 | x < 4) = (2/3) / (2.5/3) = (2/3) * (3/2.5) = 2/2.5 = 0.8\n\nSo, the probability is 0.8.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.5\n\nB. 0.625\n\nC. 0.8\n\nD. 0.875\n\nThe correct answer is C. 0.8\n\nI think that makes sense. Just to double-check, maybe I should see if the data in the table supports this.\n\nThe table has four rows with seven columns each, totaling 28 entries. The values range from 1.5 to 4.5, which matches the uniform distribution parameters.\n\nIf I were to calculate the empirical probabilities from the data, I could count the number of homes with x < 3.5 and x < 4.\n\nBut since the problem states that the distribution is X ~ U(1.5, 4.5), it's probably expecting me to use the theoretical probabilities from the uniform distribution rather than the sample data.\n\nMoreover, the sample mean and standard deviation are given, but they aren't necessary for this particular question since we're dealing with the uniform distribution's properties.\n\nSo, I think sticking with the uniform distribution approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.8\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
