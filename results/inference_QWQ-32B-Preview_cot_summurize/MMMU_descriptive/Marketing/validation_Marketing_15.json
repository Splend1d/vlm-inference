The types of fries listed are Skinny Fries, Curly Fries, and Steak Fries. The table provides the number of sales for each type of fry in each region:\n\n- **Skinny Fries:**\n  - Northeast: 70\n  - South: 50\n  - Central: 20\n  - West: 25\n\n- **Curly Fries:**\n  - Northeast: 100\n  - South: 60\n  - Central: 15\n  - West: 30\n\n- **Steak Fries:**\n  - Northeast: 20\n  - South: 40\n  - Central: 10\n  - West: 10\n\nThis table is used to conduct a test of independence to determine if the type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> A major food manufacturer is concerned that the sales for its skinny french fries have been decreasing. As a part of a feasibility study, the company conducts research into the types of fries sold across the country to determine if the type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country. The results of the study are shown in Table 11.43. Conduct a test of independence. At the 5% significance level, what can you conclude?\n\nA. There is insufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\nB. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\nC. Not certain.\n"

Here are the steps to conduct this test:\n\n1. **State the Hypotheses:**\n   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The type of fries sold is independent of the area of the country.\n   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The type of fries sold is dependent on the area of the country.\n\n2. **Set the Significance Level:**\n   - \u03b1 = 0.05\n\n3. **Calculate the Expected Frequencies:**\n   - For each cell in the table, the expected frequency under the assumption of independence is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     E_{ij} = \\frac{\\text{row total}_i \\times \\text{column total}_j}{\\text{total sample size}}\n     \\]\n   - First, we need to calculate the row totals and column totals.\n\n   From the table:\n   - Skinny Fries: 70 + 50 + 20 + 25 = 165\n   - Curly Fries: 100 + 60 + 15 + 30 = 205\n   - Steak Fries: 20 + 40 + 10 + 10 = 80\n   - Total sales: 165 + 205 + 80 = 450\n\n   Now, calculate the expected frequencies for each cell:\n   - For Skinny Fries in Northeast:\n     \\[\n     E_{11} = \\frac{165 \\times (70 + 100 + 20)}{450} = \\frac{165 \\times 190}{450} = \\frac{31,350}{450} = 70\n     \\]\n   - For Skinny Fries in South:\n     \\[\n     E_{12} = \\frac{165 \\times (50 + 60 + 40)}{450} = \\frac{165 \\times 150}{450} = \\frac{24,750}{450} = 55\n     \\]\n   - For Skinny Fries in Central:\n     \\[\n     E_{13} = \\frac{165 \\times (20 + 15 + 10)}{450} = \\frac{165 \\times 45}{450} = \\frac{7,425}{450} = 16.5\n     \\]\n   - For Skinny Fries in West:\n     \\[\n     E_{14} = \\frac{165 \\times (25 + 30 + 10)}{450} = \\frac{165 \\times 65}{450} = \\frac{10,725}{450} = 23.8333\n     \\]\n\n   - For Curly Fries in Northeast:\n     \\[\n     E_{21} = \\frac{205 \\times 190}{450} = \\frac{38,950}{450} = 86.5556\n     \\]\n   -

E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\n     \\]\n   - Where O_{ij} is the observed frequency and E_{ij} is the expected frequency.\n\n   Let's calculate this for each cell:\n\n   - Skinny Fries in Northeast:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(70 - 70)^2}{70} = \\frac{0}{70} = 0\n     \\]\n\n   - Skinny Fries in South:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(50 - 55)^2}{55} = \\frac{25}{55} \\approx 0.4545\n     \\]\n\n   - Skinny Fries in Central:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(20 - 16.5)^2}{16.5} = \\frac{12.25}{16.5} \\approx 0.7424\n     \\]\n\n   - Skinny Fries in West:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(25 - 23.8333)^2}{23.8333} = \\frac{1.3611}{23.8333} \\approx 0.0571\n     \\]\n\n   - Curly Fries in Northeast:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(100 - 86.5556)^2}{86.5556} = \\frac{184.8444}{86.5556} \\approx 2.135\n     \\]\n\n   - Curly Fries in South:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(60 - 68.3333)^2}{68.3333} = \\frac{70.1111}{68.3333} \\approx 1.026\n     \\]\n\n   - Curly Fries in Central:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(15 - 20.5)^2}{20.5} = \\frac{30.25}{20.5} \\approx 1.4756\n     \\]\n\n   - Curly Fries in West:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(30 - 29.6111)^2}{29.6111} = \\frac{0.1588}{29.6111} \\approx 0.0054\n     \\]\n\n   - Steak Fries in Northeast:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(20 - 33.7778)^2}{33.7778} = \\frac{189.4444}{33.7778} \\approx 5.61\n     \\]\n\n   - Steak Fries in South:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(40 - 26.6667)^2}{26.6667} = \\frac{177.7778}{26.6667} \\approx 6.6667\n     \\]\n\n   - Steak Fries in Central:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(10 - 8)^2}{8} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.5\n     \\]\n\n   - Steak Fries in West:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{(10 - 11.5556)^2}{11.5556} = \\frac{2.4237}{11.5556} \\approx 0.2093\n     \\]\n\n   Now, sum all these values to get the chi-square statistic:\n   \\[\n   \\chi^2 \\approx 0 + 0.4545 + 0.7424 + 0.0571 + 2.135 + 1.026 + 1.4756 + 0.0054 + 5.61 + 6.6667 + 0.5 + 0.2093 \\approx 19.48\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Degrees of Freedom:**\n   - For a chi-square test of independence, the degrees of freedom are:\n     \\[\n     df = (\\text{number of rows} - 1) \\times (\\text{number of columns} - 1)\n     \\]\n   - Here, number of rows = 3 (types of fries), number of columns = 4 (regions)\n   - So, df = (3 - 1) \u00d7 (4 - 1) = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n\n6. **Find the Critical Value:**\n   - At \u03b1 = 0.05 and df = 6, the critical value from the chi-square distribution table is approximately 12.5916.\n\n7. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Compare the calculated chi-square statistic to the critical value.\n   - If the calculated chi-square is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis.\n   - Here, 19.48 > 12.5916, so we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - There is sufficient evidence at the 5% significance level to conclude that the type of fries sold is dependent on the area of the country.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nB. There is sufficient evidence that types of fries and location are dependent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
