The scores are as follows:\n\n- Wife's score: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4\n- Husband's score: 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4\n\nThese scores represent the ratings given by husbands and wives regarding their satisfaction with the division of childcare responsibilities. The ratings range from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), but the scores listed are only between 1 and 4.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> One of the questions in a study of marital satisfaction of dual-career couples was to rate the statement \"I'm pleased with the way we divide the responsibilities for childcare.\" The ratings went from one (strongly agree) to five (strongly disagree). Table 10.19 contains ten of the paired responses for husbands and wives. Conduct a hypothesis test to see if the mean difference in the husband's versus the wife's satisfaction level is negative (meaning that, within the partnership, the husband is happier than the wife). Calculate t-value.\n\nA. -1.96\nB. -1.86\nC. -1.26\nD. -0.96\n"

                    "text": "To conduct a hypothesis test to see if the mean difference in the husband's versus the wife's satisfaction level is negative, we need to perform a paired t-test. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **State the Hypotheses:**\n   - Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)): The mean difference (\\(\\mu_d\\)) is zero or positive, meaning husbands are not happier than wives on average.\n     \\[\n     H_0: \\mu_d \\geq 0\n     \\]\n   - Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_a\\)): The mean difference is negative, meaning husbands are happier than wives on average.\n     \\[\n     H_a: \\mu_d < 0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   For each pair, calculate the difference as \\(d = \\text{husband's score} - \\text{wife's score}\\).\n\n   Given data:\n   - Wife's scores: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4\n   - Husband's scores: 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4\n\n   Calculate \\(d\\):\n   \\[\n   \\begin{align*}\n   d_1 &= 2 - 2 = 0 \\\\\n   d_2 &= 2 - 2 = 0 \\\\\n   d_3 &= 1 - 3 = -2 \\\\\n   d_4 &= 3 - 3 = 0 \\\\\n   d_5 &= 2 - 4 = -2 \\\\\n   d_6 &= 1 - 2 = -1 \\\\\n   d_7 &= 1 - 1 = 0 \\\\\n   d_8 &= 1 - 1 = 0 \\\\\n   d_9 &= 2 - 2 = 0 \\\\\n   d_{10} &= 4 - 4 = 0 \\\\\n   \\end{align*}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Mean of the Differences (\\(\\bar{d}\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\bar{d} = \\frac{\\sum d}{n} = \\frac{0 + 0 + (-2) + 0 + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0}{10} = \\frac{-5}{10} = -0.5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Standard Deviation of the Differences (\\(s_d\\)):**\n   First, find the sum of squared differences from the mean:\n   \\[\n   \\sum (d - \\bar{d})^2 = (0 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - (-0.5))^2 + (-2 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - (-0.5))^2 + (-2 - (-0.5))^2 + (-1 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - (-0.5))^2 + (0 - (-0.5))^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 6.5\n   \\]\n   Then, the standard deviation is:\n   \\[\n   s_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (d - \\bar{d})^2}{n - 1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6.5}{9}} \\approx 0.8515\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the t-statistic:**\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{\\bar{d} - \\mu_d}{s_d / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{-0.5 - 0}{0.8515 / \\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{-0.5}{0.8515 / 3.1623} \\approx \\frac{-0.5}{0.2693} \\approx -1.856\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine the Degrees of Freedom:**\n   \\[\n   df = n - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find the Critical Value:**\n   Since this is a one-tailed test with \\(H_a: \\mu_d < 0\\), and assuming a significance level of 0.05, the critical t-value for 9 degrees of freedom is approximately -1.833.\n\n8. **Make a Decision:**\n   Our calculated t-value is approximately -1.856, which is less than the critical value of -1.833. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
