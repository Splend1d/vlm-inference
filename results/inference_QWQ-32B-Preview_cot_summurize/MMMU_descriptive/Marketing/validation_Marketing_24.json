                    "text": "Based on the table provided in Table 2.71, which lists salary ranges and their corresponding relative frequencies, we can see the distribution of responses regarding what constitutes a middle-class income. The table includes various salary ranges from less than $20,000 up to $100,000 and above, along with their respective relative frequencies.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of survey respondents who answered 'not sure,' and this information is not directly provided in the table. The table only shows responses related to specific salary ranges, but there is no category listed for 'not sure.'\n\nGiven that the total number of respondents is 600 adult Americans, and the table provides relative frequencies for each salary range, we might consider whether the 'not sure' responses can be inferred from the data provided. Relative frequencies typically sum up to 1 (or 100%) if all possible categories are included. Therefore, if the relative frequencies in the table add up to less than 1, the difference might represent the 'not sure' responses.\n\nLet's add up the relative frequencies provided:\n\n- < $20,000: 0.02\n- $20,000\u2013$25,000: 0.09\n- $25,000\u2013$30,000: 0.19\n- $30,000\u2013$40,000: 0.26\n- $40,000\u2013$50,000: 0.18\n- $50,000\u2013$75,000: 0.17\n- $75,000\u2013$99,999: 0.02\n- $100,000+: 0.01\n\nSum of relative frequencies:\n\n0.02 + 0.09 + 0.19 + 0.26 + 0.18 + 0.17 + 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.84\n\nSince the total relative frequency is 0.84, which is less than 1, the remaining relative frequency might correspond to the 'not sure' responses.\n\nRelative frequency for 'not sure' = 1 - 0.84 = 0.16\n\nTo find the percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.16 \u00d7 100% = 16%\n\nHowever, none of the provided options (A. 0.04, B. 0.05, C. 0.06, D. 0.07) match this calculation. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the question or the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'not sure' responses were excluded from the table, and the relative frequencies provided are based only on responses that fell within the specified salary ranges. In that case, without information on 'not sure' responses, it's impossible to determine their percentage from the given data.\n\nGiven the options provided (A. 0.04, B. 0.05, C. 0.06, D. 0.07), none of which correspond to the calculated 16%, it's possible that the question is misaligned with the table or additional information is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the relative frequencies provided are proportions, and the 'not sure' responses are a separate category not included in the table. If that's the case, and if the sum of the relative frequencies is 0.84, then the 'not sure' responses would indeed be 16%, but since that's not among the options, there might be an error in the question or the options provided.\n\nAnother possibility is that the relative frequencies are percentages, in which case the sum is already 84%, leaving 16% for 'not sure,' but again, this doesn't match the options.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the calculated 'not sure' percentage and the provided options, it's unclear how to proceed. The options seem to be decimal representations of percentages (e.g., 0.04 represents 4%), but even then, 0.16 would correspond to 16%, which isn't among them.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the calculation, the percentage of survey respondents who answered 'not sure' appears to be 16%, but since that doesn't match any of the options, the correct answer isn't evident from the given choices.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the above}} \\]"
