The table consists of 38 numbered slots, including numbers 1 through 36, plus an additional 0 and 00. Each number is either red or black, except for 0 and 00, which are green. The numbers are arranged in three columns and twelve rows, with each column containing 12 numbers. \n\nThe table also includes various betting areas:\n- At the bottom, there are sections for betting on \"1st Dozen\" (numbers 1-12), \"2nd Dozen\" (numbers 13-24), and \"3rd Dozen\" (numbers 25-36).\n- There are also sections for betting on \"1 to 18\" (low numbers) and \"19 to 36\" (high numbers).\n- Additionally, there are sections for betting on \"EVEN\" and \"ODD\" numbers.\n- There are also sections for betting on individual numbers, pairs of numbers that touch each other (e.g., 10-11 or 10-13), and groups of numbers.\n\nThe question asks about the probability of winning a bet on two numbers that touch each other on the table, such as 10-11 or 10-13.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> The casino game, roulette, allows the gambler to bet on the probability of a ball, which spins in the roulette wheel, landing on a particular color, number, or range of numbers.

                    "text": "To compute the probability of winning a bet on two numbers that touch each other on a standard American roulette table, we need to understand the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes for this specific type of bet.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a standard American roulette wheel has 38 numbered slots: numbers 1 through 36, plus 0 and 00. Each of these slots is equally likely to be where the ball lands.\n\nNow, the question is about betting on two numbers that touch each other on the table. Examples given are 10-11 or 10-13. This type of bet is known as a \"split\" bet in roulette terminology, where you're betting that the ball will land on one of two adjacent numbers.\n\nTo find the probability of winning this bet, we need to determine how many favorable outcomes there are compared to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes = 38 (since there are 38 slots).\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes = 2 (since you're betting on two specific numbers).\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\nProbability = 2 / 38\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\nProbability = 1 / 19\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1/38\nB. 2/38\nC. 3/38\nD. 6/38\n\nThe correct answer in the form presented is 2/38, which is option B.\n\nIt's important to note that while 2/38 simplifies to 1/19, the options provided seem to keep the denominator as 38, so 2/38 is the appropriate choice here.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2/38.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{38}} \\]"
