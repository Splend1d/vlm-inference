The data is presented in Table 12.14, which shows the goals scored per game for each team across five different observations.\n\nTo determine the degrees of freedom (df) for the numerator in an ANOVA test, we need to understand the structure of the ANOVA. In ANOVA, the numerator df represents the degrees of freedom between groups, which is related to the number of groups being compared.\n\nThe formula for the between-group degrees of freedom is:\n\n\\[ df_{\\text{between}} = k - 1 \\]\n\nwhere \\( k \\) is the number of groups.\n\nIn this case, there are four teams (Team 1, Team 2, Team 3, and Team 4), so \\( k = 4 \\).\n\nPlugging this into the formula:\n\n\\[ df_{\\text{between}} = 4 - 1 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the degrees of freedom for the numerator is 3.\n\nIt's important to note that the degrees of freedom for the numerator in ANOVA is always \\( k - 1 \\), where \\( k \\) is the number of groups. This is because we are comparing the variability between the group means to the variability within the groups.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
