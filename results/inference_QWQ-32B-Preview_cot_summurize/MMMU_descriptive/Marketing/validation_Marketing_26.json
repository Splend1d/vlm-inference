It has data divided into female and male categories, with subcategories on how they learned to play their instruments: self-taught, studied in school, and private instruction. Additionally, there are totals for each category.\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- **Female**:\n\n  - Self-taught: 12\n\n  - Studied in school: 38\n\n  - Private instruction: 22\n\n  - Total: 72\n\n- **Male**:\n\n  - Self-taught: 19\n\n  - Studied in school: 24\n\n  - Private instruction: 15\n\n  - Total: 58\n\n- **Total** (combined across genders):\n\n  - Self-taught: 31\n\n  - Studied in school: 62\n\n  - Private instruction: 37\n\n  - Total: 130\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a musician is female. To find this probability, we need to use the formula for probability:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{event}) = \\frac{\\text{number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{total number of possible outcomes}} \\]\n\nIn this context:\n\n- The event is selecting a female musician.\n\n- The number of favorable outcomes is the total number of female musicians.\n\n- The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of musicians (both female and male).\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Total number of female musicians = 72\n\n- Total number of musicians = 130\n\nTherefore, the probability that a musician is female is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{musician is female}) = \\frac{72}{130} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{72}{130} = 0.5538461538461539 \\]\n\nRounding this to two decimal places:\n\n\\[ 0.5538 \\approx 0.55 \\]\n\nThus, the probability that a musician is female is approximately 0.55.\n\nLooking at the provided options:\n\nA. 0.55\n\nB. 0.45\n\nC. 0.30\n\nD. 0.70\n\nThe correct answer is A. 0.55.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 0.55} \\]"
