The candy is weighed to determine if the average weight is at least the claimed 16 ounces. The results are in given in Table 2.57.

                    "text": "To find the mean weight of the bags of candy in the sample, I need to calculate the average of the weights provided in Table 2.57. The table lists eight weights in ounces:\n\n1. 15.65\n2. 16.09\n3. 16.01\n4. 15.99\n5. 16.02\n6. 16.00\n7. 15.98\n8. 16.08\n\nThe mean (average) is calculated by summing all the weights and then dividing by the number of bags.\n\nFirst, I'll add up all the weights:\n\n15.65 + 16.09 + 16.01 + 15.99 + 16.02 + 16.00 + 15.98 + 16.08\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\nStart with 15.65\n\n+16.09 = 31.74\n\n+16.01 = 47.75\n\n+15.99 = 63.74\n\n+16.02 = 79.76\n\n+16.00 = 95.76\n\n+15.98 = 111.74\n\n+16.08 = 127.82\n\nSo, the total weight of the eight bags is 127.82 ounces.\n\nNow, to find the mean, I'll divide the total weight by the number of bags, which is 8:\n\nMean = Total weight / Number of bags = 127.82 / 8\n\nLet's do the division:\n\n127.82 \u00f7 8 = 15.9775\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the mean weight is approximately 15.98 ounces.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 14.00 ounces\n\nB. 15.00 ounces\n\nC. 14.98 ounces\n\nD. 15.98 ounces\n\nThe correct answer is D. 15.98 ounces.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15.98} \\]"
