                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem about finding the Mean Square Factor for the weights of men from three different groups. I have the data from Table 12.13, which has three groups with five weights each. Let me first write down the weights again to make sure I have them correct.\n\nGroup 1: 216, 198, 240, 187, 176\n\nGroup 2: 202, 213, 284, 228, 210\n\nGroup 3: 170, 165, 182, 197, 201\n\nSo, we have three groups, and we need to test for the mean weight differences. The question is asking for the Mean Square Factor, which I believe is related to ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). In ANOVA, there are different mean squares, like Mean Square Between groups (MSB) and Mean Square Within groups (MSW). Maybe the Mean Square Factor refers to one of these or perhaps the F-statistic, which is the ratio of MSB to MSW.\n\nLet me recall the steps for performing a one-way ANOVA:\n\n1. Calculate the mean of each group.\n\n2. Calculate the overall mean.\n\n3. Calculate the Sum of Squares Between groups (SSB).\n\n4. Calculate the Sum of Squares Within groups (SSW).\n\n5. Calculate the degrees of freedom between groups (dfB) and within groups (dfW).\n\n6. Calculate the Mean Square Between (MSB = SSB / dfB) and Mean Square Within (MSW = SSW / dfW).\n\n7. Calculate the F-statistic (F = MSB / MSW).\n\n8. Compare the F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution table.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the Mean Square Factor, which might be MSB, MSW, or F. Given the options, they are all around 2,300 to 2,500, which seems more in line with MSB or MSW rather than the F-statistic, which is usually a ratio and could be less than 1 or greater than 1.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the mean of each group.\n\nGroup 1 mean:\n\n(216 + 198 + 240 + 187 + 176) / 5 = (216 + 198 = 414; 414 + 240 = 654; 654 + 187 = 841; 841 + 176 = 1,017) / 5 = 1,017 / 5 = 203.4\n\nGroup 2 mean:\n\n(202 + 213 + 284 + 228 + 210) / 5 = (202 + 213 = 415; 415 + 284 = 699; 699 + 228 = 927; 927 + 210 = 1,137) / 5 = 1,137 / 5 = 227.4\n\nGroup 3 mean:\n\n(170 + 165 + 182 + 197 + 201) / 5 = (170 + 165 = 335; 335 + 182 = 517; 517 + 197 = 714; 714 + 201 = 915) / 5 = 915 / 5 = 183.0\n\nNow, calculate the overall mean:\n\nTotal sum = 1,017 + 1,137 + 915 = 3,069\n\nTotal number of observations = 15\n\nOverall mean = 3,069 / 15 = 204.6\n\nNext, calculate the Sum of Squares Between groups (SSB):\n\nSSB = \u03a3n_i (mean_i - overall_mean)^2\n\nWhere n_i is the number of observations in group i, mean_i is the mean of group i, and overall_mean is the overall mean.\n\nFor Group 1: 5 * (203.4 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (-1.2)^2 = 5 * 1.44 = 7.2\n\nFor Group 2: 5 * (227.4 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (22.8)^2 = 5 * 519.84 = 2,599.2\n\nFor Group 3: 5 * (183.0 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (-21.6)^2 = 5 * 466.56 = 2,332.8\n\nSSB = 7.2 + 2,599.2 + 2,332.8 = 4,940.4 - Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, actually, n_i is the number of observations in group i, which is 5 for each group.\n\nGroup 1: 5 * (203.4 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (-1.2)^2 = 5 * 1.44 = 7.2 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGroup 2: 5 * (227.4 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * 22.8^2 = 5 * 519.84 = 2,599.2 \u2192 Correct.\n\nGroup 3: 5 * (183.0 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (-21.6)^2 = 5 * 466.56 = 2,332.8 \u2192 Correct.\n\nSSB = 7.2 + 2,599.2 + 2,332.8 = 4,940.4 - Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, calculate the Sum of Squares Within groups (SSW):\n\nSSW = \u03a3 \u03a3 (x_ij - mean_i)^2\n\nWhere x_ij is each observation in group i, and mean_i is the mean of group i.\n\nLet's calculate SSW for each group.\n\nGroup 1:\n\n(216 - 203.4)^2 = 12.6^2 = 158.76\n\n(198 - 203.4)^2 = (-5.4)^2 = 29.16\n\n(240 - 203.4)^2 = 36.6^2 = 1,339.56\n\n(187 - 203.4)^2 = (-16.4)^2 = 268.96\n\n(176 - 203.4)^2 = (-27.4)^2 = 750.76\n\nSum for Group 1: 158.76 + 29.16 + 1,339.56 + 268.96 + 750.76 = Let's add them step by step.\n\n158.76 + 29.16 = 187.92\n\n187.92 + 1,339.56 = 1,527.48\n\n1,527.48 + 268.96 = 1,796.44\n\n1,796.44 + 750.76 = 2,547.20\n\nGroup 2:\n\n(202 - 227.4)^2 = (-25.4)^2 = 645.16\n\n(213 - 227.4)^2 = (-14.4)^2 = 207.36\n\n(284 - 227.4)^2 = 56.6^2 = 3,203.56\n\n(228 - 227.4)^2 = 0.6^2 = 0.36\n\n(210 - 227.4)^2 = (-17.4)^2 = 302.76\n\nSum for Group 2: 645.16 + 207.36 + 3,203.56 + 0.36 + 302.76 = Let's add them step by step.\n\n645.16 + 207.36 = 852.52\n\n852.52 + 3,203.56 = 4,056.08\n\n4,056.08 + 0.36 = 4,056.44\n\n4,056.44 + 302.76 = 4,359.20\n\nGroup 3:\n\n(170 - 183)^2 = (-13)^2 = 169\n\n(165 - 183)^2 = (-18)^2 = 324\n\n(182 - 183)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\n\n(197 - 183)^2 = 14^2 = 196\n\n(201 - 183)^2 = 18^2 = 324\n\nSum for Group 3: 169 + 324 + 1 + 196 + 324 = Let's add them step by step.\n\n169 + 324 = 493\n\n493 + 1 = 494\n\n494 + 196 = 690\n\n690 + 324 = 1,014\n\nNow, total SSW = 2,547.20 + 4,359.20 + 1,014 = Let's add them step by step.\n\n2,547.20 + 4,359.20 = 6,906.40\n\n6,906.40 + 1,014 = 7,920.40\n\nNow, degrees of freedom between groups (dfB) = number of groups - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nDegrees of freedom within groups (dfW) = total number of observations - number of groups = 15 - 3 = 12\n\nNow, Mean Square Between (MSB) = SSB / dfB = 4,940.4 / 2 = 2,470.2\n\nMean Square Within (MSW) = SSW / dfW = 7,920.40 / 12 = 660.0333...\n\nNow, the F-statistic would be MSB / MSW = 2,470.2 / 660.0333 \u2248 3.74\n\nBut the question is asking for the Mean Square Factor, which could be either MSB or MSW or F, but given the options, it's likely MSB.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 2,309.6\n\nB. 2,325.5\n\nC. 2,328.1\n\nD. 2,469.6\n\nWait, my calculation for MSB is 2,470.2, which is closest to option D, 2,469.6.\n\nBut let me check my calculations again to make sure there are no errors.\n\nFirst, let's verify SSB.\n\nGroup 1: 5 * (203.4 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (-1.2)^2 = 5 * 1.44 = 7.2\n\nGroup 2: 5 * (227.4 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * 22.8^2 = 5 * 519.84 = 2,599.2\n\nGroup 3: 5 * (183 - 204.6)^2 = 5 * (-21.6)^2 = 5 * 466.56 = 2,332.8\n\nSSB = 7.2 + 2,599.2 + 2,332.8 = 4,940.4\n\nMSB = SSB / dfB = 4,940.4 / 2 = 2,470.2\n\nNow, SSW:\n\nGroup 1: 2,547.20\n\nGroup 2: 4,359.20\n\nGroup 3: 1,014\n\nTotal SSW = 2,547.20 + 4,359.20 + 1,014 = 7,920.40\n\nMSW = 7,920.40 / 12 = 660.0333...\n\nWait, but the options are around 2,300 to 2,500, and my MSB is 2,470.2, which is close to option D, 2,469.6.\n\nMaybe there's a rounding difference or a miscalculation in SSB or SSW.\n\nLet me check the calculations for SSB again.\n\nOverall mean = 3,069 / 15 = 204.6\n\nGroup 1 mean = 203.4\n\nGroup 2 mean = 227.4\n\nGroup 3 mean = 183.0\n\nSSB = 5*(203.4-204.6)^2 + 5*(227.4-204.6)^2 + 5*(183.0-204.6)^2\n\n= 5*(-1.2)^2 + 5*(22.8)^2 + 5*(-21.6)^2\n\n= 5*1.44 + 5*519.84 + 5*466.56\n\n= 7.2 + 2,599.2 + 2,332.8 = 4,940.4\n\nSeems correct.\n\nNow, MSB = 4,940.4 / 2 = 2,470.2\n\nOption D is 2,469.6, which is very close to my calculation.
