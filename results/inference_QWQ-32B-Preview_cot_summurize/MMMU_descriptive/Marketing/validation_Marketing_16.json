                    "text": "To find out what percent of adults flossed at most three times per week, we need to calculate the cumulative relative frequency up to three times per week and then convert that to a percentage.\n\nFirst, let's fill in the missing values in the table based on the information provided.\n\nWe have the following data:\n\n- For 0 times per week: frequency = 27, relative frequency = 0.4500\n\n- For 1 time per week: frequency = 18, relative frequency and cumulative relative frequency missing\n\n- For 3 times per week: cumulative relative frequency = 0.9333\n\n- For 6 times per week: frequency = 3, relative frequency = 0.0500\n\n- For 7 times per week: frequency = 1, relative frequency = 0.0167\n\nFirst, let's confirm the total number of observations. The problem states that there are 60 adults.\n\nTotal frequency should be 60.\n\nLet's check:\n\n27 (0 times) + 18 (1 time) + frequency for 3 times + 3 (6 times) + 1 (7 times) = 60\n\nSo, frequency for 3 times = 60 - (27 + 18 + 3 + 1) = 60 - 49 = 11\n\nNow, let's find the relative frequencies for the missing values.\n\nRelative frequency is frequency divided by total number of observations.\n\nFor 1 time per week:\n\nRelative frequency = 18 / 60 = 0.3000\n\nFor 3 times per week:\n\nRelative frequency = 11 / 60 \u2248 0.1833\n\nNow, let's calculate the cumulative relative frequencies.\n\nCumulative relative frequency is the sum of the relative frequencies up to that point.\n\nFor 0 times per week: cumulative relative frequency = 0.4500\n\nFor 1 time per week: cumulative relative frequency = 0.4500 + 0.3000 = 0.7500\n\nFor 3 times per week: cumulative relative frequency = 0.7500 + 0.1833 \u2248 0.9333 (which matches the given value)\n\nFor 6 times per week: cumulative relative frequency = 0.9333 + 0.0500 = 0.9833\n\nFor 7 times per week: cumulative relative frequency = 0.9833 + 0.0167 = 1.0000\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of adults who flossed at most three times per week. This corresponds to the cumulative relative frequency up to three times per week, which is 0.9333.\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\n0.9333 * 100 = 93.33%\n\nTherefore, the answer is 93.33%, which corresponds to option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
