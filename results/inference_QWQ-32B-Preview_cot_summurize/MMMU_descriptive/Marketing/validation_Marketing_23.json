                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. It's about determining the cumulative relative frequency for customers waiting less than 6.1 minutes in the checkout line at Lucky. The data is presented in a table with five columns and ten rows, each cell containing the waiting time in minutes for different customers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what cumulative relative frequency means. Cumulative relative frequency is the proportion of the total number of observations that are less than or equal to a particular value. In this case, it's the proportion of customers who waited less than 6.1 minutes.\n\nGiven that the data is ordered, I should be able to count the number of customers who waited less than 6.1 minutes and then divide that by the total number of customers to get the relative frequency.\n\nLet me first list out all the waiting times from the table:\n\nColumn 1: 0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75\n\nColumn 2: 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5\n\nColumn 3: 5, 5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6\n\nColumn 4: 6, 6, 6.25, 6.25, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.75, 6.75, 6.75\n\nColumn 5: 7.25, 7.25, 7.25, 7.75, 8, 8.25, 9.5, 9.5, 9.75, 10.75\n\nNow, since the table has five columns and ten rows, there should be a total of 50 data points (5 columns \u00d7 10 rows). Let me confirm that by counting the number of entries in each column:\n\n- Column 1: 10 entries\n\n- Column 2: 10 entries\n\n- Column 3: 10 entries\n\n- Column 4: 10 entries\n\n- Column 5: 10 entries\n\nTotal observations, n = 50.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of customers who waited less than 6.1 minutes. So, I'll go through each column and count the number of times the waiting time is less than 6.1 minutes.\n\nStarting with Column 1:\n\nAll values in Column 1 are less than 6.1:\n\n0.50, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.75, 3.75 \u2192 10 entries\n\nColumn 2:\n\nAll values in Column 2 are less than 6.1:\n\n4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, 4.75, 4.75, 5 \u2192 10 entries\n\nColumn 3:\n\nAll values in Column 3 are less than 6.1:\n\n5, 5.25, 5.25, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.75, 5.75, 6, 6 \u2192 10 entries\n\nWait, 6 is less than 6.1, so all 10 entries are included.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nValues in Column 4 are:\n\n6, 6, 6.25, 6.25, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.75, 6.75, 6.75\n\nHere, the first two values are 6, which is less than 6.1, and the rest are greater than or equal to 6.25, which is greater than 6.1. So, only the first two entries are less than 6.1.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nAll values in Column 5 are greater than or equal to 7.25, which is greater than 6.1, so none of these are included.\n\nNow, let's sum up the number of customers who waited less than 6.1 minutes:\n\nColumn 1: 10\n\nColumn 2: 10\n\nColumn 3: 10\n\nColumn 4: 2\n\nColumn 5: 0\n\nTotal number of customers who waited less than 6.1 minutes = 10 + 10 + 10 + 2 + 0 = 32\n\nNow, the cumulative relative frequency is the number of customers who waited less than 6.1 minutes divided by the total number of customers:\n\nRelative frequency = 32 / 50 = 0.64\n\nTherefore, the cumulative relative frequency for waiting less than 6.1 minutes is 0.64.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.62\n\nB. 0.63\n\nC. 0.64\n\nD. 0.65\n\nThe correct answer is C. 0.64.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
