The table has two columns: \"Starting cholesterol level\" and \"Ending cholesterol level.\" The rows contain the following data:\n\n- Starting cholesterol level: 140, Ending cholesterol level: 140\n- Starting cholesterol level: 220, Ending cholesterol level: 230\n- Starting cholesterol level: 110, Ending cholesterol level: 120\n- Starting cholesterol level: 240, Ending cholesterol level: 220\n- Starting cholesterol level: 200, Ending cholesterol level: 190\n- Starting cholesterol level: 180, Ending cholesterol level: 150\n- Starting cholesterol level: 190, Ending cholesterol level: 200\n- Starting cholesterol level: 360, Ending cholesterol level: 300\n- Starting cholesterol level: 280, Ending cholesterol level: 300\n- Starting cholesterol level: 260, Ending cholesterol level: 240\n\nBased on this data, we can see that some individuals had an increase in cholesterol levels, while others had a decrease. There is no clear pattern indicating a significant lowering or raising of cholesterol levels across all individuals. Therefore, at the 5% significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the low-fat diet significantly lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Ten individuals went on a low-fat diet for 12 weeks to lower their cholesterol. The data are recorded in Table 10.20. At the 5% significance level, do you think that their cholesterol levels were significantly lowered?\n\nA. there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks\nB. there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks\nC. not certain\n"

Some individuals experienced an increase in their cholesterol levels, while others saw a decrease. Given this variability and the absence of a clear trend indicating a significant overall reduction in cholesterol levels across all participants, it is reasonable to conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that the low-fat diet significantly lowered cholesterol levels at the 5% significance level.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate answer is:\n\nA. there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the medication lowered cholesterol levels after 12 weeks\n\n**Note:** The option mentions \"medication,\" which seems to be a typo or misstatement, as the context refers to a low-fat diet, not medication. Assuming it should refer to the diet, option A is still the correct choice based on the analysis of the data provided."
