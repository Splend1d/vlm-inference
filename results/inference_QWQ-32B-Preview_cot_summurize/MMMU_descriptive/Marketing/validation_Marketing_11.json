The first column is labeled \"x,\" which represents the number of years a new hire will stay with the company. The second column is labeled \"P(x),\" which represents the probability that a new hire will stay with the company for x years. The table lists the following values:\n\n- For x = 0, P(x) = 0.12\n- For x = 1, P(x) = 0.18\n- For x = 2, P(x) = 0.30\n- For x = 3, P(x) = 0.15\n- For x = 4, P(x) = 0.10\n- For x = 5, P(x) = 0.05\n\nThe value for P(x = 4) is 0.10.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> A company wants to evaluate its attrition rate, in other words, how long new hires stay with the company. Over the years, they have established the following probability distribution. Let X = the number of years a new hire will stay with the company. Let P(x) = the probability that a new hire will stay with the company x years. P(x = 4) = _______\n\n"
