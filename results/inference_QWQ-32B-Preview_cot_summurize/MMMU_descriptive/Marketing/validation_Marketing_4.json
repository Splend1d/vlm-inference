The y-axis represents frequency or count, with values ranging from 0 to 8. Each bar corresponds to a number on the x-axis, indicating the frequency of that number in the dataset. \n\n- The bar for the number 3 has a height of approximately 1.\n- The bar for the number 4 has a height of approximately 1.\n- The bar for the number 5 has a height of approximately 2.\n- The bar for the number 6 has a height of approximately 4.\n- The bar for the number 7 has a height of approximately 7.\n\nThe bars increase in height as the numbers increase, indicating that higher numbers occur more frequently than lower numbers. This suggests that the distribution is skewed right.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nDescribe the shape of this distribution. <image 1>\n\nA. The distribution is skewed left.\nB. The distribution is skewed right.\nC. The distribution is symmetric.\n"

This is because the bars increase in height as the numbers increase, indicating that higher numbers occur more frequently than lower numbers. In a right-skewed distribution, the tail is longer on the right side, and the bulk of the data is concentrated on the left. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The distribution is skewed right."
