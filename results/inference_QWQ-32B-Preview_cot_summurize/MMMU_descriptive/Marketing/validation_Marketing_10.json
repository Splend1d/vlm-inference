The first column is labeled \"x,\" and the second column is labeled \"P(x).\" The table lists the values of x from 0 to 5 along with their corresponding probabilities P(x). Here are the values:\n\n- For x = 0, P(x) = 0.03\n- For x = 1, P(x) = 0.50\n- For x = 2, P(x) = 0.24\n- For x = 3, P(x) is missing in the image.\n- For x = 4, P(x) = 0.07\n- For x = 5, P(x) = 0.04\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a customer rents three DVDs, which corresponds to finding the value of P(3) in the table.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> People visiting video rental stores often rent more than one DVD at a time. The probability distribution for DVD rentals per customer at Video To Go is given Table 4.5. There is five-video limit per customer at this store, so nobody ever rents more than five DVDs. Find the probability that a customer rents three DVDs.\n\nA. 0.11\nB. 0.12\nC. 0.55\nD. 0.77\n"

This is a fundamental property of probability distributions. Therefore, we can use this property to find the missing P(3).\n\nLet's denote the missing P(3) as P(3).\n\nAccording to the property of probability distributions:\n\nP(0) + P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) + P(5) = 1\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n0.03 + 0.50 + 0.24 + P(3) + 0.07 + 0.04 = 1\n\nNow, let's add up the known probabilities:\n\n0.03 + 0.50 = 0.53\n\n0.53 + 0.24 = 0.77\n\n0.77 + 0.07 = 0.84\n\n0.84 + 0.04 = 0.88\n\nSo, the sum of the known probabilities is 0.88.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n0.88 + P(3) = 1\n\nTo find P(3), we can subtract 0.88 from 1:\n\nP(3) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer rents three DVDs is 0.12.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.11\n\nB. 0.12\n\nC. 0.55\n\nD. 0.77\n\nThe correct answer is B. 0.12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
