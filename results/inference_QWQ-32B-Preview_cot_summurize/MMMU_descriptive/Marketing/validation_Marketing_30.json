The x-axis is labeled with numbers from 0 to 10. There is a shaded area under the curve between two vertical lines that intersect the x-axis at points labeled 6 and 7. This shaded area represents the probability or density function between these two points on the x-axis.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> What does the shaded area represent? P(___< x < ___)\n\nA. 5,6\nB. 5,7\nC. 6,7\nD. 6,8\n"

Since the shaded area represents the probability or density function between these two points on the x-axis, it corresponds to the probability that the random variable x falls between 6 and 7.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 6,7"
