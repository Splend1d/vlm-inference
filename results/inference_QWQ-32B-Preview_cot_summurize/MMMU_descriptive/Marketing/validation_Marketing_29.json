The table has five columns: Name, Single, Double, Triple, Home run, and TOTAL HITS. Each row corresponds to one player and provides the number of hits in each category for that player. The last row provides the total number of hits across all categories for all players combined. Here are the details:\n\n- **Babe Ruth**: \n  - Single: 1,517\n  - Double: 506\n  - Triple: 136\n  - Home run: 714\n  - TOTAL HITS: 2,873\n\n- **Jackie Robinson**:\n  - Single: 1,054\n  - Double: 273\n  - Triple: 54\n  - Home run: 137\n  - TOTAL HITS: 1,518\n\n- **Ty Cobb**:\n  - Single: 3,603\n  - Double: 174\n  - Triple: 295\n  - Home run: 114\n  - TOTAL HITS: 4,189\n\n- **Hank Aaron**:\n  - Single: 2,294\n  - Double: 624\n  - Triple: 98\n  - Home run: 755\n  - TOTAL HITS: 3,771\n\n- **TOTAL**:\n  - Single: 8,471\n  - Double: 1,577\n  - Triple: 583\n  - Home run: 1,720\n  - TOTAL HITS: 12,351\n\nThe table also includes a note at the bottom indicating that the data was obtained from www.baseball-almanac.com.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> The table of data obtained from www.baseball-almanac.com shows hit information for four well known baseball players. Suppose that one hit from the table is randomly selected. Find P(hit was made by Babe Ruth).\n\nA. 1518/2873\nB. 2873/12351\nC. 583/12351\nD. 4189/12351\n"
