                    "text": "To calculate the punching shear bearing capacity \\( F_l \\) of the cushion cap, we need to follow the steps outlined in the relevant structural engineering standards, such as Eurocode 2 or ACI codes. However, since the specific code is not mentioned, I'll proceed with a general approach based on Eurocode 2 provisions.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Punching Shear Area\n\nFirst, we need to determine the area subjected to punching shear. For a square column on a square pile cap, the punching shear perimeter is considered around the column.\n\nGiven:\n- Column section size: \\( 0.6 \\, \\text{m} \\times 0.6 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Pile cap dimensions: \\( 1.5 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Effective height: \\( h_0 = 1050 \\, \\text{mm} = 1.05 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- Concrete tensile strength: \\( f_t = 1.27 \\, \\text{MPa} \\)\n\nThe punching shear perimeter \\( u \\) is calculated as:\n\\[ u = \\pi \\times (b_c + d) \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( b_c \\) is the shorter side of the column (0.6 m)\n- \\( d \\) is the effective depth (1.05 m)\n\nHowever, for a square column and pile cap, it's more appropriate to use the peripheral area considering the cap's edges.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Punching Shear Resistance\n\nThe punching shear resistance \\( V_c \\) is given by:\n\\[ V_c = \\alpha \\times \\frac{f_t \\times b_c \\times h_0}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\alpha \\) is a coefficient depending on the type of member and reinforcement (assuming 1 for simplicity)\n- \\( f_t \\) is the concrete tensile strength\n- \\( b_c \\) is the shorter side of the column\n- \\( h_0 \\) is the effective depth\n- \\( \\gamma_c \\) is the partial safety factor for concrete (usually 1.5)\n\nHowever, in Eurocode 2, the formula for punching shear resistance is:\n\\[ V_{c,ed} \\leq \\frac{\\alpha \\times b_c \\times h_0 \\times f_t}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nBut to find the capacity \\( F_l \\), we rearrange to solve for the load.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\\[ F_l = \\alpha \\times b_c \\times h_0 \\times f_t / \\gamma_c \\]\n\nAssuming \\( \\alpha = 1 \\) and \\( \\gamma_c = 1.5 \\):\n\n\\[ F_l = 1 \\times 0.6 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1.05 \\, \\text{m} \\times 1.27 \\, \\text{MPa} / 1.5 \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n1. Multiply \\( b_c \\) and \\( h_0 \\):\n\\[ 0.6 \\times 1.05 = 0.63 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\]\n\n2. Multiply by \\( f_t \\):\n\\[ 0.63 \\times 1.27 = 0.7991 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\n3. Divide by \\( \\gamma_c \\):\n\\[ 0.7991 / 1.5 = 0.532733 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\nThis seems too low, indicating a possible misunderstanding in the formula application. Let's consider the perimeter approach.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Perimeter Method\n\nIn some codes, the punching shear resistance is based on the perimeter:\n\n\\[ V_c = \\frac{f_t \\times u \\times h_0}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( u = 4 \\times (b_c + d) \\) for a square column on a square cap\n\nCalculate \\( u \\):\n\n\\[ u = 4 \\times (0.6 + 1.05) = 4 \\times 1.65 = 6.6 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ V_c = \\frac{1.27 \\times 6.6 \\times 1.05}{1.5} \\]\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n1. Multiply \\( f_t \\), \\( u \\), and \\( h_0 \\):\n\\[ 1.27 \\times 6.6 \\times 1.05 = 1.27 \\times 6.93 = 8.7911 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\n2. Divide by \\( \\gamma_c \\):\n\\[ 8.7911 / 1.5 = 5.86073 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\nThis still seems low compared to typical structural values, suggesting a potential error in the approach.\n\n### Correct Approach: Eurocode 2 Clause 5.10\n\nAccording to Eurocode 2, the design shear force \\( V_{c,ed} \\) should not exceed:\n\n\\[ V_{c,rd} = \\frac{\\alpha \\times b_c \\times h_0 \\times f_t}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nBut for punching shear, the perimeter approach is used:\n\n\\[ V_{c,rd} = \\frac{\\alpha \\times u \\times h_0 \\times f_t}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( u \\) is the perimeter of the critical section\n\nFor a square column, the critical perimeter is:\n\n\\[ u = 4 \\times (b_c + d) \\]\n\nBut in Eurocode 2, for a square column, the critical perimeter is:\n\n\\[ u = 2 \\times (b_c + d) \\]\n\nAssuming \\( d = h_0 \\), then:\n\n\\[ u = 2 \\times (0.6 + 1.05) = 2 \\times 1.65 = 3.3 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nThen:\n\n\\[ V_{c,rd} = \\frac{1 \\times 3.3 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.27}{1.5} \\]\n\nCalculate:\n\n1. Multiply \\( u \\), \\( h_0 \\), and \\( f_t \\):\n\\[ 3.3 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.27 = 3.3 \\times 1.3335 = 4.39995 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\n2. Divide by \\( \\gamma_c \\):\n\\[ 4.39995 / 1.5 = 2.9333 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\nThis is still seems too low. There might be a misunderstanding in the application of the formula.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Approach\n\nPerhaps the area approach is more appropriate. The punching shear resistance can also be expressed in terms of area:\n\n\\[ V_{c,rd} = \\frac{\\alpha \\times A_{pt} \\times f_t}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A_{pt} \\) is the punching shear area.\n\nFor a square column on a square cap, the punching shear area is:\n\n\\[ A_{pt} = b_c \\times h_0 \\]\n\nBut this seems to be conflicting with the perimeter approach. Let's refer to the standard formula.\n\n### Standard Formula for Punching Shear\n\nAccording to Eurocode 2, the design shear force \\( V_{c,ed} \\) should not exceed the design shear resistance \\( V_{c,rd} \\), given by:\n\n\\[ V_{c,rd} = \\frac{\\alpha \\times u \\times h_0 \\times f_t}{\\gamma_c} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( u \\) is the perimeter of the critical section\n- For a square column, \\( u = 2 \\times (b_c + d) \\)\n\nGiven this, let's recalculate:\n\n\\[ u = 2 \\times (0.6 + 1.05) = 3.3 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\n\\[ V_{c,rd} = \\frac{1 \\times 3.3 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.27}{1.5} = \\frac{4.40085}{1.5} = 2.9339 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\nThis result seems inconsistent with expected structural values, suggesting a possible error in the application of the formula.\n\n### Considering Pile Reactions\n\nPerhaps the pile reactions need to be considered in the calculation. In a pile cap, the loads are transferred through the piles, and the punching shear is influenced by the pile positions.\n\nGiven that it's a five-pile cap, the piles are likely arranged in a quincunx pattern. However, without specific load values or pile reactions, it's challenging to proceed accurately.\n\n### Alternative Approach: Using Code-Specific Formulas\n\nReferencing a different code, such as ACI 318, the punching shear resistance is given by:\n\n\\[ V_{n} = \\phi \\times \\frac{A_v \\times f_v}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\nBut this seems not directly applicable here.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the confusion and inconsistencies in applying the formulas, it's crucial to refer to the specific code provisions applicable to the problem. Assuming Eurocode 2, the perimeter approach for punching shear seems to be the correct method, but the calculated value appears unreasonably low, suggesting a possible misunderstanding in the application.\n\nTherefore, based on the perimeter method:\n\n\\[ F_l = \\frac{\\alpha \\times u \\times h_0 \\times f_t}{\\gamma_c} = \\frac{1 \\times 3.3 \\times 1.05 \\times 1.27}{1.5} \\approx 2.93 \\, \\text{kN} \\]\n\nHowever, this value seems too low for a structural application, indicating a need to revisit the assumptions or the formula used.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2934 \\, \\text{kN}} \\]\n\nNote: The answer is provided in kilonewtons (kN), assuming the units are consistent throughout the calculation. However, given the discrepancy in the calculated value, further verification is recommended."
