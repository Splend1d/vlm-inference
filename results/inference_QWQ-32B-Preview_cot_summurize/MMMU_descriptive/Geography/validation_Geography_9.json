The graph is divided into two sides: the left side represents males, and the right side represents females. The vertical axis indicates age, ranging from 0 to 110 years, while the horizontal axis represents the population in thousands, ranging from -4 to 4 thousand.\n\nThe graph shows a typical population pyramid with a wider base, indicating a larger number of younger individuals, and a narrower top, indicating fewer older individuals. The data points are represented by blue lines, labeled as \"observed,\" which likely indicate the actual observed population data.\n\nGiven the shape of the population pyramid, it suggests a developing country with a relatively young population and high birth rates. This type of demographic structure is often seen in countries with growing populations and lower life expectancy.\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. Kenya\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n <image 1> \nThis population graphs shows demographic info mation for:\n\nA. Kenya\nB. Kiribati\nC. Kuweit\nD. Kyrgyzstan\n"

Among the options given\u2014Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, and Kyrgyzstan\u2014the description most aligns with Kenya.\n\nKenya is known for having a young population and higher birth rates, which would result in a population pyramid with a broad base and a narrower top, matching the description provided. Kiribati is a small island nation with a smaller population, Kuwait is an oil-rich country with a significant expatriate population, and Kyrgyzstan is a Central Asian country with its own demographic characteristics, but Kenya fits the description of a developing country with a young population best among these options.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Kenya."
