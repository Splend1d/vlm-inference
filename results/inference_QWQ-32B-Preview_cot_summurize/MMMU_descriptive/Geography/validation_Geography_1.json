                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem about torque on a rod with multiple torsion couples applied at different points. Let's see if I can figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There's a fixed straight rod with torsion couples applied at various points along its length. The rod is divided into sections, and I need to find the torque at specific sections, labeled 1-1 and 2-2.\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- At section 1-1, there's a torsion couple of 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- Between sections 1-1 and 2-2, there's an additional torsion couple of 4.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- At section 2-2, there's another torsion couple of 2 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- Further along the rod, there's a torsion couple of 5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nThe key here is to determine the torque at sections 1-1 and 2-2 by considering the cumulative effect of all the torsion couples acting up to those points.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Imagine the rod extending from left to right, fixed at the left end. Torsion couples are applied at different points along its length.\n\nTo find the torque at a particular section, I think I need to sum up all the torsion couples from the fixed end up to that section.\n\nLet's start with section 1-1:\n\n- The first torsion couple is 1 kN\u00b7m at section 1-1.\n\nSo, the torque at section 1-1 is 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\nWait, but the options have different values, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back, the description says \"at section 1-1, there is a torsion couple of 1 kN\u00b7m.\" But perhaps there are other couples applied before reaching section 1-1.\n\nHmm, the problem mentions that the rod is fixed at the left end and is subjected to a torsion couple. Maybe there's an initial torsion couple at the fixed end, and then additional ones at 1-1, between 1-1 and 2-2, at 2-2, and further along.\n\nLet me try to list out all the torsion couples in order along the rod:\n\n1. At the fixed end: unknown torsion couple (let's call it T0).\n\n2. At section 1-1: 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\n3. Between 1-1 and 2-2: 4.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\n4. At section 2-2: 2 kN\u00b7m.\n\n5. Further along: 5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the fixed straight rod at the left end is subjected to a torsion couple,\" so perhaps T0 is the first couple applied at the fixed end.\n\nI need to find the torque at sections 1-1 and 2-2.\n\nMaybe I should consider the direction of these couples. Are they all in the same direction, or do some of them oppose the others?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify the directions, so perhaps I can assume that all couples are in the same direction, say clockwise, and define positive torque as clockwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the signs indicate the direction: positive for clockwise and negative for counterclockwise.\n\nLooking at the options, there are both positive and negative torques, so perhaps the direction matters.\n\nLet's assume positive torque is clockwise.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence of torsion couples along the rod:\n\n- Fixed end: T0 (unknown)\n\n- Section 1-1: +1 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\n- Between 1-1 and 2-2: +4.5 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\n- Section 2-2: +2 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\n- Further along: +5 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\nWait, but the options have negative torques, so maybe some of these couples are counterclockwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rod is subjected to external couples, and the torques in the options are the internal torques in the rod.\n\nIn that case, the internal torque in the rod at a section is equal and opposite to the sum of all external couples applied up to that section.\n\nThis might be more complicated than I thought.\n\nLet me recall the basic principle for torsion in rods: the torque at any cross-section is equal to the algebraic sum of all applied torsion couples (moments) up to that section.\n\nSo, to find the torque at section 1-1, I need to sum all the torsion couples from the fixed end up to section 1-1.\n\nSimilarly, for section 2-2, sum all the torsion couples from the fixed end up to section 2-2.\n\nBut the problem states that the rod is fixed at the left end and is subjected to a torsion couple. So, there must be an applied couple at the fixed end.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"fixed straight rod at the left end is subjected to a torsion couple\" means that there is an applied torsion couple at the fixed end, and then additional ones at 1-1, between 1-1 and 2-2, at 2-2, and further along.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rod is fixed at one end and free at the other, and various torsion couples are applied at different points along its length.\n\nIn that case, the internal torque at any section is equal to the sum of all applied external torsion couples from the fixed end up to that section.\n\nGiven that, let's try to calculate the torque at section 1-1:\n\nTorque at section 1-1 = sum of all external couples from the fixed end up to section 1-1.\n\nSimilarly, torque at section 2-2 = sum of all external couples from the fixed end up to section 2-2.\n\nBut according to the description:\n\n- At section 1-1: 1 kN\u00b7m\n\n- Between 1-1 and 2-2: 4.5 kN\u00b7m\n\n- At section 2-2: 2 kN\u00b7m\n\n- Further along: 5 kN\u00b7m\n\nAssuming these are all external applied couples, then:\n\nTorque at section 1-1 = couple at fixed end + couple at section 1-1\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the fixed straight rod at the left end is subjected to a torsion couple,\" but doesn't specify its magnitude.\n\nHmm, maybe the couple at the fixed end is zero, since it's fixed.\n\nWait, no. If the rod is fixed at one end, and torsion couples are applied at various points along its length, then the internal torque at any section is equal to the sum of all external couples up to that section.\n\nBut in that case, without knowing the couple at the fixed end, I can't determine the torques at sections 1-1 and 2-2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the couple at the fixed end is reactive, balancing the sum of the applied couples.\n\nWait, in torsion, the reactive torque at the fixed end would be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the sum of all applied torsion couples.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nLet's assume that the rod is fixed at one end, and external torsion couples are applied at sections 1-1, between 1-1 and 2-2, at 2-2, and further along.\n\nThen, the internal torque at any section is equal to the sum of all external couples applied from the fixed end up to that section.\n\nGiven that, let's list the applied couples in order along the rod:\n\n- At section 1-1: +1 kN\u00b7m\n\n- Between 1-1 and 2-2: +4.5 kN\u00b7m\n\n- At section 2-2: +2 kN\u00b7m\n\n- Further along: +5 kN\u00b7m\n\nNow, torque at section 1-1: sum of all couples up to section 1-1, which is just the couple at section 1-1, so 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\nTorque at section 2-2: sum of couples up to section 2-2, which is 1 kN\u00b7m + 4.5 kN\u00b7m + 2 kN\u00b7m = 7.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have 7.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLooking back at the description:\n\n- At section 1-1, there is a torsion couple of 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- Between sections 1-1 and 2-2, there is an additional torsion couple of 4.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- At section 2-2, there is another torsion couple of 2 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- Further along the rod, there is a torsion couple of 5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nSo, perhaps the sequence is:\n\n- Start at fixed end.\n\n- To section 1-1: couple of 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- From 1-1 to 2-2: additional couple of 4.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- At 2-2: another couple of 2 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- Further along: couple of 5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nAssuming that \"further along\" is beyond section 2-2.\n\nTherefore, torques at sections:\n\n- Section 1-1: sum of couples up to section 1-1, which is 1 kN\u00b7m.\n\n- Section 2-2: sum of couples up to section 2-2, which is 1 kN\u00b7m + 4.5 kN\u00b7m + 2 kN\u00b7m = 7.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nBut the options don't include 7.5 kN\u00b7m, which makes me think I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the rod is subjected to these couples in a different way.\n\nLet me consider that the rod is fixed at one end, and the couples are applied along its length, and there might be a reaction torque at the fixed end.\n\nIn that case, the internal torque at any section is equal to the sum of the external couples up to that section.\n\nBut if there's a reaction torque at the fixed end, then the sum of all external couples should be zero for the rod to be in equilibrium.\n\nWait, but the problem is about torque at specific sections, not necessarily about equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rod is not in equilibrium, and we're just to find the internal torques at sections 1-1 and 2-2 based on the applied couples.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the internal torque at section 1-1 is equal to the applied couple at that section, and at section 2-2, it's the sum of all couples up to that section.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the options provided.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 12.0kN.m, -3kN.m\n\nB. -2.5kN.m, -3kN.m\n\nC. -2.5kN.m, -3kN.m\n\nD. 2.5kN.m, -3kN.m\n\nWait, options B and C are the same, which is probably a typo.\n\nGiven that, and considering my earlier calculations don't match any of the options, I must be missing something fundamental.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the direction of the couples.\n\nLet's assume that clockwise couples are positive and counterclockwise are negative.\n\nIf the rod is fixed at the left end and subjected to a torsion couple, say T0, then the internal torque at any section is equal to the sum of all external couples up to that section.\n\nGiven that, and knowing the torques at sections 1-1 and 2-2, I might need to set up equations to solve for T0.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- T0: couple at the fixed end.\n\n- At section 1-1: +1 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\n- Between 1-1 and 2-2: +4.5 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\n- At section 2-2: +2 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\n- Further along: +5 kN\u00b7m (clockwise)\n\nThen, torque at section 1-1: T0 + 1 kN\u00b7m\n\nTorque at section 2-2: T0 + 1 kN\u00b7m + 4.5 kN\u00b7m + 2 kN\u00b7m = T0 + 7.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nBut the options have specific values for these torques, so perhaps I can set up equations based on the options.\n\nLooking at option A: 12.0 kN\u00b7m and -3 kN\u00b7m\n\nSo, if torque at section 1-1 is 12.0 kN\u00b7m and at section 2-2 is -3 kN\u00b7m, then:\n\nT0 + 1 = 12.0 => T0 = 11.0 kN\u00b7m\n\nAnd T0 + 7.5 = -3 => 11.0 + 7.5 = 18.5, which is not equal to -3. So inconsistency.\n\nOption B: -2.5 kN\u00b7m and -3 kN\u00b7m\n\nT0 + 1 = -2.5 => T0 = -3.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nT0 + 7.5 = -3 => -3.5 + 7.5 = 4.0, which is not equal to -3. Inconsistent.\n\nOption D: 2.5 kN\u00b7m and -3 kN\u00b7m\n\nT0 + 1 = 2.5 => T0 = 1.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nT0 + 7.5 = -3 => 1.5 + 7.5 = 9.0, which is not equal to -3. Inconsistent.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to make sense with this approach.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the torque at a section is equal to the sum of all couples from the fixed end up to that section, but taking into account the direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the torque at section 1-1 is the sum of the couple at the fixed end and the couple at section 1-1, and the torque at section 2-2 is the sum of all couples up to section 2-2.\n\nBut again, without knowing the couple at the fixed end, I can't determine the torques.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the rod is in static equilibrium, so the sum of all couples is zero.\n\nIn that case, T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 + 5 = 0 => T0 = -12.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nThen, torque at section 1-1: T0 + 1 = -12.5 + 1 = -11.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nTorque at section 2-2: T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 = -12.5 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 = -5.0 kN\u00b7m\n\nBut none of the options match this.\n\nI must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that the rod is fixed at one end, and torsion couples are applied at various points along its length, and we need to find the internal torques at sections 1-1 and 2-2.\n\nIn torsion analysis, the internal torque at any cross-section is equal to the sum of all applied external torques from the fixed end up to that section.\n\nGiven that, let's define the applied torques:\n\n- At the fixed end: assume it's T0.\n\n- At section 1-1: +1 kN\u00b7m\n\n- Between 1-1 and 2-2: +4.5 kN\u00b7m\n\n- At section 2-2: +2 kN\u00b7m\n\n- Further along: +5 kN\u00b7m\n\nThen, torque at section 1-1: T0 + 1 kN\u00b7m\n\nTorque at section 2-2: T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 = T0 + 7.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nNow, if the rod is in equilibrium, the sum of all torques should be zero, so T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 + 5 = T0 + 12.5 = 0 => T0 = -12.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nThen, torque at section 1-1: -12.5 + 1 = -11.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nTorque at section 2-2: -12.5 + 7.5 = -5.0 kN\u00b7m\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe the \"further along\" couple of 5 kN\u00b7m is not included up to section 2-2.\n\nIn that case, sum of torques up to section 2-2 would be T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 = T0 + 7.5\n\nAnd sum of all torques is T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 + 5 = T0 + 12.5 = 0 => T0 = -12.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nThen, torque at section 1-1: -12.5 + 1 = -11.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nTorque at section 2-2: -12.5 + 7.5 = -5.0 kN\u00b7m\n\nStill doesn't match the options.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nLet me consider that the rod is not necessarily in equilibrium, and perhaps the torques at sections 1-1 and 2-2 are simply the sums of the applied couples up to those sections, without considering a reaction torque at the fixed end.\n\nIn that case:\n\nTorque at section 1-1: +1 kN\u00b7m\n\nTorque at section 2-2: 1 + 4.5 + 2 = 7.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nBut this doesn't match any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the torque at section 1-1 is the sum of all couples except those beyond section 1-1.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the direction of the couples.\n\nSuppose that the couple at the fixed end is in the opposite direction to the others.\n\nLet's assume the applied couples are clockwise (+), and the reaction at the fixed end is counterclockwise (-).\n\nThen, T0 is negative, and the applied couples are positive.\n\nIn equilibrium, T0 + 1 + 4.5 + 2 + 5 = 0 => T0 = -12.5 kN\u00b7m\n\nThen, torque at section 1-1: T0 + 1 = -12"
