Each subclass is further broken down into specific rock types with accompanying photographs.\n\n1. **Clastic Subclass**:\n   - **Sandstone**: Composed of sand-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Siltstone**: Composed of silt-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Conglomerate**: Composed of rounded or sub-rounded gravel-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Mudstone**: Composed of very fine-grained rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Claystone**: Composed of clay-sized rock and mineral fragments.\n   - **Shale**: Composed of clay-sized rock and mineral fragments, often breaking into thin layers.\n\n2. **Chemically Precipitated Subclass**:\n   - **Limestone**: Formed by chemical precipitation from seawater, sometimes with the help of micro-organisms.\n   - **Dolomite**: Similar to limestone but containing magnesium carbonate.\n   - **Chert**: A microcrystalline form of quartz.\n   - **Evaporites**: Formed from the evaporation of seawater.\n\n3. **Organic Subclass**:\n   - **Coal**: Formed from organic material.\n   - **Petroleum (mineral fuel)**: Formed from organic material.\n   - **Natural gas (mineral fuel)**: Formed from organic material.\n\nEach rock type is accompanied by a photograph showing its appearance in natural settings. The photographs are credited to various sources, including Bill Hatcher/NG Image Collection, Walter Meayers Edwards/NG Image Collection, Norbert Rosing/NG Image Collection, and Melissa Farlow/NG Image Collection.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe following statements of the rocks in <image 1> are all correct EXCEPT\n\nA. Siltstone is cemented silt particles\nB. Shale is Clay, breaking easily into flat flakes and plates\nC. Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz\nD. None\n"

Each subclass has specific rock types with photographs. The question is to identify which statement about the rocks in image 1 is incorrect.\n\nLet's look at each option:\n\nA. Siltstone is cemented silt particles.\n\nFrom the description, siltstone is described as \"Composed of silt-sized rock and mineral fragments.\" Typically, siltstone is indeed composed of silt-sized particles that are cemented together. So, this statement seems correct.\n\nB. Shale is Clay, breaking easily into flat flakes and plates.\n\nThe description says: \"Shale: Composed of clay-sized rock and mineral fragments, often breaking into thin layers.\" Shale is known for its laminar or plate-like structure, which allows it to break easily into flat pieces. So, this statement appears to be correct.\n\nC. Chert is Silica, a microcrystalline form of quartz.\n\nThe description mentions: \"Chert: A microcrystalline form of quartz.\" This matches the statement, so it seems correct.\n\nD. None\n\nThis option suggests that none of the above statements are incorrect, meaning all of them are correct.\n\nGiven that options A, B, and C all seem correct based on the description and general knowledge of sedimentary rocks, the answer should be D. None.\n\nHowever, to ensure there isn't a trick or misinterpretation, let's double-check each statement:\n\n- Siltstone: Composed of silt-sized particles, which are typically cemented. So, A is correct.\n\n- Shale: Composed of clay-sized particles and breaks into thin layers, which matches the description. So, B is correct.\n\n- Chert: Indeed a microcrystalline form of quartz. So, C is correct.\n\nTherefore, since all statements are correct, the answer is D. None.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
