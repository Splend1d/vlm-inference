The minerals listed are:\n\n1. Feldspar:\n   - Hardness: 6-6.5\n   - Specific Gravity: 2.5-2.8\n   - Luster/Color: Nonmetallic/colorless or white\n\n2. Fluorite:\n   - Hardness: 4\n   - Specific Gravity: 3-3.3\n   - Luster/Color: Nonmetallic/yellow, blue, purple, rose, green, or brown\n\n3. Galena:\n   - Hardness: 2.5-2.75\n   - Specific Gravity: 7.4-7.6\n   - Luster/Color: Metallic/grayish black\n\n4. Quartz:\n   - Hardness: 7\n   - Specific Gravity: 2.65\n   - Luster/Color: Nonmetallic/colorless in pure form\n\nBased on this information, the hardest mineral listed in the table is quartz, with a hardness of 7.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat is the hardest mineral in <image 1>? \n\nA. feldspar\nB. fluorite\nC. galena\nD. quartz\n"
