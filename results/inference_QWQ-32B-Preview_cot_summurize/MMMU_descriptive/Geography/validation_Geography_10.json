The rectangle is oriented such that its longer sides are aligned horizontally and vertically.\n- **Section (b)**: This section shows a square with a circular hole cut out of its center. The circle is perfectly centered within the square.\n\nBoth sections have labels indicating dimensions:\n- In section (a), the circle has a radius labeled as \\( r \\).\n- In section (b), the square has sides labeled as \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), and the circle has a radius labeled as \\( r \\).\n\nThe question asks to compare the moments of inertia \\( I \\) for these two sections.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe figure shows (a) and (b) two sections, (a) is a circle of rectangular holes, (b) a square u and v with circular holes are the spindle of the center. There are four answers about the moment of inertia L. and I, among which the correct is<image 1>\n\nA. l(a)>1,(a);l(b)=l(b)\nB. l.(a) >L(a);l(b)>l,(b)\nC. l.(a) >2(a);l(b)>l,(b)\nD. l.(a) >L(a);l(b)>2,(b)\n"
