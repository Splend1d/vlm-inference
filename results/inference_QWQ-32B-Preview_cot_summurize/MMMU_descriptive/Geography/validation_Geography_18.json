Both thermometers have temperature scales marked in degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) and degrees Celsius (\u00b0C). \n\n- The top thermometer has a scale that ranges from -100\u00b0F to 212\u00b0F. The freezing point of water is marked at 32\u00b0F, and the boiling point of water is marked at 212\u00b0F.\n- The bottom thermometer has a scale that ranges from -80\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C. The freezing point of water is marked at 0\u00b0C, and the boiling point of water is marked at 100\u00b0C.\n\nThe bottom thermometer, which uses the Celsius scale, represents the international standard for temperature measurement.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich thermometer in <image 1> stands for the international standard?\n\nA. The top one\nB. The bottom one\n"

This is because it uses the Celsius scale, which is the standard scale used in most countries around the world for scientific and everyday temperature measurements. The Celsius scale sets the freezing point of water at 0 degrees and the boiling point at 100 degrees under standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe top thermometer uses the Fahrenheit scale, which is primarily used in the United States and a few other countries. On this scale, the freezing point of water is at 32 degrees and the boiling point at 212 degrees under standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. The bottom one"
