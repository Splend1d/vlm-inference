                    "text": "To determine the pore water pressure at point G in the earth dam, we need to understand the relationship between the equipotential lines and the hydraulic head. The equipotential lines represent lines of constant hydraulic head, and the interval between them indicates the change in hydraulic head.\n\nGiven that there are m=22 equipotential lines evenly spaced, and point G is on the 20th equipotential line, we can infer that the hydraulic head at point G is related to its position relative to the downstream and the total storage height.\n\nFirst, let's understand the distribution of the equipotential lines. Since there are 22 equipotential lines, the interval between each line represents a change in hydraulic head. If we assume that the downstream is at zero hydraulic head (equipotential line 1), then each equipotential line represents an increase in hydraulic head.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the equipotential lines are numbered from 1 to 22, and point G is on the 20th equipotential line. This suggests that the numbering starts from the downstream, where the hydraulic head is lowest, to the upstream, where the hydraulic head is highest.\n\nThe storage height of the dam is 16 meters, which likely corresponds to the total hydraulic head difference between the upstream and downstream.\n\nSince there are 22 equipotential lines, the hydraulic head difference per equipotential line is:\n\n\u0394h = total hydraulic head / number of intervals\n\nNote that the number of intervals between equipotential lines is one less than the number of equipotential lines. However, in this context, since the equipotential lines are numbered from 1 to 22, there are 21 intervals between them.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the interval of the water head gradient equipotential lines is evenly divided into m=22, which might imply that the hydraulic head difference per equipotential line is:\n\n\u0394h = H / m\n\nwhere H is the total hydraulic head.\n\nGiven that the storage height is 16 meters, and assuming that this is equivalent to the total hydraulic head, we have:\n\n\u0394h = 16 m / 22 \u2248 0.727 m per equipotential line\n\nHowever, this seems a bit low, as typically, the hydraulic head difference per equipotential line would be larger. Alternatively, perhaps the total hydraulic head is different from the storage height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equipotential lines are spaced equally in terms of hydraulic gradient, not hydraulic head.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The equipotential lines represent constant hydraulic head, and the spacing between them indicates the hydraulic gradient.\n\nThe hydraulic gradient i is defined as:\n\ni = dh / dl\n\nwhere dh is the change in hydraulic head and dl is the distance along the flow path.\n\nIn a homogeneous dam, the flow is governed by Darcy's law, and the equipotential lines are typically closer together where the hydraulic gradient is higher.\n\nHowever, in this problem, it is stated that the equipotential lines are evenly spaced, which might imply that the hydraulic gradient is uniform throughout the dam.\n\nIf the hydraulic gradient is uniform, then the pore water pressure varies linearly with depth.\n\nGiven that, we can consider the pore water pressure at any point as:\n\nu = \u03b3_w * h\n\nwhere \u03b3_w is the unit weight of water, and h is the hydraulic head at that point.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the hydraulic head at point G.\n\nGiven that there are 22 equipotential lines, numbered from 1 to 22, with point G on the 20th line, we can assume that the hydraulic head increases linearly from the downstream to the upstream.\n\nIf equipotential line 1 is at the downstream with hydraulic head h=0, and equipotential line 22 is at the upstream with hydraulic head h=H, then the hydraulic head at any equipotential line n is:\n\nh_n = (n - 1) * (H / (m - 1))\n\nwhere m is the total number of equipotential lines.\n\nGiven m=22, n=20, and H=16 m:\n\nh_20 = (20 - 1) * (16 m / (22 - 1)) = 19 * (16 m / 21) \u2248 19 * 0.7619 m \u2248 14.476 m\n\nTherefore, the hydraulic head at point G is approximately 14.476 meters.\n\nNow, the pore water pressure at point G is:\n\nu = \u03b3_w * h_n\n\nAssuming the unit weight of water \u03b3_w is approximately 9.81 kN/m\u00b3,\n\nu \u2248 9.81 kN/m\u00b3 * 14.476 m \u2248 142.06 kPa\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 30 kPa\nB. 45 kPa\nC. 115 kPa\nD. 145 kPa\n\nThe closest value to 142.06 kPa is option D, 145 kPa.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, confirm the hydraulic head at point G:\n\nh_n = (n - 1) * (H / (m - 1)) = 19 * (16 / 21) = 19 * (16/21) \u2248 19 * 0.7619 \u2248 14.476 m\n\nThen, pore water pressure:\n\nu = \u03b3_w * h_n = 9.81 kN/m\u00b3 * 14.476 m \u2248 142.06 kPa\n\nIndeed, the closest option is D. 145 kPa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different way to interpret the spacing of the equipotential lines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equipotential lines are spaced equally in terms of hydraulic head difference, but perhaps the total hydraulic head is not equal to the storage height.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the storage height of 16 m is the height of the dam, and the hydraulic head is different.\n\nWait, in earth dams, the storage height is the height of water retained by the dam, and the hydraulic head is related to the water pressure within the dam.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hydraulic head at the upstream face is equal to the storage height, which is 16 m, and the downstream face is at zero hydraulic head.\n\nIn that case, with m=22 equipotential lines from downstream to upstream, the hydraulic head at each equipotential line would be:\n\nh_n = (n - 1) * (H / (m - 1)) = (n - 1) * (16 m / 21) \u2248 (n - 1) * 0.7619 m\n\nFor n=20:\n\nh_20 \u2248 19 * 0.7619 m \u2248 14.476 m\n\nThus, u \u2248 9.81 kN/m\u00b3 * 14.476 m \u2248 142.06 kPa, which is closest to option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equipotential lines are spaced equally in distance, not in hydraulic head.\n\nIf the equipotential lines are equally spaced in distance, then the hydraulic gradient is uniform, and the hydraulic head varies linearly with distance.\n\nIn that case, the previous calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equipotential lines are spaced according to the hydraulic gradient, which may not be uniform.\n\nHowever, given the problem states that the equipotential lines are evenly spaced, it is reasonable to assume that they are equally spaced in distance, implying a uniform hydraulic gradient.\n\nTherefore, the pore water pressure at point G is approximately 142.06 kPa, and the closest option is D. 145 kPa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
