The diagram shows a vertical profile with various layers and features labeled with specific dimensions. Here are the details:\n\n1. **Vertical Scale**: The vertical scale is marked in meters, ranging from 0 to 7 meters.\n2. **Horizontal Scale**: The horizontal scale is marked in meters, with a total length of 47 meters (32 meters + 15 meters).\n3. **Layers and Features**:\n   - There is a layer at the bottom extending horizontally for 32 meters.\n   - Above this layer, there is another layer that extends horizontally for 15 meters.\n   - The depth of these layers varies, with the deepest point being 7 meters below the surface.\n   - There is a vertical section that extends from the surface down to 7 meters.\n   - The topmost layer is labeled as 3 meters deep.\n\nBased on the description, the image does not contain a joint rose diagram or any information related to joints, dips, strikes, or the number of joints. Therefore, the question about the meaning of the length of the straight line segment projecting from the center of the semicircle in the radial direction cannot be answered using this image.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn the joint rose diagram, which of the following is the meaning of the length of the straight line segment that projects from the center of the semicircle in the radial direction?<image 1>\n\nA. Joint tendency\nB. Joint dip angle\nC.  Joint strike\nD. Number of joints\n"
