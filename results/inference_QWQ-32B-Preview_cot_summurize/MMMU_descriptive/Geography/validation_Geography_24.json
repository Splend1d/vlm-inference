The rod is shown in a horizontal orientation with its left end fixed against a vertical surface. At the right end of the rod, there are two forces acting: a torque (T) applied tangentially and a force (F) applied perpendicularly. The coordinate system is defined with the x-axis along the length of the rod, the y-axis pointing upwards, and the z-axis pointing into the page. The point where the rod is fixed against the vertical surface is labeled as \"A.\"\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich of the following testing methods should be used to evaluate the uniformity and compactness of crushed stone fill?<image 1>\n\nA. Static penetration test\nB. Light power penetration\nC. Heavy power penetration\nD. Standard penetration test\n"
