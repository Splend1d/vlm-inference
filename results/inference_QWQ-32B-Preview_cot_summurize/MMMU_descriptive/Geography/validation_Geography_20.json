The image appears to depict a geometric figure, possibly a trapezoid or a parallelogram, with labeled points and measurements. However, these details are unrelated to the properties of soil mentioned in the question. Therefore, the image cannot be used to determine the correct answer to the question regarding the natural pore ratio of the soil.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe natural water content of a fully saturated cohesive soil is 60%, and its natural pore ratio is closest to which of the following Option?<image 1>\n\nA. 1.0\nB. 1.3\nC. 1.6\nD. 1.9\n"
