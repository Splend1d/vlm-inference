                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand the type of deformation that occurs in each cross-sectional shape when subjected to a concentrated force \\( P \\) at an angle, as described in the problem.\n\nFirst, let's recall that when a beam is subjected to a force that is not aligned with its principal axes, it can experience a combination of bending and torsion. The specific combination depends on the cross-sectional properties and the direction of the applied force.\n\nGiven that the force \\( P \\) is applied at an angle, it has both vertical and horizontal components. This will cause the beam to bend in the direction of the force and also twist if the force does not pass through the centroidal axis of the cross-section.\n\nNow, let's consider each cross-sectional shape:\n\nA. **Rectangle**: A rectangular cross-section has two principal axes, one along the width and one along the height. If the force \\( P \\) is applied at an angle that is not aligned with these principal axes, it will cause both bending and torsion. However, for a rectangular cross-section, the product of inertia is zero if the force is applied along the principal axes. But since the force is at an angle, it's likely that it's not aligned with the principal axes, leading to a combination of bending and torsion.\n\nB. **Channel steel**: Channel steel has an asymmetric cross-section. The centroid may not coincide with the visual center, and the product of inertia may not be zero. Therefore, when a force is applied at an angle, it can cause a combination of bending and torsion.\n\nC. **I-beam**: An I-beam also has two principal axes, similar to a rectangle, but with more material concentrated at the flanges. If the force is applied at an angle not aligned with the principal axes, it will cause both bending and torsion.\n\nD. **Equilateral angle steel**: An equilateral angle steel has an L-shaped cross-section, which is asymmetric. The centroid is located at a specific point within the L, and the product of inertia is generally not zero. Therefore, when a force is applied at an angle, it is likely to cause a combination of bending and torsion.\n\nGiven that all these cross-sections can potentially experience a combination of bending and torsion when subjected to an angled force, we need to determine which one specifically produces the combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for a specific type of cross-section that exhibits this behavior, implying that one of these options is more prone to this type of deformation than the others.\n\nConsidering the properties of each cross-section:\n\n- The rectangle has principal axes that are straightforward, and if the force is applied at an angle to these axes, it will cause both bending and torsion.\n\n- Channel steel and angle steel have more complex geometries with asymmetric properties, which can lead to more pronounced torsional effects when loaded at an angle.\n\n- The I-beam, while having a higher moment of inertia due to its design, still can experience torsion if the force is not aligned with its principal axes.\n\nAmong these, the equilateral angle steel has a particularly asymmetric shape, which means that its centroid is not located at the intersection of the two legs but rather at a point that divides the area equally. This asymmetry can lead to a higher degree of torsion when a force is applied at an angle.\n\nTherefore, the equilateral angle steel is more likely to exhibit significant combined deformation of oblique bending and torsion when subjected to an angled force \\( P \\).\n\nHence, the answer is:\n\nD.
