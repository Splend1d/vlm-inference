                    "text": "I'm going to answer this question about the electrical circuit based on the description provided. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nSo, there's a circuit with several current sources and branches. The current sources are labeled with their values and directions:\n\n1. A 2A current source pointing to the left.\n\n2. A 1A current source pointing to the right.\n\n3. A 1.5A current source pointing to the right.\n\n4. A 0.5A current source pointing to the left.\n\nThe circuit has two main branches:\n\n- Branch 1 has the 2A and 1A current sources connected in parallel.\n\n- Branch 2 has the 1.5A and 0.5A current sources connected in parallel.\n\nThe currents in these branches are labeled as I1 and I2, respectively.\n\nTo find I1 and I2, we need to consider the directions and magnitudes of the currents in each branch.\n\nFor Branch 1 (I1):\n\n- The 2A current source points to the left.\n\n- The 1A current source points to the right.\n\nSince they are in parallel, their currents either add up or subtract depending on their directions. Here, one is going left and the other right. So, they are opposing each other. Therefore, the net current I1 is the difference between the two: 2A - 1A = 1A.\n\nSimilarly, for Branch 2 (I2):\n\n- The 1.5A current source points to the right.\n\n- The 0.5A current source points to the left.\n\nAgain, they are in parallel but in opposite directions. So, the net current I2 is the difference: 1.5A - 0.5A = 1A.\n\nTherefore, both I1 and I2 are 1A.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 2.5A and 1.5A\n\nB. 1A and 0A\n\nC. 2.5A and 0A\n\nD. 1A and 1.5A\n\nNone of these options match our calculation where both I1 and I2 are 1A. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nLet me double-check the description.\n\nIt says:\n\n\"For Branch 1 (I1):\n\n- The 2A current source points to the left.\n\n- The 1A current source points to the right.\n\n- Net current I1 is 2A - 1A = 1A.\"\n\nAnd for Branch 2 (I2):\n\n- The 1.5A current source points to the right.\n\n- The 0.5A current source points to the left.\n\n- Net current I2 is 1.5A - 0.5A = 1A.\"\n\nSo, according to this, I1 is 1A and I2 is 1A.\n\nBut in the options, D is \"1A and 1.5A\", which is close but not exact. Maybe there's a mistake in the options or in the interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps there's more to the circuit that isn't described here. Maybe there are connections between the branches or other components affecting the currents.\n\nLet me read the description again carefully.\n\n\"The circuit includes:\n\n1. A current source labeled \"2A\" pointing to the left.\n\n2. A current source labeled \"1A\" pointing to the right.\n\n3. A current source labeled \"1.5A\" pointing to the right.\n\n4. A current source labeled \"0.5A\" pointing to the left.\n\nThere are two main branches in the circuit:\n\n- Branch 1: This branch has the 2A current source and the 1A current source connected in parallel.\n\n- Branch 2: This branch has the 1.5A current source and the 0.5A current source connected in parallel.\n\nThe currents in these branches are labeled as I1 and I2, respectively.\"\n\nIt seems straightforward. But maybe there are more elements in the circuit affecting the currents.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the directions of the current sources are such that they are feeding into a junction or something, and we need to apply Kirchhoff's current law.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nIf there are branches connected in a certain way, maybe the currents are combining differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the branches are not independent, and there is a relationship between I1 and I2.\n\nLet me consider Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), which states that the sum of currents entering a junction must equal the sum of currents leaving the junction.\n\nIf there is a junction where I1 and I2 meet, then perhaps there is an equation relating them.\n\nBut based on the description, it seems like Branch 1 has I1 as the net current, and Branch 2 has I2 as the net current, and they are separate branches.\n\nUnless there is more to the circuit, like a connection between the branches or other components.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"the illustrated circuit,\" but since there's no actual image, we have to go by the description.\n\nGiven that, and based on the description's calculation, I1 is 1A and I2 is 1A.\n\nBut none of the options match that exactly. Option D is \"1A and 1.5A\", which is close but not the same.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate.\n\nFor Branch 1:\n\n2A to the left and 1A to the right. If they are in parallel, and assuming the directions are opposite, the net current I1 should be 2A - 1A = 1A, as previously calculated.\n\nFor Branch 2:\n\n1.5A to the right and 0.5A to the left, so net current I2 is 1.5A - 0.5A = 1A.\n\nStill getting I1 = 1A and I2 = 1A.\n\nBut perhaps the branches are not isolated, and there is interaction between them.\n\nMaybe there is a larger circuit where these branches are connected, and we need to consider more than just the net current in each branch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the total current in the circuit, or something else.\n\nWait, the question is: \"the current I1 and the current I2 are respectively.\"\n\nGiven the options, it seems like I1 and I2 are being asked for, and the options provide different pairs of values.\n\nSince our calculation gives I1 = 1A and I2 = 1A, but that's not among the options, maybe the description has an error, or perhaps there is more to the circuit than what's described.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the directions of the currents more carefully.\n\nLet me consider defining a positive direction. Let's assume current flowing to the right as positive.\n\nThen:\n\n- 2A to the left: -2A\n\n- 1A to the right: +1A\n\n- 1.5A to the right: +1.5A\n\n- 0.5A to the left: -0.5A\n\nFor Branch 1 (I1): -2A + 1A = -1A, which means I1 is 1A to the left.\n\nFor Branch 2 (I2): +1.5A - 0.5A = +1A, which means I2 is 1A to the right.\n\nSo, I1 is 1A to the left, I2 is 1A to the right.\n\nBut the question just asks for the magnitudes, so both are 1A.\n\nStill, none of the options match.\n\nWait, maybe there is a mistake in the description's calculation.\n\nLet me check again.\n\n\"In Branch 1:\n\n- The 2A current source points to the left.\n\n- The 1A current source points to the right.\n\n- Net current I1 is 2A - 1A = 1A.\"\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, considering directions, it should be -2A + 1A = -1A, meaning 1A to the left.\n\nSimilarly, for Branch 2:\n\n+1.5A - 0.5A = +1A, meaning 1A to the right.\n\nSo, I1 is 1A (left), I2 is 1A (right).\n\nBut the options don't have this combination.\n\nOption D is \"1A and 1.5A\", which is close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the description, and the net current in one of the branches is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about something else, like the total current in the circuit or something.\n\nWait, perhaps the branches are connected in a way that their currents are not independent.\n\nFor example, maybe there is a junction where I1 and I2 meet, and there is another current flowing out.\n\nIn that case, we would need to apply KCL.\n\nBut based on the description, it seems like Branch 1 has I1 and Branch 2 has I2, and that's it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a larger circuit with more elements.\n\nGiven that, maybe I need to consider more than just the net current in each branch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about something else entirely.\n\nWait, maybe the \"11 and the current 12\" is a typo, and it's meant to be \"I1 and I2\".\n\nAssuming that, and given that, perhaps the answer is B. 1A and 0A, but that doesn't match our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the directions more carefully.\n\nLet me consider writing the KCL equations at the junctions.\n\nAssuming there is a junction where Branch 1 and Branch 2 meet, and perhaps there is another branch connected to it.\n\nBut based on the description, it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the branches are in series or something.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the description concludes that I1 and I2 are both 1A, but that's not among the options, I might have to choose the closest option, which is D. 1A and 1.5A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the description's calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about something else entirely.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided, perhaps the answer is B. 1A and 0A.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C. 2.5A and 0A.\n\nWait, maybe there is a different way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the total current supplied by all sources.\n\nTotal current: -2A (left) + 1A (right) + 1.5A (right) - 0.5A (left) = -2A + 1A + 1.5A - 0.5A = 0A.\n\nSo, the total current seems to be zero, which might indicate that the circuit is closed and currents are balanced.\n\nBut that doesn't directly help in determining I1 and I2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the currents in each branch separately, as initially done.\n\nGiven that, and based on the description, I1 is 1A and I2 is 1A.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is B. 1A and 0A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the question or the options provided.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll go with the closest option, which is D. 1A and 1.5A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B. 1A and 0A.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, and the uncertainty, I'll choose B. 1A and 0A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
