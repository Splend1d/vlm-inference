The diagram shows a single pile with a length of 30 meters extending vertically into the ground. At the top of the pile, there is a circular cap or footing. The diagram also includes a horizontal line labeled \"120 kPa\" at the bottom of the pile, indicating the pressure exerted by the soil at that depth. The label \"p0/kPa\" is shown to the right of this line, suggesting that it represents the pressure at the base of the pile.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn precast concrete pile foundations, the center distance of the piles should not be less than ()<image 1>\n\nA. 4D\nB. 3.5D\nC. 3.0D\nD. 2.5D\n"
