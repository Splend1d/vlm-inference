The penetrometer has sunk 6mm into the soil, indicating the depth of penetration. The soil sample is labeled as a cohesive soil undisturbed sample with a weight of 76 grams. The depth of penetration is used to determine the consistency of the soil. \n\nGiven the depth of penetration (6mm), we can infer the consistency of the soil sample. The options provided are:\n\nA. Hard plastic\nB. Plastic\nC. Soft plastic\nD. Flow molding\n\nBased on the depth of penetration, the soil sample likely falls into one of these categories.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn port engineering survey, the cone settlement of a cohesive soil undisturbed sample (76g liquid limit instrument sinking into the soil) was measured The depth in is 6mm.

The options for the consistency of the soil are hard plastic, plastic, soft plastic, and flow molding.\n\nIn soil mechanics, the cone penetration test (CPT) is used to determine the geotechnical engineering properties of soils and delineate soil layers. The depth of penetration of the cone is inversely related to the soil's resistance; a greater penetration indicates lower resistance and thus softer soil.\n\nGiven that the penetrometer has sunk 6mm into the soil, we need to correlate this depth of penetration with the provided options for soil consistency.\n\nGenerally, the penetration depth can be associated with soil consistency as follows:\n\n- **Hard plastic:** Low penetration, high resistance.\n\n- **Plastic:** Moderate penetration, moderate resistance.\n\n- **Soft plastic:** Higher penetration, lower resistance.\n\n- **Flow molding:** Very high penetration, very low resistance.\n\nSince the penetrometer has sunk 6mm into the soil, which is a relatively small depth, this suggests that the soil has\u8f83\u9ad8 resistance, indicating a harder consistency.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate option is:\n\nA. Hard plastic\n\nThis conclusion is based on the assumption that a smaller penetration depth corresponds to higher soil resistance, which is characteristic of harder soil consistency.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
