The drawing includes several sections labeled I-I, II-II, and III-III, indicating different views or cross-sections of the wall. Key measurements and annotations are provided throughout the drawing:\n\n1. **Overall Dimensions**: The total height of the wall is 1400 mm.\n2. **Wall Thickness**: The thickness of the wall is 250 mm at the base, tapering down to 120 mm at the top.\n3. **Waterproofing Layer**: There is a designated area for the waterproofing layer, which is shown as a separate layer applied to the exterior surface of the wall.\n4. **Additional Layers**: The drawing shows multiple layers, including a protective layer on the outside of the waterproofing layer.\n5. **Construction Details**: Specific dimensions and annotations indicate the placement and thickness of each layer, ensuring proper installation.\n\nBased on this description, the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is:\n\n**A. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall**\n\nThis is because the waterproofing layer is shown applied directly to the exterior (upstream) surface of the wall in the drawing.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat is the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials:<image 1>\n\nA. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall\nB. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the back surface of the external wall\nC. The outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method\nD.  When laying double layer coils, the two layers of coils are perpendicular to each other\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the correct method for constructing the waterproofing layer of the basement exterior wall with coiled materials is:\n\n**A. The roll waterproof layer is laid on the upstream surface of the external wall**\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from the description which mentions that \"the waterproofing layer is shown as a separate layer applied to the exterior surface of the wall.\" In the context of basement exterior walls, the exterior surface is exposed to the soil and groundwater, making it the upstream surface where water pressure originates. Therefore, applying the waterproofing layer on this side is crucial for preventing water infiltration.\n\nOption B suggests laying the waterproof layer on the back surface of the external wall, which would typically be the interior side. This is generally not the preferred method because the waterproofing should face the source of moisture, which is externally in this case.\n\nOption C mentions that the outer wall roll adopts the empty laying method. While empty laying can be a method used in some waterproofing applications to allow for movement or to prevent adhesion to the substrate, the description does not specify this method. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed as the correct approach based on the given information.\n\nOption D refers to laying double layers of coils with the two layers being perpendicular to each other. This method can enhance waterproofing by providing multiple layers and potentially covering more area, but again, the description does not indicate the use of double layers or their orientation.\n\nGiven that the description explicitly states the waterproofing layer is applied to the exterior surface of the wall, option A is the most accurate choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
