                    "text": "Given the description and the question, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have propene reacting with bromine in the presence of water to form 2-bromo-2-propanol. The reaction is an addition reaction across the double bond of propene.\n\nNow, the question is about a specific reaction condition: treating an unsymmetrical alkene like propene with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The major product has bromine bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom.\n\nWe need to determine if this is Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov orientation.\n\nLet's recall Markovnikov's rule: In the addition of a protic acid HX to an alkene, the hydrogen (H) attaches to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms, and the X attaches to the carbon with the fewest hydrogen atoms. In other words, the more substituted carbon gets the hydrogen, and the less substituted gets the X.\n\nHowever, in this case, we're dealing with bromination using NBS in DMSO, which is a polar aprotic solvent.\n\nNBS is a source of bromine, and in the presence of DMSO, it can lead to bromination reactions. DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent that can stabilize transition states or intermediates with partial negative charges.\n\nIn typical electrophilic addition to alkenes, bromine adds in a Markovnikov fashion: the bromine atom attaches to the less substituted carbon, and the hydrogen attaches to the more substituted carbon, forming a bromohydrin.\n\nBut here, it's specified that the major product has bromine bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom. Let's see where that is in propene.\n\nPropene is CH3-CH=CH2. The double bond is between C2 and C3. C1 is methyl (CH3), C2 is methylene (CH=), and C3 is hydrogen (H).\n\nSo, C1 is more substituted (connected to three hydrogens and one carbon), C2 is connected to one carbon and two hydrogens, and C3 is connected to one carbon and two hydrogens.\n\nWait, C2 and C3 both are connected to one carbon and two hydrogens, so they are equally substituted in terms of hydrogens.\n\nWait, but in propene, C1 is connected to three hydrogens and one carbon, C2 is connected to two hydrogens and two carbons, and C3 is connected to two hydrogens and one carbon.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to number the carbons correctly.\n\nLet's number the propene as CH3-CH=CH2.\n\nC1: connected to C2 and two H's.\n\nC2: connected to C1 and C3 and one H.\n\nC3: connected to C2 and two H's.\n\nSo, C1: 2 H's and 1 C.\n\nC2: 1 H and 2 C's.\n\nC3: 2 H's and 1 C.\n\nSo, C2 is more substituted than C3.\n\nTherefore, in the product, bromine is bonded to the less highly substituted carbon, which is C3.\n\nIn Markovnikov addition, the bromine would attach to C3, the less substituted carbon, and the hydroxyl group would attach to C2, the more substituted carbon.\n\nSo, if the major product has bromine on C3, that aligns with Markovnikov's rule.\n\nBut the question says: \"the major product has the bromine atom bonded to the less highly substituted carbon atom. Is the following one Markovnikov or non-Markovnikov orientation?\"\n\nGiven that Markovnikov's rule dictates that the electrophile (bromine) attaches to the less substituted carbon, which is what is observed here, the answer should be Markovnikov orientation.\n\nHowever, there is a twist. Sometimes, in the presence of certain solvents or reagents, reactions can proceed via a free radical mechanism or other pathways that can lead to anti-Markovnikov selectivity.\n\nNBS is often used in radical halogenations, but in this case, it's in DMSO, which is a polar aprotic solvent, and might influence the reaction mechanism.\n\nBut according to the question, it's specifically stated that the major product has bromine on the less highly substituted carbon, which is consistent with Markovnikov's rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. Markovnikov orientation.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nMarkovnikov addition: electrophile adds to less substituted carbon, nucleophile adds to more substituted carbon.\n\nIn this case, bromine is the electrophile, attaching to C3 (less substituted), and the hydroxyl group (which is nucleophilic) attaches to C2 (more substituted).\n\nThis matches Markovnikov's rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Markovnikov orientation.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
