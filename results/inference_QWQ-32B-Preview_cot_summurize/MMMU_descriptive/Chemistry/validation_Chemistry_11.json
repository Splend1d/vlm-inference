The curve starts at a low pH value near 1 and gradually increases as the volume increases. At around 50 milliliters, there is a sharp increase in the pH, indicating the equivalence point, where the pH jumps significantly. The equivalence point is marked by a dot labeled \"Equivalence point.\" The curve then continues to rise steeply, approaching a pH value of 12. This type of curve is characteristic of a strong base being titrated into a strong acid.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Figure 29-1: Titration curve. Which of the following matches the titration curve shown in Figure 29-1?\n\nA. A strong acid is titrated into a weak base.\nB. A strong acid is titrated into a strong base.\nC.

                    "text": "Based on the description provided for the titration curve in Figure 29-1, the correct match is:\n\nD. A strong base is titrated into a strong acid.\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this choice:\n\n1. **pH Range and Starting Point:**\n   - The curve starts at a low pH near 1, which indicates that the initial solution is acidic. This suggests that the titration begins with an acidic solution, likely a strong acid.\n\n2. **Equivalence Point:**\n   - The equivalence point is reached at around 50 milliliters, where there is a sharp increase in pH. In titrations involving strong acids and strong bases, the equivalence point is typically around pH 7, which is neutral. However, the description mentions that the pH jumps significantly and continues to rise steeply towards pH 12. This suggests that after the equivalence point, the solution becomes basic, indicating that a base is being added to an acid.\n\n3. **Shape of the Curve:**\n   - The gradual increase in pH as the volume of titrant increases is typical for titrations where a strong base is added to a strong acid. The sharp rise around the equivalence point is also characteristic of such titrations.\n\n4. **Final pH:**\n   - The curve approaches a pH of 12 after the equivalence point, which is basic. This confirms that the titrant is a base.\n\nGiven these observations, the titration curve described matches the titration of a strong base into a strong acid.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A: A strong acid is titrated into a weak base.**\n  - In this case, the equivalence point would be acidic (pH < 7), not neutral or basic.\n\n- **Option B: A strong acid is titrated into a strong base.**\n  - This would involve adding acid to a base, starting with a high pH and decreasing to a low pH, which contradicts the description.\n\n- **Option C: A strong base is titrated into a weak acid.**\n  - The equivalence point in this scenario would be basic (pH > 7), but the initial pH would be higher than in a strong acid titration.\n\n- **Option E: A weak base is titrated into a weak acid.**\n  - The equivalence point for such titrations is often around pH 7, but the shape of the curve and the pH changes are different from those described.\n\nTherefore, the correct match is option D."
