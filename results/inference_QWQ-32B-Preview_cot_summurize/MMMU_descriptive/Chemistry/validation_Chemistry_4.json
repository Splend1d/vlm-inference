One substituent is a chlorine atom (Cl), and the other is a methyl group (CH3). The chlorine atom is attached to one carbon atom of the ring, and the methyl group is attached to another carbon atom of the ring. The dashed lines indicate that these substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, suggesting a trans configuration.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nName the following substances, including the cis- or trans- prefix: <image 1>\n\n"

So, we have a cyclohexane ring with two substituents: a chlorine atom and a methyl group. The description says that these substituents are attached to different carbon atoms and are on opposite sides of the ring, suggesting a trans configuration.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how to name compounds with multiple substituents on a cyclohexane ring. I think the parent chain is cyclohexane, and the substituents are chlorine and methyl. Since there are only two substituents, I don't need to worry about multiple locants, but I do need to indicate their relative positions.\n\nThe description mentions that the substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, which I interpret as trans. I believe that in cyclohexanes, trans refers to the substituents being on different chairs or something like that. Wait, actually, cyclohexanes can be in chair conformations, and substituents can be axial or equatorial, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nMaybe I should think about it in terms of cis and trans for disubstituted cyclohexanes. I recall that for two substituents on a cyclohexane ring, if they are on the same side of the ring, it's cis, and if they are on opposite sides, it's trans. The description says the substituents are on opposite sides, so it should be trans.\n\nSo, the name should include \"trans-\" as a prefix. Then, I need to list the substituents in alphabetical order. Chlorine comes before methyl in alphabetical order, so it should be chloro first, then methyl.\n\nWait, but I think in IUPAC nomenclature, we list the substituents in alphabetical order without considering the prefixes like \"chloro\" or \"methyl.\" So, chlorine is Cl, and methyl is CH3. In terms of alphabetical order, chlorine (Cl) comes before methyl (which is considered as \"methyl\"), so chloro comes first.\n\nTherefore, the full name should be something like \"trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane.\" But I'm not entirely sure about the numbering. In cyclohexanes, the numbering can be a bit tricky because the ring can be numbered in different ways, but since there are only two substituents, the lowest possible numbers should be used.\n\nAssuming that the chlorine is on carbon 1 and the methyl is on carbon 2, and they are trans, then \"trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane\" seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more specific way to denote their positions. Perhaps using cis and trans is not standard for chloro and methyl substituents. Maybe I need to consider the priority of the groups based on CIP rules.\n\nLet me think about CIP rules. Chlorine has a higher atomic number than carbon, so it would have higher priority. Methyl is a carbon substituent, so chlorine is higher priority than methyl.\n\nIn stereoisomerism, the configuration is determined based on the priority of the substituents. If the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, with the higher priority group (chlorine) in front, then it's the trans configuration.\n\nSo, yes, trans seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the name should be trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to confirm if the trans prefix is necessary. In some cases, for disubstituted cyclohexanes, the trans prefix is used to indicate that the substituents are on opposite sides of the ring.\n\nBut I think in more formal IUPAC nomenclature, the cis and trans prefixes are used for alkene-like configurations, but for cyclohexanes, it might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the absolute configuration like R and S is more appropriate, but that seems complicated for this case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the substituents' positions in terms of axial and equatorial.\n\nIn cyclohexanes, substituents can be axial or equatorial, and perhaps that affects the naming.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently. Perhaps I can name it as 1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane, and specify that it's the trans isomer.\n\nBut I think to be more precise, I should use the cis and trans prefixes.\n\nWait, but I need to confirm if cis and trans are appropriate here.\n\nLet me recall that in cyclohexanes, cis refers to substituents being on the same side of the ring, and trans refers to them being on opposite sides.\n\nSo, if the chlorine and methyl are on opposite sides, it's trans.\n\nTherefore, the name should be trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use E,Z notation, but that's typically for alkenes.\n\nNo, E,Z notation is for alkenes, not cyclohexanes.\n\nSo, I think cis and trans are the way to go here.\n\nTherefore, the final name is trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{trans-1-chloro-2-methylcyclohexane}} \\]"
