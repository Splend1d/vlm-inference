                    "text": "So I've got this question about a titration curve for sodium oxalate reacting with hydrochloric acid. The image describes the curve with two plateaus at points E and F, which are the endpoints of the titration. Points G and H are mentioned but not crucial for this particular question. The question is asking about the predominant species in solution at point E.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reaction between sodium oxalate and hydrochloric acid. Sodium oxalate is Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084, and hydrochloric acid is HCl. Oxalate is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons. So, the titration will have two endpoints corresponding to the protonation of each oxygen in the C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b ion.\n\nThe balanced equations for the reactions are:\n\n1. C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b + H\u207a \u2192 HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b\n\n2. HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b + H\u207a \u2192 H\u2082C\u2082O\u2084\n\nPoint E is the first endpoint, where the first protonation occurs, converting C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b to HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b.\n\nAt this point, the solution contains:\n\n- Sodium ions (Na\u207a) from sodium oxalate.\n\n- Chloride ions (Cl\u207b) from hydrochloric acid.\n\n- The conjugate acid of C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b, which is HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b.\n\n- Some water (H\u2082O), but that's mentioned separately in the question.\n\nSo, the predominant species in solution at point E should be Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 and HCl\n\n- At the endpoint, the reactants are completely reacted, so there shouldn't be significant amounts of Na\u2082C\u2082O\u2084 and HCl left.\n\nB. Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b\n\n- This matches what I've deduced.\n\nC. C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b and H\u207a\n\n- At the endpoint, the C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b should have been converted to HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b, and H\u207a would be present but not as a predominant species.\n\nD. Na\u207a, H\u207a, and C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b\n\n- Again, at the endpoint, C\u2082O\u2084\u00b2\u207b should have been converted to HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b, and H\u207a would not be a predominant species.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B. Na\u207a, Cl\u207b, and HC\u2082O\u2084\u207b.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
