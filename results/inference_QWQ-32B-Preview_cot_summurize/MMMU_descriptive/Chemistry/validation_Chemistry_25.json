The first column is labeled \"Isotope,\" the second column is labeled \"Mass (amu),\" and the third column is labeled \"Percent Abundance.\" Each row corresponds to an isotope of magnesium:\n\n- The first row lists Mg-24 with a mass of 24.0 amu and a percent abundance of 79.0%.\n- The second row lists Mg-25 with a mass of 25.0 amu and a percent abundance of 10.0%.\n- The third row lists Mg-26 with a mass of 26.0 amu and a percent abundance of 11.0%.\n\nUsing this information, you can calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium by multiplying each isotope's mass by its percent abundance (converted to a decimal), summing these products, and then dividing by 100.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThere are three common isotopes of naturally occuring magnesium as indicated in the table below. <image 1> Using the information above, calculate the average atomic mass of magnesium. Write your answer number only, in the unit of amu.\n\n"
