The left half-cell contains a zinc (Zn) electrode immersed in a 1.0 M solution of zinc ions (Zn\u00b2\u207a). The right half-cell contains a silver (Ag) electrode immersed in a 1.0 M solution of silver ions (Ag\u207a). The voltmeter is connected to both electrodes to measure the potential difference between them.\n\nAdditionally, there is a table provided with standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions associated with the electrochemical cell:\n\n- The first half-reaction is Ag\u207a(aq) + e\u207b \u2192 Ag(s), with a standard reduction potential (E\u00b0) of +0.80 V.\n- The second half-reaction is Zn\u00b2\u207a(aq) + 2e\u207b \u2192 Zn(s), with a standard reduction potential (E\u00b0) of -0.76 V.\n\nBased on these details, the net ionic equation for the overall reaction that occurs as the cell operates can be determined by combining the two half-reactions appropriately.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Standard reduction potentials for the half-reactions associated with the electrochemical cell shown above are given in the table below. <image 2> Which of the following is the net ionic equation for the overall reaction that occurs as the cell operates?\n\nA. $Ag$(s) + $Zn^{2+}$(aq) $\\rightarrow$ $Ag^{2+}$(aq) + $Zn$(s)\nB. $Ag^+$(aq) + $Zn^{2+}$(aq) + 3 $e^-$ $\\rightarrow$ $AgZn$(s)\nC. $Ag^+$(aq) + $Zn$(s) $\\rightarrow$ $Ag$(s) + $Zn^{2+}$(aq) + $e^-$\nD. 2 $Ag^+$(aq) + $Zn$(s) $\\\rightarrow$ 2 $Ag$(s) + $Zn^{2+}$(aq)\n"

                    "text": "To determine the net ionic equation for the overall reaction occurring in the electrochemical cell, we need to consider the standard reduction potentials provided and identify which half-reactions will occur at the anode and cathode.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in an electrochemical cell:\n\n- The cathode is where reduction occurs, and it has a more positive standard reduction potential.\n\n- The anode is where oxidation occurs, and it has a more negative standard reduction potential.\n\nGiven the standard reduction potentials:\n\n1. \\( Ag^+ (aq) + e^- \\rightarrow Ag (s) \\) with \\( E^\\circ = +0.80 \\, V \\)\n\n2. \\( Zn^{2+} (aq) + 2 e^- \\rightarrow Zn (s) \\) with \\( E^\\circ = -0.76 \\, V \\)\n\nComparing these potentials:\n\n- The silver half-reaction has a higher \\( E^\\circ \\) value (+0.80 V), so it is more likely to be reduced.\n\n- The zinc half-reaction has a lower \\( E^\\circ \\) value (-0.76 V), so it is more likely to be oxidized.\n\nTherefore, in the cell:\n\n- The cathode will be the silver electrode, where reduction occurs.\n\n- The anode will be the zinc electrode, where oxidation occurs.\n\nNext, we need to write the half-reactions for both the cathode and the anode.\n\n**Cathode (reduction):**\n\n\\[ Ag^+ (aq) + e^- \\rightarrow Ag (s) \\]\n\n**Anode (oxidation):**\n\nThe standard reduction potential for zinc is:\n\n\\[ Zn^{2+} (aq) + 2 e^- \\rightarrow Zn (s) \\quad E^\\circ = -0.76 \\, V \\]\n\nTo write the oxidation half-reaction, we reverse this equation:\n\n\\[ Zn (s) \\rightarrow Zn^{2+} (aq) + 2 e^- \\quad E^\\circ_{\\text{oxidation}} = +0.76 \\, V \\]\n\nNow, we combine the two half-reactions to get the overall cell reaction.\n\nFrom the cathode:\n\n\\[ Ag^+ (aq) + e^- \\rightarrow Ag (s) \\]\n\nFrom the anode:\n\n\\[ Zn (s) \\rightarrow Zn^{2+} (aq) + 2 e^- \\]\n\nTo combine these, we need to balance the electrons.
