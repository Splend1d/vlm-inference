The structure consists of four carbon atoms (C) arranged in a linear chain. The first carbon atom has an aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to it, indicating that this is an aldose sugar. The remaining carbon atoms have hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to them, with the last carbon also having a hydrogen atom (H) attached. The presence of four carbon atoms and an aldehyde group classifies this monosaccharide as an aldotetrose.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nChoose the right type of the following monosaccharide. <image 1>\n\nA. It's an aldotetrose.\nB. It's an aldopentose.\nC. It's a ketopentose.\nD. It's a ketohexose.\n"

This classification places it as an aldose sugar with four carbons, which is specifically referred to as an aldotetrose.\n\nLet's break down the terms to ensure clarity:\n\n1. **Aldose vs. Ketose**: Aldoses have an aldehyde group (-CHO) at the end of their carbon chain, whereas ketoses have a ketone group (C=O) somewhere in the carbon chain, typically in the middle for monosaccharides.\n\n2. **Number of Carbon Atoms**:\n   - **Tetrose**: 4 carbon atoms\n   - **Pentose**: 5 carbon atoms\n   - **Hexose**: 6 carbon atoms\n\nGiven that Threose has four carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, it is correctly classified as an aldotetrose.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nA. It's an aldotetrose.\n\nB. It's an aldopentose.\n\nC. It's a ketopentose.\n\nD. It's a ketohexose.\n\nOption A directly matches the classification derived from the description.\n\nOption B, aldopentose, would apply to aldoses with five carbon atoms, which is not the case here.\n\nOption C, ketopentose, refers to ketoses with five carbon atoms, which again does not match the description.\n\nOption D, ketohexose, refers to ketoses with six carbon atoms, which also does not correspond to the given monosaccharide.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. It's an aldotetrose.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
