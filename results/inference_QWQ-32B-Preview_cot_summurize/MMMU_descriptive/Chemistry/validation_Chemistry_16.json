The central atom is bonded to four other atoms, each represented by a circle with a pair of dots (representing lone pairs of electrons) on either side. The arrangement of these atoms around the central atom forms a square planar geometry. Each corner of the square represents one of the bonded atoms, and the central atom is at the intersection of the lines connecting these corners.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nChoose the word that best describes the geometric shape of the molecule or ion whose Lewis structure is shown below. <image 1>\n\nA. linear\nB. bent\nC. triangular planar\nD. tetrahedral\nE. square planar\nF. triangular pyramid\nG. triangular bipyramid\nH. octahedral\nI.
