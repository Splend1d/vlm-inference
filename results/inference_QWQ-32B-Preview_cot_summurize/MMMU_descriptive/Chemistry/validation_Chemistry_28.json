Attached to the same carbon as the nitro group is an N,N-dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2).\n\n- Structure (B) also has a benzene ring with a nitro group (-NO2) attached at the para position. However, in addition to the nitro group, there are three methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the benzene ring: one at the ortho position (second carbon atom), one at the meta position (third carbon atom), and one at the para position (fourth carbon atom). The N,N-dimethylamino group is attached to the same carbon as the nitro group.\n\nThe dipole moments for these compounds are given as:\n- (A) = 6.87 D\n- (B) = 4.11 D\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Dipole moments of given compound will be :\n\nA. (A) = 6.87D, (B) = 4.11D\nB. (A) = 4.11 D , (B) = 6.87 D\nC. (A) = 4.11 D , (B) = 4.11 D\nD. (A) = 6.87 D, (B) = 6.87 D\n"
