The diagram includes several key features:\n\n1. **Triple Point**: This is the point where all three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) coexist in equilibrium. It is located at the intersection of the three lines representing the phase boundaries.\n2. **Phase Boundaries**:\n   - **Solid-Liquid Boundary**: This line represents the melting point of the substance as a function of pressure.\n   - **Liquid-Gas Boundary**: This line represents the boiling point of the substance as a function of pressure.\n   - **Solid-Gas Boundary**: This line represents the sublimation point of the substance as a function of pressure.\n\nThere are five labeled points on the diagram:\n- **Point (A)**: Located at the lowest temperature and pressure, near the origin.\n- **Point (B)**: Located to the left of the triple point, in the region where the solid and gas phases coexist.\n- **Point (C)**: Located in the upper right quadrant, in the region where the liquid and gas phases coexist.\n- **Point (D)**: Located just above the triple point, in the region where the liquid phase exists.\n- **Point (E)**: Located in the lower right quadrant, in the region where the solid and liquid phases coexist.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks at which point the substance will be solely in the solid phase at equilibrium.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nSee the following phase diagram below, where there are 5 points labeled as (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E), respectively. <image 1> At which point will the substancemce represented by the phase diagram be solely in the solid phase at equilibrium?\n\nA.

Since it's near the origin and the triple point is at a higher temperature and pressure, point (A) should be in the solid phase region. Points (B), (C), (D), and (E) are described as being in other regions where multiple phases may coexist or where different single phases exist.\n\nGiven that point (A) is in the solid phase region, the substance should be solely in the solid phase at equilibrium at that point.\n\nSo, the answer is A.
