The structure is enclosed in square brackets and has a superscript charge of +2 for M and -2 for X. The Lewis structure for M is represented by [M\u00b2\u207a], indicating that M has lost two electrons to achieve a positive charge of +2. The Lewis structure for X is represented by [:X:] with four lone pairs of electrons around it, indicating that X has gained two electrons to achieve a negative charge of -2. The overall charge of the compound is neutral, as indicated by the superscript charge of +2 for M and -2 for X.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn the Lewis structures listed here, $M$ and $X$ represent various elements in the third period of the periodic table. <image 1> Write the formula of the compound using the chemical symbols of each element.\n\n"

So, from the description, we have two elements: M and X, both from the third period of the periodic table.\n\nFirst, M has a Lewis structure shown as [M\u00b2\u207a], which means it has a +2 charge. This suggests that M has lost two electrons. Since it's from the third period, possible candidates could be magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), etc. But aluminum typically forms a +3 ion, and silicon doesn't commonly form ions. Magnesium, though, commonly forms a +2 ion, so Mg\u00b2\u207a makes sense here.\n\nNext, X is represented as [:X:] with four lone pairs and a -2 charge, indicating it has gained two electrons. In the third period, elements that can gain electrons to form negative ions include sulfur (S) and chlorine (Cl). Sulfur can form S\u00b2\u207b, and chlorine can form Cl\u207b, but Cl\u207b has a -1 charge, which doesn't match the -2 charge described. So, sulfur seems more likely, as it can form S\u00b2\u207b.\n\nWait, but sulfur's common ion is S\u00b2\u207b, which matches the -2 charge. However, sulfur is in period 3, group 16, and typically forms S\u00b2\u207b by gaining two electrons to achieve a noble gas configuration.\n\nSo, if M is Mg\u00b2\u207a and X is S\u00b2\u207b, the compound would be MgS, since the charges balance out: +2 and -2 give a neutral compound.\n\nBut let's double-check. The description says the overall charge of the compound is neutral, which makes sense for an ionic compound like magnesium sulfide.\n\nAlternatively, could there be other elements in the third period that fit this description? For M, sodium (Na) forms Na\u207a, but that's a +1 ion, not +2. Silicon (Si) doesn't typically form ions, and phosphorus (P) forms P\u00b3\u207b, which doesn't match the -2 charge.\n\nWait, phosphorus can sometimes form P\u00b3\u207b, but that's not -2. Chlorine can form Cl\u207b, which is -1. Argon (Ar) is a noble gas and doesn't typically form ions.\n\nSo, Mg\u00b2\u207a and S\u00b2\u207b seem to be the most likely candidates here.\n\nTherefore, the formula of the compound should be MgS.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{MgS}} \\]"
