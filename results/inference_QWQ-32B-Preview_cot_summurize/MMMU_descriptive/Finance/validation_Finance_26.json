Perpetuity C has an annual amount of $3,000 and a discount rate of 6%. The question is to determine the interest rate and present value of perpetuity C.\n\nFirst, let's identify the interest rate for perpetuity C. According to the table, the discount rate for perpetuity C is 6%. In the context of perpetuities, the discount rate is equivalent to the interest rate used to calculate the present value. Therefore, the interest rate for perpetuity C is 6.0%.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the present value of perpetuity C. The formula for the present value (PV) of a perpetuity is:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{\\text{annual amount}}{\\text{interest rate}} \\]\n\nGiven that the annual amount is $3,000 and the interest rate is 6% (or 0.06 in decimal form), we can plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ PV = \\frac{3,000}{0.06} = 50,000 \\]\n\nTherefore, the present value of perpetuity C is $50,000.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. interest rate = 5.0%; present value = $1,200,000\n\nB. interest rate = 10.0%; present value = $1,000,000\n\nC. interest rate = 8.0%; present value = $250,000\n\nD. interest rate = 6.0%; present value = $50,000\n\nThe correct answer is D. interest rate = 6.0%; present value = $50,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
