The balance sheet is divided into two main sections: Total Assets and Total Liabilities and Equity. Each section lists various accounts with their respective values in dollars ($).\n\n### Total Assets:\n- **Cash:** $100\n- **Accounts receivable:** $200\n- **Inventories:** $200\n- **Net fixed assets:** $500\n\n**Total assets:** $1,000\n\n### Total Liabilities and Equity:\n- **Accounts payable:** $50\n- **Notes payable:** $150\n- **Accruals:** $50\n- **Long-term debt:** $400\n- **Common stock:** $100\n- **Retained earnings:** $250\n\n**Total liabilities and equity:** $1,000\n\nThe balance sheet is balanced, with total assets equaling total liabilities and equity at $1,000 each.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe Booth Company's sales are forecasted to double from $1,000 in 2010 to $2,000 in 2011. Here is the December 31, 2010, balance sheet: <image 1> Booth's fixed assets were used to only 50% of capacity during 2010, but its current assets were at their proper levels in relation to sales. All assets except fixed assets must increase at the same rate as sales, and fixed assets would also have to increase at the same rate if the current excess capacity did not exist. Booth's after-tax profit margin is forecasted to be 5% and its payout ratio to be 60%. What is Booth's additional funds needed (AFN) for the coming year?\n\n"
