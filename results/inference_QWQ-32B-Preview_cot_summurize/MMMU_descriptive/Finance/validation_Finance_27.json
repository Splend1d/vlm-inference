                    "text": "So I've got this question here about finding the nominal rate of interest on a 5-year U.S. Treasury bond, given some information about inflation expectations and the real rate of interest. Let me try to understand what's being asked and how to approach it.\n\nFirst, there's a table that provides average annual rates of inflation expected over different periods: 3 months, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 20 years. The inflation rates are 5% for 3 months, 6% for 2 years, 8% for 5 years, 8.5% for 10 years, and 9% for 20 years. The real rate of interest is given as 2.5%.\n\nThe question is asking for the nominal rate of interest on a 5-year Treasury bond. The options are 7.5%, 8.5%, 10.5%, and 11.5%.\n\nI recall that there's a relationship between nominal interest rates, real interest rates, and inflation rates. The Fisher equation comes to mind, which is:\n\nNominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Expected inflation rate\n\nSometimes, it's expressed as:\n\nNominal interest rate \u2248 Real interest rate + Expected inflation rate\n\nOr, for more accuracy:\n\n(1 + Nominal rate) = (1 + Real rate) * (1 + Inflation rate)\n\nBut for small rates, the approximation is sufficient.\n\nGiven that, I can plug in the values I have:\n\nReal interest rate = 2.5%\n\nExpected inflation rate for 5 years = 8%\n\nSo, Nominal interest rate = 2.5% + 8% = 10.5%\n\nLooking at the options, 10.5% is option C.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check if I'm doing this correctly. The table provides average annual rates of inflation for different periods. For the 5-year bond, it's straightforward because the expected inflation rate for 5 years is given directly as 8%.\n\nSo, using the Fisher equation, nominal rate = 2.5% + 8% = 10.5%.\n\nAlternatively, using the exact formula:\n\n(1 + Nominal rate) = (1 + 0.025) * (1 + 0.08)\n\nCalculate that:\n\n1.025 * 1.08 = 1.105\n\nSo, nominal rate = 10.5%, which matches the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 10.5%.\n\nBut let's make sure there isn't any trick here. The question mentions that there's no maturity risk, meaning that longer-term interest rates are not affected more by future interest rate movements than shorter-term rates. However, since we're only dealing with the relationship between real rates, nominal rates, and inflation, and we have the expected inflation rate directly for 5 years, I think the Fisher equation is sufficient.\n\nAlso, the fact that it's a U.S. Treasury bond might imply that it's risk-free, but since the real rate is already given, and we're dealing with nominal rates and inflation, I don't think that affects the calculation.\n\nSo, I think C. 10.5% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
