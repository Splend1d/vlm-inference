                    "text": "To find the dollar interest rate for 1 year, we can use the concept of interest rate parity, which relates interest rates and exchange rates between two currencies. The formula for forward discount or premium is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Forward Discount} = \\left( \\frac{F - S}{S} \\right) \\times \\frac{360}{t}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( F \\) is the forward exchange rate\n\n- \\( S \\) is the spot exchange rate\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time to maturity in days\n\nGiven that the spot exchange rate is 15 nanos per dollar, and for the 1-year period, the forward nanos per dollar is 15.6, we can first calculate the forward discount.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the forward discount in percentage terms:\n\n\\[\nF = 15.6 \\, \\text{nanos per dollar}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = 15 \\, \\text{nanos per dollar}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nt = 360 \\, \\text{days} \\, (\\text{assuming a 360-day year for financial calculations})\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Forward Discount} = \\left( \\frac{15.6 - 15}{15} \\right) \\times \\frac{360}{360} = \\left( \\frac{0.6}{15} \\right) \\times 1 = 0.04 = 4\\%\n\\]\n\nSo, the forward discount on nano is 4% per year.\n\nNow, using the interest rate parity formula:\n\n\\[\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + r_f) \\times \\frac{F}{S}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( r_d \\) is the dollar interest rate\n\n- \\( r_f \\) is the nano interest rate\n\n- \\( F \\) is the forward exchange rate\n\n- \\( S \\) is the spot exchange rate\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n(1 + r_d) = (1 + 0.098) \\times \\frac{15.6}{15}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1 + r_d) = (1.098) \\times (1.04)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(1 + r_d) = 1.14292\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr_d = 1.14292 - 1 = 0.14292 = 14.292\\%\n\\]\n\nHowever, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Let's check if we need to annualize or if there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the approximate interest rate parity formula:\n\n\\[\nr_d = r_f + \\text{forward discount}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the forward discount is 4% and the nano interest rate is 9.8%, then:\n\n\\[\nr_d = 9.8\\% + 4\\% = 13.8\\%\n\\]\n\nStill, this doesn't match the options. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the forward discount is applied.\n\nLet's consider the relationship between the interest rates and the forward exchange rate more carefully. The interest rate parity formula can also be expressed as:\n\n\\[\nF = S \\times \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{(1 + r_f)}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( F \\), \\( S \\), and \\( r_f \\), we can solve for \\( r_d \\):\n\n\\[\n15.6 = 15 \\times \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{(1 + 0.098)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n15.6 = 15 \\times \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{1.098}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15.6}{15} = \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{1.098}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.04 = \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{1.098}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + r_d = 1.04 \\times 1.098 = 1.138992\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr_d = 1.138992 - 1 = 0.138992 = 13.8992\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Maybe there's a misinterpretation of the forward discount.\n\nLet's look back at the table. For the 3-month period, the forward discount on nano is given as 4.8%. Perhaps the forward discount is related differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the forward discount is calculated differently. Let's try to use the interest rate parity formula in continuous compounding, though the rates are given as annually compounded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the forward discount is given annually but needs to be adjusted for the period.\n\nWait, perhaps the forward discount is given on a annualized basis, and we need to annualize the interest rates accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to use the actual formula for forward discount in terms of interest rates.\n\nThe forward discount formula can also be expressed in terms of interest rate differentials:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Forward Discount} = \\left( \\frac{F - S}{S} \\right) \\times \\frac{360}{t} = r_f - r_d\n\\]\n\nGiven that, for the 3-month period, the forward discount is 4.8%, and t=90 days:\n\n\\[\n4.8\\% = r_f - r_d\n\\]\n\nBut \\( r_f \\) and \\( r_d \\) are annual rates.\n\nSimilarly, for the 1-year period, the forward discount is 4%, so:\n\n\\[\n4\\% = r_f - r_d\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( r_f = 9.8\\% \\), then:\n\n\\[\n4\\% = 9.8\\% - r_d\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr_d = 9.8\\% - 4\\% = 5.8\\%\n\\]\n\nBut 5.8% isn't among the options. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.\n\nWait, maybe the forward discount formula is different. Let's check the definition again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the forward discount is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Forward Discount} = \\left( \\frac{F - S}{S} \\right) \\times \\frac{360}{t}\n\\]\n\nGiven that for 1 year (t=360 days), forward discount is 4%, F=15.6, S=15:\n\n\\[\n4\\% = \\left( \\frac{15.6 - 15}{15} \\right) \\times \\frac{360}{360} = \\left( \\frac{0.6}{15} \\right) = 0.04 = 4\\%\n\\]\n\nThis checks out. So, the forward discount is correctly calculated.\n\nNow, using the interest rate parity:\n\n\\[\nF = S \\times \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{(1 + r_f)}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n15.6 = 15 \\times \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{(1 + 0.098)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n15.6 = 15 \\times \\frac{(1 + r_d)}{1.098}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{15.6}{15} = \\frac{1 + r_d}{1.098}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1.04 = \\frac{1 + r_d}{1.098}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1 + r_d = 1.04 \\times 1.098 = 1.138992\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr_d = 1.138992 - 1 = 0.138992 = 13.8992\\%\n\\]\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options. Perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided or in the interpretation of the table.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interest rates are continuously compounded, although the problem states they are annually compounded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the forward discount is calculated differently in the context of the problem.\n\nGiven that none of the approaches are leading to one of the provided options, perhaps there's an error in the question or the options.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose the closest option to 13.8992%, it would be C. 15.18%, but that's not close enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the forward discount figure for 1 year.\n\nWait, perhaps the forward discount of 4% is not the forward discount on nano, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the forward discount is given as a percentage per year, but needs to be annualized differently.\n\nGiven the time constraints, and after multiple attempts to align with the provided options, I conclude that the correct answer is not matching any of the options based on standard calculations. However, if forced to choose, option C is the closest, but it's still not accurate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
