The statements are divided into two sections: Income Statement and Balance Sheet.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n\n- **2010:**\n  - Revenue: $474 million\n  - Depreciation: $20 million\n  - Other operating costs: $368 million\n  - Income before taxes: $86 million\n  - Taxes: $26 million\n  - Net income: $60 million\n  - Dividends: $18 million\n  - Earnings per share: $0.714\n  - Dividend per share: $0.214\n  - Common shares outstanding (millions): 84.0\n\n- **2011:**\n  - Revenue: $598 million\n  - Depreciation: $23 million\n  - Other operating costs: $460 million\n  - Income before taxes: $115 million\n  - Taxes: $35 million\n  - Net income: $80 million\n  - Dividends: $24 million\n  - Earnings per share: $0.952\n  - Dividend per share: $0.286\n  - Common shares outstanding (millions): 84.0\n\n**Balance Sheet:**\n\n- **2010:**\n  - Current assets: $201 million\n  - Net property, plant, and equipment: $474 million\n  - Total assets: $675 million\n  - Current liabilities: $57 million\n  - Long-term debt: $0 million\n  - Total liabilities: $57 million\n  - Shareholders' equity: $618 million\n  - Total liabilities and equity: $675 million\n  - Capital expenditures: $34 million\n\n- **2011:**\n  - Current assets: $326 million\n  - Net property, plant, and equipment: $489 million\n  - Total assets: $815 million\n  - Current liabilities: $141 million\n  - Long-term debt: $0 million\n  - Total liabilities: $141 million\n  - Shareholders' equity: $674 million\n  - Total liabilities and equity: $815 million\n  - Capital expenditures: $38 million\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nAbbey Naylor, CFA, has been directed to determine the value of Sundanci's stock using the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model. Naylor believes that Sundanci's FCFE will grow at 27% for 2 years and 13% thereafter. Capital expenditures, depreciation, and working capital are all expected to increase proportionately with FCFE. <image 1> Calculate the amount of FCFE per share for the year 2011, using the data from above table.\n\n"

It's a measure of a company's financial performance and is used in valuation models.\n\n2. **Formula for FCFE**: The general formula for FCFE is:\n   \\[\n   FCFE = Net\\ Income + Non-Cash\\ Charges - Capital\\ Expenditures - Change\\ in\\ Working\\ Capital + New\\ Debt - Debt\\ Repayments\n   \\]\n   However, in this case, we are given specific instructions that capital expenditures, depreciation, and working capital increase proportionately with FCFE. This suggests a different approach, possibly using a growth model.\n\n3. **Given Data**:\n   - For 2011:\n     - Net income: $80 million\n     - Dividends: $24 million\n     - Common shares outstanding: 84 million\n\n4. **Simplify FCFE Calculation**: Since the problem mentions that capital expenditures, depreciation, and working capital increase proportionately with FCFE, and given the information provided, it seems we can use a simplified approach focusing on net income and dividends.\n\n5. **FCFE Calculation**: A common simplification for FCFE is:\n   \\[\n   FCFE = Net\\ Income - Dividends\n   \\]\n   However, this might not fully capture the changes in working capital and capital expenditures. Given the problem's context, it's likely that the FCFE is directly related to the net income minus dividends, adjusted for growth.\n\n6. **Growth Rates**: The problem states that FCFE will grow at 27% for 2 years and 13% thereafter. This suggests that the FCFE for 2011 is the base year, and it will grow at 27% in 2012 and 2013, then at 13% perpetually.\n\n7. **Calculate FCFE for 2011**:\n   - Net income: $80 million\n   - Dividends: $24 million\n   - Therefore, FCFE = $80 million - $24 million = $56 million\n\n8. **FCFE per Share**:\n   - FCFE per share = FCFE / Number of shares outstanding\n   - FCFE per share = $56 million / 84 million shares = $0.6667 per share\n\nHowever, this seems too straightforward, and perhaps I'm missing some adjustments for capital expenditures and working capital. Let's consider a more detailed approach.\n\n9. **Detailed FCFE Calculation**:\n   - Net income: $80 million\n   - Add: Depreciation (non-cash charge): $23 million\n   - Less: Capital expenditures: $38 million\n   - Less: Change in working capital\n\n   To find the change in working capital, we need to look at the balance sheet.\n\n10. **Working Capital Calculation**:\n    - Working capital = Current assets - Current liabilities\n    - For 2010: $201 million - $57 million = $144 million\n    - For 2011: $326 million - $141 million = $185 million\n    - Change in working capital = $185 million - $144 million = $41 million\n\n11. **FCFE Calculation with Working Capital**:\n    \\[\n    FCFE = Net\\ Income + Depreciation - Capital\\ Expenditures - Change\\ in\\ Working\\ Capital\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    FCFE = $80 million + $23 million - $38 million - $41 million = $24 million\n    \\]\n\n12. **FCFE per Share**:\n    \\[\n    FCFE\\ per\\ share = \\frac{$24\\ million}{84\\ million\\ shares} = $0.2857\\ per\\ share\n    \\]\n\nThis result seems more plausible, considering the components involved in FCFE.\n\n13. **Consideration of Dividends**: In some definitions, FCFE includes dividends paid. However, in the formula used above, dividends are not directly included because they are considered part of the cash flow to equity holders. The FCFE calculated above represents the cash available to equity holders after all obligations.\n\n14. **Conclusion**: Based on the detailed calculation, the FCFE per share for Sundanci in 2011 is $0.2857 per share.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.286} \\]\n\n"
