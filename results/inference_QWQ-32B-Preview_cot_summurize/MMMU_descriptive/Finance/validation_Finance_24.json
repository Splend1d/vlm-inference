The key metrics are:\n\n1. **Forecast industry earnings retention rate**: 40%\n2. **Forecast industry return on equity**: 25%\n3. **Industry beta**: 1.2\n4. **Government bond yield**: 6%\n5. **Equity risk premium**: 5%\n\nFirst, let's understand what each of these metrics represents:\n\n- **Earnings retention rate** is the percentage of earnings that are retained in the business rather than paid out as dividends. It is calculated as (1 - dividend payout ratio).\n\n- **Return on equity (ROE)** is a measure of a company's profitability relative to shareholder's equity.\n\n- **Beta** measures the volatility of a stock or industry relative to the overall market.\n\n- **Government bond yield** is the return on risk-free government bonds.\n\n- **Equity risk premium** is the additional return expected from equities over the risk-free rate.\n\nOur goal is to find the P/E ratio, which is the ratio of the price per share to the earnings per share (EPS). In other words, P/E = P0 / E1, where P0 is the current price and E1 is the expected earnings per share for the next period.\n\nTo find P/E, we can use the Gordon Growth Model, which is commonly used for valuing stocks that pay dividends and are expected to grow at a constant rate. The formula for the Gordon Growth Model is:\n\nP0 = D1 / (r - g)\n\nwhere:\n\n- P0 is the current stock price\n\n- D1 is the expected dividend per share one year from now\n\n- r is the required rate of return\n\n- g is the constant growth rate of dividends\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with the industry P/E ratio and not necessarily with dividend-paying stocks, we can adapt this model to use earnings instead of dividends.\n\nFirst, we need to find the growth rate (g) of earnings. The growth rate can be estimated using the retention rate and the ROE:\n\ng = retention rate * ROE\n\nGiven that the retention rate is 40% (or 0.4) and ROE is 25% (or 0.25):\n\ng = 0.4 * 0.25 = 0.10 or 10%\n\nNext, we need to find the required rate of return (r). The required rate of return can be estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):\n\nr = risk-free rate + beta * equity risk premium\n\nGiven that the risk-free rate is the government bond yield of 6% (or 0.06), beta is 1.2, and the equity risk premium is 5% (or 0.05):\n\nr = 0.06 + 1.2 * 0.05 = 0.06 + 0.06 = 0.12 or 12%\n\nNow, using the Gordon Growth Model adapted for earnings:\n\nP0 = E1 / (r - g)\n\nTherefore, the P/E ratio is:\n\nP/E = P0 / E1 = 1 / (r - g)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nP/E = 1 / (0.12 - 0.10) = 1 / 0.02 = 50\n\nSo, the price-to-earnings ratio for the industry is 50.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]"
