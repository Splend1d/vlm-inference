                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the external funds required (EFR) for Eagle Sport Supply if it maintains a dividend payout ratio of 50% and plans a growth rate of 15% in 2020. We'll use the AFN (Additional Funds Needed) formula, which is a common method to calculate external funding requirements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify Key Financial Figures:**\n   - Sales in 2019: $950\n   - Projected sales growth rate: 15%\n   - Dividend payout ratio: 50%\n   - Net income in 2019: $500\n   - Net assets in 2019: $3,000\n   - Debt in 2019: $1,000\n   - Equity in 2019: $2,000\n\n2. **Calculate Projected Sales for 2020:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Projected Sales} = \\text{Sales}_{2019} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate}) = 950 \\times 1.15 = 1,092.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Increase in Assets:**\n   Since assets are proportional to sales:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Increase in Assets} = \\text{Net Assets}_{2019} \\times \\text{growth rate} = 3,000 \\times 0.15 = 450\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Increase in Spontaneous Liabilities:**\n   Spontaneous liabilities are those that increase automatically with sales, such as accounts payable. However, in the given balance sheet, the only liability is debt, which is not necessarily spontaneous. Assuming no spontaneous liabilities, the increase in spontaneous liabilities is $0.\n\n5. **Calculate the Increase in Retained Earnings:**\n   - Net income for 2020:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Net Income}_{2020} = \\text{Net Income}_{2019} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Projected Sales}}{\\text{Sales}_{2019}} \\right) = 500 \\times \\left( \\frac{1,092.5}{950} \\right) = 500 \\times 1.15 = 575\n     \\]\n   - Dividends paid:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Dividends} = \\text{Net Income}_{2020} \\times \\text{payout ratio} = 575 \\times 0.50 = 287.5\n     \\]\n   - Increase in retained earnings:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Increase in Retained Earnings} = \\text{Net Income}_{2020} - \\text{Dividends} = 575 - 287.5 = 287.5\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the External Funds Required (EFR):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{EFR} = \\text{Increase in Assets} - \\text{Increase in Spontaneous Liabilities} - \\text{Increase in Retained Earnings}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{EFR} = 450 - 0 - 287.5 = 162.5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the required external funds are $162.5.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{162.5} \\]"
