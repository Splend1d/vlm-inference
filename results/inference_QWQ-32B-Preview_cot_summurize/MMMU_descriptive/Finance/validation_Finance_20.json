                    "text": "So I have this problem here about Spike Equino, who's the CEO of a medical equipment company. They're planning to sell 100,000 shares of their stock in an open auction. There's a table with different bids, showing how many shares people want to buy and at what price. The question is asking for the total receipts the company will get if it's a discriminatory auction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a discriminatory auction is. From what I recall, in a discriminatory auction, also known as a pay-as-bid auction, each bidder pays the price they bid for the shares they want. So, unlike a uniform price auction where everyone pays the same price, in this type, you pay what you offered for each share.\n\nLooking at the table, it shows different quantities of shares and their corresponding prices:\n\n- 20,000 shares at $80 each\n\n- 10,000 shares at $78 each\n\n- 15,000 shares at $73 each\n\n- 25,000 shares at $70 each\n\n- 10,000 shares at $69 each\n\n- 8,000 shares at $67 each\n\n- 14,000 shares at $66 each\n\n- 15,000 shares at $65 each\n\n- 30,000 shares at $61 each\n\nThe company is selling 100,000 shares. So, I need to figure out which of these bids will be accepted. In a discriminatory auction, typically, the highest bidders get their shares first until the total shares are sold.\n\nSo, I should sort these bids from the highest price to the lowest and see how many shares are covered until reaching 100,000 shares.\n\nLet's list them in descending order of price:\n\n1. $80 per share for 20,000 shares\n\n2. $78 per share for 10,000 shares\n\n3. $73 per share for 15,000 shares\n\n4. $70 per share for 25,000 shares\n\n5. $69 per share for 10,000 shares\n\n6. $67 per share for 8,000 shares\n\n7. $66 per share for 14,000 shares\n\n8. $65 per share for 15,000 shares\n\n9. $61 per share for 30,000 shares\n\nNow, starting from the top:\n\n- First, take the highest bid: 20,000 shares at $80. Total shares sold so far: 20,000\n\n- Next, 10,000 shares at $78. Total shares sold: 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000\n\n- Then, 15,000 shares at $73. Total shares sold: 30,000 + 15,000 = 45,000\n\n- Then, 25,000 shares at $70. Total shares sold: 45,000 + 25,000 = 70,000\n\n- Next, 10,000 shares at $69. Total shares sold: 70,000 + 10,000 = 80,000\n\n- Then, 8,000 shares at $67. Total shares sold: 80,000 + 8,000 = 88,000\n\n- Next, 14,000 shares at $66. Total shares sold: 88,000 + 14,000 = 102,000\n\nWait a minute, the company is only selling 100,000 shares. So, up to this point, accepting the first seven bids would cover 102,000 shares, which is 2,000 more than needed.\n\nTherefore, I need to accept only enough shares to make up 100,000.\n\nSo, after accepting the first six bids, total shares are 88,000. Then, I need another 12,000 shares to reach 100,000.\n\nThe next bid is for 14,000 shares at $66. So, I can accept only 12,000 shares at $66.\n\nTherefore, the total shares sold would be:\n\n- 20,000 at $80\n\n- 10,000 at $78\n\n- 15,000 at $73\n\n- 25,000 at $70\n\n- 10,000 at $69\n\n- 8,000 at $67\n\n- 12,000 at $66\n\nNow, to find the total receipts, I need to calculate the sum of (shares * price) for each of these.\n\nLet's do the calculations step by step:\n\n1. 20,000 shares * $80 = $1,600,000\n\n2. 10,000 shares * $78 = $780,000\n\n3. 15,000 shares * $73 = $1,095,000\n\n4. 25,000 shares * $70 = $1,750,000\n\n5. 10,000 shares * $69 = $690,000\n\n6. 8,000 shares * $67 = $536,000\n\n7. 12,000 shares * $66 = $792,000\n\nNow, add all these amounts together to get the total receipts.\n\nLet's add them step by step:\n\nStart with $1,600,000\n\n+ $780,000 = $2,380,000\n\n+ $1,095,000 = $3,475,000\n\n+ $1,750,000 = $5,225,000\n\n+ $690,000 = $5,915,000\n\n+ $536,000 = $6,451,000\n\n+ $792,000 = $7,243,000\n\nTherefore, the total receipts from the sale would be $7,243,000.\n\nI should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet's verify each multiplication:\n\n1. 20,000 * 80 = 1,600,000 \u2705\n\n2. 10,000 * 78 = 780,000 \u2705\n\n3. 15,000 * 73 = 1,095,000 \u2705\n\n4. 25,000 * 70 = 1,750,000 \u2705\n\n5. 10,000 * 69 = 690,000 \u2705\n\n6. 8,000 * 67 = 536,000 \u2705\n\n7. 12,000 * 66 = 792,000 \u2705\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n1,600,000\n\n+780,000 = 2,380,000 \u2705\n\n+1,095,000 = 3,475,000 \u2705\n\n+1,750,000 = 5,225,000 \u2705\n\n+690,000 = 5,915,000 \u2705\n\n+536,000 = 6,451,000 \u2705\n\n+792,000 = 7,243,000 \u2705\n\nEverything checks out. So, the company's total receipts from the sale would be $7,243,000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7243000} \\]"
