                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Corton Inc. looking to acquire Denham. There's a table with some financial data for both companies, and I need to figure out how the cost of the share offer would change if the expected growth rate wasn't altered by the merger. The options are A through D, with different dollar amounts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about the cost of merging through a stock offer, and how it changes based on the growth rate assumptions. The scenario says that currently, investors expect a 6% growth in Denham's earnings and dividends, but under new management, this could increase to 8% per year without needing extra capital. But the question is asking about the cost if the growth rate wasn't changed by the merger, meaning it would stay at 6%.\n\nI need to recall how to value a company or its shares based on growth rates. I think the Gordon Growth Model might be relevant here, which is a way to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that grow at a constant rate. The formula is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( P \\) is the current stock price.\n\n- \\( D_1 \\) is the expected dividend per share one year from now.\n\n- \\( r \\) is the required rate of return.\n\n- \\( g \\) is the constant growth rate in dividends.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Let me look at the data provided:\n\n- Forecast earnings per share:\n\n  - Corton: $5.00\n\n  - Denham: $1.50\n\n- Forecast dividend per share:\n\n  - Corton: $3.00\n\n  - Denham: $0.80\n\n- Number of shares:\n\n  - Corton: 1,000,000\n\n  - Denham: 600,000\n\n- Stock price:\n\n  - Corton: $90\n\n  - Denham: $20\n\nSo, Denham's current stock price is $20, and they have 600,000 shares outstanding. If Corton wants to acquire Denham through a stock offer, they need to figure out how many shares of Corton to offer in exchange for each Denham share.\n\nBut the question is about the cost of the share offer if the growth rate isn't changed by the merger, meaning it remains at 6%. I think I need to calculate the value of Denham based on the 6% growth rate and then see what the cost would be for Corton to acquire all of Denham's shares.\n\nWait, but Denham's current stock price is already $20, and they have 600,000 shares, so the current market value is $20 * 600,000 = $12,000,000. But the question is about the cost of the share offer, and how it changes with different growth rate assumptions.\n\nMaybe I need to value Denham based on its future dividends, assuming a certain growth rate, and then see what Corton would have to offer in terms of its own shares to match that value.\n\nLet's try using the Gordon Growth Model to value Denham's shares, assuming the growth rate remains at 6%.\n\nFirst, I need to find \\( D_1 \\), the expected dividend per share one year from now. Denham's current forecast dividend is $0.80, and with a 6% growth rate:\n\n\\[ D_1 = D_0 \\times (1 + g) = 0.80 \\times 1.06 = 0.848 \\]\n\nNext, I need to know the required rate of return, \\( r \\). This isn't directly provided, but perhaps I can infer it from Denham's current stock price.\n\nUsing the Gordon Growth Model formula:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nI can rearrange this to solve for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{D_1}{P} + g \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{0.848}{20} + 0.06 = 0.0424 + 0.06 = 0.1024 \\] or 10.24%\n\nSo, the required rate of return is approximately 10.24%.\n\nNow, if the growth rate remains at 6%, and the required return is 10.24%, then the value per share according to the model is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{0.848}{0.1024 - 0.06} = \\frac{0.848}{0.0424} \\approx 20 \\]\n\nWhich matches Denham's current stock price of $20.\n\nBut the question is about the cost of the share offer if the growth rate isn't changed by the merger. I think this means that Denham's growth rate remains at 6%, and I need to find out how much Corton would have to offer in its own shares to acquire Denham.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of the merger is based on Denham's market value, which is already $20 per share, so $20 * 600,000 = $12,000,000.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them list $12,000,000. The options are $3,000,000, $4,000,000, $4,500,000, and $5,000,000.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Perhaps the cost of the merger through a stock offer is based on the exchange ratio of Corton's shares for Denham's shares.\n\nLet me think about that. If Corton offers to exchange its shares for Denham's shares, the value of Corton's shares offered should equal the value of Denham's shares.\n\nLet's say Corton offers \\( x \\) shares for each Denham share. Then, the value of Corton's shares offered per Denham share should equal the value of one Denham share.\n\nGiven that Corton's stock price is $90 and Denham's is $20, the exchange ratio \\( x \\) would be:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{20}{90} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 0.2222 \\]\n\nSo, for each Denham share, Corton would need to give approximately 0.2222 of its own share.\n\nNow, to acquire all of Denham's 600,000 shares, Corton would need to issue:\n\n\\[ 600,000 \\times 0.2222 \\approx 133,333 \\] shares of its own stock.\n\nThe value of these Corton shares would be:\n\n\\[ 133,333 \\times 90 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nAgain, this is the same as Denham's current market value.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options provided. Maybe there's another way to look at this.\n\nPerhaps the question is asking about the cost in terms of Corton's shares, but considering the different growth rates.\n\nWait, the initial scenario assumes that under new management, Denham's growth rate would increase to 8%, but the question is about the cost if the growth rate isn't changed by the merger, meaning it stays at 6%.\n\nMaybe I need to value Denham based on the 6% growth rate and then see how many Corton shares would be needed to buy Denham based on that value.\n\nBut earlier, using the Gordon Growth Model with a 6% growth rate, I got Denham's value per share as $20, which matches its current stock price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Corton would need to offer a premium to Denham's shareholders to acquire the company, and that's where the different options come in.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to calculate a merger premium based on the growth rate assumptions.\n\nIf the growth rate remains at 6%, and Denham's value is $20 per share, but under new management, it would grow at 8%, which is a higher growth rate, potentially increasing Denham's value.\n\nBut the question is about the cost if the growth rate isn't changed, meaning no additional value from new management.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate Denham's value with the higher growth rate and compare it to the value with the lower growth rate.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFirst, calculate Denham's value with the 6% growth rate:\n\n\\[ P_{6\\%} = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} = \\frac{0.848}{0.1024 - 0.06} = \\frac{0.848}{0.0424} \\approx 20 \\]\n\nNow, calculate Denham's value with the 8% growth rate:\n\nFirst, find \\( D_1 \\) with 8% growth:\n\n\\[ D_1 = 0.80 \\times 1.08 = 0.864 \\]\n\nThen, using the same required return of 10.24%:\n\n\\[ P_{8\\%} = \\frac{0.864}{0.1024 - 0.08} = \\frac{0.864}{0.0224} \\approx 38.57 \\]\n\nSo, with an 8% growth rate, Denham's shares would be worth approximately $38.57 each.\n\nBut the question is about the cost if the growth rate isn't changed, meaning it remains at 6%, and Denham's shares are valued at $20 each.\n\nNow, perhaps Corton needs to offer shares based on Denham's higher potential value under new management, but since the growth rate isn't changed, it's valued at $20 per share.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe I should think about the cost of the merger in terms of the number of Corton shares needed to buy Denham's shares at their current market price, without any change in growth rate.\n\nGiven that Denham has 600,000 shares outstanding at $20 each, the total cost would be $12,000,000, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut since this doesn't match any of the options, perhaps there's a different way to compute the cost based on the earnings or some other metric.\n\nLet me consider the price-earnings (P/E) ratio approach.\n\nFirst, find Denham's forecast earnings per share: $1.50.\n\nDenham's current stock price is $20, so its P/E ratio is:\n\n\\[ P/E = \\frac{20}{1.5} \\approx 13.33 \\]\n\nNow, if Corton acquires Denham, and assumes the same P/E ratio for Denham's earnings, then the value of Denham would be based on its earnings multiplied by Corton's P/E ratio.\n\nWait, but Corton has a different P/E ratio.\n\nCorton's earnings per share are $5.00, and its stock price is $90, so its P/E ratio is:\n\n\\[ P/E = \\frac{90}{5} = 18 \\]\n\nIf Corton applies its own P/E ratio to Denham's earnings, then Denham's value per share would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Value per share} = 1.50 \\times 18 = 27 \\]\n\nTherefore, the total value of Denham would be:\n\n\\[ 27 \\times 600,000 = 16,200,000 \\]\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I need to look at the dividend yield approach.\n\nDenham's current dividend is $0.80, and its stock price is $20, so its dividend yield is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Dividend yield} = \\frac{0.80}{20} = 0.04 \\] or 4%\n\nIf Corton offers shares with the same dividend yield, they would need to offer shares that provide the same yield.\n\nCorton's dividend is $3.00 per share, and its stock price is $90, so its dividend yield is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3.00}{90} \\approx 0.0333 \\] or 3.33%\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps directly.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about the exchange ratio based on the dividend yields or some other metric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the cost of the merger in terms of the number of Corton shares issued, multiplied by Corton's stock price, and seeing how that changes with different growth rate assumptions.\n\nBut I'm still not connecting the dots to get to one of the provided options.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe the cost of the merger through a stock offer is based on the market value of Denham, adjusted for the difference in growth rates.\n\nIf the growth rate isn't changed by the merger, then Denham's value remains at $20 per share, as per the Gordon Growth Model.\n\nBut perhaps Corton needs to offer more shares to account for the higher growth potential that isn't being realized.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If the growth rate isn't changed, Denham's value stays the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost of the merger is based on Denham's enterprise value or some other valuation metric.\n\nI'm starting to think that I might be overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me look back at the question:\n\n\"As financial manager of Corton Inc., you are investigating a possible acquisition of Denham. ... You estimate that investors expect a steady growth of about 6% in Denham's earnings and dividends. Under new management, this growth rate would be increased to 8% per year without the need for additional capital. How would the cost of the share offer change if the expected growth rate was not changed by the merger?\"\n\nSo, the cost of the share offer would be different based on whether the growth rate changes or not.\n\nIf the growth rate is increased to 8%, Denham's value would be higher, and thus the cost of the merger would be higher.\n\nBut the question is asking about the cost if the growth rate isn't changed by the merger, meaning it remains at 6%.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to calculate Denham's value with a 6% growth rate and compare it to its value with an 8% growth rate.\n\nEarlier, with a 6% growth rate, Denham's value per share is $20.\n\nWith an 8% growth rate, it's approximately $38.57 per share.\n\nSo, if the growth rate isn't changed, the cost of the merger would be based on the $20 per share value.\n\nBut again, that gives a total cost of $12,000,000, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of the merger through a stock offer is calculated based on the exchange ratio of Corton's shares to Denham's shares.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the exchange ratio would be approximately 0.2222 Corton shares per Denham share.\n\nSo, for 600,000 Denham shares, Corton would need to issue about 133,333 shares.\n\nThe value of these Corton shares is $12,000,000, but perhaps the number of shares is what's relevant here.\n\nBut the options are in dollar amounts, not in the number of shares.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the cost in terms of the number of Corton shares issued, and then see what that costs Corton.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost of the merger is based on Denham's forecast earnings or dividends.\n\nLet me try calculating the present value of Denham's future dividends with a 6% growth rate.\n\nUsing the Gordon Growth Model:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{D_1}{r - g} \\]\n\nWith \\( D_1 = 0.848 \\), \\( r = 0.1024 \\), and \\( g = 0.06 \\), which gives \\( P = 20 \\), as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the forecast earnings and apply a certain multiple.\n\nBut I'm still not getting to one of the provided options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the impact on Corton's earnings per share after the merger.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nIf Corton acquires Denham, and assuming no change in growth rate, Denham's earnings remain at $1.50 per share growing at 6%.\n\nCorton's earnings are $5.00 per share.\n\nAfter the merger, the total earnings would be:\n\nCorton's earnings: $5.00 per share * 1,000,000 shares = $5,000,000\n\nDenham's earnings: $1.50 per share * 600,000 shares = $900,000\n\nTotal earnings: $5,000,000 + $900,000 = $5,900,000\n\nIf Corton issues 133,333 new shares to acquire Denham, its total number of shares would be:\n\n1,000,000 + 133,333 = 1,133,333 shares\n\nThus, the new earnings per share would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{EPS}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{5,900,000}{1,133,333} \\approx 5.21 \\]\n\nBut I don't see how this relates to the cost of the share offer.\n\nWait, maybe the cost of the merger is based on the dilution of Corton's earnings per share.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how to connect this to the provided options.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the present value of Denham's future earnings or dividends under the 6% growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about the cost of the share offer in terms of the number of Corton shares required to buy Denham, valued at their respective stock prices.\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the cost of the merger in terms of the market value of Corton shares issued.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, Corton needs to issue approximately 133,333 shares to buy Denham's 600,000 shares.\n\nAt Corton's stock price of $90, the cost would be:\n\n\\[ 133,333 \\times 90 = 12,000,000 \\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is based on Denham's market"
