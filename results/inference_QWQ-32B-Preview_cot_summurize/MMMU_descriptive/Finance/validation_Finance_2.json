                    "text": "Given that we're dealing with a three-factor APT model, the expected return of a stock can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nExpected Return = Risk-Free Rate + \u03b2\u2081 * Risk Premium\u2081 + \u03b2\u2082 * Risk Premium\u2082 + \u03b2\u2083 * Risk Premium\u2083\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082, \u03b2\u2083 are the stock's sensitivities (betas) to each of the three factors.\n\n- Risk Premium\u2081, Risk Premium\u2082, Risk Premium\u2083 are the risk premiums associated with each factor.\n\nFrom the description, the three factors and their risk premiums are:\n\n1. Change in gross national product (GNP): +5%\n\n2. Change in energy prices: -1%\n\n3. Change in long-term interest rates: +2%\n\nThe risk-free interest rate is 7%.\n\nThe problem states that the stock's return is uncorrelated with all three factors. In the context of the APT model, this means that the stock's betas (sensitivities) to all three factors are zero (\u03b2\u2081 = \u03b2\u2082 = \u03b2\u2083 = 0).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\nExpected Return = 7% + 0*5% + 0*(-1%) + 0*2% = 7% + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7%\n\nTherefore, the expected rate of return on this stock is 7%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{7\\%} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nIn the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model, the expected return of a stock is determined by its sensitivity to various macroeconomic factors, each of which has an associated risk premium. The formula for the expected return is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected Return} = \\text{Risk-Free Rate} + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Risk Premium}_1 + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{Risk Premium}_2 + \\beta_3 \\times \\text{Risk Premium}_3 \\]\n\nGiven that the stock's return is uncorrelated with all three factors, its betas (sensitivities) to these factors are zero. Therefore, the expected return simplifies to just the risk-free rate.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Risk-Free Rate = 7%\n\n- Risk Premiums: +5%, -1%, +2%\n\n- Betas: 0 for all factors\n\nCalculation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Expected Return} = 7\\% + 0 \\times 5\\% + 0 \\times (-1\\%) + 0 \\times 2\\% = 7\\% + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7\\% \\]\n\nThus, the expected rate of return on the stock is 7%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
