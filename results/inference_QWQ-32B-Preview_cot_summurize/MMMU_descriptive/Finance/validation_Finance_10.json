The first column is labeled \"U.S. Dollar/Franc,\" and the second column is labeled \"Franc/U.S. Dollar.\" The rows represent different time periods for the exchange rates:\n\n- The first row is labeled \"Spot\" and has the values 1.6590 for U.S. Dollar/Franc and 0.6028 for Franc/U.S. Dollar.\n- The second row is labeled \"30-day forward\" and has the values 1.6540 for U.S. Dollar/Franc and 0.6046 for Franc/U.S. Dollar.\n- The third row is labeled \"90-day forward\" and has the values 1.6460 for U.S. Dollar/Franc and 0.6075 for Franc/U.S. Dollar.\n- The fourth row is labeled \"180-day forward\" and has the values 1.6400 for U.S. Dollar/Franc and 0.6098 for Franc/U.S. Dollar.\n\nThese values represent the exchange rates for converting between U.S. Dollars and Francs at different points in time, including the spot rate and forward rates for 30, 90, and 180 days in the future.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nBoisjoly Watch Imports has agreed to purchase 15,000 Swiss watches for 1 million francs at today's spot rate. The firm's financial manager, James Desreumaux, has noted the following current spot and forward rates: <image 1> On the same day, Desreumaux agrees to purchase 15,000 more watches in 3 months at the same price of 1 million francs. If the exchange rate for the Swiss franc is 0.50 to $1 in 90 days, how much will Desreumaux have to pay (in dollars) for the watches?\n\n"

                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Boisjoly Watch Imports and their purchase of Swiss watches. Let me try to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the company has agreed to buy 15,000 Swiss watches for 1 million francs at today's spot rate. Then, on the same day, they agree to buy another 15,000 watches in 3 months at the same price of 1 million francs. The question is asking how much Desreumaux will have to pay in dollars for the second batch of watches if the exchange rate in 90 days is 0.50 dollars to one franc.\n\nOkay, so I need to find out the dollar cost of 1 million francs at the exchange rate of 0.50 dollars per franc.\n\nWait a minute, the exchange rate is given as 0.50 dollars per franc. So, for every franc, you get 0.50 dollars. But I need to convert francs to dollars, so I should multiply the number of francs by the exchange rate.\n\nSo, 1,000,000 francs * 0.50 dollars/franc = 500,000 dollars.\n\nIs that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check the exchange rate notation.\n\nIn the description, there's a table with spot and forward exchange rates. The spot rate is 1.6590 US Dollar/Franc and 0.6028 Franc/US Dollar. Wait, but in the problem, it says the exchange rate in 90 days is 0.50 dollars to one franc. That seems different from the table provided.\n\nHmm, maybe the table is just for reference, and the problem is giving a different exchange rate for the forward contract.\n\nBut according to the problem, the exchange rate in 90 days is 0.50 dollars per franc. So, to find out how many dollars are needed to buy 1 million francs, I multiply 1,000,000 francs by 0.50 dollars per franc, which equals 500,000 dollars.\n\nWait, but in the table, the 90-day forward rate is 1.6460 US Dollar/Franc and 0.6075 Franc/US Dollar. But the problem states that the exchange rate in 90 days is 0.50 dollars to one franc, which seems inconsistent with the table.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake here. Perhaps the problem is overriding the table with the new exchange rate of 0.50 dollars per franc in 90 days.\n\nIn that case, I should use the given rate of 0.50 dollars per franc to calculate the cost.\n\nSo, 1,000,000 francs * 0.50 dollars/franc = 500,000 dollars.\n\nAlternatively, if the exchange rate is 0.50 dollars per franc, that means 1 franc = 0.50 dollars, so to find out how many dollars are needed for 1 million francs, it's straightforward multiplication.\n\nI think that's the answer: Desreumaux will have to pay 500,000 dollars for the watches.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor involved, like forward contracts or something. The problem mentions that they agreed to purchase the watches in 3 months at the same price of 1 million francs, and the exchange rate in 90 days is 0.50 dollars to one franc.\n\nSo, it seems like a straightforward conversion at the future rate.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 500,000 dollars.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500000} \\]"
