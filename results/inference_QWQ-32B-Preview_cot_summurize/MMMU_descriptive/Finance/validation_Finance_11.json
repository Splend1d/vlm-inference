The first row lists the initial investment for both expansions, which is $12,000 for both. The second row lists the annual rate of return under three scenarios: pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic. For Expansion A, the rates are 16%, 20%, and 24%, respectively. For Expansion B, the rates are 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nSolar Designs is considering an investment in an expanded product line. Two possible types of expansion are being considered. After investigating the possible outcomes, the company made the estimates shown in the following table. <image 1> Determine the range of the rates of return for each of the two projects.\n\nA.

So, for each expansion, the range would be from the pessimistic to the optimistic rate.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Expansion A: 16% to 24%\n\n- Expansion B: 10% to 30%\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. Expansion A: 20% to 24%; Expansion B: 10% to 30%\n\nB. Expansion A: 16% to 24%; Expansion B: 10% to 30%\n\nC. Expansion A: 16% to 24%; Expansion B: 20% to 30%\n\nD. Expansion A: 20% to 24%; Expansion B: 20% to 30%\n\nThe correct answer is B. Expansion A: 16% to 24%; Expansion B: 10% to 30%\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they either misrepresent the minimum or maximum rates for one or both expansions.\n\n- Option A incorrectly sets the minimum rate for Expansion A at 20% instead of 16%.\n\n- Option C incorrectly sets the maximum rate for Expansion B at 30%, but the pessimistic rate is 10%, so the range should include 10%.\n\n- Option D has incorrect minimum rates for both expansions.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
