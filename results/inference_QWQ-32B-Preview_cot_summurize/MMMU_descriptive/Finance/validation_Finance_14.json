Here are the key details:\n\n### Balance Sheet (Fiscal 2017)\n- **Assets:**\n  - Current assets:\n    - Cash and marketable securities: $6,756\n    - Accounts receivable: $5,614\n    - Inventories: $43,783\n    - Other current assets: $3,511\n    - Total current assets: $59,664\n  - Fixed assets:\n    - Net fixed assets: $114,818\n    - Other long-term assets: $30,040\n    - Total assets: $204,522\n\n- **Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity:**\n  - Current liabilities:\n    - Accounts payable: $46,092\n    - Other current liabilities: $32,429\n    - Total current liabilities: $78,521\n  - Long-term debt: $36,825\n  - Other long-term liabilities: $11,307\n  - Total liabilities: $126,653\n  - Total shareholders' equity: $77,869\n  - Total liabilities and shareholders' equity: $204,522\n\n### Income Statement (Fiscal 2017)\n- Net sales: $500,343\n- Cost of goods sold: $373,396\n- Selling, general, and administrative expenses: $95,981\n- Depreciation: $10,529\n- Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT): $20,437\n- Interest expense: $2,178\n- Taxable income: $18,259\n- Tax: $4,600\n- Net income: $13,659\n\nAdditional information provided:\n- At the end of fiscal 2017, Walmart had 2,960 million shares outstanding with a share price of $106.\n- The company's weighted-average cost of capital was about 5%.\n- Assume the marginal corporate tax rate was 35%.\n\nBased on this information, we need to calculate Economic Value Added (EVA). EVA is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{EVA} = \\text{Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT)} - (\\text{Capital Employed} \\times \\text{Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)}) \\]\n\nGiven:\n- Net income: $13,659\n- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 5%\n- Capital Employed: Total assets - Non-interest-bearing current liabilities\n  - Total assets: $204,522\n  - Non-interest-bearing current liabilities: Accounts payable + Other current liabilities = $46,092 + $32,429 = $78,521\n  - Capital Employed = $204,522 - $78,521 = $125,991\n\nNow, calculate EVA:\n\\[ \\text{EVA} = 13,659 - (125,991 \\times 0.05) \\]\n\\[ \\text{EVA} = 13,659 - 6,299.55 \\]\n\\[ \\text{EVA} = 7,359.45 \\]\n\nTherefore, the closest option is B. $7,340.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe following table gives abbreviated balance sheets and income statements for Walmart. <image 1> At the end of fiscal 2017, Walmart had 2,960 million shares outstanding with a share price of $106. The company's weighted-average cost of capital was about 5%. Assume the marginal corporate tax rate was 35%. Calculate Economic value added.\n\nA. $6,340\nB. $7,340\nC. $8,340\nD. $9,340\n"
