                    "text": "I've got this problem here about Verbrugge Publishing Company. They've got a balance sheet and an income statement for 2010, and there's this recapitalization plan. I need to figure out the income available to common shareholders after this recapitalization.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's going on with the recapitalization. There are two preferred stock issues: one that's $6 preferred and another that's $10.50 preferred. According to the plan, the $6 preferred is being exchanged for a new $2.40 preferred with a par value of $37.50 plus an 8% subordinated income debenture with a par value of $75. The $10.50 preferred is being retired with cash.\n\nI need to find out how this affects the income available to common shareholders. Let's look at the income statement:\n\n- Net sales: $540.0 million\n\n- Operating expenses: $516.0 million\n\n- Net operating income: $24.0 million\n\n- Other income: $3.0 million\n\n- Earnings before taxes (EBT): $27.0 million\n\n- Taxes (50%): $13.5 million\n\n- Net income: $13.5 million\n\n- Dividends on $6 preferred: $7.2 million\n\n- Dividends on $10.50 preferred: $0.6 million\n\n- Income available to common stockholders: $5.7 million\n\nOkay, so currently, the income available to common stockholders is $5.7 million. But with the recapitalization, things are changing.\n\nFirst, the $10.50 preferred is being retired with cash. That means they're going to pay off the $10.50 preferred shareholders with cash, and those shares will be gone. Currently, they're paying $0.6 million in dividends on this preferred stock.\n\nSecond, the $6 preferred is being exchanged for a new $2.40 preferred and some debentures. The new preferred pays $2.40 per share, and the debentures pay 8% interest.\n\nI need to find out what the new dividend obligations are and see how that affects the income available to common stockholders.\n\nLet's first look at the number of shares for each preferred stock.\n\nFrom the balance sheet:\n\n- $6 preferred stock, $112.50 par value, 1,200,000 shares, totaling $135 million\n\n- $10.50 preferred stock, no par, callable at $150, 60,000 shares, totaling $9 million\n\nWait, the $6 preferred has a par value of $112.50, and there are 1,200,000 shares, which would be $112.50 * 1,200,000 = $135 million, which matches the balance sheet.\n\nSimilarly, the $10.50 preferred has 60,000 shares totaling $9 million, so each share is worth $150 (since it's callable at $150, which might be its value).\n\nNow, in the recapitalization:\n\nEach share of $6 preferred is exchanged for one share of $2.40 preferred with a par value of $37.50 plus one 8% subordinated income debenture with a par value of $75.\n\nSo, for each $6 preferred share:\n\n- Get one $2.40 preferred share with par $37.50\n\n- Get one debenture with par $75, paying 8% interest.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total number of $6 preferred shares: 1,200,000 shares.\n\nSo, 1,200,000 new $2.40 preferred shares will be issued, each with par value $37.50, so total preferred stock would be 1,200,000 * $37.50 = $45 million.\n\nAlso, 1,200,000 debentures will be issued, each with par value $75, so total debentures would be 1,200,000 * $75 = $90 million.\n\nNow, the $10.50 preferred is being retired with cash. They have 60,000 shares, each worth $150, so total cost to retire is 60,000 * $150 = $9 million.\n\nSo, in the recapitalization:\n\n- Issue $45 million of new $2.40 preferred\n\n- Issue $90 million of 8% debentures\n\n- Pay $9 million in cash to retire the $10.50 preferred\n\nNow, let's see how this affects the income available to common stockholders.\n\nFirst, the dividends paid will change.\n\nPreviously:\n\n- $6 preferred: $7.2 million\n\n- $10.50 preferred: $0.6 million\n\nTotal dividends paid: $7.2 + $0.6 = $7.8 million\n\nNet income: $13.5 million\n\nIncome available to common: $13.5 - $7.8 = $5.7 million\n\nAfter recapitalization:\n\n- New $2.40 preferred: 1,200,000 shares * $2.40 = $2.88 million\n\n- Debentures: $90 million * 8% = $7.2 million in interest\n\n- No more $10.50 preferred dividends\n\nSo, total payouts:\n\n- New preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\n- Debenture interest: $7.2 million\n\nTotal payouts: $2.88 + $7.2 = $10.08 million\n\nNet income: Still $13.5 million (assuming no change in net income)\n\nTherefore, income available to common stockholders: $13.5 - $10.08 = $3.42 million\n\nWait, but the answer is supposed to be $5 million, according to the earlier description.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check the net income again. Is there any change in the net income due to the recapitalization?\n\nWell, the debentures pay interest, which is deductible before taxes, so perhaps there's a tax shield effect.\n\nWait, in the income statement, taxes are 50% of EBT.\n\nLet me see:\n\nOriginal situation:\n\n- EBT: $27 million\n\n- Taxes: $13.5 million\n\n- Net income: $13.5 million\n\nAfter recapitalization, if there's additional interest expense, that would reduce EBT, which would reduce taxes, but also reduce net income.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust for the interest expense on the new debentures.\n\nLet's try to recast the income statement after the recapitalization.\n\nOriginal:\n\n- Net sales: $540 million\n\n- Operating expenses: $516 million\n\n- Net operating income: $24 million\n\n- Other income: $3 million\n\n- EBT: $27 million\n\n- Taxes (50%): $13.5 million\n\n- Net income: $13.5 million\n\nNow, with the new debentures, there's an interest expense of $90 million * 8% = $7.2 million.\n\nThis interest is deductible before taxes, so it will reduce EBT.\n\nSo, adjusted EBT would be $27 million - $7.2 million = $19.8 million\n\nTaxes: 50% of $19.8 million = $9.9 million\n\nNet income: $19.8 million - $9.9 million = $9.9 million\n\nNow, dividends:\n\n- New preferred: $2.88 million\n\n- No $10.50 preferred\n\nSo, total payouts: $2.88 million\n\nIncome available to common: $9.9 million - $2.88 million = $7.02 million\n\nHmm, that's close to $7 million, which is one of the options.\n\nBut according to the earlier description, the answer is $5 million.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the entire interest expense is deductible.\n\nOr maybe there's something about the retirement of the $10.50 preferred.\n\nWait, when they retire the $10.50 preferred with cash, they pay $9 million in cash. Does that affect the balance sheet, but not the income statement?\n\nYes, retiring the preferred likely affects the balance sheet but not the income statement directly.\n\nWait, but if they pay $9 million in cash, that would reduce their cash and preferred stock by $9 million.\n\nBut in terms of the income statement, there might be no immediate effect, unless there's a gain or loss on retirement, which isn't mentioned.\n\nSo, perhaps my earlier calculation is correct: net income after recapitalization is $9.9 million, minus $2.88 million for preferred dividends, leaving $7.02 million for common stockholders.\n\nBut the answer is supposed to be $5 million, according to the earlier description.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the $10.50 preferred was paying $0.6 million in dividends, which will no longer be paid after retirement, so that saves $0.6 million.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I only considered the new preferred dividends of $2.88 million, but perhaps I need to adjust for the elimination of the $0.6 million dividend.\n\nWait, no. The $10.50 preferred is being retired, so its dividend is no longer paid.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, I only included the new preferred dividends of $2.88 million, which is correct, as the $10.50 preferred is gone.\n\nSo, total dividends paid after recapitalization: only $2.88 million.\n\nNet income after recapitalization: $9.9 million\n\nThus, income available to common: $9.9 - $2.88 = $7.02 million\n\nBut the answer is supposed to be $5 million.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in assuming the tax rate remains at 50%.\n\nPerhaps the interest on the debentures is not fully tax-deductible, or maybe there are other factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the net income doesn't change because the interest expense is offset by other changes.\n\nWait, maybe I need to look at the way the income statement is structured.\n\nOriginal income statement:\n\n- Net sales: $540 million\n\n- Operating expenses: $516 million\n\n- Net operating income: $24 million\n\n- Other income: $3 million\n\n- EBT: $27 million\n\n- Taxes: $13.5 million\n\n- Net income: $13.5 million\n\nNow, with the new interest expense of $7.2 million, EBT would be $27 million - $7.2 million = $19.8 million\n\nTaxes at 50%: $9.9 million\n\nNet income: $19.8 - $9.9 = $9.9 million\n\nThen, subtract the new preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\nIncome to common: $9.9 - $2.88 = $7.02 million\n\nBut according to the earlier description, the income available to common shareholders is $5.7 million, and the answer is $5 million.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the net income doesn't change because the interest expense is already factored in.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the other income of $3 million includes interest income or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the interest expense is already included in the operating expenses.\n\nWait, operating expenses are $516 million, and net sales are $540 million, giving net operating income of $24 million.\n\nThen, other income is $3 million, bringing EBT to $27 million.\n\nIf the interest expense is a separate line item in the income statement, perhaps as \"interest expense,\" but it's not shown here.\n\nWait, in the original income statement, there's no line item for interest expense. Maybe it's included in operating expenses.\n\nIf that's the case, then adding an additional $7.2 million in interest expense would require adjusting the operating expenses or creating a separate line item.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet's consider the change in cash flows.\n\nBefore recapitalization:\n\n- Net income: $13.5 million\n\n- Dividends on $6 preferred: $7.2 million\n\n- Dividends on $10.50 preferred: $0.6 million\n\n- Income to common: $5.7 million\n\nAfter recapitalization:\n\n- They pay $9 million in cash to retire the $10.50 preferred\n\n- Issue $45 million of new $2.40 preferred\n\n- Issue $90 million of 8% debentures\n\nSo, their liabilities and equity change.\n\nBut in terms of income available to common shareholders, it's net income minus preferred dividends.\n\nIn the new structure:\n\n- Preferred dividends: 1,200,000 shares * $2.40 = $2.88 million\n\n- Interest on debentures: 1,200,000 * $75 * 8% = $7.2 million\n\nSo, total payouts: $2.88 + $7.2 = $10.08 million\n\nIf net income remains $13.5 million, then income to common would be $13.5 - $10.08 = $3.42 million\n\nBut earlier, I thought net income would adjust for the interest expense.\n\nWait, perhaps net income does decrease by the interest expense after tax.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nOriginal net income: $13.5 million\n\nInterest expense: $7.2 million\n\nTax rate: 50%\n\nThe interest savings would be $7.2 million * 50% = $3.6 million in tax savings\n\nSo, net effect on net income: -$7.2 million + $3.6 million = -$3.6 million\n\nThus, new net income: $13.5 - $3.6 = $9.9 million\n\nThen, subtract new preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\nIncome to common: $9.9 - $2.88 = $7.02 million\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the $5 million answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the tax rate changes or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is $5 million, which is closest to $5.7 million, the original income to common.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the recapitalization changes the payouts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $6 preferred was 1,200,000 shares, but maybe the par value is different.\n\nWait, the $6 preferred has a par value of $112.50, and they're exchanging for $2.40 preferred with par value $37.50 and a $75 debenture.\n\nSo, the total consideration per share is $37.50 (preferred) + $75 (debenture) = $112.50, which matches the original par value of $112.50.\n\nSo, it's a parity transaction in terms of par value.\n\nBut in terms of cash flows, the dividends change.\n\nOriginal $6 preferred pays $6 per share, so $7.2 million total.\n\nNew $2.40 preferred pays $2.40 per share, so $2.88 million total.\n\nAdditionally, the debentures pay 8% of $75, which is $6 per debenture, so total interest is $7.2 million.\n\nSo, total payouts after recapitalization: $2.88 million (preferred) + $7.2 million (interest) = $10.08 million\n\nOriginal payouts: $7.2 million ( $6 preferred) + $0.6 million ( $10.50 preferred) = $7.8 million\n\nSo, payouts increase by $10.08 - $7.8 = $2.28 million\n\nIf net income remains the same, income to common decreases by $2.28 million, from $5.7 million to $3.42 million\n\nBut again, this doesn't match the $5 million answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps net income changes due to the tax shield on the interest.\n\nEarlier, I calculated that the interest expense is $7.2 million, with a tax shield of $3.6 million, so net effect on net income is -$3.6 million, from $13.5 to $9.9 million\n\nThen, subtract $2.88 million for preferred dividends, leaving $7.02 million for common.\n\nBut the answer is supposed to be $5 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the answer options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the net income doesn't change because the interest expense is already factored into the operating expenses.\n\nWait, in the original income statement, operating expenses are $516 million, which might include interest expense.\n\nIf that's the case, then adding additional interest expense would increase operating expenses further.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nOriginal operating expenses: $516 million\n\nAdd new interest expense: $7.2 million\n\nNew operating expenses: $516 + $7.2 = $523.2 million\n\nNet operating income: $540 - $523.2 = $16.8 million\n\nAdd other income: $3 million\n\nEBT: $19.8 million\n\nTaxes: 50% of $19.8 = $9.9 million\n\nNet income: $9.9 million\n\nSubtract preferred dividends: $2.88 million\n\nIncome to common: $9.9 - $2.88 = $7.02 million\n\nStill, not $5 million.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other income includes investment income that is lost due to the recapitalization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me look back at the balance sheet to see if there are any clues.\n\nBalance sheet:\n\nAssets:\n\n- Current assets: $168 million\n\n- Net fixed assets: $153 million\n\n- Goodwill: $15 million\n\n- Total assets: $336 million\n\nLiabilities and equity:\n\n- Current liabilities: $42 million\n\n- Advance payments: $78 million\n\n- Reserves: $6 million\n\n- $6 preferred stock: $135 million\n\n- $10.50 preferred stock: $9 million\n\n- Common stock: $9 million\n\n- Retained earnings: $57"
