The nominal stock market return for 1932 is given as -9.9%, and the inflation rate for that year is -10.3%.\n\nThe formula to calculate the real return is:\n\nReal Return = (1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation Rate) - 1\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nReal Return = (1 + (-0.099)) / (1 + (-0.103)) - 1\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n\n1 + (-0.103) = 0.897\n\nNow, calculate the numerator:\n\n1 + (-0.099) = 0.901\n\nSo, Real Return = 0.901 / 0.897 - 1\n\nDivide 0.901 by 0.897:\n\n0.901 / 0.897 \u2248 1.00446\n\nNow, subtract 1:\n\n1.00446 - 1 = 0.00446\n\nConvert this to a percentage:\n\n0.00446 * 100 \u2248 0.45%\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. -14.33%\n\nB. -23.72%\n\nC. 0.45%\n\nD. 56.52%\n\nThe correct answer is C. 0.45%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
