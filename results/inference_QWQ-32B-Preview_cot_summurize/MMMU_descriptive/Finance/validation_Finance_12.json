                    "text": "To calculate the rate of return for the second period (from time \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\)) for each stock, we need to consider both the price change and any dividends or splits that occur during that period. In this case, Stock C undergoes a two-for-one split in the last period, which affects its share count and price.\n\nThe general formula for the rate of return over a period is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{P_{t+1} + D_t - P_t}{P_t}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( P_{t+1} \\) is the price at the end of the period\n- \\( D_t \\) is any dividend paid during the period\n- \\( P_t \\) is the price at the beginning of the period\n\nSince there is no mention of dividends in the table, we'll assume \\( D_t = 0 \\) for all stocks.\n\nHowever, for Stock C, there is a two-for-one split, which means the number of shares outstanding doubles, and the price per share is halved to adjust for the split.\n\nFirst, let's adjust the price of Stock C for the split.\n\nGiven:\n- Before split: \\( P_1 = 110 \\), \\( Q_1 = 200 \\)\n- After split: \\( P_2 = 55 \\), \\( Q_2 = 400 \\)\n\nThe split adjusts the price from \\( P_1 = 110 \\) to \\( P_2' = \\frac{P_2}{2} = \\frac{55}{2} = 27.5 \\), but actually, the price is reported as \\( P_2 = 55 \\), which reflects the split.\n\nWait a minute, that seems confusing. Let's clarify.\n\nIn a two-for-one split, each share splits into two shares, and the price per share is halved to reflect the increased number of shares.\n\nSo, if Stock C has \\( P_1 = 110 \\) and \\( Q_1 = 200 \\) at time \\( t = 1 \\), after the split at time \\( t = 2 \\), the number of shares doubles to \\( Q_2 = 400 \\), and the price per share should be halved to \\( P_2' = \\frac{110}{2} = 55 \\), which matches the given \\( P_2 = 55 \\).\n\nTherefore, the price adjustment due to the split is already reflected in the given data.\n\nNow, we can calculate the rate of return for each stock from \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\).\n\n### Stock A\n\n- \\( P_1 = 95 \\)\n- \\( P_2 = 95 \\)\n\n\\[\nr_A = \\frac{95 + 0 - 95}{95} = \\frac{0}{95} = 0\\%\n\\]\n\n### Stock B\n\n- \\( P_1 = 45 \\)\n- \\( P_2 = 45 \\)\n\n\\[\nr_B = \\frac{45 + 0 - 45}{45} = \\frac{0}{45} = 0\\%\n\\]\n\n### Stock C\n\n- \\( P_1 = 110 \\)\n- \\( P_2 = 55 \\)\n\n\\[\nr_C = \\frac{55 + 0 - 110}{110} = \\frac{-55}{110} = -0.5 = -50\\%\n\\]\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense because the split should not cause a negative return if the value remains the same.\n\nLet me rethink this.\n\nIn reality, a stock split doesn't change the total value of the investment; it just changes the number of shares and the price per share.\n\nSo, if Stock C had \\( P_1 = 110 \\) and \\( Q_1 = 200 \\) at \\( t = 1 \\), the total value is \\( 110 \\times 200 = 22,000 \\).\n\nAfter the split, \\( P_2 = 55 \\) and \\( Q_2 = 400 \\), the total value is \\( 55 \\times 400 = 22,000 \\), which is the same.\n\nTherefore, there should be no return from the split itself.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust the price series to reflect the split.\n\nIn calculating the rate of return, to account for the split, I should adjust the price at \\( t = 1 \\) to reflect the split's impact.\n\nFor Stock C, since it splits 2-for-1, the adjusted price at \\( t = 1 \\) would be \\( P_1' = \\frac{P_1}{2} = \\frac{110}{2} = 55 \\).\n\nThen, the rate of return would be:\n\n\\[\nr_C = \\frac{P_2 - P_1'}{P_1'} = \\frac{55 - 55}{55} = \\frac{0}{55} = 0\\%\n\\]\n\nThis makes more sense because the split shouldn't affect the rate of return; it's just a change in the number of shares.\n\nSo, for stocks that undergo splits, we need to adjust the prices accordingly to calculate the correct rate of return.\n\nTherefore, for Stock C, the rate of return from \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\) is 0%.\n\nBut the question seems to suggest that there is a rate of return, and the options provided are 0%, 1.23%, 2.38%, and 3.57%.\n\nGiven that for Stocks A and B, the prices remain the same, their returns are 0%.\n\nFor Stock C, after adjusting for the split, the return is also 0%.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the split occurs before \\( t = 2 \\), and the price adjustment is already reflected, so no further adjustment is needed.\n\nIn that case, the return for Stock C is:\n\n\\[\nr_C = \\frac{55 - 110}{110} = \\frac{-55}{110} = -0.5 = -50\\%\n\\]\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the total value hasn't changed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split is reflected in the shares outstanding, and the price is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the total value.\n\nLet me calculate the total value for each stock at \\( t = 1 \\) and \\( t = 2 \\).\n\n### Stock A\n\n- \\( P_1 = 95 \\), \\( Q_1 = 100 \\) \u2192 Value at \\( t = 1 \\): \\( 95 \\times 100 = 9,500 \\)\n- \\( P_2 = 95 \\), \\( Q_2 = 100 \\) \u2192 Value at \\( t = 2 \\): \\( 95 \\times 100 = 9,500 \\)\n\n### Stock B\n\n- \\( P_1 = 45 \\), \\( Q_1 = 200 \\) \u2192 Value at \\( t = 1 \\): \\( 45 \\times 200 = 9,000 \\)\n- \\( P_2 = 45 \\), \\( Q_2 = 200 \\) \u2192 Value at \\( t = 2 \\): \\( 45 \\times 200 = 9,000 \\)\n\n### Stock C\n\n- \\( P_1 = 110 \\), \\( Q_1 = 200 \\) \u2192 Value at \\( t = 1 \\): \\( 110 \\times 200 = 22,000 \\)\n- \\( P_2 = 55 \\), \\( Q_2 = 400 \\) \u2192 Value at \\( t = 2 \\): \\( 55 \\times 400 = 22,000 \\)\n\nSo, for all stocks, the total value remains the same from \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\), indicating that the rate of return should be 0%.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different interpretation or a different way to calculate the return that leads to one of the provided options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the rate of return of a portfolio consisting of these three stocks.\n\nLet's explore that possibility.\n\nFirst, calculate the total value of the portfolio at \\( t = 1 \\) and \\( t = 2 \\).\n\n### Portfolio Value at \\( t = 1 \\)\n\n\\[\nV_1 = (P_{A1} \\times Q_{A1}) + (P_{B1} \\times Q_{B1}) + (P_{C1} \\times Q_{C1}) = (95 \\times 100) + (45 \\times 200) + (110 \\times 200) = 9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000 = 40,500\n\\]\n\n### Portfolio Value at \\( t = 2 \\)\n\n\\[\nV_2 = (P_{A2} \\times Q_{A2}) + (P_{B2} \\times Q_{B2}) + (P_{C2} \\times Q_{C2}) = (95 \\times 100) + (45 \\times 200) + (55 \\times 400) = 9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000 = 40,500\n\\]\n\nAgain, the total portfolio value remains the same from \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\), suggesting a rate of return of 0%.\n\nBut 0% is one of the options, option A.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different way to calculate the portfolio return, considering the weight of each stock.\n\nLet's calculate the weighted average return.\n\nFirst, calculate the weight of each stock at \\( t = 1 \\):\n\n\\[\nW_A = \\frac{9,500}{40,500} \\approx 0.2346\n\\]\n\\[\nW_B = \\frac{9,000}{40,500} \\approx 0.2222\n\\]\n\\[\nW_C = \\frac{22,000}{40,500} \\approx 0.5432\n\\]\n\nThen, the rate of return for each stock:\n\n\\[\nr_A = 0\\%\n\\]\n\\[\nr_B = 0\\%\n\\]\n\\[\nr_C = 0\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the weighted average return is:\n\n\\[\nr_p = W_A \\times r_A + W_B \\times r_B + W_C \\times r_C = 0\\% + 0\\% + 0\\% = 0\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, this suggests that the portfolio return is 0%.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different approach, considering price indices or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about calculating the rate of return for a market index representing these three stocks, and perhaps using a different formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about calculating the rate of return considering the change in shares outstanding due to the split.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the quantity adjusted prices.\n\nIn index calculation, when there is a split, the price is adjusted to maintain continuity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about calculating the rate of return using the geometric mean or some other method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about calculating the rate of return for a market capitalization-weighted index.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about calculating the rate of return for a price-weighted index, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nIn a price-weighted index, the index value is the sum of the stock prices divided by a divisor.\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nFirst, calculate the price-weighted index at \\( t = 1 \\) and \\( t = 2 \\).\n\n### Price-Weighted Index at \\( t = 1 \\)\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\frac{P_{A1} + P_{B1} + P_{C1}}{D}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( D \\) is the divisor.\n\nInitially, \\( D = 3 \\), but with stock splits, the divisor may change.\n\nHowever, since there are no splits at \\( t = 1 \\), \\( D = 3 \\).\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\frac{95 + 45 + 110}{3} = \\frac{250}{3} \\approx 83.333\n\\]\n\n### Price-Weighted Index at \\( t = 2 \\)\n\nAt \\( t = 2 \\), Stock C has split 2-for-1, so the divisor needs to be adjusted.\n\nIn a price-weighted index, a stock split requires the divisor to be adjusted to maintain continuity.\n\nThe formula to adjust the divisor is:\n\n\\[\nD_{new} = D_{old} \\times \\frac{P_{C1}}{P_{C2} \\times \\text{split factor}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that Stock C splits 2-for-1, the split factor is 2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nD_{new} = 3 \\times \\frac{110}{55 \\times 2} = 3 \\times \\frac{110}{110} = 3 \\times 1 = 3\n\\]\n\nWait, the divisor remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the index at \\( t = 2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nI_2 = \\frac{P_{A2} + P_{B2} + P_{C2}}{D} = \\frac{95 + 45 + 55}{3} = \\frac{195}{3} = 65\n\\]\n\nThen, the rate of return for the index from \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_1} = \\frac{65 - 83.333}{83.333} \\approx \\frac{-18.333}{83.333} \\approx -0.22 = -22\\%\n\\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the provided options, and it's negative, whereas all options are non-negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about calculating the rate of return for a market capitalization-weighted index.\n\nIn a market cap-weighted index, the index value is the total market capitalization divided by a divisor.\n\nLet's try that.\n\n### Market Cap-Weighted Index at \\( t = 1 \\)\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\frac{V_1}{D} = \\frac{40,500}{D}\n\\]\n\nInitially, \\( D = 1 \\), but we need to see if it changes with the split.\n\nWait, in reality, in a market cap-weighted index, the divisor is adjusted for splits to maintain continuity.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, if we assume the divisor remains 1, then:\n\n\\[\nI_1 = 40,500\n\\]\n\n### Market Cap-Weighted Index at \\( t = 2 \\)\n\n\\[\nI_2 = \\frac{V_2}{D} = \\frac{40,500}{D} = 40,500\n\\]\n\nSince \\( V_2 = V_1 \\), \\( I_2 = I_1 \\), so the rate of return is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{I_2 - I_1}{I_1} = \\frac{40,500 - 40,500}{40,500} = 0\\%\n\\]\n\nAgain, this aligns with the earlier calculation.\n\nGiven this, the rate of return should be 0%, which is option A.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different interpretation or a mistake in the assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about calculating the rate of return for a value-weighted portfolio, which is similar to the market cap-weighted index.\n\nIn that case, again, the return would be 0%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about calculating the rate of return for an equally weighted portfolio.\n\nIn an equally weighted portfolio, each stock has the same weight, regardless of its market capitalization.\n\nSo, at \\( t = 1 \\), the portfolio value is:\n\n\\[\nV_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9,500 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9,000 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 22,000 = \\frac{9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000}{3} = \\frac{40,500}{3} = 13,500\n\\]\n\nAt \\( t = 2 \\), the portfolio value is:\n\n\\[\nV_2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9,500 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 9,000 + \\frac{1}{3} \\times 22,000 = \\frac{9,500 + 9,000 + 22,000}{3} = \\frac{40,500}{3} = 13,500\n\\]\n\nAgain, the portfolio value remains the same, so the rate of return is 0%.\n\nIt seems consistently that the rate of return is 0%.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the split adjustment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the return to be calculated differently, considering the change in shares outstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that after the split, the number of shares doubles, and the price halves, but perhaps the return should be calculated based on the ex-split price.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the split occurs between \\( t = 1 \\) and \\( t = 2 \\), and the price is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the split-adjusted price for \\( P_1 \\) of Stock C.\n\nIf Stock C splits 2-for-1 at \\( t = 2 \\), then the split-adjusted price for \\( P_1 \\) would be \\( P_{1, \\text{adj}} = \\frac{P_1}{2} = \\frac{110}{2} = 55 \\).\n\nThen, the return for Stock C would be:\n\n\\[\nr_C = \\frac{P_2 - P_{1, \\text{adj}}}{"
