The risk-free interest rate is given as 7%.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the expected return in a multi-factor APT model:\n\n\\[\nE(R_i) = R_f + \\beta_{i1} \\times RP_1 + \\beta_{i2} \\times RP_2 + \\beta_{i3} \\times RP_3 + \\dots + \\beta_{in} \\times RP_n\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( E(R_i) \\) is the expected return on the stock.\n\n- \\( R_f \\) is the risk-free rate.\n\n- \\( \\beta_{i1}, \\beta_{i2}, \\beta_{i3}, \\dots, \\beta_{in} \\) are the sensitivities (betas) of the stock to each of the n factors.\n\n- \\( RP_1, RP_2, RP_3, \\dots, RP_n \\) are the risk premiums associated with each of the n factors.\n\nGiven the problem, we have:\n\n- \\( R_f = 7\\% \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta_{i1} = 1 \\) for the first factor: Change in gross national product (GNP), with \\( RP_1 = +5\\% \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta_{i2} = 1 \\) for the second factor: Change in energy prices, with \\( RP_2 = -1\\% \\)\n\n- \\( \\beta_{i3} = 1 \\) for the third factor: Change in long-term interest rates, with \\( RP_3 = +2\\% \\)\n\nPlugging these values into the APT formula:\n\n\\[\nE(R_i) = 7\\% + (1 \\times 5\\%) + (1 \\times (-1\\%)) + (1 \\times 2\\%)\n\\]\n\nNow, perform the calculations step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the contribution of the first factor:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times 5\\% = 5\\%\n\\]\n\n2. Calculate the contribution of the second factor:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times (-1\\%) = -1\\%\n\\]\n\n3. Calculate the contribution of the third factor:\n\n\\[\n1 \\times 2\\% = 2\\%\n\\]\n\n4. Sum all the components:\n\n\\[\n7\\% + 5\\% + (-1\\%) + 2\\% = 7\\% + 5\\% - 1\\% + 2\\% = 13\\%\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the expected rate of return for the stock is 13%.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 5%\n\nB. 7%\n\nC. 13%\n\nD. 15.5%\n\nThe correct answer is C. 13%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{13\\%} \\]"
