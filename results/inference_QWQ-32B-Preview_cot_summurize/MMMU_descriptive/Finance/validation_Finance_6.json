The columns are labeled \"Investment,\" \"Single amount,\" and \"Investment life (years).\" Each row corresponds to a different investment option, labeled A, B, C, and D. The data in the table is as follows:\n\n- Investment A: Single amount = $8,400, Investment life = 6 years\n- Investment B: Single amount = $15,900, Investment life = 15 years\n- Investment C: Single amount = $7,600, Investment life = 4 years\n- Investment D: Single amount = $13,000, Investment life = 10 years\n\nThe question asks for the rate of return on investment B available to Clare, to the nearest 1%.

Because she is only 25 years old, she is not concerned about the length of the investment's life. What she is sensitive to is the rate of return she will earn on the investment. With the help of her financial advisor, Clare has isolated four equally risky investments, each providing a single amount at the end of its life, as shown in the following table. All the investments require an initial $5,000 payment. <image 1> Calculate, to the nearest 1%, the rate of return on investment B available to Clare.\n\nA. 11%\nB. 8%\nC. 10%\nD. 9%\n"

The IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of the investment's cash flows equal to zero.\n\nGiven the data for investment B:\n\n- Initial investment: -$5,000 (outflow)\n\n- Single amount at the end of 15 years: $15,900 (inflow)\n\n- Investment life: 15 years\n\nThe formula for NPV is:\n\n\\[ NPV = -\\text{initial investment} + \\frac{\\text{future value}}{(1 + r)^n} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the rate of return (IRR)\n\n- \\( n \\) is the number of years\n\nWe need to find \\( r \\) such that:\n\n\\[ -5,000 + \\frac{15,900}{(1 + r)^{15}} = 0 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{15,900}{(1 + r)^{15}} = 5,000 \\]\n\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = \\frac{15,900}{5,000} \\]\n\n\\[ (1 + r)^{15} = 3.18 \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 3.18^{\\frac{1}{15}} \\]\n\n\\[ 1 + r = 3.18^{0.06667} \\]\n\nUsing a calculator to find \\( 3.18^{0.06667} \\):\n\n\\[ 3.18^{0.06667} \\approx 1.08 \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ 1 + r \\approx 1.08 \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 0.08 \\]\n\n\\[ r \\approx 8\\% \\]\n\nThus, the rate of return on investment B available to Clare is approximately 8%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{8\\%} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nThe rate of return is calculated using the internal rate of return (IRR) formula, which equates the present value of future cash flows to the initial investment. By solving for the rate that makes the net present value zero, we find that the IRR for investment B is approximately 8%, making option B the correct choice."
