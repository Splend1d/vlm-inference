                    "text": "To calculate the net working capital (NWC) for Adam and Arin Adams as of December 31, 2015, we need to determine the difference between their total liquid assets and their total current liabilities. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the liquid assets and current liabilities from the provided list.\n\n**Liquid Assets:**\nLiquid assets are assets that can be easily converted into cash within a short period, usually within one year. These typically include:\n\n- Cash\n- Checking accounts\n- Savings accounts\n- Money market funds\n\nFrom the assets list:\n\n- Cash: $300\n- Checking: $3,000\n- Savings: $1,200\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n\nTotal liquid assets = $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 = $5,700\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\nCurrent liabilities are obligations that are due within one year. These typically include:\n\n- Utility bills payable\n- Credit card balance\n- Personal loan (assuming it's due within one year)\n\nFrom the liabilities list:\n\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nTotal current liabilities = $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $5,150\n\nNow, net working capital (NWC) is calculated as:\n\nNWC = Total liquid assets - Total current liabilities\n\nNWC = $5,700 - $5,150 = $550\n\nWait a minute, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Let's double-check the definitions and make sure we're including the correct items.\n\n**Re-evaluating Liquid Assets:**\n- Cash: $300\n- Checking: $3,000\n- Savings: $1,200\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n\nThese seem correct.\n\n**Re-evaluating Current Liabilities:**\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nIs the personal loan due within one year? Sometimes, personal loans have longer terms. If only a portion is due within one year, we should only include that portion. However, since the problem doesn't specify, we'll assume the entire personal loan is due within one year.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps some other liabilities should be considered current.\n\nLooking back at the liabilities:\n\n- Auto loan: $8,000 (likely not due within one year)\n- Mortgage: $100,000 (long-term liability)\n- Medical bills payable: $250 ( likely due soon, so current)\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nMaybe medical bills payable should be included in current liabilities.\n\nSo, revised current liabilities:\n\n- Medical bills payable: $250\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nTotal current liabilities = $250 + $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $5,400\n\nNWC = $5,700 - $5,400 = $300\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nWait, perhaps the definition of liquid assets is broader, including short-term investments like IBM stock or retirement funds.\n\nLet's try including IBM stock and retirement funds in liquid assets.\n\nIBM stock: $2,000\nRetirement funds, IRA: $2,000\n\nTotal liquid assets = $5,700 + $2,000 + $2,000 = $9,700\n\nNWC = $9,700 - $5,400 = $4,300\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only short-term investments are considered liquid assets, excluding retirement funds due to potential early withdrawal penalties.\n\nSo, liquid assets: $5,700 + $2,000 (IBM stock) = $7,700\n\nNWC = $7,700 - $5,400 = $2,300\n\nStill not matching.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider all current assets minus current liabilities.\n\n**Current Assets:**\n- Cash: $300\n- Checking: $3,000\n- Savings: $1,200\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n- IBM stock: $2,000\n- Retirement funds, IRA: $2,000\n- Jewelry and artwork: $3,000\n- Household furnishings: $4,200\n\nTotal current assets = $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 + $2,000 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $4,200 = $17,100\n\n**Current Liabilities:**\n- Auto loan: $8,000 (if due within one year)\n- Medical bills payable: $250\n- Utility bills payable: $150\n- Credit card balance: $2,000\n- Personal loan: $3,000\n\nAssuming the auto loan is not due within one year, current liabilities would be $250 + $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $5,400\n\nNWC = $17,100 - $5,400 = $11,700\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps only certain assets are considered current assets. Typically, current assets include cash, checking, savings, money market funds, short-term investments like stocks, but not jewelry, artwork, or household furnishings, as these may not be easily convertible to cash.\n\nSo, revised current assets:\n\n- Cash: $300\n- Checking: $3,000\n- Savings: $1,200\n- Money market funds: $1,200\n- IBM stock: $2,000\n- Retirement funds, IRA: $2,000\n\nTotal current assets = $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 + $2,000 + $2,000 = $9,700\n\nCurrent liabilities: $5,400\n\nNWC = $9,700 - $5,400 = $4,300\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps retirement funds are not considered liquid assets.\n\nThen, current assets: $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 + $2,000 = $7,700\n\nNWC = $7,700 - $5,400 = $2,300\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the auto loan is considered a current liability.\n\nIncluding auto loan: $8,000 + $250 + $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 = $13,400\n\nNWC = $9,700 - $13,400 = -$3,700\n\nNegative NWC, which doesn't make sense given the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the portion of the auto loan due within one year is considered a current liability. If that's the case, we might need to estimate that portion.\n\nSimilarly, for the mortgage, if a portion is due within one year, it should be included in current liabilities.\n\nHowever, without specific information on the loan terms, it's challenging to determine the exact amounts.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the net worth provided can help us cross-verify.\n\nNet worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities.\n\nFrom the provided net worth: $76,500\n\nTotal assets: $300 (cash) + $3,000 (checking) + $1,200 (savings) + $2,000 (IBM stock) + $2,000 (IRA) + $1,200 (money market) + $3,000 (jewelry and artwork) + $4,200 (household furnishings) + $150,000 (real estate) + $15,000 (Sebring) + $8,000 (Jeep) = $188,200\n\nTotal liabilities: $8,000 (auto loan) + $100,000 (mortgage) + $250 (medical bills) + $150 (utility bills) + $2,000 (credit card) + $3,000 (personal loan) = $113,500\n\nNet worth: $188,200 - $113,500 = $74,700\n\nBut the provided net worth is $76,500, which doesn't match. There might be a mistake in the asset or liability amounts, or possibly in the net worth figure.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, it's difficult to proceed with confidence. However, based on standard definitions:\n\n- Current assets: Cash, checking, savings, money market funds, short-term investments (IBM stock)\n\n- Current liabilities: Utility bills, credit card balance, personal loan, and any portion of the auto loan due within one year.\n\nWithout specific information on the auto loan terms, it's reasonable to consider the entire auto loan as a long-term liability if it's a multi-year loan.\n\nTherefore, current liabilities would be: utility bills, credit card, personal loan, and medical bills.\n\nTotal current liabilities: $150 + $2,000 + $3,000 + $250 = $5,400\n\nCurrent assets: $300 + $3,000 + $1,200 + $1,200 + $2,000 = $7,700\n\nNWC = $7,700 - $5,400 = $2,300\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the provided options (A. $2,100 B. $3,100 C. $4,100 D. $5,100)\n\nPerhaps there's a misinterpretation of what constitutes current assets or current liabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the NWC is calculated differently in this context.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll make an educated guess based on the closest figure.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
