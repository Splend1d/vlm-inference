This matrix is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different growth strategy:\n\n1. **Market Penetration**: This quadrant is labeled \"EXISTING\" for both products/services and markets. It represents strategies aimed at increasing sales in existing markets with existing products.\n2. **Product Development**: This quadrant is labeled \"NEW\" for products/services and \"EXISTING\" for markets. It represents strategies focused on developing new products for existing markets.\n3. **Market Development**: This quadrant is labeled \"EXISTING\" for products/services and \"NEW\" for markets. It represents strategies aimed at finding new markets for existing products.\n4. **Diversification**: This quadrant is labeled \"NEW\" for both products/services and markets. It represents strategies focused on developing new products for new markets.\n\nAnsoff's Matrix is used to help companies identify and develop their core competencies by aligning their products and services with market opportunities. The strategies mentioned in the question (A, B, C, D) are related to this framework, but one of them is not directly associated with Ansoff's original components.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe <image 1> shows the Product/Market Growth Matrix pattern diagram. Among them, Ansoff proposed that companies should identify and develop a core competency. To achieve this goal, Ansoff identified four components of his strategy. Which of the following options is not a strategy he developed?\n\nA. Have a clear concept of product and market alignment\nB. Develop competitive advantage\nC. Create synergy\nD. Focus on product innovation\n"

It underpins the success of market penetration, product development, market development, and diversification.\n\nC. **Create synergy**\n\nSynergy typically refers to the combined effect of different elements being greater than the sum of their individual parts. While synergy can be a beneficial outcome of certain strategies, such as diversification, it is not specifically identified as one of Ansoff's four primary strategies.\n\nD. **Focus on product innovation**\n\nProduct innovation is central to the \"Product Development\" quadrant of Ansoff's Matrix, where new products are developed for existing markets.\n\nGiven this analysis, option C, \"Create synergy,\" is not directly one of the four strategies identified in Ansoff's Matrix. While synergy can be a result of certain strategies, it is not specifically named as one of the core components of Ansoff's growth strategies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C."
