The table has four columns and five rows, including the header row. Here is a detailed description of the table:\n\n### Table Description\n\n#### Header Row:\n- **Activity**: Lists the activities (A, B, C, D).\n- **Immediate Predecessor**: Indicates which activity must be completed before the current activity can start.\n- **Time (Weeks)**: This column is further divided into three sub-columns:\n  - **a**: Optimistic time estimate.\n  - **m**: Most likely time estimate.\n  - **b**: Pessimistic time estimate.\n\n#### Data Rows:\n1. **Row for Activity A**:\n   - Immediate Predecessor: None (indicated by \"\u2014\").\n   - Time (Weeks):\n     - a: 9\n     - m: 10\n     - b: 11\n\n2. **Row for Activity B**:\n   - Immediate Predecessor: None (indicated by \"\u2014\").\n   - Time (Weeks):\n     - a: 4\n     - m: 10\n     - b: 16\n\n3. **Row for Activity C**:\n   - Immediate Predecessor: Activity A.\n   - Time (Weeks):\n     - a: 9\n     - m: 10\n     - b: 11\n\n4. **Row for Activity D**:\n   - Immediate Predecessor: Activity B.\n   - Time (Weeks):\n     - a: 5\n     - m: 8\n     - b: 11\n\n### Answering the Question\n\nTo find the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less, we need to calculate the expected time and variance for each activity and then use these to determine the probability.\n\n1. **Expected Time (E)** for an activity is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   E = \\frac{a + 4m + b}{6}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Variance (Var)** for an activity is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Var = \\left(\\frac{b - a}{6}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\nFor Activity B:\n- a = 4\n- m = 10\n- b = 16\n\n\\[\nE_B = \\frac{4 + 4 \\times 10 + 16}{6} = \\frac{4 + 40 + 16}{6} = \\frac{60}{6} = 10\n\\]\n\\[\nVar_B = \\left(\\frac{16 - 4}{6}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{12}{6}\\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4\n\\]\n\nFor Activity D:\n- a = 5\n- m = 8\n- b = 11\n\n\\[\nE_D = \\frac{5 + 4 \\times 8 + 11}{6} = \\frac{5 + 32 + 11}{6} = \\frac{48}{6} = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nVar_D = \\left(\\frac{11 - 5}{6}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{6}{6}\\right)^2 = 1^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nThe total expected time for path B-D is:\n\\[\nE_{B-D} = E_B + E_D = 10 + 8 = 18\n\\]\n\nThe total variance for path B-D is:\n\\[\nVar_{B-D} = Var_B + Var_D = 4 + 1 = 5\n\\]\n\nThe standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) for path B-D is:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{Var_{B-D}} = \\sqrt{5}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that the path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less. We use the Z-score formula:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{X - E_{B-D}}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nwhere \\(X = 22\\) weeks.\n\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{22 - 18}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}}\n\\]\n\nUsing a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we find the probability corresponding to this Z-score. Let's assume the Z-score value is approximately 1.79 (since \\(\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24\\)).\n\nThe probability that the path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less is approximately 0.9633 (or 96.33%).\n\nTherefore, the probability that path B-D will be finished in 22 weeks or less is approximately 96.33%.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe estimated times and immediate predecessors for the activities in a project at George Kyparis's retinal scanning company are given in the following table. Assume that the activity times are independent. <image 1> If the time to complete path B-D is normally distributed, what is the probability that this path will be finished in 22 weeks or less?\n\n"
