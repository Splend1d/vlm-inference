The image shows someone sitting at a desk with a computer monitor displaying a web page that says \"SURFACE.\" There are five vertical panels to the left of the monitor, each labeled with a term related to website user experience. The panels are labeled from left to right: STRATEGY, SCOPE, STRUCTURE, SKELETON, and SURFACE. These represent the five interdependent planes in Jesse James Garrett's model for defining website usability.\n\nThe question is: Which of the following options is not part of the model definition?\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. cooperate\n\nB. scope\n\nC. Structure\n\nD. Strategy\n\nFirst, I need to recall the five planes mentioned in the description: STRATEGY, SCOPE, STRUCTURE, SKELETON, and SURFACE.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nB. scope - This matches one of the plane labels.\n\nC. Structure - This also matches one of the plane labels.\n\nD. Strategy - This matches the first plane label.\n\nA. cooperate - This doesn't match any of the plane labels I recall. The closest term might be \"cooperate,\" but in the context of website user experience, it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a typo in option A. It's possible it should be \"coordinate\" instead of \"cooperate.\" In some models, coordination might be a aspect, but in Jesse James Garrett's model, it's not one of the five planes.\n\nHowever, based on the description provided, the five planes are STRATEGY, SCOPE, STRUCTURE, SKELETON, and SURFACE.\n\nSo, option A, \"cooperate,\" isn't one of these planes.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's double-check:\n\n- STRATEGY: Yes, it's the first plane.\n\n- SCOPE: Yes, it's the second plane.\n\n- STRUCTURE: Yes, it's the third plane.\n\n- SKELETON: Yes, it's the fourth plane.\n\n- SURFACE: Yes, it's the fifth plane.\n\nNone of the planes mention \"cooperate\" or \"coordinate.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option A: cooperate.\n\nIt's possible that the question might have a typo, and option A should be \"coordinate\" instead of \"cooperate.\" However, based on the information given, \"cooperate\" isn't part of the model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"cooperate\" is a misinterpretation of one of the actual planes.\n\nBut according to the description, the planes are clearly labeled as STRATEGY, SCOPE, STRUCTURE, SKELETON, and SURFACE.\n\nSo, unless there's additional context not provided in the description, option A, \"cooperate,\" is not part of the model definition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. cooperate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
