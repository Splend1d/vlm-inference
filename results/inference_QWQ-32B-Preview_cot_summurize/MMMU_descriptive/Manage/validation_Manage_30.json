The y-axis represents the cases per 100 full-time workers, ranging from 3.0 to 5.5. The x-axis represents the years from 2003 to 2011.\n\nThere are two lines on the graph:\n1. A solid line, which is the regression line for the data.\n2. A dotted line, which connects the points for 2003 and 2011, representing the average rate of change in reported injuries and illness over the eight-year period.\n\nThe graph also includes data points (black dots) for each year from 2003 to 2011, showing the actual number of reported injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time workers for each year.\n\nFrom the graph, it is clear that the regression line (solid line) does not perfectly align with all the data points. The point that deviates the most from the regression line is the one for the year 2009.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nGraph 3 shows the number of injuries and illnesses a corporation reported per 100 full-time workers from 2003 to 2011. The solid line is the regression line for the data. The dotted line connects the points for 2003 and 2011; it represents the average rate of change in reported injuries and illness over the eight-year period. <image 1> The least-squares regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in ____________.\n\nA. 2003\nB. 2005\nC. 2007\nD. 2009\nE. 2010\n"

It includes a regression line and a dotted line connecting the points for 2003 and 2011, representing the average rate of change over the eight-year period. Data points for each year are also plotted.\n\nThe description explicitly states that \"the point that deviates the most from the regression line is the one for the year 2009.\" This indicates that the regression line is least successful at predicting the number of injury and illness reports in 2009, as this data point has the greatest discrepancy from the predicted value based on the regression line.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2009\n"
