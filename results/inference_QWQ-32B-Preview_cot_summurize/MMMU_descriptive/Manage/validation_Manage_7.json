                    "text": "I'm looking at this graph about sustaining versus disruptive innovation. So, there's a y-axis that shows product performance and an x-axis that shows time. There are two main lines: one for sustaining technologies and another for disruptive technologies. The sustaining technologies line starts higher and increases gradually, while the disruptive technologies line starts lower but increases more steeply over time.\n\nThere are also two horizontal dotted lines representing the performance demanded at the high end and the low end of the market. The sustaining technologies line intersects with the high-end performance line, and the disruptive technologies line intersects with the low-end performance line.\n\nFrom this, it seems like sustaining technologies are geared towards meeting the needs of high-end customers who demand higher performance, and they improve gradually over time. On the other hand, disruptive technologies start by addressing the needs of low-end customers with lower performance requirements but improve rapidly and might eventually surpass the performance needed by high-end customers.\n\nNow, the question is about a typical innovation model where innovation adds more functions. It's asking which of the options is NOT a result of that.\n\nOption A: Achieve performance levels required by the market.\n\nWell, adding more functions should help achieve or even exceed the performance levels that the market requires. So, this seems like a likely result.\n\nOption B: This product has ongoing sales value.\n\nIf the product continues to innovate and add functions, it should maintain its appeal to customers and thus have ongoing sales value. So, this also seems like a probable outcome.\n\nOption C: Customers are overserved.\n\nThis term \"overserved\" isn't one I've heard before, but I'm assuming it means that the product offers more features or performance than customers actually need or are willing to pay for. So, if innovation adds more functions beyond what customers require, this could be a result.\n\nOption D: Customers receive additional value.\n\nAdding more functions should provide customers with additional value, assuming those functions are useful and desired by the customers.\n\nThe question is asking which of these is NOT a result of adding more functions through innovation.\n\nGiven that, option C seems like it might be the answer because overserving customers\u2014giving them more than they need\u2014might not be a desirable outcome. In fact, it could lead to wasted resources and higher costs without providing commensurate benefits to customers.\n\nBut let's think about it again. If a company adds more functions and customers don't need them, they might not use those features or value them, which could mean the company is spending resources to develop features that don't provide additional value to customers. In some cases, this could lead to customers perceiving less value if the product becomes too complex or expensive.\n\nOn the other hand, options A, B, and D all seem like positive outcomes of innovation: meeting market requirements, maintaining sales value, and providing additional value to customers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely option C: Customers are overserved.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if any of the other options could also be possible negative outcomes.\n\nFor example, if a company adds too many functions, it might achieve performance levels beyond what the market requires (which is similar to overserving), but that's already covered in option C.\n\nOption B says the product has ongoing sales value. Adding more functions should generally help maintain or increase sales value, so that seems like a positive outcome.\n\nOption D says customers receive additional value. Again, adding useful functions should provide additional value to customers.\n\nTherefore, the only option that isn't a desirable result is C: Customers are overserved.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
