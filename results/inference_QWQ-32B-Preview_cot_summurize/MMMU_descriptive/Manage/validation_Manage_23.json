The first column is labeled \"YEAR,\" and the second column is labeled \"NO. UNITS SOLD.\" The table lists the number of units sold for different years:\n\n- In 1950, 1000 units were sold.\n- In 1955, 1100 units were sold.\n- In 1960, 1210 units were sold.\n- In 1965, 1331 units were sold.\n\nBased on this data, the number of units sold increases each year. To estimate the sales in units for 1970, we need to identify the pattern or trend in the increase of units sold over the years.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIf the past trend will continue, find the estimated sales in units for 1970. <image 1>\n\n"

Let's look at the time intervals and the corresponding increases in units sold.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1955 (5 years):\n\n1100 - 1000 = 100 units increase\n\nFrom 1955 to 1960 (5 years):\n\n1210 - 1100 = 110 units increase\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965 (5 years):\n\n1331 - 1210 = 121 units increase\n\nHmm, the increase itself is increasing by a pattern. Let's see:\n\n110 - 100 = 10\n\n121 - 110 = 11\n\nSo, the increase in units sold every 5 years is going up by 10, then 11, suggesting possibly a compound growth rate.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the growth rate percentage:\n\nFrom 1950 to 1955:\n\n(1100 - 1000)/1000 = 0.1 or 10%\n\nFrom 1955 to 1960:\n\n(1210 - 1100)/1100 \u2248 0.0999 or about 10%\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965:\n\n(1331 - 1210)/1210 \u2248 0.100 or 10%\n\nWait, that's interesting. The percentage increase seems to be consistently around 10% each 5-year period.\n\nLet's verify that:\n\n1000 * 1.1 = 1100\n\n1100 * 1.1 = 1210\n\n1210 * 1.1 = 1331\n\nPerfect, it's a 10% increase every 5 years.\n\nSo, the pattern is a 10% increase every 5 years.\n\nNow, to find the estimated sales for 1970, which is another 5 years after 1965.\n\nSo, taking the 1965 sales of 1331 units and applying the same 10% increase:\n\n1331 * 1.1 = 1464.1 units\n\nSince we're dealing with units sold, which are typically whole numbers, we might round this to 1464 units.\n\nBut let's double-check if this pattern holds.\n\nLooking back:\n\n1950: 1000\n\n1955: 1000 * 1.1 = 1100\n\n1960: 1100 * 1.1 = 1210\n\n1965: 1210 * 1.1 = 1331\n\n1970: 1331 * 1.1 = 1464.1 \u2248 1464\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as exponential growth, where the number of units sold grows at a rate of 10% every 5 years.\n\nThe formula for exponential growth is:\n\n\\[ \\text{final amount} = \\text{initial amount} \\times (1 + r)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( r \\) is the growth rate\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time in periods\n\nIn this case, the growth rate \\( r = 0.10 \\) every 5 years, and from 1950 to 1970 is 20 years, which is 4 periods of 5 years each.\n\nSo, starting from 1950:\n\n\\[ \\text{units in 1970} = 1000 \\times (1.1)^4 \\]\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, \\( (1.1)^4 \\):\n\n\\( (1.1)^2 = 1.21 \\)\n\n\\( (1.21)^2 = 1.4641 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 1000 \\times 1.4641 = 1464.1 \\) units, which again rounds to 1464 units.\n\nAlternatively, starting from 1965:\n\n\\[ \\text{units in 1970} = 1331 \\times 1.1 = 1464.1 \\] units.\n\nThis matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the estimated sales in units for 1970, assuming the past trend continues, would be approximately 1464 units.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1464} \\]\n\n"
