However, the question specifically asks for the variance of price, which typically refers to the difference between the actual price paid for materials and the standard price per unit of material. \n\nGiven:\n- Standard price per pound of material: $0.21\n- Actual price per pound of material: $0.22\n\nThe variance of price can be calculated as follows:\n\nVariance of price = (Actual price - Standard price) * Actual quantity used\nVariance of price = ($0.22 - $0.21) * 296,000 pounds\nVariance of price = $0.01 * 296,000 pounds\nVariance of price = $2,960\n\nTherefore, the variance of price is $2,960.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe Ships Ahoy Manufacturing Company, a producer of supplies for both commercial and leisure time fishermen, wants to check on the efficiency of the production of its deluxe net for tuna fishing. It has established standard costs for making one of these fishing nets as shown below: <image 1> The fixed overhead rate is based on normal monthly activity of 120,000 direct labor hours. Last month 19,500 nets were produced. There had been no initial inventories. The total costs of production were: <image 2> Find the variance of price.\n\n"

They've provided some standard costs and actual costs, and I need to find the variance of price. From what I understand, the variance of price typically refers to the difference between the actual price paid for materials and the standard price that was expected for those materials.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the standard costs for producing one deluxe fishing net.

The actual quantity of materials used was 296,000 pounds.\n\nSo, the formula for the price variance is:\n\nPrice Variance = (Actual Price - Standard Price) * Actual Quantity\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nPrice Variance = ($0.22 - $0.21) * 296,000 pounds = $0.01 * 296,000 = $2,960.\n\nTherefore, the variance of price is $2,960.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that this is indeed the variance of price and not another type of variance, like quantity variance or labor variance. The question specifically mentions \"variance of price,\" and in the context of materials, that usually refers to the price paid per unit compared to the standard price.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that there might be other variances to consider, like material quantity variance, labor rate variance, labor efficiency variance, variable overhead spending variance, and so on. But since the question only asks for the variance of price, and given the standard and actual prices provided, I believe the $2,960 is the correct answer.\n\nOne thing to consider is whether the variance is favorable or unfavorable. Since the actual price is higher than the standard price, this would be an unfavorable variance. But the question just asks for the variance of price, so the sign might not be required, but it's good to know for context.\n\nAlso, I should check if the actual quantity of materials used makes sense. If 19,500 nets were produced and each net requires 15 pounds of materials, then the total standard quantity of materials should be 19,500 nets * 15 pounds/net = 292,500 pounds. But the actual quantity used was 296,000 pounds, which is more than the standard quantity. That would lead to a material quantity variance, but again, the question is only about the price variance.\n\nSo, to summarize, the variance of price for materials is $2,960 unfavorable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2960} \\]"
