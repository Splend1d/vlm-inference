The model is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different role of HR professionals:\n\n1. **Strategic Partner**: This quadrant is located in the top left corner and focuses on processes. It depicts a group of people sitting around a table, discussing and analyzing documents, indicating their involvement in strategic planning and process management.\n\n2. **Change Agent**: This quadrant is located in the top right corner and focuses on people. It shows a person standing on a chair, pointing at a whiteboard with a graph, suggesting they are leading or facilitating change within the organization.\n\n3. **Employee Champion**: This quadrant is located in the bottom right corner and focuses on day-to-day operational focus. It depicts a group of people holding signs that say \"Strike\" and \"Fair Pay,\" indicating their role in advocating for employee rights and addressing immediate concerns.\n\n4. **Administration Expert**: This quadrant is located in the bottom left corner and focuses on day-to-day operational focus. It shows a person sitting at a desk, surrounded by paperwork and a computer, suggesting their role in managing administrative tasks and ensuring operational efficiency.\n\nThe model highlights the need for HR professionals to balance strategic and operational focus, as well as processes and people-oriented roles.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> is the HRM Roles, David Ulrich (1997) model. According to Ulrich, if HR is to become and remain relevant in the current business environment, what is not something HR professionals must learn?\n\nA. Manage human resources operations and infrastructure\nB. Become the link between human resources and organizational strategy\nC. Optimize the value of employees\nD. Be a change agent with a long-term vision for the organization\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided for the HRM Roles model by David Ulrich (1997), HR professionals are expected to fulfill four key roles: Strategic Partner, Change Agent, Employee Champion, and Administration Expert. Each role focuses on different aspects of HR management, balancing between strategic and operational concerns, as well as processes and people-oriented approaches.\n\nOption A, \"Manage human resources operations and infrastructure,\" aligns with the Administration Expert role, which focuses on day-to-day operational tasks, ensuring that administrative functions are handled efficiently. This is a crucial aspect of HR's responsibilities and is definitely something HR professionals must learn.\n\nOption B, \"Become the link between human resources and organizational strategy,\" corresponds to the Strategic Partner role. This role emphasizes the importance of HR in strategic planning and process management, making it essential for HR professionals to understand and contribute to the organization's overall strategy.\n\nOption C, \"Optimize the value of employees,\" seems to relate to the Employee Champion role, which advocates for employee rights and addresses their immediate concerns. However, optimizing employee value could also involve strategic initiatives to enhance employee performance and contribution to the organization's goals. This appears to be an integral part of HR's function.\n\nOption D, \"Be a change agent with a long-term vision for the organization,\" directly corresponds to the Change Agent role, which focuses on leading and facilitating organizational change. This role requires HR professionals to have a forward-looking perspective and play a key part in driving transformations within the organization.\n\nGiven that all these options seem to be integral parts of the HRM Roles model as described, the question asks for something that HR professionals must not learn. However, based on the model, all the options listed are aspects that HR professionals should learn and master to be effective in their roles.\n\nTherefore, none of the options provided is something that HR professionals should not learn according to Ulrich's model. It's possible that the question is designed to identify which option is less critical or not directly related to HR's responsibilities, but based on the description, all options are relevant.\n\nIf I had to choose one that might be less directly related or potentially misaligned, it could be option C, \"Optimize the value of employees.\" This phrase is somewhat vague and could be interpreted in various ways. In the context of Ulrich's model, optimizing employee value might not be explicitly stated as a role, whereas the other options clearly map to the defined quadrants.\n\nHowever, in practice, optimizing employee value is likely encompassed within the Employee Champion and Strategic Partner roles, as it involves both advocating for employees and aligning their development with organizational strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that HR professionals must learn all these aspects, and none should be overlooked. In that case, the answer would be that there is nothing among the options that HR professionals must not learn.\n\nGiven the options provided and the model described, the most appropriate answer would be that all of these are essential for HR professionals to learn, and thus, none of them is something they must not learn.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the above}} \\]"
