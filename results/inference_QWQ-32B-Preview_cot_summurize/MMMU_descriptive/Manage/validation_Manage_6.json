The hare is shown in mid-air, leaping energetically with its eyes wide open and mouth agape, appearing to be in a state of excitement or urgency. In contrast, the tortoise is depicted slowly walking on the ground, looking calm and composed. To the left of the image, there is a carrot hanging from a string, which seems to be the hare's target. The hare's behavior suggests impatience and a desire for immediate gratification, while the tortoise's demeanor indicates a more measured and steady approach. This visual representation highlights the contrast between the hare's quick, reactive nature and the tortoise's deliberate, thoughtful manner.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe <image 1> shows the difference between the brains of rabbits and tortoises. What is the difference between the brains of tortoises and rabbits?\n\nA. calculating,\nB. analytical,\nC. category dependent\nD. synthetic\n"
