For an amount of purchase between $100 and $799, the commission is 2.0% plus $4.40 up to $65.\n2. For an amount of purchase between $800 and $2,499, the commission is 1.3% plus $10 up to $65.\n3. For an amount of purchase of $2,500 and above, the commission is 0.9% plus $20 up to $65.\n\nThis table provides the brokerage rates for different ranges of purchase amounts.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n Mr. Samuels purchased 50 shares of stock when the round lot price was 146(1/8). The odd-lot differential on the sale is 1/4 of a point. Using the table of Brokerage Rates below, calculate the Commission on the sale. <image 1>\n\n"
