The BSC framework is divided into four main perspectives:\n\n1. **Financial Perspective**: This perspective focuses on how the organization appears to its shareholders. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to financial performance.\n\n2. **Customer Perspective**: This perspective focuses on how the organization appears to its customers. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to customer satisfaction and market presence.\n\n3. **Internal Business Processes Perspective**: This perspective focuses on the processes that the organization must excel at to satisfy its shareholders and customers. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to operational efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n4. **Learning and Growth Perspective**: This perspective focuses on the organization's ability to change and improve. It includes objectives, measures, targets, and initiatives related to employee skills, systems, and culture.\n\nEach perspective is connected by arrows, indicating the flow and interdependence of these areas in achieving the overall vision and strategy of the organization.\n\nBased on this description, the KPIs applicable to the four perspectives of BSC are:\n- Human resource management (related to Learning and Growth)\n- Technology (related to Internal Business Processes)\n- Marketing (related to Customer)\n\nOperations, however, are not explicitly mentioned as a separate category in the BSC framework described in the image. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nD. operations\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe <image 1> shows the Facade model. The following KPIs are applicable to the four perspectives of BSC. Which one is not included?\n\nA. human resource Management\nB. technology\nC. marketing\nD. operations\n"
