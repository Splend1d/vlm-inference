The left side of the brain is labeled \"CREATIVITY\" and \"DIVERGENT,\" while the right side is labeled \"CONVERGENT\" and \"Science Stereotype.\" The left side shows a branching pattern, symbolizing the divergent thinking process, where multiple ideas are generated. The right side shows a converging pattern, symbolizing the convergent thinking process, where ideas are narrowed down to a single solution or product. The image illustrates the sequential nature of the divergence-convergence process, where divergence (generating multiple ideas) precedes convergence (narrowing down to a specific outcome).\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> is The process of divergence and convergence, the divergence-convergence process is sequential, divergence precedes convergence, as shown in the figure. You first unfold like a fruiting tree, and then some of the broad changes you produce converge on new, innovative products. Note that many divergent ideas end up going nowhere, so what do critics complain about?\n\nA. No need to diverge\nB. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent\nC.

No need to diverge\n\nB. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent\n\nC. Convergence proceeds too slowly\n\nD. The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance.\n\nGiven that the description mentions that many divergent ideas end up going nowhere, it suggests that critics might have issues with the efficiency or value of the divergence phase, where multiple ideas are generated but not all lead to productive outcomes.\n\nOption A, \"No need to diverge,\" suggests that critics might argue against the necessity of generating multiple ideas in the first place.\n\nOption B, \"Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent,\" implies that critics see the divergent phase, which often involves differing opinions and ideas, as a waste of time and resources.\n\nOption C, \"Convergence proceeds too slowly,\" suggests that critics might be impatient with the speed at which the convergent phase narrows down ideas to a specific solution.\n\nOption D, \"The process of divergence-convergence is of little significance,\" implies that critics may doubt the overall importance or effectiveness of this dual-process approach.\n\nConsidering the context that many divergent ideas don't lead anywhere, critics are likely to complain about the perceived wastefulness of generating numerous ideas that don't result in tangible outcomes. This aligns most closely with option B, \"Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent,\" as it directly addresses the potential inefficiency of the divergent phase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Disagreement is wasteful and self-indulgent.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
