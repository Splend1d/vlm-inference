The data is presented in two rows, with each column representing a different year and the corresponding number of room registrations in thousands. Here are the details:\n\n- Year 1: 17 thousand registrations\n- Year 2: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 3: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 4: 21 thousand registrations\n- Year 5: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 6: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 7: 23 thousand registrations\n- Year 8: 25 thousand registrations\n- Year 9: 24 thousand registrations\n\nThis data will be used to develop a regression equation to forecast future room registrations.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRoom registrations in the Toronto Towers Plaza Hotel have been recorded for the past 9 years. To project future occupancy, management would like to determine the mathematical trend of guest registration. This estimate will help the hotel determine whether future expansion will be needed. Given the following time-series data, develop a regression equation relating registrations to time (e.g., a trend equation). Then forecast year 11 registrations. Room registrations are in the thousands: <image 1>\n\nA. 27010\nB. 27020\nC. 27030\nD. 27040\n"

This equation will help us forecast the number of room registrations for year 11.\n\nFirst, let's list out the data provided:\n\n- Year 1: 17 thousand registrations\n- Year 2: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 3: 16 thousand registrations\n- Year 4: 21 thousand registrations\n- Year 5: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 6: 20 thousand registrations\n- Year 7: 23 thousand registrations\n- Year 8: 25 thousand registrations\n- Year 9: 24 thousand registrations\n\nSince we are dealing with time-series data and want to model the trend over time, a linear regression model seems appropriate. In linear regression, we assume a linear relationship between the independent variable (time, in this case, years) and the dependent variable (room registrations).\n\nThe general form of a linear regression equation is:\n\n\\[ y = a + b x \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( y \\) is the dependent variable (room registrations in thousands)\n- \\( x \\) is the independent variable (year)\n- \\( a \\) is the y-intercept\n- \\( b \\) is the slope of the line\n\nTo find the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), we can use the least squares method. The formulas for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{n \\sum(xy) - \\sum x \\sum y}{n \\sum x^2 - (\\sum x)^2} \\]\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{\\sum y - b \\sum x}{n} \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of observations (years).\n\nLet's organize the data into tables to calculate the necessary sums.\n\nFirst, create a table with years and registrations:\n\n| Year (x) | Registrations (y) | x*y   | x\u00b2    |\n|----------|-------------------|-------|-------|\n| 1        | 17                | 17    | 1     |\n| 2        | 16                | 32    | 4     |\n| 3        | 16                | 48    | 9     |\n| 4        | 21                | 84    | 16    |\n| 5        | 20                | 100   | 25    |\n| 6        | 20                | 120   | 36    |\n| 7        | 23                | 161   | 49    |\n| 8        | 25                | 200   | 64    |\n| 9        | 24                | 216   | 81    |\n\nNow, sum up each column:\n\n- \\( \\sum x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 \\)\n- \\( \\sum y = 17 + 16 + 16 + 21 + 20 + 20 + 23 + 25 + 24 = 182 \\)\n- \\( \\sum xy = 17 + 32 + 48 + 84 + 100 + 120 + 161 + 200 + 216 = 978 \\)\n- \\( \\sum x^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 = 285 \\)\n\nGiven that \\( n = 9 \\), we can now calculate \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{9 \\times 978 - 45 \\times 182}{9 \\times 285 - 45^2} = \\frac{8802 - 8190}{2565 - 2025} = \\frac{612}{540} = 1.1333 \\]\n\nNext, calculate \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{182 - 1.1333 \\times 45}{9} = \\frac{182 - 51}{9} = \\frac{131}{9} = 14.5556 \\]\n\nSo, the regression equation is:\n\n\\[ y = 14.5556 + 1.1333 x \\]\n\nNow, to forecast the registrations for year 11:\n\n\\[ y_{11} = 14.5556 + 1.1333 \\times 11 = 14.5556 + 12.4663 = 27.0219 \\]\n\nSince the registrations are in thousands, the forecasted number of registrations for year 11 is approximately 27,022.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 27010\nB. 27020\nC. 27030\nD. 27040\n\nThe closest option to our calculated value of 27,022 is option B. 27020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 27020.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{27020} \\]"
