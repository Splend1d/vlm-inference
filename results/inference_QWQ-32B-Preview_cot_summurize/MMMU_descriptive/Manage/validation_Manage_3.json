The table is divided into three columns, one for each month, and two rows for different types of sales: Cash Sales and Credit Sales. Each row has a corresponding amount in dollars for each month. Here are the details:\n\n- **October:**\n  - Cash Sales: $100,000\n  - Credit Sales: $100,000\n  - Total: $200,000\n\n- **November:**\n  - Cash Sales: $120,000\n  - Credit Sales: $150,000\n  - Total: $270,000\n\n- **December:**\n  - Cash Sales: $80,000\n  - Credit Sales: $90,000\n  - Total: $170,000\n\nThe table provides a clear breakdown of the sales figures for each type of sale and the total sales for each month.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nTimpco, a retailer, makes both cash and credit sales (i.e., sales on open account). Information regarding budgeted sales for the last quarter of the year is as follows: <image 1> Past experience shows that 5 percent of credit sales are uncollectible. Of the credit sales that are collectible, 60 percent are collected in the month of sale; the remaining 40 percent are collected in the month following the month of sale. Customers are granted a 1.5 percent discount for payment within 10 days of billing. Approximately 75 percent of collectible credit sales take advantage of the cash discount. Inventory purchases each month are 100 percent of the cost of the following month's projected sales. (The gross profit rate for Timpco is approximately 30 percent.) All merchandise purchases are made on credit, with 25 percent paid in the month of purchase and the remainder paid in the following month. No cash discounts for early payment are available.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall the sales data from the table:\n\n- **October:**\n  - Cash Sales: $100,000\n  - Credit Sales: $100,000\n  - Total: $200,000\n\n- **November:**\n  - Cash Sales: $120,000\n  - Credit Sales: $150,000\n  - Total: $270,000\n\n- **December:**\n  - Cash Sales: $80,000\n  - Credit Sales: $90,000\n  - Total: $170,000\n\nGiven that 5% of credit sales are uncollectible, we first need to determine the collectible portion of credit sales.\n\nFor November credit sales:\n\n- Credit Sales: $150,000\n- Uncollectible: 5% of $150,000 = $7,500\n- Collectible Credit Sales: $150,000 - $7,500 = $142,500\n\nNow, of the collectible credit sales, 60% are collected in the month of sale, and 40% are collected in the month following the sale.\n\nFor November collectible credit sales:\n\n- Collected in November: 60% of $142,500 = $85,500\n- Collected in December: 40% of $142,500 = $57,000\n\nAdditionally, 75% of collectible credit sales take advantage of the 1.5% discount for payment within 10 days.\n\nFor November collectible credit sales:\n\n- Total collectible: $142,500\n- Sales taking discount: 75% of $142,500 = $106,875\n- Sales not taking discount: 25% of $142,500 = $35,625\n\nNow, calculate the cash receipts from credit sales in November:\n\n- Collected in November: $85,500\n- Of this, $106,875 are eligible for discount, but since the discount is for payment within 10 days, and we don't have information on when exactly within the month the payments are made, we'll assume that the discount is applied to the amount collected in the month of sale.\n\nHowever, since the discount is 1.5%, the actual cash received from sales taking discount is 98.5% of the sales amount.\n\nTherefore, for the sales taking discount:\n\n- Discounted collections: $106,875 * 98.5% = $105,328.125\n\nAnd for sales not taking discount:\n\n- Full collections: $35,625 * 100% = $35,625\n\nTotal credit sales collections in November:\n\n- $105,328.125 (discounted) + $35,625 (full) = $140,953.125\n\nBut wait, this seems inconsistent because we previously calculated that only $85,500 is collected in November. This discrepancy suggests that not all collectible sales are being collected in November, and the discount applies only to the portion collected in November.\n\nLet's adjust our approach:\n\n- Total collectible credit sales: $142,500\n- Collected in November: $85,500\n- Collected in December: $57,000\n\nAssuming that the discount applies to the portion collected in November:\n\n- Of the $85,500 collected in November, 75% of the total collectible sales take the discount, which is $106,875, but since only $85,500 is collected in November, we need to find out what proportion of the $85,500 corresponds to the discount-takers.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's simpler to assume that the discount is applied to the portion of collectible sales collected in November, proportional to the total collectible sales.\n\nSo, the amount of collectible sales collected in November is $85,500 out of $142,500, which is:\n\n- Proportion collected in November: $85,500 / $142,500 = 60%\n\nGiven that 75% of collectible sales take the discount, the amount taking discount collected in November is:\n\n- Discount-takers collected in November: 75% * 60% * $142,500 = 0.75 * 0.6 * $142,500 = 0.45 * $142,500 = $64,125\n\nThe remaining portion collected in November is from those who don't take the discount:\n\n- Non-discount takers collected in November: $85,500 - $64,125 = $21,375\n\nNow, apply the discount to the discount-takers:\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $64,125 * 0.015 = $961.875\n- Therefore, cash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal cash receipts from credit sales in November:\n\n- Discount takers: $63,163.125\n- Non-discount takers: $21,375\n- Total credit collections in November: $63,163.125 + $21,375 = $84,538.125\n\nBut this seems lower than the $85,500 collected, which suggests an error in calculation.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps the discount is applied only to the portion of the collectible sales that are collected in the month of sale and take the discount.\n\nFirst, determine the portion of collectible sales collected in November:\n\n- Collected in November: $85,500\n\nAssume that 75% of the collectible sales collected in November take the discount:\n\n- Discount takers: 75% of $85,500 = $64,125\n- Non-discount takers: 25% of $85,500 = $21,375\n\nNow, apply the 1.5% discount to the discount takers:\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.875\n- Cash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal cash receipts from credit sales in November:\n\n- $63,163.125 (discount takers) + $21,375 (non-discount takers) = $84,538.125\n\nNow, add the cash sales for November:\n\n- Cash Sales: $120,000\n\nTotal cash receipts for November:\n\n- Cash Sales: $120,000\n- Credit Sales Collections: $84,538.125\n- Total: $120,000 + $84,538.125 = $204,538.125\n\nHowever, this seems inconsistent with the earlier calculation where the total collectible credit sales are $142,500, with $85,500 collected in November and $57,000 in December. But according to this approach, the credit sales collections in November are $84,538.125, which is less than $85,500. This discrepancy suggests an error in the approach.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to consider that the discount is applied to the portion of collectible sales that take the discount, and this portion is collected in November.\n\nGiven that 75% of collectible sales take the discount and are collected in November, and the remaining 25% are collected in November without discount, and the 40% collected in December are without discount.\n\nWait, but the 40% collected in December would be from the collectible sales not collected in November, which is 40% of $142,500 = $57,000.\n\nBut according to the earlier assumption, only 60% is collected in November, which is $85,500.\n\nGiven that 75% of collectible sales take the discount, which is $106,875, but only $85,500 is collected in November. So, perhaps not all discount takers are collected in November.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the discount is applied to the entire collectible sales collected in November, proportionally.\n\nLet's try this approach:\n\nTotal collectible sales: $142,500\n\nCollected in November: $85,500\n\nProportion collected in November: $85,500 / $142,500 = 0.6 or 60%\n\nGiven that 75% of collectible sales take the discount, the amount of discount-takers collected in November is 75% * 60% * $142,500 = 0.45 * $142,500 = $64,125\n\nSimilarly, the amount of non-discount takers collected in November is 25% * 60% * $142,500 = 0.15 * $142,500 = $21,375\n\nNow, apply the 1.5% discount to the discount-takers collected in November:\n\nDiscount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.875\n\nCash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal cash receipts from credit sales in November:\n\n$63,163.125 (discount takers) + $21,375 (non-discount takers) = $84,538.125\n\nAdd cash sales:\n\n$120,000 (cash sales) + $84,538.125 (credit collections) = $204,538.125\n\nBut this still doesn't account for the full $85,500 collected in November. There seems to be a mismatch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discount is applied only to the portion of the collectible sales that take the discount, and this is separate from the collection percentages.\n\nLet's consider that 75% of collectible sales take the discount and pay within 10 days, and the remaining 25% do not take the discount and pay later.\n\nGiven that 60% of collectible sales are collected in the month of sale, and 40% in the following month, we need to align the discount with the collection timing.\n\nAssume that all discount takers pay in the month of sale, and the non-discount takers pay in the month following the sale.\n\nGiven that, for November:\n\n- Collectible sales: $142,500\n- Discount takers: 75% of $142,500 = $106,875\n- Non-discount takers: 25% of $142,500 = $35,625\n\nCollections in November:\n\n- Discount takers: $106,875 less 1.5% discount\n- Non-discount takers collected in November: 0 (since they pay in December)\n\nWait, but earlier we had that 60% is collected in November, which is $85,500, but according to this, discount takers are $106,875, which is more than $85,500. This inconsistency suggests a flaw in the assumptions.\n\nMaybe the 60% collected in the month of sale includes both discount and non-discount takers, and the 40% is collected in the following month.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the 75% discount takers are included in the 60% collected in the month of sale.\n\nBut if 75% of collectible sales take the discount and pay within 10 days, but only 60% are collected in the month of sale, there's a mismatch.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that the discount is applied to the portion of collectible sales that are collected in November, and calculate the cash receipts accordingly.\n\nGiven that, collectible sales collected in November: $85,500\n\nAssume that 75% of the collectible sales collected in November take the discount:\n\n- Discount takers: 75% of $85,500 = $64,125\n- Non-discount takers: 25% of $85,500 = $21,375\n\nApply the 1.5% discount to the discount takers:\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.875\n- Cash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal credit sales collections in November:\n\n- $63,163.125 (discount takers) + $21,375 (non-discount takers) = $84,538.125\n\nAdd cash sales:\n\n- Cash Sales: $120,000\n\nTotal cash receipts for November:\n\n- $120,000 + $84,538.125 = $204,538.125\n\nHowever, this still doesn't account for the full $85,500 that should be collected in November. There seems to be a discrepancy of $85,500 - $84,538.125 = $961.875, which matches the discount amount. This suggests that the discount is reducing the total collections by that amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discount should be applied to the discount takers' portion separately.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nTotal collectible sales: $142,500\n\nCollections in November:\n\n- 60% of $142,500 = $85,500\n\nOf the collectible sales:\n\n- 75% take the discount: $106,875\n- 25% do not take the discount: $35,625\n\nNow, of the $85,500 collected in November:\n\n- The proportion of discount takers collected in November is $106,875 / $142,500 = 75%\n- Therefore, discount takers collected in November: 75% of $85,500 = $64,125\n- Non-discount takers collected in November: 25% of $85,500 = $21,375\n\nNow, apply the 1.5% discount to the discount takers:\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.875\n- Cash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal credit sales collections in November:\n\n- $63,163.125 (discount takers) + $21,375 (non-discount takers) = $84,538.125\n\nAdd cash sales:\n\n- $120,000 + $84,538.125 = $204,538.125\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the budgeted total cash receipts for November are $204,538.13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{204538.13} \\]"

Perhaps the simplest approach is to assume that the discount is applied to the portion of collectible sales that are collected in November, and calculate the cash receipts accordingly.\n\nGiven that, collectible sales collected in November: $85,500\n\nAssume that 75% of the collectible sales collected in November take the discount:\n\n- Discount takers: 75% of $85,500 = $64,125\n- Non-discount takers: 25% of $85,500 = $21,375\n\nApply the 1.5% discount to the discount takers:\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.875\n- Cash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal credit sales collections in November:\n\n- $63,163.125 (discount takers) + $21,375 (non-discount takers) = $84,538.125\n\nAdd cash sales:\n\n- Cash Sales: $120,000\n\nTotal cash receipts for November:\n\n- $120,000 + $84,538.125 = $204,538.125\n\nHowever, this still doesn't account for the full $85,500 that should be collected in November. There seems to be a discrepancy of $85,500 - $84,538.125 = $961.875, which matches the discount amount. This suggests that the discount is reducing the total collections by that amount.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the discount should be applied to the discount takers' portion separately.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\nTotal collectible sales: $142,500\n\nCollections in November:\n\n- 60% of $142,500 = $85,500\n\nOf the collectible sales:\n\n- 75% take the discount: $106,875\n- 25% do not take the discount: $35,625\n\nNow, of the $85,500 collected in November:\n\n- The proportion of discount takers collected in November is $106,875 / $142,500 = 75%\n- Therefore, discount takers collected in November: 75% of $85,500 = $64,125\n- Non-discount takers collected in November: 25% of $85,500 = $21,375\n\nNow, apply the 1.5% discount to the discount takers:\n\n- Discount amount: $64,125 * 1.5% = $961.875\n- Cash received from discount takers: $64,125 - $961.875 = $63,163.125\n\nTotal credit sales collections in November:\n\n- $63,163.125 (discount takers) + $21,375 (non-discount takers) = $84,538.125\n\nAdd cash sales:\n\n- $120,000 + $84,538.125 = $204,538.125\n\nThis seems consistent with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the budgeted total cash receipts for November are $204,538.13.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{204538.13} \\]",
