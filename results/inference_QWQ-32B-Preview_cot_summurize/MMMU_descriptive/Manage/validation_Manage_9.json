                    "text": "So I've got this table showing monthly sales data for 20 stores over March, April, and May. The table provides the total sales amount in thousands of dollars, the average number of daily sales, and the average length of customer visits in minutes for each store and each month. The statement I need to evaluate is: \"The store that averaged the fewest sales in May had higher total dollar sales that month than the store that averaged the most sales in May.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"averaged the fewest sales\" and \"averaged the most sales\" mean in this context. Since the table provides both total sales amount and average number of daily sales, I need to clarify which one is being referred to. The statement mentions \"averaged the fewest sales\" and \"averaged the most sales,\" which suggests it's referring to the average number of daily sales rather than the total sales amount.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should consider both possibilities because the statement could be ambiguous. But given that it specifies \"averaged the fewest sales,\" it's more likely referring to the average number of daily sales rather than averaging the total sales amount.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by considering the store with the lowest average number of daily sales in May and the store with the highest average number of daily sales in May, and then compare their total sales amounts for May.\n\nLooking at the data for May:\n\n- Ashford: 123 sales/day\n\n- Bennington: 80 sales/day\n\n- Carlisle: 52 sales/day\n\n- Depot: 112 sales/day\n\n- Eddington: 118 sales/day\n\n- Farpoint: 95 sales/day\n\n- Greenville: 151 sales/day\n\n- Harrington: 100 sales/day\n\n- Iverton: 66 sales/day\n\n- Jackson: 143 sales/day\n\n- Kiplinger: 110 sales/day\n\n- Landfield: 115 sales/day\n\n- Midville: 70 sales/day\n\n- Northfield: 78 sales/day\n\n- Overton: 103 sales/day\n\n- Princeville: 92 sales/day\n\n- Queensland: 118 sales/day\n\n- Riverton: 131 sales/day\n\n- Southland: 115 sales/day\n\n- Tuxedo: 128 sales/day\n\nFrom this list, the store with the fewest average daily sales in May is Carlisle with 52 sales/day, and the store with the most average daily sales in May is Greenville with 151 sales/day.\n\nNow, I need to look at their total sales amounts for May:\n\n- Carlisle: $465,000\n\n- Greenville: $508,000\n\nSo, Greenville has higher total sales than Carlisle in May.\n\nBut wait, the statement says: \"The store that averaged the fewest sales in May had higher total dollar sales that month than the store that averaged the most sales in May.\"\n\nIn this case, Carlisle had fewer average daily sales but lower total sales compared to Greenville, which had more average daily sales and higher total sales. So, according to this, the statement would be false.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any possibility that another store might have the fewest or most average daily sales, but given the data provided, Carlisle has the absolute lowest average daily sales, and Greenville has the highest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider if there's a store with very high average daily sales but low total sales, but that seems unlikely because total sales are generally higher with higher daily sales.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should look at the relationship between average daily sales and total sales. Total sales are calculated by multiplying average daily sales by the number of days in the month. Assuming May has 31 days, the total sales should be average daily sales multiplied by 31.\n\nLet me verify that for a couple of stores.\n\nTake Ashford:\n\n- Average daily sales: 123\n\n- Total sales: $472,000\n\n- 123 * 31 = 3,813, which should correspond to the total sales. But the total sales are given in thousands, so 3,813 thousand would be $3,813,000, which doesn't match the $472,000 reported. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nMaybe the average daily sales are not simply total sales divided by the number of days in the month. Perhaps there's another factor, like the store being open for fewer days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the average daily sales are calculated based on the days the store was open, not the total days in the month.\n\nThis complicates things because if stores have different numbers of operating days in May, then the relationship between average daily sales and total sales isn't directly proportional.\n\nIf that's the case, then a store with fewer average daily sales could potentially have higher total sales if it was open for many more days than a store with higher average daily sales.\n\nBut according to this, all stores seem to have the same average length of visit, which is in minutes, but that doesn't directly relate to the number of operating days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all stores operate every day in May, making the total sales directly proportional to average daily sales.\n\nBut given that Ashford's average daily sales of 123 multiplied by 31 days would be 3,813, which doesn't match their total sales of $472,000, there must be some misinterpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the average daily sales are in thousands as well. Let's check:\n\nIf average daily sales for Ashford are 123 (assuming thousands), then 123 * 31 = 3,813 thousand, which is $3,813,000, still not matching the $472,000 reported.\n\nThis suggests that average daily sales are not in thousands; they're just numbers of sales.\n\nBut in that case, total sales should be calculated based on the average revenue per sale, which isn't provided.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the statement is referring to the average of the total sales amounts, rather than average daily sales.\n\nBut the table specifically lists \"average number of daily sales,\" so that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"averaged the fewest sales\" refers to the lowest average daily sales, which I've already identified as Carlisle with 52 sales/day, and \"averaged the most sales\" refers to Greenville with 151 sales/day.\n\nThen, comparing their total sales amounts: Carlisle has $465,000 and Greenville has $508,000.\n\nSo, Greenville has higher total sales despite having higher average daily sales.\n\nThus, the store with the fewest average daily sales (Carlisle) does not have higher total sales than the store with the most average daily sales (Greenville).\n\nTherefore, the statement is false.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should check if any store with lower average daily sales has higher total sales than a store with higher average daily sales.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Carlisle: 52 sales/day, $465,000\n\n- Greenville: 151 sales/day, $508,000\n\n- Other stores:\n\n- Ashford: 123 sales/day, $472,000\n\n- Bennington: 80 sales/day, $498,000\n\n- Eddington: 118 sales/day, $423,000\n\n- Farpoint: 95 sales/day, $437,000\n\n- Harrington: 100 sales/day, $431,000\n\n- Iverton: 66 sales/day, $479,000\n\n- Jackson: 143 sales/day, $454,000\n\n- Kiplinger: 110 sales/day, $450,000\n\n- Landfield: 115 sales/day, $410,000\n\n- Midville: 70 sales/day, $504,000\n\n- Northfield: 78 sales/day, $437,000\n\n- Overton: 103 sales/day, $489,000\n\n- Princeville: 92 sales/day, $436,000\n\n- Queensland: 118 sales/day, $480,000\n\n- Riverton: 131 sales/day, $439,000\n\n- Southland: 115 sales/day, $444,000\n\n- Tuxedo: 128 sales/day, $408,000\n\nLooking at this, Carlisle has $465,000, and Greenville has $508,000. Carlisle does not have higher total sales than Greenville.\n\nSimilarly, other stores with lower average daily sales have lower or higher total sales compared to stores with higher average daily sales.\n\nBut since the statement specifically refers to the store with the fewest sales (Carlisle) and the store with the most sales (Greenville), and Carlisle does not have higher total sales than Greenville, the statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
