                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the correct answer is A. Graph A.\n\nLet me explain why:\n\nOhm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, and inversely proportional to the resistance between them. Mathematically, it's expressed as V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.\n\nPower dissipated in a resistor can be calculated using the formula P = I\u00b2R, where P is power, I is current, and R is resistance. Since the component obeys Ohm's law, its resistance R is constant.\n\nGiven that P = I\u00b2R and R is constant, the power P should vary with the square of the current I. This means that as current increases, power should increase quadratically, which would appear as a curve that starts at the origin (0,0) and rises steeply as I increases.\n\nLooking at the descriptions of the graphs:\n\n- Graph A: Shows a curve where power P increases rapidly as current I increases, starting from the origin (0,0) and rising steeply. This matches the expected quadratic relationship.\n\n- Graph B: Shows a straight line that decreases linearly from the y-axis to the x-axis, indicating a negative slope. This does not match the expected positive quadratic relationship.\n\n- Graph C: Shows a straight line that increases linearly from the origin (0,0), indicating a positive slope. However, since power is proportional to the square of current, not directly proportional to current, this linear relationship is incorrect.\n\n- Graph D: Shows a curve that starts high on the y-axis and decreases rapidly as current I increases, approaching zero. This suggests an inverse relationship, which is not consistent with P = I\u00b2R.\n\nTherefore, Graph A is the correct representation of how power dissipated varies with current in a component that obeys Ohm's law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
