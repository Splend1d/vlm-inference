                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem about the electrical circuit with six resistors and figure out where a voltmeter would read zero when connected between two points. Let's start by understanding the circuit description and then analyze the options given.\n\nFirst, the description says there are six resistors arranged in a series-parallel configuration. They are labeled from left to right:\n\n1. Resistor between T and S\n\n2. Resistor between S and Q\n\n3. Resistor between Q and P\n\n4. Resistor between W and U\n\n5. Resistor between U and the point where the fourth resistor ends (which should be W, I think, but let's confirm)\n\n6. Resistor between that point and P (which would be between W and P, assuming the fifth resistor is between U and W)\n\nWait, I need to make sure I understand the connections correctly.\n\nLet me sketch this out based on the description:\n\n- Resistor 1: T ----[R1]---- S\n\n- Resistor 2: S ----[R2]---- Q\n\n- Resistor 3: Q ----[R3]---- P\n\n- Resistor 4: W ----[R4]---- U\n\n- Resistor 5: U ----[R5]---- W\n\n- Resistor 6: W ----[R6]---- P\n\nAnd the battery is connected between T and P.\n\nWait, but resistor 5 is between U and W, and resistor 4 is also between W and U. So maybe resistors 4 and 5 are in parallel between W and U.\n\nThen resistor 6 is between W and P.\n\nSo the circuit looks like this:\n\nT ----[R1]---- S ----[R2]---- Q ----[R3]---- P\n\n|\n\n|\n\nW ----[R4]---- U ----[R5]---- W ----[R6]---- P\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to redraw it more clearly.\n\nProbably, points Q and W are at the same potential if there's no current flowing through them or something, but I need to see the actual connections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps resistors 4, 5, and 6 form a separate parallel branch.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that resistors 1, 2, and 3 are in series from T to P, and resistors 4, 5, and 6 are connected in some parallel configuration.\n\nBut the description is a bit unclear, so maybe I should look at the options provided and see which points are likely to be at the same potential, causing the voltmeter to read zero.\n\nThe voltmeter reads zero when connected between two points at the same electric potential. So, I need to find which pair of points among the options have the same potential.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. Q and U\n\nB. P and T\n\nC. Q and W\n\nD. S and U\n\nI need to analyze the circuit to determine the potentials at these points.\n\nFirst, since all resistors have the same resistance, let's denote the resistance as R.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the battery voltage is V.\n\nNow, in a series circuit, the voltage drops across each resistor are proportional to their resistances. Since all resistors are equal, the voltage drops are equal.\n\nBut in this circuit, there are parallel branches, so I need to consider how the current divides.\n\nWait, perhaps I can simplify the circuit step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the path from T to P through S, Q, and P with resistors R1, R2, and R3 in series.\n\nTotal resistance in this path: R + R + R = 3R.\n\nNow, the other path is from W to P through U and W with resistors R4, R5, and R6.\n\nWait, resistors 4 and 5 are between W and U, and resistor 6 is between W and P.\n\nThis seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider that resistors 4 and 5 are in parallel between W and U.\n\nThen, resistor 6 is in series with that parallel combination from W to P.\n\nSo, the equivalent resistance between W and P would be the parallel combination of R4 and R5 in series with R6.\n\nSince R4 and R5 are in parallel, their equivalent resistance is R/2.\n\nThen, in series with R6, the total resistance from W to P is R/2 + R = (R/2 + R) = (3R/2).\n\nNow, the main circuit has two paths from T to P: one through S, Q, P with 3R resistance, and another through W, (U), W, P with 3R/2 resistance.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the entire circuit and apply Kirchhoff's laws.\n\nAlternatively, since all resistors are equal, perhaps there is symmetry that can help simplify the problem.\n\nLet me try to assign voltages to each point assuming the battery is connected between T and P with voltage V.\n\nLet\u2019s set P at 0V and T at V volts.\n\nThen, the voltage at points between T and P can be determined based on the resistance divisions.\n\nFirst, consider the series path T-S-Q-P with resistors R1, R2, R3, each of resistance R.\n\nIn a series circuit, the voltage drop across each resistor is V/n, where n is the number of resistors.\n\nSo, voltage at S: V - (V/3) = (2V/3)\n\nVoltage at Q: (2V/3) - (V/3) = (V/3)\n\nVoltage at P: 0V\n\nWait, but there are two paths from Q to P: one directly through R3 and another through W, U, W, and R6.\n\nThis means that the current splits at Q and combines again at P.\n\nSo, the voltage at Q is not simply V/3; I need to consider the parallel path.\n\nThis is getting too complicated for my current approach. Maybe I should consider the concept of potential dividers or use the idea that in a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch is the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of symmetry or consider that certain points are at the same potential due to the symmetry of the resistors.\n\nWait, option A is Q and U, option C is Q and W, option D is S and U.\n\nIf I can determine the voltages at Q, U, and W, I might be able to see if any of them are equal.\n\nLet me assume that the resistors R4 and R5 are in parallel between W and U, and R6 is between W and P.\n\nThen, the equivalent resistance between W and P is the parallel combination of R4 and R5 in series with R6.\n\nBut since R4 and R5 are in parallel, their combined resistance is R/2.\n\nThen, in series with R6, which is R, the total resistance from W to P is R/2 + R = 3R/2.\n\nNow, the main path from T to P is through S, Q, P with resistors R1, R2, R3, each of R, so total 3R.\n\nAlternatively, from T to P through W, U, W, P with total resistance 3R/2.\n\nWait, but this doesn't seem right because there are multiple paths involving W and U.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the entire circuit and calculate the equivalent resistance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of mesh currents or node voltages to solve for the voltages at each point.\n\nBut that might be too time-consuming for this problem.\n\nLet me consider the symmetry of the circuit.\n\nIf I look at points Q and W, they might be at the same potential due to symmetry, but I need to confirm that.\n\nSimilarly, points U and S might have some relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the circuit has symmetry such that certain points are at the same potential.\n\nIf that's the case, then the voltmeter would read zero between those points.\n\nLooking at option C: Q and W.\n\nIf Q and W are at the same potential, then the voltmeter would read zero there.\n\nSimilarly, for option A: Q and U.\n\nOption D: S and U.\n\nOption B: P and T, but P is at 0V and T is at V, so the voltmeter would read V there, not zero.\n\nSo, option B is not the answer.\n\nTherefore, the likely answers are options A, C, or D.\n\nTo determine which one is correct, I need to find out if Q and U, Q and W, or S and U are at the same potential.\n\nGiven that all resistors are equal, perhaps Q and W are at the same potential.\n\nIf that's the case, then the voltmeter would read zero between Q and W.\n\nSimilarly, if S and U have the same potential, then option D would be the answer.\n\nBut I need to determine which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Q and U have the same potential.\n\nTo decide, maybe I can assign voltages based on the resistance divisions.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the battery voltage is V between T and P.\n\nThen, the total current I divides between the two paths: the series path T-S-Q-P with 3R resistance and the parallel path through W, U, W, P with 3R/2 resistance.\n\nThe current division formula says that the current through each path is inversely proportional to the resistance of that path.\n\nSo, current through the series path: I_series = I * (R_parallel / (R_series + R_parallel))\n\nSimilarly, current through the parallel path: I_parallel = I * (R_series / (R_series + R_parallel))\n\nWait, no, the correct formula for current division is I1 = I * (R_total / R1) and I2 = I * (R_total / R2), but I might be confusing it.\n\nActually, in parallel circuits, the current divides inversely proportional to the resistance.\n\nWait, no, in parallel circuits, the current divides in proportion to the conductance.\n\nLet me correct myself.\n\nThe total resistance of the circuit is R_total = 1 / (1/R_series + 1/R_parallel) = 1 / (1/3R + 1/(3R/2)) = 1 / (1/3R + 2/3R) = 1 / (3/3R) = 1 / (1/R) = R.\n\nSo, the total resistance of the circuit is R.\n\nThen, the total current from the battery is I = V / R.\n\nNow, the current divides between the two paths: series path with 3R and parallel path with 3R/2.\n\nThe current through the series path is I_series = I * (R_parallel / (R_series + R_parallel)) = (V/R) * (3R/2) / (3R + 3R/2) = (V/R) * (3R/2) / (9R/2) = (V/R) * (3R/2) * (2/9R) = V/R * 3R/9R = V/R * 1/3 = V/(3R)\n\nSimilarly, the current through the parallel path is I_parallel = I - I_series = V/R - V/(3R) = (3V - V)/(3R) = 2V/(3R)\n\nNow, let's find the voltages at various points.\n\nFirst, voltage at S:\n\nThe voltage drop from T to S is I_series * R1 = V/(3R) * R = V/3\n\nSo, voltage at S is V - V/3 = 2V/3\n\nSimilarly, voltage drop from S to Q is I_series * R2 = V/(3R) * R = V/3\n\nSo, voltage at Q is 2V/3 - V/3 = V/3\n\nVoltage drop from Q to P is I_series * R3 = V/(3R) * R = V/3\n\nSo, voltage at P is V/3 - V/3 = 0, which matches our initial assumption.\n\nNow, for the parallel path:\n\nFrom W to U through R4 and R5 in parallel.\n\nWait, R4 and R5 are between W and U, and they are in parallel.\n\nSo, the voltage across R4 and R5 is the same, and the current divides between them.\n\nBut since they are in parallel, the voltage across them is the same.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the voltage at W as V_W and at U as V_U.\n\nThen, the voltage across R4 is V_W - V_U, and across R5 is V_U - V_W, but since they are in parallel, V_W - V_U should be the same for both.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that R4 and R5 are in parallel, so their combined resistance is R/2 between W and U.\n\nThen, the voltage across W and U is V_W - V_U.\n\nThe current through the parallel combination is I_parallel = 2V/(3R)\n\nThen, V_W - V_U = I_parallel * (R/2) = (2V/(3R)) * (R/2) = V/3\n\nSo, V_W - V_U = V/3\n\nNow, from W to P through R6:\n\nThe voltage drop from W to P is I_parallel * R6 = (2V/(3R)) * R = 2V/3\n\nSo, voltage at W is V_W, and voltage at P is 0V.\n\nTherefore, V_W - 0 = 2V/3, so V_W = 2V/3\n\nThen, from earlier, V_W - V_U = V/3, so V_U = V_W - V/3 = 2V/3 - V/3 = V/3\n\nNow, we have:\n\nV_T = V\n\nV_S = 2V/3\n\nV_Q = V/3\n\nV_W = 2V/3\n\nV_U = V/3\n\nV_P = 0V\n\nNow, let's look back at the options:\n\nA. Q and U: V_Q = V/3, V_U = V/3 \u2192 voltage difference is zero\n\nB. P and T: V_P = 0V, V_T = V \u2192 voltage difference is V\n\nC. Q and W: V_Q = V/3, V_W = 2V/3 \u2192 voltage difference is V/3\n\nD. S and U: V_S = 2V/3, V_U = V/3 \u2192 voltage difference is V/3\n\nTherefore, the only pair with zero voltage difference is Q and U.\n\nSo, the answer should be option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
