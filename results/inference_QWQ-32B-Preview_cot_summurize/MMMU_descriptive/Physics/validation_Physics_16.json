                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a particle moving in a circular path at a constant speed, counterclockwise. It moves from point P to point Q, and Q is exactly halfway around the circle from P. I need to find the direction of the average velocity during this time interval.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what average velocity is. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval. Displacement is a vector that points from the initial position to the final position. So, in this case, it's from P to Q.\n\nGiven that Q is halfway around the circle from P, that means the particle has moved 180 degrees around the circle. So, if the circle is, say, centered at the origin, and P is at the rightmost point, then Q would be at the leftmost point.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If P is at (R,0), where R is the radius of the circle, then Q would be at (-R,0). So, the displacement vector would be from (R,0) to (-R,0), which is a vector pointing to the left, with components (-2R, 0).\n\nTherefore, the displacement is in the negative x-direction, assuming that's rightward.\n\nWait, the question says \"rightward\" and \"leftward,\" but it doesn't specify the coordinate system. I think it's safe to assume that rightward is positive x and leftward is negative x.\n\nSo, if displacement is from P to Q, which is from right to left, that's leftward.\n\nBut let's make sure. The average velocity is the displacement vector divided by time. The magnitude would be the straight-line distance from P to Q divided by time, and the direction is the direction of the displacement vector.\n\nIn this case, since P and Q are diametrically opposite, the displacement is directly from P to Q, which is leftward.\n\nWait, but if the particle is moving counterclockwise, and Q is halfway around, then yes, it's moving from P to Q in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nBut the displacement is just the straight-line distance from P to Q, regardless of the path taken.\n\nSo, yes, the displacement is directly from P to Q, which is leftward.\n\nTherefore, the average velocity should be leftward.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. rightward\n\nB. leftward\n\nC. upward\n\nD. The average velocity is zero.\n\nSo, B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there any scenario where it could be different?\n\nSuppose the circle is not horizontal, but say, P is at the top and Q at the bottom. Then, displacement would be downward.\n\nWait, the description says \"point Q is located exactly halfway around the circle from point P,\" and \"the particle moves from P to Q along the circular path.\" It also mentions that \"the direction of motion is indicated by arrows, showing that the particle moves in a counterclockwise direction.\"\n\nBut in the description, it says \"the distance between P and Q represents half of the circumference of the circle.\"\n\nSo, regardless of the orientation, moving halfway around the circle means displacement is directly from P to Q, which is a straight line passing through the center of the circle.\n\nIn the standard Cartesian coordinate system, if P is at (R,0), Q is at (-R,0), displacement is leftward.\n\nIf P is at (0,R), Q is at (0,-R), displacement is downward.\n\nWait, but the question doesn't specify the orientation of the circle. It only says that Q is halfway around the circle from P.\n\nLooking back, the description mentions \"point Q is located exactly halfway around the circle from point P, indicating that the particle moves from P to Q along the circular path. The direction of motion is indicated by arrows, showing that the particle moves in a counterclockwise direction.\"\n\nBut in the description, there's likely an image that shows the positions of P and Q.\n\nHowever, since I don't have the image, I need to consider the general case.\n\nIn general, the displacement vector from P to Q, being diametrically opposite, would be in the direction from P to Q.\n\nGiven that Q is halfway around the circle, the displacement vector would be along the diameter connecting P and Q.\n\nSo, the direction depends on the positions of P and Q.\n\nBut the question asks for the direction of the average velocity during this time interval.\n\nGiven that average velocity is displacement over time, and displacement is a vector from P to Q, the direction should be from P to Q.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. rightward\n\nB. leftward\n\nC. upward\n\nD. The average velocity is zero.\n\nSince Q is halfway around the circle from P, and the particle moves counterclockwise from P to Q, the displacement vector is from P to Q.\n\nDepending on how the circle is oriented, the direction could be leftward, rightward, upward, or downward.\n\nBut the options only include rightward, leftward, upward, and zero.\n\nGiven that it's a circular path and Q is halfway around, the displacement is along the diameter.\n\nSo, unless P and Q are positioned in such a way that the diameter is along the x-axis, the direction might not be leftward or rightward.\n\nWait, but the question says \"point Q is located exactly halfway around the circle from point P,\" and \"the particle moves from P to Q along the circular path.\"\n\nIt also says \"the direction of motion is indicated by arrows, showing that the particle moves in a counterclockwise direction.\"\n\nBut without the image, I have to assume a general position.\n\nHowever, perhaps the image shows P and Q in a specific orientation.\n\nGiven the options, it seems like the displacement is leftward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the circle is vertical, with P at the top and Q at the bottom, making the displacement downward, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if P is on the right and Q on the left, then displacement is leftward.\n\nPerhaps that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, if P is on the left and Q on the right, displacement would be rightward.\n\nBut the question says Q is exactly halfway around the circle from P, and the particle moves counterclockwise from P to Q.\n\nUnless the image specifies the positions, I think we have to assume a standard position.\n\nMaybe P is at the rightmost point, and Q at the leftmost point, making displacement leftward.\n\nTherefore, the average velocity is leftward.\n\nSo, the answer should be B. leftward.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any scenario where it could be different.\n\nIf the circle is oriented such that P is at the top and Q at the bottom, then displacement would be downward, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if P is at the bottom and Q at the top, displacement would be upward, which is option C.\n\nBut the options don't include downward, so perhaps the image shows P and Q such that displacement is leftward or rightward.\n\nGiven that, and considering the counterclockwise motion, if P is on the right and Q on the left, then leftward makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if P is on the left and Q on the right, it would be rightward.\n\nBut the question specifies that Q is exactly halfway around the circle from P, and the particle moves counterclockwise from P to Q.\n\nWithout more specific information about the orientation, I think the safest answer is B. leftward, assuming the standard orientation where P is on the right and Q on the left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. leftward.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
