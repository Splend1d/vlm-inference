                    "text": "So I've got this problem here involving torque and rotation. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have a rod on a horizontal tabletop, pivoted at one end, and it can rotate freely without friction about a vertical axis. The rod has a length L. At the other end of the rod, a force F is applied at an angle \u03b8 to the rod. The force is directed towards the right and slightly upwards, making an angle \u03b8 with the rod. We're looking at this from above, so we see the top surface of the rod and the direction of the force.\n\nNow, the question is asking: if the force F were to be applied perpendicular to the rod, at what distance from the axis should it be applied in order to produce the same torque?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall what torque is. Torque (\u03c4) is defined as the cross product of the position vector (r) and the force vector (F), so \u03c4 = r \u00d7 F. The magnitude of the torque is \u03c4 = r F sin \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between r and F.\n\nIn the initial setup, the force F is applied at the end of the rod, which is at a distance L from the axis, and it's at an angle \u03b8 to the rod. So, the torque produced in this case is \u03c4 = L F sin \u03b8.\n\nNow, the question is asking what distance from the axis we should apply the force F perpendicularly to the rod to produce the same torque. So, in this new scenario, the force is applied perpendicular to the rod, meaning the angle between r and F is 90 degrees.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the new distance from the axis as d. Since the force is perpendicular to the rod, the torque would be \u03c4 = d F sin 90\u00b0 = d F (since sin 90\u00b0 = 1).\n\nWe want this torque to be equal to the original torque, so:\n\nd F = L F sin \u03b8\n\nWe can cancel F from both sides (assuming F \u2260 0), which gives:\n\nd = L sin \u03b8\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. L sin \u03b8\n\nB. L cos \u03b8\n\nC. L\n\nD. L tan \u03b8\n\nIt seems like option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the component of the force that is perpendicular to the rod. In the original setup, the perpendicular component of the force to the rod is F sin \u03b8. Since torque is r times the perpendicular component of the force, \u03c4 = L * (F sin \u03b8).\n\nIn the new setup, the force is applied perpendicularly, so the perpendicular component is just F. We need \u03c4 = d * F.\n\nSetting them equal: d * F = L * F * sin \u03b8.\n\nAgain, cancel F: d = L sin \u03b8.\n\nHmm, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the moment arm in both cases.\n\nThe moment arm is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force.\n\nIn the original setup, the moment arm is L sin \u03b8.\n\nIn the new setup, since the force is applied perpendicularly to the rod, the moment arm is just the distance d.\n\nSo, to have the same torque, d should equal L sin \u03b8.\n\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I should draw a diagram to visualize this.\n\n[Imagining a diagram: rod of length L pivoted at one end, force F applied at the other end at an angle \u03b8 to the rod.\n\nIn the new setup, force F is applied perpendicular to the rod, but at a different distance d from the axis.\n\n]\n\nSo, in the original setup, the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force is L sin \u03b8.\n\nIn the new setup, since the force is perpendicular to the rod, the distance d is directly the moment arm.\n\nTherefore, d = L sin \u03b8.\n\nSeems consistent.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Like the direction of the force or something?\n\nWell, the problem says the force is applied perpendicular to the rod in the new setup, so the direction is taken care of.\n\nAnd since we're dealing with torques, and the question is about producing the same torque, I think focusing on the magnitude is sufficient here.\n\nUnless there's something about the direction of rotation, but since it's from above and the force is towards the right and slightly upwards, but in the new setup, it's perpendicular to the rod, I think as long as the torque magnitudes are equal, that should be fine.\n\nI don't see any trick here or additional complexities.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A. L sin \u03b8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]\n\n"
