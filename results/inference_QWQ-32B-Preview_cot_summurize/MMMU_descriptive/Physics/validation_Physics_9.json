The rod is oriented horizontally, with the rope pulling upwards from the left side and the wall supporting the right side. There are four labeled points along the rod: Point 1 is where the rope is attached, Point 2 is where the rod touches the wall, Point 3 is the midpoint of the rod, and Point 4 is the far end of the rod. The rod appears to be balanced, suggesting that the forces and torques acting on it are in equilibrium.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>The uniform rod shown below is held in place by the rope and wall. Suppose you know the weight of the rod and all dimensions. Then you can solve a single equation for the force exerted by the rope, provided you write expressions for the torques about the point:\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\nE. 1, 2, or 3\n"

                    "text": "To solve for the force exerted by the rope, we need to consider the equilibrium conditions for the rod. Since the rod is uniform and in static equilibrium, both the sum of the forces and the sum of the torques must be zero.\n\nGiven that we know the weight of the rod and all dimensions, we can choose any point as the pivot point to calculate the torques. However, selecting a strategic pivot point can simplify the calculations by eliminating some unknown forces from the torque equation.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Point 1**\n\nPoint 1 is where the rope is attached. If we choose this point as the pivot, the torque due to the force exerted by the rope is zero because the distance from the pivot to the point where the force acts is zero.\n\nThe torques acting about Point 1 would include:\n\n- The torque due to the weight of the rod.\n\n- The torque due to the normal force from the wall at Point 2.\n\nSince we know the weight and its position (acting at the center of mass, which is the midpoint for a uniform rod), and we know all dimensions, we can set up the torque equation and solve for the normal force from the wall. However, the force exerted by the rope is directly related to this normal force through the force equilibrium equations.\n\nBut the question asks for solving a single equation for the force exerted by the rope. Choosing Point 1 as the pivot might not directly give us the rope force in a single equation.\n\n**Option B: Point 2**\n\nPoint 2 is where the rod touches the wall. If we choose this point as the pivot, the torque due to the normal force from the wall is zero.\n\nThe torques acting about Point 2 would include:\n\n- The torque due to the weight of the rod.\n\n- The torque due to the force exerted by the rope.\n\nAgain, knowing the weight and its position, and knowing all dimensions, we can set up the torque equation to solve for the force exerted by the rope.\n\nThis seems promising because the unknown is directly in the torque equation.\n\n**Option C: Point 3**\n\nPoint 3 is the midpoint of the rod. If we choose this point as the pivot, the torque due to the weight is zero because the weight acts at this point.\n\nThe torques acting about Point 3 would include:\n\n- The torque due to the force exerted by the rope.\n\n- The torque due to the normal force from the wall.\n\nWith two unknowns in the torque equation, we would need another equation to solve for both unknowns. Therefore, choosing Point 3 does not allow us to solve for the rope force in a single equation.\n\n**Option D: Point 4**\n\nPoint 4 is the far end of the rod. If we choose this point as the pivot, the torque due to the normal force from the wall is zero.\n\nThe torques acting about Point 4 would include:\n\n- The torque due to the weight of the rod.\n\n- The torque due to the force exerted by the rope.\n\nSimilar to choosing Point 2 as the pivot, we can set up the torque equation to solve for the force exerted by the rope.\n\n**Option E: 1, 2, or 3**\n\nThis option suggests that any of Points 1, 2, or 3 can be used to solve for the rope force in a single equation.\n\nFrom the analysis above:\n\n- Point 1: Does not directly give the rope force in a single equation.\n\n- Point 2: Allows solving for the rope force in a single equation.\n\n- Point 3: Does not allow solving for the rope force in a single equation.\n\nTherefore, Option E is not entirely correct because only Point 2 (and possibly Point 4) allows solving for the rope force in a single equation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, the best choice is Point 2, as selecting this point as the pivot allows us to write a single torque equation that directly solves for the force exerted by the rope.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing Option D (Point 4), it also seems feasible to solve for the rope force in a single equation similarly to Point 2.\n\nBut since Option D is not included in the possible answers provided (A, B, C, E), and considering the options given, the correct choice is:\n\n**B. 2**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
