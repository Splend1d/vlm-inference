                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of light in the plastic based on the given angles of incidence and refraction. The key concept here is Snell's Law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the speeds of light in the two media.\n\nFirst, let's recall Snell's Law:\n\n\\[ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\) are the indices of refraction of the first and second media, respectively.\n- \\( \\theta_1 \\) is the angle of incidence.\n- \\( \\theta_2 \\) is the angle of refraction.\n\nIn this problem:\n- The first medium is air.\n- The second medium is plastic.\n- The angle of incidence \\( \\theta_1 \\) is 37 degrees.\n- The angle of refraction \\( \\theta_2 \\) is 53 degrees.\n\nWe know that the speed of light in air is approximately equal to the speed of light in vacuum, which is \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s.\n\nThe index of refraction \\( n \\) of a medium is related to the speed of light in that medium \\( v \\) by:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{c}{v} \\]\n\nOur goal is to find the speed of light in the plastic \\( v_{\\text{plastic}} \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the indices of refraction for air and plastic.\n\nFor air, the index of refraction \\( n_{\\text{air}} \\) is approximately 1.\n\nLet \\( n_{\\text{plastic}} \\) be the index of refraction of the plastic.\n\nUsing Snell's Law:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times \\sin(37^\\circ) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\times \\sin(53^\\circ) \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( n_{\\text{plastic}} \\):\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{\\sin(37^\\circ)}{\\sin(53^\\circ)} \\]\n\nUsing the values of the sine function:\n\n\\[ \\sin(37^\\circ) \\approx 0.6 \\]\n\\[ \\sin(53^\\circ) \\approx 0.8 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{0.6}{0.8} = 0.75 \\]\n\nNow, using the relationship between the index of refraction and the speed of light:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{c}{v_{\\text{plastic}}} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v_{\\text{plastic}} \\):\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{c}{n_{\\text{plastic}}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}}{0.75} = 4 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nHowever, the question asks for the speed of light in the plastic in units of \\( 10^8 \\) m/s.

Let's double-check the calculations.\n\nWait a minute, in Snell's Law, the light is going from air into plastic. The angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence, which would imply that the speed of light increases when entering the plastic, meaning the index of refraction of plastic is less than that of air. But the index of refraction typically increases when going from air to a denser medium like plastic.\n\nHowever, in this case, the angle of refraction is larger than the angle of incidence, which suggests that the light is bending away from the normal, indicating that the speed of light increases in the plastic, meaning the index of refraction decreases.\n\nBut this seems counterintuitive because plastic is denser than air, so light should slow down, and the index of refraction should increase.\n\nLet me verify the angles again.\n\nGiven:\n- Angle of incidence in air: 37 degrees\n- Angle of refraction in plastic: 53 degrees\n\nWait, this seems unusual because typically, when light enters a denser medium, it bends towards the normal, meaning the angle of refraction should be smaller than the angle of incidence.\n\nHere, the angle of refraction is larger, which suggests that light is bending away from the normal, indicating that the speed of light increases in the plastic, meaning the index of refraction decreases.\n\nBut plastic has a higher index of refraction than air, so this seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in interpreting the angles.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that the angles are measured differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the light is going from plastic to air.\n\nWait, the problem states that the light enters the block of plastic from air.\n\nSo, it should be air to plastic.\n\nBut according to Snell's Law, if \\( n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) \\), and \\( n_2 > n_1 \\), then \\( \\theta_2 < \\theta_1 \\).\n\nBut here, \\( \\theta_2 > \\theta_1 \\), which would imply \\( n_2 < n_1 \\), meaning plastic has a lower index than air, which doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps there is a misinterpretation of the angles.\n\nLet me consider that the angles might be measured with respect to the interface differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the light is going from plastic to air, not from air to plastic.\n\nBut the problem clearly states that the light enters the block of plastic from air.\n\nGiven that, there must be an error in the interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angles are not what they seem.\n\nLet me try calculating again.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\times \\sin(37^\\circ) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\times \\sin(53^\\circ) \\]\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{\\sin(37^\\circ)}{\\sin(53^\\circ)} = \\frac{0.6}{0.8} = 0.75 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{c}{n_{\\text{plastic}}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8}{0.75} = 4 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the speed of light in plastic relative to the speed in vacuum, expressed in units of \\( 10^8 \\) m/s.\n\nBut 4 is not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming the angles.\n\nLet me consider that the angle of incidence is 53 degrees and the angle of refraction is 37 degrees.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\sin(\\theta_2) \\]\n\n\\[ 1 \\times \\sin(53^\\circ) = n_{\\text{plastic}} \\times \\sin(37^\\circ) \\]\n\n\\[ n_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{\\sin(53^\\circ)}{\\sin(37^\\circ)} = \\frac{0.8}{0.6} = 1.\\overline{3} \\approx 1.33 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ v_{\\text{plastic}} = \\frac{c}{n_{\\text{plastic}}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^8}{1.33} \\approx 2.26 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\]\n\nExpressed in units of \\( 10^8 \\) m/s, this is 2.26.\n\nLooking back at the options, D. 2.26 matches this value.\n\nBut wait, in the initial interpretation, the angles were given as incidence 37 degrees and refraction 53 degrees, which would suggest \\( n_{\\text{plastic}} = 0.75 \\), leading to \\( v_{\\text{plastic}} = 4 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s, which isn't an option.\n\nHowever, if I swap the angles, assuming incidence 53 degrees and refraction 37 degrees, then \\( n_{\\text{plastic}} = 1.33 \\), and \\( v_{\\text{plastic}} = 2.26 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s, which is option D.\n\nGiven that 4 isn't an option, and 2.26 is, perhaps there was a misinterpretation of which angle is the angle of incidence and which is the angle of refraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the light exiting the plastic, not entering it.\n\nBut the problem clearly states that the light enters the block of plastic from air.\n\nGiven that, and given the discrepancy, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the angle of incidence is 53 degrees and the angle of refraction is 37 degrees, leading to \\( v_{\\text{plastic}} = 2.26 \\times 10^8 \\) m/s.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. 2.26.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{2.26} \\]"
