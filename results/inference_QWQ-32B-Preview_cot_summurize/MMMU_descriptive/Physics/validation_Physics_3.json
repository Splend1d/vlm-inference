Each wire carries a current \\(i\\) directed into the page, indicated by the circular symbols with a dot in the center for one wire and a cross in the center for the other wire. The wires are aligned horizontally, and the distance between them is labeled as \\(d\\).\n\nBased on this description, the direction of the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire can be determined using the right-hand rule for magnetic forces between currents. According to this rule, when two currents flow in the same direction, they attract each other, and when they flow in opposite directions, they repel each other.\n\nSince both currents are flowing into the page (in the same direction), the wires will attract each other. Therefore, the force on the right-hand wire due to the current in the left-hand wire will be directed towards the left.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\nB. to the left\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>relate to the two long parallel wires shown.
