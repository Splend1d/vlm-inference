                    "text": "To determine the work function of the material from the graph of maximum kinetic energy (\\(E_{km}\\)) of photoelectrons versus the frequency (\\(f\\)) of photons, we can use the photoelectric effect equation:\n\n\\[ E_{km} = hf - \\phi \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( h \\) is Planck's constant (\\( h \\approx 4.1357 \\times 10^{-15} \\) eV\u00b7s),\n- \\( f \\) is the frequency of the photon,\n- \\( \\phi \\) is the work function of the material.\n\nIn the graph, the x-axis represents the frequency in units of \\(10^{14}\\) Hz, and the y-axis represents \\(E_{km}\\) in electron volts (eV). The graph shows a straight line that starts at a negative value on the y-axis and increases linearly as the frequency increases. The line intersects the x-axis at approximately \\(4 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz, which is the threshold frequency (\\(f_0\\)) where \\(E_{km} = 0\\). At this point, the energy of the photon is exactly equal to the work function:\n\n\\[ \\phi = hf_0 \\]\n\nGiven that \\(f_0 \\approx 4 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz, we can calculate the work function:\n\n\\[ \\phi = (4.1357 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 4.1357 \\times 4 \\times 10^{-15} \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 4.1357 \\times 4 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 4.1357 \\times 0.4 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi \\approx 1.65428 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nHowever, this calculation seems off because multiplying \\(4.1357 \\times 10^{-15}\\) eV\u00b7s by \\(4 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz should give:\n\n\\[ \\phi = 4.1357 \\times 4 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 16.5428 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 1.65428 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nBut this result does not match any of the provided options (1.5 eV, 2.0 eV, 2.7 eV, 3.5 eV). It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again.\n\nFirst, note that Planck's constant \\(h\\) is approximately \\(4.1357 \\times 10^{-15}\\) eV\u00b7s, and the threshold frequency \\(f_0\\) is \\(4 \\times 10^{14}\\) Hz.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\phi = h f_0 = (4.1357 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{eV} \\cdot \\text{s}) \\times (4 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{Hz}) \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 4.1357 \\times 4 \\times 10^{-15} \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 4.1357 \\times 4 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 16.5428 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = 1.65428 \\, \\text{eV} \\]\n\nThis calculation consistently gives approximately 1.65 eV, which is closest to option A, 1.5 eV. However, another approach is to consider the slope of the line in the graph, which should be equal to Planck's constant, and the y-intercept should be equal to \\(-\\phi\\).\n\nIf we have the equation:\n\n\\[ E_{km} = h f - \\phi \\]\n\nThis is in the form of a linear equation \\(y = m x + b\\), where \\(m = h\\) and \\(b = -\\phi\\).\n\nIf we can determine the y-intercept from the graph, that would give us \\(-\\phi\\), and thus \\(\\phi = -b\\).\n\nHowever, since the description only provides the threshold frequency and not the y-intercept or the slope, we have to rely on the threshold frequency to find the work function.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that at the threshold frequency, \\(E_{km} = 0\\), then:\n\n\\[ 0 = h f_0 - \\phi \\]\n\n\\[ \\phi = h f_0 \\]\n\nWhich is what we have already calculated as approximately 1.65 eV.\n\nGiven that, among the options provided, 1.5 eV (option A) is the closest to our calculated value.\n\nTherefore, the approximate work function of this material is 1.5 eV.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.5 \\, \\text{eV}} \\]\n\n**Option A**"
