The light changes direction at each interface, indicating that the refractive indices are different for each medium.\n\nTo determine the relationship between the speeds of light in these media, we need to recall the relationship between the refractive index and the speed of light in a medium. The refractive index \\( n \\) of a medium is defined as:\n\n\\[\nn = \\frac{c}{v}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \\( v \\) is the speed of light in the medium. This equation tells us that the higher the refractive index, the slower the speed of light in that medium.\n\nGiven this relationship, if we can determine the relative refractive indices of the three media, we can deduce the relative speeds of light in them.\n\nFrom the description, the light beam enters medium n1 at an angle, refracts into medium n2, and then refracts again into medium n3. The path of the light beam changes direction at each interface, suggesting that the refractive indices are different.\n\nTo analyze the refraction at each interface, we can use Snell's Law, which states:\n\n\\[\nn_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta_1 \\) is the angle of incidence and \\( \\theta_2 \\) is the angle of refraction.\n\nLet's assume that as the light passes from medium n1 to medium n2, it bends towards the normal. This would indicate that the light is slowing down upon entering medium n2, meaning that \\( n_2 > n_1 \\), and thus \\( v_2 < v_1 \\).\n\nSimilarly, when the light passes from medium n2 to medium n3, if it bends away from the normal, this would suggest that the light is speeding up upon entering medium n3, meaning that \\( n_3 < n_2 \\), and thus \\( v_3 > v_2 \\).\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- \\( n_2 > n_1 \\) implies \\( v_2 < v_1 \\)\n\n- \\( n_3 < n_2 \\) implies \\( v_3 > v_2 \\)\n\nFrom these inequalities, we can infer:\n\n\\( v_1 > v_2 \\) and \\( v_3 > v_2 \\)\n\nHowever, we don't have direct information about the relationship between \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_3 \\). To determine whether \\( v_1 > v_3 \\) or \\( v_1 < v_3 \\), we would need more information about the angles of incidence and refraction or the specific values of the refractive indices.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. \\( v_3 > v_1 > v_2 \\)\n\nB. \\( v_1 > v_2 > v_3 \\)\n\nC. \\( v_1 > v_3 < v_2 \\)\n\nD. \\( v_2 > v_3 > v_1 \\)\n\nBased on our deductions:\n\n- \\( v_1 > v_2 \\)\n\n- \\( v_3 > v_2 \\)\n\nOption A suggests \\( v_3 > v_1 > v_2 \\), which is possible if \\( v_3 > v_1 \\).\n\nOption B suggests \\( v_1 > v_2 > v_3 \\), which would require \\( v_1 > v_3 \\), but we don't have information to confirm this.\n\nOption C has \\( v_1 > v_3 < v_2 \\), which contradicts our finding that \\( v_3 > v_2 \\).\n\nOption D has \\( v_2 > v_3 > v_1 \\), which contradicts \\( v_1 > v_2 \\).\n\nGiven that option C and D are contradictory to our findings, they can be eliminated.\n\nBetween options A and B, we need to determine whether \\( v_1 > v_3 \\) or \\( v_3 > v_1 \\).\n\nSince we don't have specific information about the angles or the refractive indices beyond the relationships at each interface, we cannot definitively say which is greater between \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_3 \\).\n\nHowever, based on the typical behavior of light passing through different media, if light slows down from medium n1 to n2 and then speeds up from n2 to n3, it's possible that \\( v_3 > v_1 \\), especially if medium n3 has a lower refractive index than medium n1.\n\nTherefore, option A (\\( v_3 > v_1 > v_2 \\)) seems plausible.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another perspective.\n\nSuppose medium n1 is air (\\( n_1 \\approx 1.00 \\)), medium n2 is water (\\( n_2 \\approx 1.33 \\)), and medium n3 is glass (\\( n_3 \\approx 1.50 \\)).\n\nIn this case:\n\n\\( n_1 < n_2 < n_3 \\), which would mean \\( v_1 > v_2 > v_3 \\), corresponding to option B.\n\nAlternatively, if medium n1 is glass (\\( n_1 = 1.50 \\)), medium n2 is water (\\( n_2 = 1.33 \\)), and medium n3 is air (\\( n_3 = 1.00 \\)), then:\n\n\\( n_1 > n_2 > n_3 \\), which would mean \\( v_1 < v_2 < v_3 \\), similar to option A but in reverse.\n\nHowever, without specific values or additional information, we cannot definitively choose between options A and B.\n\nGiven the information provided in the description and the need to select one option, I would lean towards option A (\\( v_3 > v_1 > v_2 \\)), as it is consistent with the light speeding up in medium n3 compared to medium n1, while both are faster than in medium n2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
