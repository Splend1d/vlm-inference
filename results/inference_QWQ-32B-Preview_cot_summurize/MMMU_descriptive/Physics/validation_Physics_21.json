The x-axis represents distance, and the y-axis represents force. The graph has four labeled points: A, B, C, and D.\n\n- Point A is located at the far left of the graph, where the force is positive and very high.\n- As we move from point A to point B along the curve, the force decreases rapidly and becomes zero at point B.\n- Beyond point B, the force becomes negative and reaches its minimum value at point C.\n- After point C, the force increases again, becoming less negative, and approaches zero as it reaches point D.\n\nPoint A shows the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force because it is at this point where the force is positive and very high, indicating repulsion.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>The graph below shows the variation of the strong nuclear force with nucleon separation.Which of the points A, B, C or D shows the repulsive nature of the strong nuclear force? \n\n"
