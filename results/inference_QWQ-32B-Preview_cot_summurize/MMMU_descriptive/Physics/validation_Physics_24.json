This equation represents a nuclear reaction where a lithium-6 nucleus (with 3 protons and 3 neutrons) reacts with an unknown particle (?) to produce a lithium-7 nucleus (with 3 protons and 4 neutrons).\n\nTo determine what the \"?\" represents, we need to consider the conservation of mass and charge in nuclear reactions. The lithium-6 nucleus has a total mass number of 6 (3 protons + 3 neutrons), and the lithium-7 nucleus has a total mass number of 7 (3 protons + 4 neutons). Therefore, the unknown particle must have a mass number of 1 to balance the equation.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. an alpha particle (which has a mass number of 4)\nB. an electron (which has no mass number)\nC. a neutron (which has a mass number of 1)\nD. a proton (which has a mass number of 1)\n\nThe correct answer is C. a neutron, because it has a mass number of 1 and can balance the equation.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>What does the ? represent in the nuclear reaction\n\nA. an alpha particle\nB. an electron\nC. a neutron\nD. a proton\n"
