                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions for constructive interference in a thin film when light is incident normally. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Setup\n- We have a thin film with index of refraction \\( n_f \\).\n- This film is sandwiched between two materials, each with an index of refraction less than \\( n_f \\), denoted as \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n- A monochromatic beam of light is incident normally (perpendicularly) onto the film.\n- The wavelength of light within the film is \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n### Step 2: Reflection Phases\nWhen light reflects from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a medium with a lower index of refraction, there is no phase change. Conversely, when light reflects from a medium with a lower index of refraction to a medium with a higher index of refraction, there is a phase change of \\( \\pi \\) radians (or half a wavelength).\n\nIn this scenario:\n- Incident light from medium 1 (index \\( n_1 < n_f \\)) to the film (index \\( n_f \\)): reflection phase change of \\( \\pi \\).\n- Reflected light from the film to medium 2 (index \\( n_2 < n_f \\)): no phase change.\n- Reflected light from medium 2 back to the film: reflection phase change of \\( \\pi \\).\n- Finally, the light reflects back from the film to medium 1: no phase change.\n\nWait, actually, let's correct that. Since the light is incident from medium 1 to the film, and medium 1 has \\( n_1 < n_f \\), there will be a phase change upon reflection at the first interface. Then, the light travels through the film and reflects at the second interface, where the film has \\( n_f > n_2 \\), so there will be another phase change.\n\nBut actually, for thin film interference, the standard case is to consider the phase changes at each reflection.\n\n### Step 3: Path Difference\nFor constructive interference, the path difference between the two reflected beams must be an integer multiple of the wavelength in the film.\n\nThe total path difference for the light that reflects off the top surface and the light that transmits into the film, reflects off the bottom surface, and exits back into medium 1 is:\n\n\\[ 2d \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is the thickness of the film.\n\nHowever, we must consider the phase changes upon reflection.\n\n### Step 4: Phase Changes\n- At the top surface (from medium 1 to film): phase change of \\( \\pi \\) because \\( n_1 < n_f \\).\n- At the bottom surface (from film to medium 2): phase change of \\( \\pi \\) because \\( n_f > n_2 \\).\n\nSo, total phase change is \\( \\pi + \\pi = 2\\pi \\), which is equivalent to no phase change.\n\n### Step 5: Condition for Constructive Interference\nSince there is no net phase change, the condition for constructive interference is:\n\n\\[ 2d = m\\lambda \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is an integer (1, 2, 3, ...).\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Film Thickness\nWe are to find the film thicknesses that result in maximum constructive interference. Given the options:\n\nA. \\( 2\\lambda \\)\n\nB. \\( \\lambda \\)\n\nC. \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nD. \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{4} \\)\n\nFrom the condition \\( 2d = m\\lambda \\), we can solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{m\\lambda}{2} \\]\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( m = 2 \\), \\( d = \\lambda \\)\n\nFor \\( m = 3 \\), \\( d = \\frac{3\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nLooking at the options, \\( d = \\lambda \\) (option B) and \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\) (option C) are possible.\n\nHowever, the question asks for \"which of the following film thicknesses\" without specifying a particular order, so both B and C are correct.\n\nBut since it's a multiple-choice question with single selection, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the phase changes again.\n\n### Step 7: Revisiting Phase Changes\nLet's double-check the phase changes:\n\n- Top surface: medium 1 to film, \\( n_1 < n_f \\), so phase change \\( \\pi \\).\n\n- Bottom surface: film to medium 2, \\( n_f > n_2 \\), so phase change \\( \\pi \\).\n\nTotal phase change: \\( \\pi + \\pi = 2\\pi \\), which is equivalent to no phase change.\n\nTherefore, the condition for constructive interference is indeed:\n\n\\[ 2d = m\\lambda \\]\n\nSo, \\( d = \\frac{m\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( m = 2 \\), \\( d = \\lambda \\)\n\nBoth of these are options C and B.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects only one answer, considering the smallest thickness for maximum constructive interference, which would be \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the indices.\n\n### Step 8: Considering Indices of Refraction\nThe problem states that both surrounding materials have indices less than \\( n_f \\), i.e., \\( n_1 < n_f \\) and \\( n_2 < n_f \\).\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment of phase changes is correct.\n\n### Step 9: Conclusion\nGiven that both \\( d = \\lambda \\) and \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\) satisfy the condition for constructive interference, and both are options, perhaps the question allows for multiple correct answers.\n\nHowever, since it's likely a single-select question, the smallest thickness for constructive interference is \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\), which corresponds to option C.\n\nBut option B is also correct according to the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the order of the interference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in considering both phase changes.\n\nLet me consider the standard formula for constructive interference in a thin film with normal incidence:\n\nWhen light reflects from a medium of lower \\( n \\) to higher \\( n \\), there's a phase change of \\( \\pi \\), and vice versa.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Top interface: \\( n_1 \\) to \\( n_f \\), \\( n_1 < n_f \\), so phase change \\( \\pi \\).\n\n- Bottom interface: \\( n_f \\) to \\( n_2 \\), \\( n_f > n_2 \\), so phase change \\( \\pi \\).\n\nTotal phase change: \\( 2\\pi \\), which is equivalent to no phase change.\n\nTherefore, the condition for constructive interference is:\n\n\\[ 2d = m\\lambda \\]\n\nSo, \\( d = \\frac{m\\lambda}{2} \\), where \\( m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\)\n\nThus, for \\( m = 1 \\), \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\)\n\nFor \\( m = 2 \\), \\( d = \\lambda \\)\n\nBoth are options C and B.\n\nGiven that, both are correct, but perhaps the question expects the smallest thickness, which is \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\), option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the light has to travel through the film and back, considering the round trip.\n\nThe round trip path length is \\( 2d \\), and for constructive interference, this should be equal to \\( m\\lambda \\), considering any phase changes.\n\nSince there are two phase changes, totaling \\( 2\\pi \\), which is equivalent to no phase shift, the condition remains \\( 2d = m\\lambda \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( d = \\frac{m\\lambda}{2} \\).\n\nSo, both B and C are correct.\n\nBut likely, the question expects a single answer, so perhaps there's a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength in the film, and we need to relate it to the wavelength in vacuum or another medium.\n\nWait, no, the problem specifies that \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength within the film.\n\nTherefore, the condition \\( 2d = m\\lambda \\) holds.\n\nThus, the correct film thicknesses are \\( d = \\frac{m\\lambda}{2} \\), for integer \\( m \\).\n\nGiven the options, both B and C satisfy this condition for \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\), respectively.\n\nHowever, perhaps the question is considering only the first order constructive interference, which would be \\( m = 1 \\), corresponding to \\( d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\), option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the film is between two different media, but the problem states that both surrounding media have \\( n < n_f \\), so my initial assessment holds.\n\nGiven that, I would choose option C, \\( \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\), as the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other factors.\n\n### Step 10: Considering Polarization or Other Effects\nSince the light is incident normally and the film is non-absorbing, polarization effects do not come into play in a significant way for this interference condition.\n\nTherefore, the condition \\( 2d = m\\lambda \\) remains valid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
