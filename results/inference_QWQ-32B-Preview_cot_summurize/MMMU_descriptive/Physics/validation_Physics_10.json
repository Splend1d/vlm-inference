                    "text": "Let's see. I have these two systems here: one is a mass attached to a spring, and the other is a simple pendulum. Both are released from rest and undergo simple harmonic motion. I need to figure out which statement is true for both spheres.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basics about simple harmonic motion. In SHM, the motion is periodic, and the restoring force is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\nFor the spring-mass system:\n\n- The spring exerts a restoring force proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n\n- The potential energy stored in the spring is \\( \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is the spring constant, and \\( x \\) is the displacement from equilibrium.\n\n- The gravitational potential energy also plays a role, but if we choose the equilibrium position as the reference point, the total energy is the sum of kinetic, spring potential, and gravitational potential energies.\n\nFor the simple pendulum:\n\n- The restoring force is the component of the gravitational force tangent to the arc of motion.\n\n- For small angles, the motion is approximately simple harmonic.\n\n- The potential energy is due to gravity and is given by \\( mgh \\), where \\( h \\) is the height relative to the lowest point.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. The maximum kinetic energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nFor the spring-mass system:\n\n- At equilibrium, the spring is neither compressed nor stretched, so its potential energy is minimum.\n\n- The gravitational potential energy is at a reference point, assuming equilibrium is the zero point.\n\n- Therefore, the kinetic energy should be maximum at equilibrium because total energy is conserved.\n\nFor the simple pendulum:\n\n- At the equilibrium position (lowest point), all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.\n\n- So, kinetic energy is maximum at the equilibrium position.\n\nTherefore, option A seems true for both systems.\n\nB. The minimum gravitational potential energy is attained as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nFor the spring-mass system:\n\n- If we set the equilibrium position as the zero for gravitational potential energy, then yes, at equilibrium, gravitational potential energy is minimum.\n\nFor the simple pendulum:\n\n- At the equilibrium position (lowest point), gravitational potential energy is minimum.\n\nTherefore, option B is also true for both systems.\n\nC. The maximum gravitational potential energy is attained when the sphere reaches its point of release.\n\nFor the spring-mass system:\n\n- The point of release is below the equilibrium position, so gravitational potential energy is actually lower than at equilibrium.\n\n- Wait, but the spring is stretched downward, so the mass is lower than equilibrium, meaning greater gravitational potential energy.\n\n- Wait, no, gravitational potential energy is \\( mgh \\), with \\( h \\) being height. If equilibrium is the zero point, and the mass is displaced downward, \\( h \\) decreases, so gravitational potential energy decreases.\n\n- So, at the point of release, gravitational potential energy is less than at equilibrium.\n\n- Therefore, this option is not true for the spring-mass system.\n\nFor the simple pendulum:\n\n- At the point of release, the mass is at its highest point, so gravitational potential energy is maximum.\n\nTherefore, option C is true for the simple pendulum but not for the spring-mass system.\n\nD. The maximum total energy is attained only as the sphere passes through its equilibrium position.\n\nFor both systems:\n\n- Total energy is conserved in SHM, so it doesn't change with position.\n\n- Therefore, the maximum total energy is attained at all points, not just at equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, option D is not true for either system.\n\nSo, options A and B seem to be true for both spheres, while C is only true for the pendulum, and D is false for both.\n\nBut the question asks for which of the following is true for both spheres. So, both A and B seem to fit.\n\nHowever, I need to choose the correct answer, and presumably, it's a single-choice question.\n\nWait, maybe I need to select the best answer, or the one that is unequivocally true for both.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn option A, for both systems, maximum kinetic energy is indeed at the equilibrium position.\n\nIn option B, minimum gravitational potential energy is at equilibrium for both.\n\nBut in the spring-mass system, if I consider the equilibrium position as the reference point, gravitational potential energy is zero there, and increases as the mass moves up or down.\n\nIn the pendulum, it's similar; at the lowest point, gravitational potential energy is minimum.\n\nSo both A and B seem correct.\n\nBut perhaps the question expects only one correct answer, so maybe I need to choose the one that is most directly applicable to both systems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in the spring-mass system, if I consider the total potential energy, which includes both spring and gravitational potential energies, then at equilibrium, the spring potential energy is minimum, and gravitational potential energy is at a reference point.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions gravitational potential energy.\n\nSo, option B focuses on gravitational potential energy.\n\nIn the spring-mass system, gravitational potential energy is indeed minimum at equilibrium.\n\nIn the pendulum, it's also minimum at equilibrium.\n\nSo, option B is true for both.\n\nOption A says maximum kinetic energy is at equilibrium.\n\nIn the spring-mass system, yes, because at equilibrium, the spring is neither stretched nor compressed, so the velocity is maximum.\n\nIn the pendulum, at the equilibrium position, the kinetic energy is maximum.\n\nSo, option A is also true for both.\n\nBut perhaps the question is designed to have only one correct answer, so maybe I need to look for a subtlety.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both A and B are correct, and the question allows for multiple correct options.\n\nBut in standard multiple-choice questions, especially in physics tests, often only one option is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is multiple-select, in which case I can choose multiple options.\n\nBut assuming it's single-select, I need to choose the best answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to have only one correct answer, and I need to find which one is necessarily true for both systems.\n\nLooking back, option C is only true for the pendulum, and option D is false for both.\n\nTherefore, between A and B, both seem correct.\n\nPerhaps the answer is that both A and B are correct, but since it's a single-select, I need to choose the one that encompasses the most accurate statement for both systems.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to highlight a common aspect of SHM in both systems.\n\nGiven that, I would say option A is a key feature of SHM: kinetic energy is maximum at equilibrium.\n\nOption B is also true but perhaps less fundamental to SHM.\n\nTherefore, I might lean towards A.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should confirm.\n\nIn SHM, velocity is maximum at equilibrium, leading to maximum kinetic energy.\n\nIn both systems, this holds.\n\nIn contrast, gravitational potential energy being minimum at equilibrium is also true but perhaps secondary.\n\nTherefore, option A might be the primary correct answer.\n\nHowever, since the question allows for considering both systems and their energies, perhaps both A and B are acceptable answers.\n\nBut given that it's likely a single-select question, I should choose the most appropriate one.\n\nI think option A is the most directly applicable and fundamental to SHM in both systems.\n\nTherefore, my answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
