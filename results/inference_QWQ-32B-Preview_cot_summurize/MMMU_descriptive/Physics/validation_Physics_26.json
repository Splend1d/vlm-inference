The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents velocity. The graph has several key points labeled A, B, C, and D.\n\n- Point A shows an increase in velocity.\n- Point B shows the highest velocity reached by the duck.\n- Point C shows a decrease in velocity but still positive.\n- Point D shows the velocity dropping to zero.\n\nBased on this description, the question asks at which point the duck stopped its forward motion. The correct answer is:\n\nD. D\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>Given the graph of the velocity vs. time of a duck flying due south for the winter. At what point did the duck stop its forward motion?\n\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD. D\n"
