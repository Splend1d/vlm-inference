The light ray is shown entering from the top and passing through three layers: air, glass, and water. Each medium has a specified refractive index (n):\n\n- Air: \\( n = 1.00 \\)\n- Glass: \\( n = 1.50 \\)\n- Water: \\( n = 1.33 \\)\n\nThe thickness of the glass layer is denoted by \"t.\" The light ray is incident normal to the surface of the glass layer, meaning it strikes the glass at a perpendicular angle. The question asks for the minimum thickness of the glass layer that would cause the reflected light to have an orange-like color, with a wavelength in air of 600 nm.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>A light ray is incident normal to a thin layer of glass.

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum thickness of the glass layer that causes the reflected light to have an orange-like color with a wavelength in air of 600 nm. The light is incident normally on the glass surface, which means the angle of incidence is 0 degrees.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding Normal Incidence:**\n   - When light is incident normally, the angle of incidence is 0 degrees. This simplifies the refractive index considerations because the light travels straight through without bending.\n\n2. **Refractive Indices:**\n   - Air: \\( n_{\\text{air}} = 1.00 \\)\n   - Glass: \\( n_{\\text{glass}} = 1.50 \\)\n   - Water: \\( n_{\\text{water}} = 1.33 \\)\n\n3. **Wavelength in Glass:**\n   - The wavelength of light changes when it enters a medium with a different refractive index. The wavelength in the glass (\\( \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} \\)) can be calculated using:\n     \\[\n     \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{glass}}} = \\frac{600 \\, \\text{nm}}{1.50} = 400 \\, \\text{nm}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Phase Change upon Reflection:**\n   - When light reflects from a medium with a higher refractive index to a medium with a lower refractive index, there is no phase change.\n   - When light reflects from a medium with a lower refractive index to a medium with a higher refractive index, there is a phase change of \\( \\pi \\) radians (or half a wavelength).\n\n5. **Reflections at the Air-Glass Interface:**\n   - The light ray reflects off the top surface of the glass (air to glass): no phase change.\n   - The light ray reflects off the bottom surface of the glass (glass to water): phase change of \\( \\pi \\) radians.\n\n6. **Path Difference:**\n   - The path difference between the two reflected rays is twice the thickness of the glass layer (\\( 2t \\)) because the light travels down to the bottom and back up.\n   - However, since there is a phase change upon reflection from the bottom surface, the effective path difference is:\n     \\[\n     2t - \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{glass}}}{2}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Condition for Constructive Interference:**\n   - For the reflected light to be in phase (constructive interference), the path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength in glass:\n     \\[\n     2t - \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{glass}}}{2} = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}, \\quad m = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( t \\):\n     \\[\n     2t = m \\lambda_{\\text{glass}} + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{glass}}}{2} = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\lambda_{\\text{glass}}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     t = \\left( m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{glass}}}{2}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Minimum Thickness:**\n   - The minimum thickness corresponds to \\( m = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     t_{\\text{min}} = \\left( 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\frac{400 \\, \\text{nm}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 200 \\, \\text{nm} = 100 \\, \\text{nm}\n     \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\, \\text{nm}} \\]"
