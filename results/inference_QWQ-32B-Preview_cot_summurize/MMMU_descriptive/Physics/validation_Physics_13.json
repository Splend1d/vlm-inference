The x-axis represents time in seconds (s), ranging from 0 to 4 seconds. The y-axis represents velocity in meters per second (m/s), ranging from -2 m/s to 2 m/s.\n\nThe graph consists of several segments:\n1. From 0 to 1 second, the velocity decreases linearly from 0 m/s to -2 m/s.\n2. From 1 to 2 seconds, the velocity increases linearly from -2 m/s back to 0 m/s.\n3. From 2 to 3 seconds, the velocity remains constant at 0 m/s.\n4. From 3 to 4 seconds, the velocity increases linearly from 0 m/s to 2 m/s.\n\nThe area under the curve represents the displacement of the object. The object passes through its initial position when the total displacement returns to zero.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>The graph above shows the velocity versus time for an object moving in a straight line.

Displacement is the area under the velocity-time graph.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **From 0 to 1 second:**\n   - Velocity decreases linearly from 0 m/s to -2 m/s.\n   - This forms a straight line.\n   - The area under this segment is a triangle with base 1 s and height -2 m/s.\n   - Area = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 1 * (-2) = -1 m.\n\n2. **From 1 to 2 seconds:**\n   - Velocity increases linearly from -2 m/s to 0 m/s.\n   - Again, a straight line.\n   - The area under this segment is a triangle with base 1 s and height 2 m/s.\n   - Area = 0.5 * 1 * 2 = 1 m.\n\n3. **From 2 to 3 seconds:**\n   - Velocity is constant at 0 m/s.\n   - The area under this segment is zero.\n\n4. **From 3 to 4 seconds:**\n   - Velocity increases linearly from 0 m/s to 2 m/s.\n   - A straight line.\n   - The area under this segment is a triangle with base 1 s and height 2 m/s.\n   - Area = 0.5 * 1 * 2 = 1 m.\n\nNow, let's calculate the cumulative displacement at each stage:\n\n- At t = 1 s: Displacement = -1 m\n- At t = 2 s: Displacement = -1 m + 1 m = 0 m\n- At t = 3 s: Displacement = 0 m + 0 m = 0 m\n- At t = 4 s: Displacement = 0 m + 1 m = 1 m\n\nThe object passes through its initial position when the displacement is zero.\n\nFrom the above calculations:\n\n- At t = 2 s, displacement is 0 m.\n- At t = 3 s, displacement is also 0 m.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the time after t = 0 when the object again passes through its initial position. Since at t = 0, the displacement is zero, the next time it passes through the initial position is at t = 2 s.\n\nBut let's verify if there are any other times between 2 and 3 seconds where the displacement might be zero.\n\nFrom t = 2 s to t = 3 s, the velocity is zero, so the displacement remains constant at zero until t = 3 s.\n\nTherefore, the object passes through its initial position at t = 2 s and remains there until t = 3 s.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 1 s\n\nB. Between 1 and 2 s\n\nC. 2 s\n\nD. Between 2 and 3 s\n\nThe correct answer is C. 2 s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
