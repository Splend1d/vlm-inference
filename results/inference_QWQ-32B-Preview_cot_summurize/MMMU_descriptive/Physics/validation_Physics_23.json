                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the magnitude and direction of the current in the square loop of wire when the magnetic field is decreased to zero at a constant rate over 2 seconds. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Setup\n- **Loop dimensions:** Square loop with side length \\(0.5\\) meters.\n- **Resistance:** \\(10^{-2}\\) ohms.\n- **Magnetic field:** Uniform, directed out of the page, initial magnitude \\(0.4\\) tesla.\n- **Change in magnetic field:** Decreased to zero in \\(2\\) seconds at a constant rate.\n\n### Step 2: Relevant Concepts\nWe need to use Faraday's law of induction, which states that the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.\n\nMathematically, Faraday's law is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) is the induced EMF and \\(\\Phi_B\\) is the magnetic flux.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Magnetic Flux\nThe magnetic flux \\(\\Phi_B\\) through the loop is given by:\n\\[\n\\Phi_B = B \\cdot A \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\(B\\) is the magnetic field strength.\n- \\(A\\) is the area of the loop.\n- \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the area.\n\nIn this case, the magnetic field is directed out of the page, which is perpendicular to the plane of the loop, so \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\). Therefore, \\(\\cos(0^\\circ) = 1\\), and the flux simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\Phi_B = B \\cdot A\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Area of the Loop\nThe area \\(A\\) of the square loop is:\n\\[\nA = (0.5 \\, \\text{m})^2 = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Rate of Change of Magnetic Flux\nThe magnetic field decreases from \\(0.4\\) T to \\(0\\) T in \\(2\\) seconds at a constant rate. Therefore, the rate of change of the magnetic field \\(B\\) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = \\frac{0 - 0.4 \\, \\text{T}}{2 \\, \\text{s}} = -0.2 \\, \\text{T/s}\n\\]\n\nThus, the rate of change of magnetic flux is:\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(B \\cdot A) = A \\cdot \\frac{dB}{dt} = 0.25 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\cdot (-0.2 \\, \\text{T/s}) = -0.05 \\, \\text{Wb/s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Induced EMF\nUsing Faraday's law:\n\\[\n\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = -(-0.05 \\, \\text{Wb/s}) = 0.05 \\, \\text{V}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Induced Current\nThe induced current \\(I\\) in the loop can be found using Ohm's law:\n\\[\nI = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}}{R}\n\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the resistance of the loop.\n\nGiven \\(R = 10^{-2}\\) ohms:\n\\[\nI = \\frac{0.05 \\, \\text{V}}{10^{-2} \\, \\Omega} = 5 \\, \\text{A}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Direction of the Current\nTo determine the direction of the current, we use Lenz's law, which states that the direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change that caused it.\n\nIn this case, the magnetic field is decreasing out of the page. Therefore, the induced current will flow in a direction that tries to maintain the magnetic field out of the page.\n\nUsing the right-hand rule:\n- Point your right thumb in the direction of the desired magnetic field (out of the page).\n- Curl your fingers; the direction they curl indicates the direction of the current.\n\nTo maintain the magnetic field out of the page, the current should flow counterclockwise when viewed from above.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe magnitude of the current is \\(5\\) A, and the direction is counterclockwise.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5 \\, \\text{A}, \\, \\text{counterclockwise}}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct choice is option B."
