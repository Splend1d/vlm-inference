The time intervals are labeled from 0 seconds to 5 seconds, and the corresponding positions of the ball are indicated in centimeters. Here are the details:\n\n- At 0 seconds, the ball is at the 0 cm mark.\n- At 1 second, the ball is at the 1 cm mark.\n- At 2 seconds, the ball is at the 4 cm mark.\n- At 3 seconds, the ball is at the 9 cm mark.\n- At 4 seconds, the ball is at the 16 cm mark.\n- At 5 seconds, the ball is at the 25 cm mark.\n\nThe positions of the ball increase in a quadratic manner, indicating uniform acceleration.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe diagram shows a uniformly accelerating ball. The position of the ball each second is indicated.<image 1>What is the average speed of the ball between 3 and 4 seconds?\n\nA. 3.0 cm/s\nB. 7.0 cm/s\nC. 3.5 cm/s\nD. 12.5 cm/s\n"
