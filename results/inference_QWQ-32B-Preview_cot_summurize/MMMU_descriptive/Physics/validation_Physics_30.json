                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about standing waves on a string. Let me try to understand what's going on. The description says there's a string fixed at both ends, and there are three complete wavelengths visible along the length of the string, which is 6 meters long. Each loop has a peak-to-peak distance of 2 meters, which is supposed to indicate the wavelength of the component traveling waves.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a standing wave is. A standing wave is formed when two identical waves traveling in opposite directions interfere with each other. In a string fixed at both ends, the waves reflect back and forth, creating nodes (points of no displacement) at the fixed ends and antinodes (points of maximum displacement) in between.\n\nThe problem mentions that there are three complete wavelengths visible along the string. So, if the string is 6 meters long and there are three wavelengths, then each wavelength should be 6 meters divided by 3, which is 2 meters. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the description also says that each loop has a peak-to-peak distance of 2 meters. Now, in a standing wave, a loop consists of an antinode in the middle and nodes at both ends. The distance between two consecutive nodes is half a wavelength. Similarly, the distance between two consecutive antinodes is also half a wavelength. So, the peak-to-peak distance, which is the distance between two consecutive antinodes, should be half a wavelength.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me think again. In a standing wave, the antinodes are points of maximum displacement, and nodes are points of no displacement. The distance between two consecutive nodes is indeed half a wavelength. But the distance between two consecutive antinodes should also be half a wavelength, because in one wavelength, there are two antinodes.\n\nHowever, the loop is defined as the distance between two consecutive nodes, which is half a wavelength. So, if the loop has a peak-to-peak distance of 2 meters, that would mean the distance between two consecutive antinodes is 2 meters. But since the distance between two consecutive antinodes is half a wavelength, then half a wavelength is 2 meters, which means the full wavelength is 4 meters.\n\nHmm, that seems to contradict the earlier calculation where I divided the total string length by the number of wavelengths. Let's see.\n\nThe string is 6 meters long and has three complete wavelengths. So, the wavelength \u03bb should be 6 meters divided by 3, which is 2 meters. But according to the peak-to-peak distance being 2 meters, which is half a wavelength, that would make the wavelength 4 meters.\n\nThat's confusing. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me look at the standing wave patterns. For a string fixed at both ends, the fundamental frequency has one antinode and two nodes (at the ends). The first harmonic has one wavelength, the second harmonic has two wavelengths, and so on.\n\nIn general, for a string fixed at both ends, the number of wavelengths in the standing wave is equal to the harmonic number. So, if there are three complete wavelengths, that would correspond to the third harmonic.\n\nGiven that, the total length of the string should be equal to three half-wavelengths, because each wavelength consists of two half-wavelengths (one crest and one trough).\n\nWait, no. Actually, for a string fixed at both ends, the length L is equal to n times half the wavelength, where n is the harmonic number.\n\nSo, L = n * (\u03bb / 2)\n\nIn this case, n = 3, L = 6 meters.\n\nSo, 6 = 3 * (\u03bb / 2)\n\nSolving for \u03bb:\n\n6 = (3\u03bb)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 12 = 3\u03bb\n\nThen, \u03bb = 12 / 3 = 4 meters.\n\nOkay, that matches the earlier conclusion that the wavelength is 4 meters.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that with three wavelengths in 6 meters, \u03bb should be 2 meters. But that seems incorrect based on the standing wave pattern for a string fixed at both ends.\n\nLet me double-check the standing wave patterns. For a string fixed at both ends:\n\n- Fundamental mode (first harmonic): one antinode, two nodes, wavelength \u03bb = 2L / n, where n = 1. So, \u03bb = 2L.\n\n- Second harmonic: two antinodes, three nodes, \u03bb = 2L / 2 = L.\n\n- Third harmonic: three antinodes, four nodes, \u03bb = 2L / 3.\n\nWait a minute, this seems inconsistent with my previous statement.\n\nActually, the formula is \u03bb = 2L / n, where n is the harmonic number.\n\nSo, for n = 3, \u03bb = 2 * 6 / 3 = 4 meters.\n\nYes, that matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, the wavelength is 4 meters.\n\nBut the problem mentions that each loop has a peak-to-peak distance of 2 meters. Let's see what that means.\n\nIn a standing wave, a loop is the distance between two consecutive nodes. In the third harmonic, with n = 3, there are four nodes (including the two fixed ends). So, the distance between two consecutive nodes is \u03bb / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2 meters.\n\nYes, that matches the peak-to-peak distance of 2 meters.\n\nSo, the loop length is 2 meters, which is equal to half the wavelength, and the full wavelength is 4 meters.\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of the component traveling waves is 4 meters.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 0.25 m\nB. 0.5 m\nC. 1 m\nD. 2 m\nE. 4 m\n\nThe correct answer should be E. 4 m.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the wavelength of one of the component traveling waves. In a standing wave, the component traveling waves have the same wavelength as the standing wave.\n\nSo, if the standing wave has a wavelength of 4 meters, then the component traveling waves also have a wavelength of 4 meters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E. 4 m.\n\nHowever, the earlier quick division of total length by number of wavelengths gave \u03bb = 2 meters, which was incorrect because it didn't take into account the specific properties of standing waves in a string fixed at both ends.\n\nSo, the key point here is to use the formula for standing waves in a string fixed at both ends: \u03bb = 2L / n, where n is the harmonic number.\n\nGiven L = 6 meters and n = 3, \u03bb = (2 * 6) / 3 = 12 / 3 = 4 meters.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of the number of loops: each loop is half a wavelength, so the length of one loop is \u03bb / 2. Given that the loop length is 2 meters, then \u03bb / 2 = 2 meters, so \u03bb = 4 meters.\n\nThis confirms the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
