Bubbles are forming at both electrodes, but the bubbles at electrode A are larger and more numerous compared to those at electrode B. This observation suggests that hydrogen gas is being produced at electrode A during the electrolysis process.\n\nIn the context of electrolysis of water, hydrogen gas is typically produced at the cathode, which is the electrode where reduction occurs. During the electrolysis of water, the half-reactions are as follows:\n\nAt the cathode (negative electrode):\n\n\\[2H_2O + 2e^- \\rightarrow H_2 + 2OH^-\\]\n\nAt the anode (positive electrode):\n\n\\[2H_2O \\rightarrow O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^-\\]\n\nor, in basic conditions:\n\n\\[4OH^- \\rightarrow O_2 + 2H_2O + 4e^-\\]\n\nFrom these half-reactions, hydrogen gas is produced at the cathode, and oxygen gas is produced at the anode.\n\nGiven that electrode A is producing more bubbles, which are likely hydrogen gas, it can be inferred that electrode A is the cathode in this setup.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. A\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
