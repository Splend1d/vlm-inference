                    "text": "Let's tackle this question about the significant figures in the measurement of the liquid's volume in the graduated cylinder. The volume is reported as 31.8 mL, and we have to determine two things: how many significant figures are there in this measurement, and in which digit is there uncertainty.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the rules for significant figures. Significant figures are the digits in a measurement that are known with certainty plus one digit that is uncertain. The uncertainty usually lies in the last digit reported.\n\nLooking at the measurement, 31.8 mL, let's identify the significant figures:\n\n1. The digit '3' is certain; it's in the tens place.\n\n2. The digit '1' is also certain; it's in the units place.\n\n3. The digit '8' is in the tenths place. This is likely the uncertain digit because it's the last one reported.\n\nSo, the measurement has three significant figures: 3, 1, and 8.\n\nNow, for part (a), how many significant figures are there in the measurement? Based on the above, it's three.\n\nFor part (b), in which digit is there uncertainty? That would be the last digit reported, which is '8'.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 1,2\n\nB. 2,6\n\nC. 3,8\n\nD. 4,1\n\nThe correct choice seems to be C. 3,8, as it matches the number of significant figures and the uncertain digit.\n\nHowever, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. The image description mentions that the liquid level is between 30 mL and 40 mL, with markings every milliliter and finer divisions likely representing tenths of a milliliter. The liquid level is just below the 32 mL mark but slightly above the 31.8 mL mark.\n\nThis suggests that the graduated cylinder has markings at every milliliter and subdivisions for tenths of a milliliter. Therefore, the measurement is read to the nearest tenth of a milliliter, which aligns with the reported volume of 31.8 mL.\n\nIn terms of significant figures:\n\n- The digits '3' and '1' are certain.\n\n- The digit '8' is estimated between the markings, so it's the uncertain digit.\n\nThus, the measurement has three significant figures, with uncertainty in the eighth digit if we consider the decimal places, but in terms of the digits given, it's the '8' in the tenths place.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a confusion here. In the context of significant figures, the uncertain digit is the last one reported, which is '8' in this case. But the options list digits by their position in the number.\n\nLet's consider the number 31.8:\n\n- The digit '3' is the first digit.\n\n- The digit '1' is the second digit.\n\n- The digit '8' is the third digit.\n\nSo, the uncertain digit is the third digit, which is '8'.\n\nTherefore, option C. 3,8 is correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nIs it possible that the measurement has more significant figures? For example, if the graduated cylinder allows for readings to the hundredths place, but the description says it's to the tenths place.\n\nGiven the information, it's to the tenths place, so three significant figures are appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the '3' is not significant, but in measurements, non-zero digits are always significant.\n\nSo, yes, '3', '1', and '8' are all significant, with '8' being the uncertain digit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3,8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
