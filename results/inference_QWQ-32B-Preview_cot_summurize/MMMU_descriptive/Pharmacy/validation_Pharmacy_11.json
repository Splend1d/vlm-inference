Each wave represents an electromagnetic wave. Wave (A) has the largest peaks and troughs, indicating the highest amplitude. Wave (B) has smaller peaks and troughs than wave (A) but larger than wave (C). Wave (C) has the smallest peaks and troughs, indicating the lowest amplitude.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nUse the drawings to answer the question. Each drawing represents an electromagnetic wave. <image 1>,Which wave has the highest amplitude? \n\nA. a\nB. b\nC. c\n"
