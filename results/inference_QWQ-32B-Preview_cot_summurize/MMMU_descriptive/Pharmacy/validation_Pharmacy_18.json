                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between dose and the area under the curve (AUC) for transdermal absorption via active transport and then match it to the appropriate graph.\n\nFirst, let's recall what AUC represents in pharmacokinetics. AUC is a measure of the total exposure to a drug over time and is directly related to the bioavailability and the clearance of the drug.\n\nActive transport is a process of moving molecules across a cell membrane against their concentration gradient, from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration. This process requires energy, usually in the form of ATP.\n\nTransdermal absorption refers to the process by which substances are delivered through the skin into the bloodstream. When active transport is involved in transdermal absorption, it means that the drug is being transported across the skin layers via specific transporters that require energy.\n\nNow, let's consider how the AUC relates to the dose in this scenario.\n\nIn passive diffusion, which is concentration gradient-driven and does not require energy, the AUC is typically directly proportional to the dose. This means that if you double the dose, the AUC doubles, resulting in a constant AUC/dose ratio. This would correspond to Graph 2, where the AUC/dose ratio is constant regardless of the dose.\n\nHowever, in the case of active transport, the relationship between AUC and dose can be different because active transport can be saturable. This means that at low doses, the transporters are not saturated, and increasing the dose leads to a more than proportional increase in AUC. As the dose increases further, the transporters become saturated, and the increase in AUC becomes less than proportional to the dose increase.\n\nTherefore, the AUC/dose ratio would increase at lower doses and then decrease at higher doses as the transporters become saturated.\n\nLooking back at the descriptions:\n\n1. Graph 1 shows a curve that starts at a high value and decreases as the dose increases, indicating that the AUC/dose ratio decreases with increasing dose.\n\n2. Graph 2 shows a straight horizontal line, indicating a constant AUC/dose ratio regardless of the dose.\n\n3. Graph 3 shows an upward-sloping curve, suggesting that the AUC/dose ratio increases with increasing dose.\n\nGiven that for active transport, at low doses, the AUC/dose ratio increases with dose (before saturation), and at higher doses, it decreases as the transporters become saturated, the overall trend might not be purely decreasing or increasing.\n\nHowever, among the options provided, Graph 1 shows a decreasing AUC/dose ratio with increasing dose, which could correspond to the phase after the transporters have become saturated.\n\nBut considering the entire behavior, active transport would initially show an increasing AUC/dose ratio followed by a decreasing ratio at higher doses. Since we have only three graphs, and none of them show both increasing and decreasing trends, we need to choose the one that best represents the overall trend or the trend at higher doses.\n\nGiven that at higher doses, active transport approaches passive diffusion or the transporters are saturated, leading to a decrease in the AUC/dose ratio, Graph 1 might be the most appropriate choice.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that at lower doses, the AUC/dose ratio increases due to the efficiency of active transport, Graph 3 might seem appropriate. However, since active transport saturates at higher doses, the ratio would eventually decrease.\n\nGiven the options, Graph 1 seems to be the most relevant for transdermal absorption by active transport, as it shows a decreasing AUC/dose ratio with increasing dose, which aligns with the saturation of transporters at higher doses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Graph 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
