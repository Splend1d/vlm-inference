Each graph is plotted on a grid with both x-axis and y-axis ranging from 0 to 5.\n\n- Graph (A) shows a straight line that starts at the origin (0,0) and increases linearly as it moves to the right. The line has a positive slope, indicating that as the x-value increases, the y-value also increases proportionally.\n- Graph (B) displays a horizontal line that remains constant at a y-value of 4 across the entire range of the x-axis. This indicates that the y-value does not change regardless of the x-value.\n- Graph (C) depicts a curve that starts high on the y-axis and decreases as it moves to the right. The curve is concave downward, showing that the rate of decrease in the y-value slows down as the x-value increases.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the graph with a constant slope is Graph (B), as it is a horizontal line indicating no change in the y-value regardless of the x-value.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nUse the graphs to answer Questions.A graph : may be used once, more than once, or not at all.<image 1>,Which graph is with a constant slope? \n\nA. a,b\nB. a,c\nC. b,c\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, graph (B) is the one with a constant slope. The description states that graph (B) displays a horizontal line that remains constant at a y-value of 4 across the entire range of the x-axis. This indicates that the y-value does not change regardless of the x-value, which means the slope is zero, a constant.\n\nGraph (A) is a straight line with a positive slope, meaning it has a constant rate of increase, but it's not horizontal. Graph (C) is a curve that decreases as x increases, indicating a varying slope since it's concave downward.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is graph (B), which corresponds to option C. b,c, assuming that the question is asking for the graph with a constant slope, and considering that graph (C) is not constant but varying.\n\nHowever, if the question is strictly about which graph has a constant slope, and considering that both graph (A) and graph (B) have constant slopes (graph (A) has a constant positive slope, and graph (B) has a constant zero slope), then the answer could be A. a,b.\n\nBut based on the description provided, which specifies \"the graph with a constant slope is Graph (B)\", the answer should be C. b,c, assuming there's a typo in the options and it should be C. b only, or perhaps the options are listed incorrectly.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll assume the question is to identify which graph has a constant slope, and according to the description, it's graph (B). So, if option C is \"b,c\", it might be a misprint, and the intended answer is just \"b\". But based on the options given, none directly say \"b only\". \n\nPerhaps the question is to select all graphs that have constant slopes, in which case graph (A) also has a constant slope (just not zero), so the answer would be A. a,b.\n\nGiven the information, I think the most accurate answer is A. a,b, as both have constant slopes, but according to the description, only graph (B) is mentioned as having a constant slope, likely referring to a zero slope.\n\nI need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back at the description: \"the graph with a constant slope is Graph (B)\", it seems to specify only graph (B). Therefore, if the options are A. a,b ; B. a,c ; C. b,c, then perhaps the question allows selecting multiple graphs that have constant slopes, but according to the description, only graph (B) does.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the question is to select which pair of graphs shows certain properties, but without the exact question, it's hard to be precise.\n\nGiven that, and assuming the question is to identify which graph has a constant slope, and considering that both graph (A) and graph (B) have constant slopes (graph (A) has a constant positive slope, graph (B) has a constant zero slope), the answer should be A. a,b.\n\nBut according to the description, only graph (B) is identified as having a constant slope, perhaps distinguishing it as having a zero slope, which is constant.\n\nTo resolve this, I would need the exact wording of the question. However, based on the description provided, I will go with A. a,b, assuming that both graphs have constant slopes, just different values.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
