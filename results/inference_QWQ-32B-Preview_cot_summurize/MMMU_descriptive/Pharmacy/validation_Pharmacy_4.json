                    "text": "To determine if all four samples are the same compound based on the graph and the given mathematical expression, we need to analyze the relationship between the mass of iron and the mass of oxygen in the samples.\n\nFirst, let's look at the graph titled \"Mass of Elements in Samples.\" The x-axis represents the mass of oxygen in grams, ranging from 0 to 8 g, and the y-axis represents the mass of iron in grams, ranging from 0 to 20 g. There are four data points plotted on the graph, each representing a different sample of a rust-colored substance. These data points are connected by a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between the mass of iron and the mass of oxygen in the samples.\n\nA linear relationship suggests that there is a constant ratio between the masses of iron and oxygen in the samples. This is a key characteristic of compounds, where the elements are present in fixed proportions by mass.\n\nNow, let's consider the mathematical expression provided below the graph:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{g iron}}{\\text{g oxygen}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ g iron}}{2.25 \\text{ g oxygen}} \\approx \\frac{2.3 \\text{ g iron}}{\\text{g oxygen}}\n\\]\n\nThis expression represents the ratio of the mass of iron to the mass of oxygen in the samples. The ratio is approximately 2.3 g of iron per gram of oxygen. This consistent ratio further supports the idea that the samples are of the same compound, as compounds have definite and characteristic mass ratios.\n\nTo confirm this, let's assume that the four samples have different masses of oxygen and corresponding masses of iron, but the ratio remains constant. For example:\n\n1. Sample 1: 2.25 g O, 5 g Fe \u2192 \\(\\frac{5}{2.25} \\approx 2.22\\) g Fe/g O\n\n2. Sample 2: 4.5 g O, 10 g Fe \u2192 \\(\\frac{10}{4.5} \\approx 2.22\\) g Fe/g O\n\n3. Sample 3: 6.75 g O, 15 g Fe \u2192 \\(\\frac{15}{6.75} \\approx 2.22\\) g Fe/g O\n\n4. Sample 4: 9 g O, 20 g Fe \u2192 \\(\\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22\\) g Fe/g O\n\nWait a minute, the fourth sample seems to have 9 g of oxygen and 20 g of iron, which gives a ratio of approximately 2.22 g Fe/g O, which matches the previous samples. However, according to the graph description, the x-axis ranges up to 8 g of oxygen, so perhaps the fourth sample has less than 9 g of oxygen. But for the sake of argument, let's assume it's within the range.\n\nGiven that all samples exhibit the same mass ratio of iron to oxygen, it is reasonable to conclude that they are all samples of the same compound.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. True\n\nAll four samples are the same compound because they maintain a constant mass ratio of iron to oxygen, which is a characteristic of compounds.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
