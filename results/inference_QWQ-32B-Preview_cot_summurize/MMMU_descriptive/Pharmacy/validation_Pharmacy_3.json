Here is a detailed description:\n\n1. **Membrane Phospholipid**: The starting point of the pathway is membrane phospholipid, which is represented by a wavy line.\n2. **Arachidonic Acid**: Arachidonic acid is produced from membrane phospholipid through an enzymatic process (step 1).\n3. **Prostaglandins**: Prostaglandins are produced from arachidonic acid through another enzymatic process (step 2). This step is indicated by an orange arrow pointing to a symbol representing prostaglandins.\n4. **Leukotrienes**: Leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4) are also produced from arachidonic acid through a different enzymatic process (step 3). This step is indicated by a blue arrow pointing to symbols representing leukotrienes.\n5. **Blockage**: There is a red \"X\" symbol indicating a blockage or inhibition at step 4, which is after the production of leukotrienes.\n\nBased on this description, the step responsible for causing the drug allergy when blocked by NSAIDs such as aspirin is step 4, which involves the production of leukotrienes.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nNSAIDs such as aspirin can produce a type of allergic response in some patients. Which step, if blocked, is responsible for causing this drug allergy? <image 1>\n\n"

However, when COX is inhibited, there is a compensatory increase in the production of leukotrienes through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (step 3). In some individuals, this increased production of leukotrienes can lead to allergic-like symptoms, such as wheezing, hives, and swelling, which are characteristic of a drug allergy.\n\nTherefore, the blockage at step 4, which is after the production of leukotrienes, might be interfering with the normal metabolism or signaling of leukotrienes, potentially exacerbating their allergic effects.
