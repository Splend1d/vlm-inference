                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to determine which atoms in the reactants are oxidized and which are reduced in the reaction between sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and water (H2O). Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the balanced chemical equation provided:\n\n\\[ \\text{NaBH}_4(s) + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\rightarrow 4\\text{H}_2(g) + \\text{NaBO}_2(aq) \\]\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that solid sodium borohydride reacts with liquid water to produce hydrogen gas and aqueous sodium metaborate.\n\nTo identify oxidation and reduction, we need to look at the changes in oxidation states of the atoms involved in the reaction.\n\nLet's assign oxidation states to all atoms in the reactants and products.\n\n1. **Reactants:**\n\n- **NaBH4:**\n\n- Sodium (Na): +1 (typically +1 for sodium in compounds)\n\n- Boron (B): To find the oxidation state of boron, we need to consider the charges of the other atoms. Hydrogen in borohydride is in the -1 state because borohydride is a hydride.\n\n- So, for NaBH4:\n\n- Na: +1\n\n- B: Let\u2019s denote it as x\n\n- H: -1 (since it's a hydride)\n\n- The sum of oxidation states in NaBH4 should be zero (since it's a neutral compound):\n\n- +1 + x + 4*(-1) = 0\n\n- +1 + x - 4 = 0\n\n- x - 3 = 0\n\n- x = +3\n\n- Therefore, B: +3\n\n- H: -1\n\n- **H2O:**\n\n- Hydrogen (H): +1 (in water)\n\n- Oxygen (O): -2 (in water)\n\n2. **Products:**\n\n- **H2:**\n\n- Hydrogen (H): 0 (in its elemental form)\n\n- **NaBO2:**\n\n- Sodium (Na): +1\n\n- Boron (B): Let\u2019s denote it as y\n\n- Oxygen (O): -2\n\n- The sum of oxidation states in NaBO2 should be +1 (since it's an aqueous compound, likely dissociated into ions, but for oxidation state purposes, we consider it as a neutral compound for simplicity):\n\n- +1 + y + 2*(-2) = 0\n\n- +1 + y - 4 = 0\n\n- y - 3 = 0\n\n- y = +3\n\n- Therefore, B: +3\n\n- O: -2\n\nNow, let's compare the oxidation states of the atoms in the reactants and products.\n\n- **Sodium (Na):**\n\n- Reactants: +1\n\n- Products: +1\n\n- No change in oxidation state.\n\n- **Boron (B):**\n\n- Reactants: +3\n\n- Products: +3\n\n- No change in oxidation state.\n\n- **Hydrogen (H):**\n\n- In NaBH4: -1\n\n- In H2: 0\n\n- Change from -1 to 0: oxidation (increase in oxidation state)\n\n- In H2O: +1\n\n- In H2: 0\n\n- Change from +1 to 0: reduction (decrease in oxidation state)\n\n- **Oxygen (O):**\n\n- In H2O: -2\n\n- In NaBO2: -2\n\n- No change in oxidation state.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that:\n\n- Hydrogen in NaBH4 is oxidized from -1 to 0.\n\n- Hydrogen in H2O is reduced from +1 to 0.\n\nTherefore, the atoms that are oxidized are the hydrogen atoms in NaBH4, and the atoms that are reduced are the hydrogen atoms in H2O.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. H,O\n\nB. H,Na\n\nC. H,B\n\nD. H,H\n\nThe correct answer should indicate that hydrogen is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. However, from our analysis, hydrogen in H2O is reduced, not oxygen.\n\nWait a minute, in our analysis, hydrogen in H2O is reduced from +1 to 0, and hydrogen in NaBH4 is oxidized from -1 to 0. But the options seem to be pairing which atoms are oxidized and which are reduced.\n\nOption A says H,O which would mean hydrogen is oxidized and oxygen is reduced.\n\nOption B says H,Na which would mean hydrogen is oxidized and sodium is reduced.\n\nOption C says H,B which would mean hydrogen is oxidized and boron is reduced.\n\nOption D says H,H which would mean hydrogen is oxidized and hydrogen is reduced.\n\nFrom our analysis, hydrogen in NaBH4 is oxidized, and hydrogen in H2O is reduced. So, it's hydrogen being both oxidized and reduced.\n\nBut according to the options, option D says H,H, which could mean hydrogen is both oxidized and reduced.\n\nHowever, in the context of the question asking which atoms are oxidized and which are reduced, it might be better to choose option D, as it indicates that hydrogen atoms are both oxidized and reduced.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that hydrogen from NaBH4 is oxidized and hydrogen from H2O is reduced, then the pairing would be hydrogen from NaBH4 oxidized and hydrogen from H2O reduced.\n\nBut since the options don't specify the source of hydrogen, just H,O or H,Na etc., it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven the options, D. H,H seems to be the most appropriate choice, as it acknowledges that hydrogen atoms are both oxidized and reduced in the reaction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
