The molecule consists of five carbon atoms in a chain. The first carbon atom (from left to right) is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The second carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, forming a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms. The third carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, which is part of the double bond with the second carbon atom. The fourth carbon atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. The fifth carbon atom is bonded to three hydrogen atoms. The oxygen atom is double-bonded to the third carbon atom, indicating a ketone functional group.\n\nBased on this description, the IUPAC name for the compound is:\n\nC. 3-pentanone\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nGive the IUPAC name for the compound.<image 1>\n\nA. cyclopentane\nB. 2-methylpropan-2-ol\nC. 3-pentanone\n"

In IUPAC nomenclature, the parent chain is named according to the number of carbon atoms, which in this case is pentane (five carbons). The ketone functional group is indicated by changing the suffix to \"-anone,\" and the position of the ketone is specified by the number of the carbon atom where it is located, which is the third carbon in this structure. Therefore, the name is 3-pentanone.\n\nOption A, cyclopentane, refers to a five-membered ring of carbon atoms, which does not match the linear chain described here. Option B, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, describes a four-carbon chain with a methyl group on the second carbon and an alcohol group also on the second carbon, which again does not correspond to the structure provided.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. 3-pentanone."
