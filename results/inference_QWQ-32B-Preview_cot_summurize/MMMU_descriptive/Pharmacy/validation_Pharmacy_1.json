The balanced equation tells us:\n\n- 4 moles of NH\u2083 react with 3 moles of O\u2082 to produce 2 moles of N\u2082 and 6 moles of H\u2082O.\n\nThis means that the reaction consumes NH\u2083 and O\u2082 in a 4:3 molar ratio and produces N\u2082 and H\u2082O in a 2:6 (or 1:3) molar ratio.\n\nGiven that we have 3.0 mol of O\u2082, we can use the stoichiometric ratios to find the corresponding moles of NH\u2083, N\u2082, and H\u2082O.\n\nFirst, find the moles of NH\u2083 that react with 3.0 mol of O\u2082.\n\nFrom the balanced equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4 \\text{ mol NH}_3}{3 \\text{ mol O}_2} = \\frac{x}{3.0 \\text{ mol O}_2} \\]\n\nSolving for x:\n\n\\[ x = 4.0 \\text{ mol NH}_3 \\]\n\nSo, 4.0 mol of NH\u2083 react with 3.0 mol of O\u2082.\n\nNext, find the moles of N\u2082 produced.\n\nFrom the balanced equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{2 \\text{ mol N}_2}{3 \\text{ mol O}_2} = \\frac{y}{3.0 \\text{ mol O}_2} \\]\n\nSolving for y:\n\n\\[ y = 2.0 \\text{ mol N}_2 \\]\n\nSo, 2.0 mol of N\u2082 are produced.\n\nFinally, find the moles of H\u2082O produced.\n\nFrom the balanced equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{6 \\text{ mol H}_2\\text{O}}{3 \\text{ mol O}_2} = \\frac{z}{3.0 \\text{ mol O}_2} \\]\n\nSolving for z:\n\n\\[ z = 6.0 \\text{ mol H}_2\\text{O} \\]\n\nSo, 6.0 mol of H\u2082O are produced.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 4.0 mol of NH3,2.0 mol of N2,6.0 mol of H2O\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
