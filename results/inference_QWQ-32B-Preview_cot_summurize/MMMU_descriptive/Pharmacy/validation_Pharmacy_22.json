The order with respect to reactant A is 2, and the order with respect to reactant B is 1.\n\nTo elaborate, the method used to determine the reaction orders involves comparing the rates of reaction under different concentrations of the reactants. The general rate law for the reaction A + B \u2192 C can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ \\text{rate} = k [A]^m [B]^n \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( k \\) is the rate constant,\n- \\( m \\) is the order with respect to reactant A,\n- \\( n \\) is the order with respect to reactant B.\n\nFrom the data table:\n\n| [A] (M) | [B] (M) | Rate (M/s) |\n|---------|---------|------------|\n| 0.08    | 0.06    | 0.012      |\n| 0.08    | 0.03    | 0.006      |\n| 0.04    | 0.06    | 0.003      |\n\nTo find the order with respect to A (\\( m \\)), we need to find how the rate changes when [A] changes, while keeping [B] constant. Comparing rows 1 and 3, [B] is constant at 0.06 M, and [A] changes from 0.08 M to 0.04 M, which is a factor of 2 decrease. The rate changes from 0.012 M/s to 0.003 M/s, which is a factor of 4 decrease.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{[A]_1}{[A]_3} = \\frac{0.08}{0.04} = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_1}{R_3} = \\frac{0.012}{0.003} = 4 \\]\n\nAssuming the rate law, we have:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{[A]_1}{[A]_3} \\right)^m = \\frac{R_1}{R_3} \\]\n\n\\[ 2^m = 4 \\]\n\n\\[ m = 2 \\]\n\nSimilarly, to find the order with respect to B (\\( n \\)), we need to see how the rate changes when [B] changes, while keeping [A] constant. Comparing rows 1 and 2, [A] is constant at 0.08 M, and [B] changes from 0.06 M to 0.03 M, which is a factor of 2 decrease. The rate changes from 0.012 M/s to 0.006 M/s, which is a factor of 2 decrease.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{[B]_1}{[B]_2} = \\frac{0.06}{0.03} = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{0.012}{0.006} = 2 \\]\n\nAgain, assuming the rate law:\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{[B]_1}{[B]_2} \\right)^n = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} \\]\n\n\\[ 2^n = 2 \\]\n\n\\[ n = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the reaction is second order with respect to A and first order with respect to B, making the overall rate law:\n\n\\[ \\text{rate} = k [A]^2 [B] \\]\n\nHence, the correct choice is A. 2,1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A. \\ 2,1} \\]"
