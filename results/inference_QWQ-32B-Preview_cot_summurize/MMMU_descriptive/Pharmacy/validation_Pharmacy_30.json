                    "text": "I've got this Nutrition Facts label to work with, and there are a few questions to answer based on it. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\nFirst, I need to construct a conversion factor that has units of calories per gram using the data given for fat. Looking at the label, for a serving size of \u00be cup (30g), the calories from fat are 15 without milk and 20 with milk. The total fat is 2g without milk and, I assume, a bit more with milk, but it's not specified separately. Hmm, maybe I should consider the values without milk for this calculation, as the question might be focusing on the cereal itself.\n\nSo, calories from fat without milk are 15 calories, and total fat is 2g. To find calories per gram of fat, I can divide calories from fat by the grams of fat:\n\ncalories per gram = calories from fat / grams of fat = 15 cal / 2g = 7.5 cal/g\n\nWait, but the options have 7.2 cal/g, 7.4 cal/g, and 7.5 cal/g. Maybe I need to consider the values with milk. Let's see:\n\nWith milk, calories from fat are 20 cal, and total fat is likely to be higher, but it's not specified. Maybe the fat content increases with added milk. The milk is \u00bd cup of skim milk, which probably has less fat, but still, it's not clear. Maybe I should stick with the values without milk for the cereal alone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects me to use the total calories and total mass for the conversion factor. Let's see:\n\nTotal calories without milk are 120 cal, and the serving size is 30g. So, calories per gram would be:\n\n120 cal / 30g = 4 cal/g\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, maybe it's specifically for fat. Oh, I think I need to use the calories from fat and the grams of fat, not the total calories and total mass.\n\nSo, going back to 15 cal from fat / 2g fat = 7.5 cal/g. That matches option D.\n\nNext, calculate the mass in kilograms for 20 servings of the food. Each serving is 30g, so:\n\n20 servings * 30g/serving = 600g\n\nTo convert grams to kilograms:\n\n600g * (1 kg / 1000g) = 0.6 kg\n\nThat matches option D again.\n\nThen, calculate the mass of protein in micrograms for one serving of the food. The label shows 2g of protein per serving. To convert grams to micrograms:\n\n2g * (1,000,000 \u03bcg / 1g) = 2,000,000 \u03bcg\n\nBut the options have 2*10^3 \u03bcg, 2*10^4 \u03bcg, 2*10^5 \u03bcg, and 2*10^6 \u03bcg. 2,000,000 \u03bcg is 2*10^6 \u03bcg, which is option D again.\n\nFinally, determine the correct number of significant figures for the answer in part a. In part a, we calculated 15 cal / 2g = 7.5 cal/g. The number 15 has two significant figures, and 2 has one significant figure. When dividing, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the least precise measurement, which is one significant figure.\n\nSo, the answer should be reported as 8 cal/g, but the options have 7.2, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.5 with significant figures of 1. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the options are mislabeled. But according to the rules, it should be one significant figure.\n\nGiven that, option D has 7.5 cal/g with 1 significant figure, which would be reported as 8 cal/g, but it's listed as 7.5. Maybe the significant figures part is a separate choice?\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 7.2 Calories/g;0.3 kg;2*10^3 \u03bcg;1\n\nB. 7.2 Calories/g;0.4 kg;2*10^4 \u03bcg;1\n\nC. 7.4 Calories/g;0.5 kg;2*10^5 \u03bcg;1\n\nD. 7.5 Calories/g;0.6 kg;2*10^6 \u03bcg;1\n\nMy calculations match option D for parts a, b, and c. For part d, the significant figures should be 1, which is listed in option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
