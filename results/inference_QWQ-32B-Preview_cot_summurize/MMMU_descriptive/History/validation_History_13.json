                    "text": "I'm looking at this map of Europe during the Cold War, and it's showing how Germany was divided into East and West Germany. The map has different colors for East and West Germany, with East being a darker shade and West a lighter one. It also marks the capitals: Bonn for West Germany and Berlin for East Germany. There are other countries around them like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and so on, plus some bigger players like France, the Soviet Union, and others.\n\nNow, the question is asking which statement is NOT true regarding the divided Germany shown on the map. The options are:\n\nA. The capital of West Germany was located in East Germany\n\nB. West Germany experienced a postwar economic miracle\n\nC. Both East Germany and West Germany were allowed to rearm\n\nD. France had occupied West Germany\n\nFirst, looking at option A: \"The capital of West Germany was located in East Germany.\" According to the map, the capital of West Germany is Bonn, which is within the borders of West Germany, not East Germany. So, this statement seems false, which might make it the correct answer since the question is asking for what is NOT true.\n\nOption B: \"West Germany experienced a postwar economic miracle.\" I know that West Germany did have a period of rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, often referred to as the \"Wirtschaftswunder,\" which means \"economic miracle.\" So, this statement is true.\n\nOption C: \"Both East Germany and West Germany were allowed to rearm.\" After World War II, there were different approaches to rearmament. West Germany was allowed to rearm under certain conditions, like joining NATO, as a way to integrate it into Western defense structures. East Germany also had its own army, but it was part of the Warsaw Pact. So, both did rearm, but under different circumstances. So, this statement is true.\n\nOption D: \"France had occupied West Germany.\" After World War II, France did occupy a part of West Germany as part of the occupation zones assigned to the Allied powers. France controlled the southwestern part of Germany, which later became part of West Germany. So, this statement is true.\n\nGiven that, the statement that is NOT true is option A, because the capital of West Germany, Bonn, was located within West Germany, not East Germany.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's make sure that no other option could be false. Option B is definitely true; West Germany's economic recovery was remarkable. Option C is a bit more nuanced, but both Germanies did have their own armed forces, so it's true. Option D is true because France did occupy part of West Germany after the war.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The capital of West Germany was located in East Germany, which is false.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
