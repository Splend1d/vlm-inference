The cartoon depicts Andrew Carnegie in two contrasting roles. On one side, Carnegie is shown holding a notice that reads \"Wages Reduced 20 per cent,\" symbolizing his role as a ruthless employer who reduces wages. On the other side, Carnegie is depicted giving away money, specifically $5000, representing his philanthropic efforts. The cartoon highlights the duality of Carnegie's character, showing how he could simultaneously exploit workers while also engaging in charitable acts. The caption at the bottom of the cartoon reads: \"As the tight-fisted employer he reduces wages that he may play philanthropist and give away libraries, etc.\" This suggests that Carnegie's philanthropy was funded by the exploitation of his workers.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Which of the following was another common criticism of Andrew Carnegie?\n\nA. As an immigrant, Carnegie had no right to own controlling interests in major American industries.\nB. Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\nC. Carnegie was seen as the epitome of American success, but he was not even the richest man in America.\nD. Too much of Carnegie's philanthropic efforts were concentrated on his homeland of Scotland, denying Americans the benefits of his charity.\n"

                    "text": "Let's see. I have this political cartoon from 1892 that shows Andrew Carnegie in two different roles. On one side, he's reducing wages by 20%, and on the other side, he's giving away money for libraries and such. The caption suggests that his philanthropy is funded by exploiting his workers. So, it's highlighting the contrast between his role as a tough employer and a generous philanthropist.\n\nNow, the question is asking for another common criticism of Andrew Carnegie. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. As an immigrant, Carnegie had no right to own controlling interests in major American industries.\n\nB. Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\n\nC. Carnegie was seen as the epitome of American success, but he was not even the richest man in America.\n\nD. Too much of Carnegie's philanthropic efforts were concentrated on his homeland of Scotland, denying Americans the benefits of his charity.\n\nFirst, I know that Carnegie was a Scottish-American, so he was an immigrant. But I don't recall if there was a significant criticism about his ownership of American industries based on his immigrant status. Maybe, but it doesn't seem like the most common criticism.\n\nOption B mentions that Carnegie did nothing to prevent violence against workers. I remember something about the Homestead Strike in 1892, which was around the same time this cartoon was published. During the Homestead Strike, there was violence between the workers and the security agents hired by Carnegie. So, this seems like a plausible criticism.\n\nOption C says that Carnegie was seen as the epitome of American success, but he wasn't even the richest man in America. I think at that time, John D. Rockefeller was richer than Carnegie. But I don't recall if this was a common criticism of Carnegie. It seems more like a factual statement rather than a criticism.\n\nOption D mentions that Carnegie's philanthropy was focused too much on Scotland, denying Americans the benefits. I know that Carnegie did donate a significant amount to Scotland, especially for libraries and other cultural institutions. But I'm not sure if this was a common criticism.\n\nConsidering all options, I think option B is the most likely correct answer. The Homestead Strike was a major event where Carnegie's company brought in strikebreakers and there was violence. Carnegie was often criticized for his role in that situation, for not addressing the workers' grievances and for using force to suppress the strike.\n\nAlso, the cartoon seems to be criticizing Carnegie for reducing wages while giving away money, which aligns with the idea that he wasn't concerned about his workers' well-being.\n\nSo, I would go with option B: Carnegie did nothing to prevent the use of violence against his workers when they asked for better wages and working conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
