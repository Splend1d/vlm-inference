The routes are represented by thin lines, with darker shaded areas indicating more heavily traveled routes. The map includes a compass rose and a legend indicating the source of the data as CLIWOC (www.cassiodorus.com/cliwoc).\n\nThe map shows extensive trade routes across various oceans and continents. Notable features include:\n\n1. **Atlantic Ocean**: There are numerous routes crossing the Atlantic, connecting Europe to North America and South America.\n2. **Indian Ocean**: Several routes are visible in the Indian Ocean, connecting Europe to Asia and Africa.\n3. **Pacific Ocean**: There are fewer routes in the Pacific Ocean compared to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, but some routes are still present, particularly around the western coast of South America and the eastern coast of Asia.\n4. **West Coast of Africa**: Routes are visible along the west coast of Africa, indicating that British ships did sail along this region.\n\nBased on the description, the conclusion that can be drawn is:\n\n**C. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.**\n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that there are fewer routes in the Pacific Ocean compared to other regions, suggesting less frequent travel in that area.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> The map above was constructed by drawing a thin line for each voyage recorded in British trade ship logs between 1750 and 1800. As a result, the darker shaded areas record the most heavily traveled routes. Which of the following conclusions could be drawn from the evidence provided by this map?\n\nA. British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n"

The map includes routes across the Atlantic Ocean, connecting Europe to North and South America, routes in the Indian Ocean connecting Europe to Asia and Africa, and fewer routes in the Pacific Ocean, particularly around the western coast of South America and the eastern coast of Asia. Additionally, there are routes along the west coast of Africa.\n\nThe question asks which conclusion can be drawn from this map regarding where British ships did not sail during this period. The options are:\n\nA. British ships did not sail along the west coast of Africa during this period.\n\nB. British ships did not sail the Atlantic Ocean during this period.\n\nC. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.\n\nD. British ships did not sail in the Indian Ocean during this period.\n\nGiven the information in the description:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because the map shows routes along the west coast of Africa.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because there are numerous routes crossing the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because there are routes in the Indian Ocean.\n\n- Option C is the only one that aligns with the description, which states that there are fewer routes in the Pacific Ocean compared to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, suggesting less frequent travel in that area.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence provided by this map is:\n\n**C. British ships did not sail the Pacific Ocean during this period.**\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the map shows some routes in the Pacific Ocean, but they are fewer compared to other regions. The conclusion might be better phrased as \"British ships sailed less frequently in the Pacific Ocean during this period\" rather than not at all, but given the options provided, C is the most appropriate choice."
