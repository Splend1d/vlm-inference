The route starts from Lisbon, Portugal, and travels southward along the western coast of Africa, passing by Cape Verde Islands and Natal. It then continues eastward across the Indian Ocean, stopping at Malindi before reaching Calicut in India. The map highlights the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, with Africa and parts of Europe and Asia visible. The title of the map reads \"Path of a late fifteenth century voyage.\"\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Which of the following conclusions about the early sixteenth century is most directly supported by the map?\n\nA.

It's from the late fifteenth century. The question is asking which conclusion about the early sixteenth century is most directly supported by this map.\n\nOption A says Portugal was primarily interested in exploration of the African and Asian coasts. Well, the map does show a Portuguese voyage to Africa and Asia, but \"primarily interested\" might be a bit too strong. Maybe they were interested in exploring these coasts, but was it their primary interest? I'm not sure if this map alone can support that.\n\nOption B says Vasco da Gama was the first European to embark on intercontinental travel by sea. Hmm, I know Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who went to India, but was he really the first European to travel by sea to another continent? I think there were Vikings who reached North America centuries earlier, and maybe other explorers as well. So, this seems unlikely.\n\nOption C says European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities. That sounds plausible. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, European countries were indeed looking to expand their trade and find new economic opportunities, especially after the Ottoman Empire blocked land routes to Asia. A voyage like this one to India could be part of that trend.\n\nOption D says Europeans began mass migrations to distant lands in the early sixteenth century. Mass migrations? Well, exploration often leads to colonization, but \"mass migrations\" might be exaggerating. Also, the map shows a single voyage, not necessarily indicating mass migrations.\n\nConsidering all this, option C seems the most directly supported by the map. The voyage from Portugal to India suggests that Europeans were looking beyond their own continent for economic gains, which aligns with the age of exploration and the search for new trade routes.\n\nSo, I think the answer is C. European nations began to look outward for economic opportunities.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
