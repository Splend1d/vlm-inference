The table is divided into two columns: \"Country\" and \"Date Joined.\" Here are the details:\n\n- Austria: 1995\n- Belgium: 1957\n- Bulgaria: 2007\n- Croatia: 2013\n- Cyprus: 2004\n- Czech Republic: 2004\n- Denmark: 1973\n- Estonia: 2004\n- Finland: 1995\n- France: 1957\n- Germany: 1957\n- Greece: 1981\n- Hungary: 2004\n- Ireland: 1973\n- Italy: 1957\n- Latvia: 2004\n- Lithuania: 2004\n- Luxembourg: 1957\n- Malta: 2004\n- Netherlands: 1957\n- Poland: 2004\n- Portugal: 1986\n- Romania: 2007\n- Slovakia: 2004\n- Slovenia: 2004\n- Spain: 1986\n- Sweden: 1995\n- United Kingdom: 1973\n\nThe table indicates that several Eastern European countries, including Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, joined the EU between 2004 and 2013. In contrast, many Western European countries joined earlier, with some joining as early as 1957.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> The table shows when each member nation joined the European Union (EU), which was created to reduce trade barriers among member nations. The 1993 Maastricht Treaty founded the EU from its predecessor organization, the European Communities. Which of the following best explains why countries of Eastern Europe were admitted later than other European Union members?\n\nA. Support of these countries' agrarian populations for protectionist trade policies\nB. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War\nC. Resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries\nD. The greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars\n"

The question is asking why Eastern European countries were admitted later than other EU members.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Support of these countries' agrarian populations for protectionist trade policies.\n\nThis option suggests that Eastern European countries had populations that favored protectionist trade policies, which might have delayed their entry into the EU, an organization aimed at reducing trade barriers. However, it's unlikely that agrarian populations' preferences alone would determine a country's admission to the EU. The EU's expansion has been more about political and economic integration, and while internal policies can be a factor, this seems like a less likely primary reason for the delayed admission of Eastern European countries.\n\nB. Control of those countries by the Soviet Union until the end of the Cold War.\n\nThis option points to the political control exerted by the Soviet Union over Eastern European countries during the Cold War era. The Soviet Union maintained a sphere of influence over these nations, which were part of the Eastern Bloc. This political domination would have made it impossible for these countries to join a Western-led organization like the EU. It wasn't until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 that these countries gained independence and started the process of moving towards integration with Western Europe, including applying for EU membership. This seems like a very plausible reason for their later admission.\n\nC. Resistance to the West by fascist governments in those countries.\n\nThis option suggests that fascist governments in Eastern European countries resisted joining the EU. However, it's important to note that while some Eastern European countries did have authoritarian or communist governments during the Cold War, labeling them all as fascist may not be accurate. Moreover, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, many of these countries underwent democratic transitions and sought to align themselves with Western Europe, including joining the EU. Therefore, this seems less likely as the primary reason for their later admission.\n\nD. The greater effect on those countries of the Great Depression and world wars.\n\nThis option proposes that Eastern European countries were more severely affected by the Great Depression and world wars, which might have delayed their economic recovery and thus their ability to join the EU. While it's true that these events had profound impacts on all of Europe, including Eastern Europe, it doesn't fully explain why Eastern European countries joined the EU decades after the initial formation of the EU's predecessor, the European Communities, in 1957. The political context of the Cold War, as mentioned in option B, seems more directly relevant to the timing of their admission.\n\nConsidering these points, option B seems to be the most accurate explanation for why Eastern European countries were admitted to the EU later than other member nations. The control exerted by the Soviet Union over these countries until the end of the Cold War prevented them from joining a Western-led organization like the EU until they gained independence and began transitioning to democratic and market economies in the 1990s.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
