The diagram is structured like a tree with branches extending from a central trunk labeled \"AFRICA.\" \n\nFrom the main trunk, there are two major branches:\n1. **AFRICAN GROUPS**: This branch includes \"other Africans,\" \"Khoisans (Bushmen),\" and \"Ethiopians.\"\n2. **OUT OF AFRICA GROUPS**: This branch further divides into several sub-branches, each representing different ethnic groups:\n   - Europeans, West Asians, Berbers\n   - Indians\n   - Lapps\n   - East Asians, Inuit\n   - Amerindians\n   - Southeast Asians\n   - Oceanians\n   - New Guineans\n   - Australians\n\nThe diagram suggests that all ethnic groups, both African and those that migrated out of Africa, have their origins traced back to Africa.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nAccording to the chart, what is the geographic origin of all races and ethnic groups in the world today? <image 1>\n\nA.
