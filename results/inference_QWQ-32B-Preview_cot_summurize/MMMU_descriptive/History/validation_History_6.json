                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the correct answer is A. The Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, while Marx envisioned it as an international movement.\n\nLet's break this down step by step. First, we need to understand the context of the image and how it relates to the options given.\n\nThe image is a World War II era poster from the Soviet Union. It shows young men and women in military uniforms, marching forward with rifles, and the background has the year \"1917\" and text encouraging them to defend their freedom, motherland, and honor won by their fathers. This suggests a strong sense of national pride and defense, which aligns with nationalist fervor.\n\nNow, let's recall Marx's view of communism. According to Marx and Engels in \"The Communist Manifesto,\" communism is an international movement. They famously stated, \"Workers of the world, unite!\" implying that the proletarian revolution should be a global endeavor, transcending national boundaries.\n\nOption A suggests that the Soviet Union saw communism as developing most effectively within a single country, whereas Marx envisioned it as international. This seems plausible because the Soviet Union, after the Russian Revolution in 1917, established a communist state within its own borders and promoted the idea of building socialism in one country. This was especially emphasized by Stalin in the 1920s and 1930s, who argued that the Soviet Union could build socialism without waiting for worldwide revolutions.\n\nOption B suggests that the Soviet Union saw communism as primarily a militaristic philosophy, while Marx argued for a peaceful approach. This isn't accurate because Marx and Engels recognized that the proletarian revolution might involve violence, especially in response to the resistance of the bourgeoisie. Moreover, the Soviet Union's approach was not solely militaristic; it also focused on economic development and industrialization.\n\nOption C states that the Soviet Union saw communism as being fully realized by 1917, while Marx predicted the proletariat revolt to occur much later. This is incorrect because, although the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917, the Soviet Union did not consider communism to be fully realized by that time. In fact, the period after the revolution was focused on building socialism, with the goal of eventually reaching communism. Marx did not specify exact timelines for the proletarian revolution; he believed it would occur when the conditions were ripe.\n\nOption D suggests that the Soviet Union saw communism as a theoretical concept, while Marx attempted to implement a communist society. This is also inaccurate because Marx and Engels were both theorists and activists who sought to influence practical political movements. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, implemented communism in practice, albeit in a form that Marx might not have recognized or approved.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A, as it accurately captures a key contrast between the Soviet Union's approach to communism and Marx's original vision: the Soviet Union's focus on developing communism within a single nation-state, while Marx saw communism as an international movement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
