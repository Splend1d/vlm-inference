The cartoon depicts an octopus with multiple tentacles, each labeled with the names of different countries or regions. The head of the octopus is labeled \"England,\" indicating that it represents British influence or imperialism. The tentacles extend to various parts of the world, including Egypt, India, Canada, Jamaica, Malta, Gibraltar, Cape Colony, and other locations. The overall theme suggests that England has extensive control or influence over these regions, symbolized by the octopus's tentacles reaching out to them.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> A similar cartoon could be made about each of the following countries prior to 1890 EXCEPT\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about a political cartoon from 1882 called \"The Devilfish in Egyptian Waters.\" It's an octopus representing England, with its tentacles reaching out to various countries, showing British influence or imperialism. The question is asking which country before 1890 couldn't have a similar cartoon made about it, implying that the other countries did have significant imperialistic or influential activities by that time.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Netherlands\n\nB. France\n\nC. Belgium\n\nD. Germany\n\nOkay, let's think about each one.\n\nStarting with the Netherlands. The Netherlands had a long history of colonialism, especially in the East Indies, which is now Indonesia. They also had colonies in Africa and South America. So, by 1890, the Netherlands certainly had extensive overseas territories, which could be represented by an octopus with many tentacles.\n\nNext, France. France was a major colonial power, with colonies in North Africa, Southeast Asia, and various parts of Africa and the Caribbean. By 1890, France had a vast colonial empire, so definitely, a similar cartoon could be made about France.\n\nBelgium was also getting into the colonial game by the late 19th century. King Leopold II personally owned and exploited the Congo Free State, which was a massive territory in central Africa. So, Belgium, especially under Leopold II, had significant colonial interests by 1890.\n\nLastly, Germany. Germany was a bit of a latecomer to colonialism. While there were some German trading posts and colonies established in the late 19th century, particularly after the scramble for Africa in the 1880s, its colonial empire wasn't as extensive as those of Britain, France, or even Belgium by 1890.\n\nSo, comparing all these, Germany had the least extensive colonial holdings by 1890. Britain, France, and the Netherlands had long histories of colonialism with vast empires, and Belgium was actively expanding its colonial presence through Leopold II's acquisitions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. Germany, as it didn't have as extensive a colonial reach by 1890 compared to the others.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
