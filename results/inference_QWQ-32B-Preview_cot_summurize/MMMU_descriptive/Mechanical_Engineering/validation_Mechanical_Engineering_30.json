The top row shows four different views of an object, labeled from (a) to (d). Each view depicts a rectangular shape with various cutouts or openings in the middle. The bottom row shows a single diagram with a circular opening in the center of a rectangular shape, viewed from a different angle.\n\nTo determine the correct left view, we need to match the perspective shown in the bottom row with one of the views in the top row. The bottom row shows a circular opening from a side view, which corresponds to the view labeled (c) in the top row. Therefore, the correct left view is (c).\n\nBased on this description, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. C\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nSelect the correct left view()<image 1>\n\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD. D\n"
