Let's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Draw the Block Diagram and Derive the Transfer Function\n\nFirst, we need to understand the block diagram and derive the closed-loop transfer function C(s)/R(s).\n\nGiven the description:\n\n1. **Input Signal (R(s))**\n2. **Summing Junction 1**: Combines R(s) and -C(s)\n3. **Gain Block (K1)**\n4. **Summing Junction 2**: Combines output of K1 and -feedback from derivative block (K2s)\n5. **Transfer Function Block**: \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n6. **Derivative Block (K2s)**\n\nLet's denote the signals:\n\n- Let\u2019s call the output of Summing Junction 1: E1(s)\n- Output of K1 block: K1 * E1(s)\n- Let\u2019s call the output of Summing Junction 2: E2(s)\n- Output of Transfer Function Block: C(s)\n\nFrom the block diagram:\n\n- E1(s) = R(s) - C(s)\n- Input to Summing Junction 2: K1 * E1(s) - K2s * C(s)\n- E2(s) = K1 * E1(s) - K2s * C(s)\n- C(s) = E2(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nNow, substitute E1(s):\n\nE1(s) = R(s) - C(s)\n\nSo,\n\nE2(s) = K1 * (R(s) - C(s)) - K2s * C(s)\n\nC(s) = [K1 * R(s) - (K1 + K2s) * C(s)] * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nNow, solve for C(s):\n\nC(s) = [K1 * R(s) - (K1 + K2s) * C(s)] * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by s(s+1):\n\ns(s+1) C(s) = K1 * R(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\) - (K1 + K2s) * C(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\) * s(s+1)\n\nSimplify:\n\ns(s+1) C(s) = K1 * R(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\) - 50 (K1 + K2s) C(s)\n\nBring all terms involving C(s) to one side:\n\ns(s+1) C(s) + 50 (K1 + K2s) C(s) = K1 * R(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nFactor C(s):\n\nC(s) [s(s+1) + 50 K1 + 50 K2 s] = K1 * R(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\nC(s) [s^2 + s + 50 K1 + 50 K2 s] = K1 * R(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC(s) [s^2 + (1 + 50 K2) s + 50 K1] = K1 * R(s) * \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\nNow, solve for C(s)/R(s):\n\n\\(\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}\\) = \\(\\frac{K1 * 50}{s(s+1) [s^2 + (1 + 50 K2) s + 50 K1]}\\)\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the concept of block diagram reduction to find the overall transfer function.\n\n### Step 2: Block Diagram Reduction\n\nLet's try to reduce the block diagram step by step.\n\n1. **Forward Path:**\n\n   - From R(s) to E1(s): R(s) - C(s)\n   - From E1(s) to Summing Junction 2: K1 * E1(s)\n   - From Summing Junction 2 to C(s): \\(\\frac{50}{s(s+1)}\\)\n\n2. **Feedback Path:**\n\n   - From C(s) to Summing Junction 1: -C(s)\n   - From C(s) to Summing Junction 2: -K2s * C(s)\n\nThis is a bit tricky due to the two feedback loops. Let's consider the overall transfer function.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume the system can be represented as:\n\nC(s) = [forward transfer function] * R(s) - [feedback transfer functions] * C(s)\n\nThen, solve for C(s)/R(s).\n\n### Step 3: Assume a Structure and Solve\n\nGiven the complexity, let's assume the closed-loop transfer function has a standard second-order form and relate the parameters to the desired peak time and settling time.\n\nThe standard second-order transfer function is:\n\n\\(\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}\\) = \\(\\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2}\\)\n\nGiven the desired peak time \\( t_p = 1 \\) second and settling time \\( t_s = 2 \\) seconds, we can find \\(\\zeta\\) and \\(\\omega_n\\).\n\n### Step 4: Relate Peak Time and Settling Time to Damping Ratio and Natural Frequency\n\nFor a second-order system:\n\n- Peak time: \\( t_p = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}} \\)\n- Settling time: \\( t_s = \\frac{4}{\\zeta \\omega_n} \\) (for 2% criterion)\n\nGiven \\( t_p = 1 \\) second and \\( t_s = 2 \\) seconds, we can set up equations to solve for \\(\\zeta\\) and \\(\\omega_n\\).\n\nFirst, from settling time:\n\n\\( t_s = \\frac{4}{\\zeta \\omega_n} = 2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\zeta \\omega_n = 2 \\) \u2192 Equation (1)\n\nFrom peak time:\n\n\\( t_p = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2}} = 1 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} = \\pi \\) \u2192 Equation (2)\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( \\zeta \\omega_n = 2 \\)\n2. \\( \\omega_n \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} = \\pi \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations for \\(\\zeta\\) and \\(\\omega_n\\).\n\nFrom Equation (1):\n\n\\( \\omega_n = \\frac{2}{\\zeta} \\)\n\nSubstitute into Equation (2):\n\n\\( \\frac{2}{\\zeta} \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} = \\pi \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(\\zeta\\):\n\n\\( 2 \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} = \\pi \\zeta \\)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\( 4 (1 - \\zeta^2) = \\pi^2 \\zeta^2 \\)\n\n\\( 4 - 4 \\zeta^2 = \\pi^2 \\zeta^2 \\)\n\n\\( 4 = \\zeta^2 (4 + \\pi^2) \\)\n\n\\( \\zeta^2 = \\frac{4}{4 + \\pi^2} \\)\n\n\\( \\zeta = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{4 + \\pi^2}} \\)\n\nCalculate \\( \\zeta \\):\n\n\\( \\zeta = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{4 + 9.8696}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{13.8696}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.288} \\approx 0.537 \\)\n\nNow, find \\( \\omega_n \\):\n\n\\( \\omega_n = \\frac{2}{\\zeta} = \\frac{2}{0.537} \\approx 3.724 \\) rad/s\n\nSo, the desired closed-loop transfer function is:\n\n\\(\\frac{C(s)}{R(s)}\\) = \\(\\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_n s + \\omega_n^2}\\) = \\(\\frac{(3.724)^2}{s^2 + 2*0.537*3.724 s + (3.724)^2}\\) \u2248 \\(\\frac{13.87}{s^2 + 3.99 s + 13.87}\\)\n\n### Step 5: Relate to the System's Transfer Function\n\nNow, we need to relate this desired transfer function to the actual system's transfer function in terms of K1 and K2.\n\nGiven the complexity of the block diagram, it's challenging to directly derive the transfer function in terms of K1 and K2. However, we can assume that the system can be represented as a second-order system with adjustable parameters K1 and K2.\n\nLet's assume that by adjusting K1 and K2, we can make the denominator of the closed-loop transfer function match the desired second-order form.\n\nSo, we want:\n\nDenominator: s^2 + (1 + 50 K2) s + 50 K1 = s^2 + 3.99 s + 13.87\n\nTherefore, by equating coefficients:\n\n1. \\( 1 + 50 K2 = 3.99 \\)\n\n2. \\( 50 K1 = 13.87 \\)\n\nNow, solve for K2 from equation 1:\n\n\\( 50 K2 = 3.99 - 1 = 2.99 \\)\n\n\\( K2 = \\frac{2.99}{50} = 0.0598 \\approx 0.06 \\)\n\nSolve for K1 from equation 2:\n\n\\( K1 = \\frac{13.87}{50} = 0.2774 \\approx 0.277 \\)\n\nTherefore, the required values are K2 = 0.06 and K1 = 0.277.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. K2=0.6, K1=0.277\n\nB. K2=0.06, K1=0.377\n\nC. K2=0.06, K1=0.277\n\nD. K2=0.01, K1=0.177\n\nThe correct choice is C. K2=0.06, K1=0.277\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
