The maximum-normal-stress theory states that yielding occurs when the maximum normal stress in a material reaches the yield strength in tension or compression.\n\nGiven:\n- Steel properties: Sy (yield strength) = 400 MPa, Ssy (shear yield strength) = 250 MPa\n- Stresses at two points on the surface under a 4-kN test load:\n  - Point a: \u03c31 = 200 MPa, \u03c32 = 100 MPa\n  - Point b: \u03c31 = 150 MPa, \u03c32 = -100 MPa\n- Stresses vary linearly with load\n\nFirst, we need to identify the maximum normal stress at each critical point and determine which point will reach the yield strength first.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the maximum normal stress at each point under the 4-kN load.**\n\nFor point a:\n- \u03c31 = 200 MPa (maximum normal stress)\n- \u03c32 = 100 MPa\n\nFor point b:\n- \u03c31 = 150 MPa\n- \u03c32 = -100 MPa (tensile stress is 150 MPa, compressive stress is 100 MPa)\n\nAccording to the maximum-normal-stress theory, yielding occurs when the maximum normal stress reaches the yield strength.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the load at which each point reaches the yield strength.**\n\nFor point a:\n- Maximum normal stress \u03c31 = 200 MPa at 4 kN\n- Yield strength Sy = 400 MPa\n\nThe stress increases linearly with load, so we can set up a proportion to find the load P_a at which \u03c31 = 400 MPa.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\text{load}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ MPa}}{4 \\text{ kN}} = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa}}{P_a}\n\\]\n\nSolving for P_a:\n\n\\[\nP_a = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa} \\times 4 \\text{ kN}}{200 \\text{ MPa}} = 8 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nFor point b:\n- Maximum normal stress \u03c31 = 150 MPa (tensile) and \u03c32 = -100 MPa (compressive) at 4 kN\n- According to the maximum-normal-stress theory, we consider the maximum tensile or compressive stress.\n\nSince Sy is given for both tension and compression (assuming the same value), we consider the maximum stress in absolute value.\n\nFor point b, the maximum stress is \u03c31 = 150 MPa (tensile).\n\nSet up a proportion to find the load P_b at which \u03c31 = 400 MPa.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\text{load}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ MPa}}{4 \\text{ kN}} = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa}}{P_b}\n\\]\n\nSolving for P_b:\n\n\\[\nP_b = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa} \\times 4 \\text{ kN}}{150 \\text{ MPa}} = \\frac{1600}{150} \\approx 10.67 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Determine the critical load.**\n\nThe frame will experience initial yielding at the point that reaches the yield strength first. Comparing P_a and P_b:\n\n- P_a = 8 kN\n- P_b \u2248 10.67 kN\n\nTherefore, point a will reach yielding first at 8 kN.\n\nHowever, we need to check if point b reaches yielding at a lower load than point a, but in this case, it does not.\n\nWait a minute, let's double-check the maximum normal stress for point b.\n\nPoint b has \u03c31 = 150 MPa (tensile) and \u03c32 = -100 MPa (compressive).\n\nAccording to the maximum-normal-stress theory, we consider the maximum stress in absolute value. So, the maximum stress at point b is 150 MPa (tensile).\n\nBut, in the maximum-normal-stress theory, we also need to consider the compressive stress. However, for ductile materials like steel, the compressive yield strength is often higher than the tensile yield strength. But in this problem, only Sy = 400 MPa is given, likely meaning the yield strength in both tension and compression.\n\nTherefore, the critical load is determined by the point that reaches \u03c3 = Sy first.\n\nSo, point a reaches 200 MPa at 4 kN, and to reach 400 MPa, it would take P_a = 8 kN.\n\nPoint b reaches 150 MPa at 4 kN, and to reach 400 MPa, it would take P_b \u2248 10.67 kN.\n\nTherefore, initial yielding occurs at 8 kN.\n\nBut wait, let's consider if there is any misunderstanding in the maximum-normal-stress theory application.\n\nThe maximum-normal-stress theory states that yielding occurs when the maximum normal stress equals the yield strength in tension or compression.\n\nIn this case, for point b, the maximum tensile stress is 150 MPa at 4 kN, and maximum compressive stress is 100 MPa.\n\nBut Sy = 400 MPa for both tension and compression.\n\nSo, point a reaches 200 MPa tensile at 4 kN, and point b reaches 150 MPa tensile and 100 MPa compressive.\n\nTo reach yielding, point a needs to reach 400 MPa tensile, which is at 8 kN.\n\nPoint b needs to reach 400 MPa tensile, which is at approximately 10.67 kN.\n\nTherefore, the frame will experience initial yielding at 8 kN.\n\nBut looking back at the options, 8 kN is option D.\n\nHowever, perhaps there is a misunderstanding. Let's consider if the maximum-normal-stress theory is applied differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we need to consider the stress state at each point and see which one reaches the yield strength first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the von Mises stress, but the problem specifies the maximum-normal-stress theory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the load factor based on both points.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to consider that both points are critical, and find the load at which either point reaches yielding.\n\nBut in the maximum-normal-stress theory, yielding occurs when the maximum normal stress at any point reaches the yield strength.\n\nTherefore, point a reaches 200 MPa at 4 kN, and to reach 400 MPa, it needs 8 kN.\n\nPoint b reaches 150 MPa at 4 kN, and to reach 400 MPa, it needs approximately 10.67 kN.\n\nTherefore, the frame will yield at 8 kN.\n\nBut perhaps there is a mistake in the linear scaling.\n\nLet's recalculate the load factors.\n\nFor point a:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_1 = 200 \\text{ MPa at } 4 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Load factor for point a} = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa}}{200 \\text{ MPa}} \\times 4 \\text{ kN} = 2 \\times 4 \\text{ kN} = 8 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nFor point b:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_1 = 150 \\text{ MPa at } 4 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Load factor for point b} = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa}}{150 \\text{ MPa}} \\times 4 \\text{ kN} \\approx 10.67 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the frame will yield at the lower of these two loads, which is 8 kN.\n\nWait, but point b has a compressive stress of -100 MPa, which is compressive.\n\nIf Sy is the same in tension and compression, then the critical stress is 400 MPa in either direction.\n\nBut the maximum normal stress at point b is 150 MPa tensile, which is less than at point a (200 MPa tensile).\n\nTherefore, point a will reach 400 MPa tensile at 8 kN, and point b will reach 400 MPa tensile at approximately 10.67 kN.\n\nTherefore, initial yielding occurs at 8 kN.\n\nBut let's consider if there is another way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the stress state at each point and see which one reaches the yield surface first based on the maximum-normal-stress theory.\n\nFor point a:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\text{max},a} = 200 \\text{ MPa at } 4 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Load ratio for point a} = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa}}{200 \\text{ MPa}} = 2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Yielding load for point a} = 2 \\times 4 \\text{ kN} = 8 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nFor point b:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\text{max},b} = 150 \\text{ MPa at } 4 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Load ratio for point b} = \\frac{400 \\text{ MPa}}{150 \\text{ MPa}} \\approx 2.667\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Yielding load for point b} = 2.667 \\times 4 \\text{ kN} \\approx 10.67 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the frame will yield at the lower of these two loads, which is 8 kN.\n\nHence, the answer should be D. 8 kN.\n\nBut let's check if there is any other consideration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the negative stress at point b needs to be considered differently.\n\nIn compression, the maximum normal stress is -100 MPa, and Sy = 400 MPa in compression.\n\nSo, for compression:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_{\\text{min},b} = -100 \\text{ MPa at } 4 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Load ratio for compression at point b} = \\frac{-400 \\text{ MPa}}{-100 \\text{ MPa}} = 4\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Yielding load for compression at point b} = 4 \\times 4 \\text{ kN} = 16 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nBut since 16 kN is higher than both 8 kN and 10.67 kN, it is not the controlling factor.\n\nTherefore, initial yielding will occur at point a at 8 kN.\n\nHence, the answer is D. 8 kN.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
