The rocket starts from rest and accelerates upward at a constant rate of 3 m/s\u00b2 for 8 seconds due to a small thruster. After 8 seconds, the thruster shuts off, and the rocket continues to move upward until it reaches its apex. At the apex, a small parachute deploys, causing the rocket to descend at a constant speed of 0.85 m/s until it impacts the ground. The diagram shows two stages: the initial launch phase with the thruster active and the descent phase with the parachute deployed. The height \\( h \\) represents the maximum height attained by the rocket.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA model rocket is launched from rest with a constant upward acceleration of 3 m /s^2 under the action of a small thruster. The thruster shuts off after 8 seconds, and the rocket continues upward until it reaches its apex. At apex, a small chute opens which ensures that the rocket falls at a constant speed of 0.85 m /s until it impacts the ground. Determine the maximum height h attained by the rocket and the total flight time. Neglect aerodynamic drag during ascent, and assume that the mass of the rocket and the acceleration of gravity are both constant.<image 1>\n\nA. h=125.358m,t=27.62s\nB. h=105.358m,t=27.62s\nC. h=125.358m,t=24.62s\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several parts: the ascent with the thruster on, the coasting ascent after the thruster shuts off, and the descent with the parachute deployed. We'll use the equations of motion for each phase.\n\n### Phase 1: Ascent with Thruster On\n\nGiven:\n- Initial velocity, \\( u = 0 \\) m/s (starts from rest)\n- Acceleration, \\( a = 3 \\) m/s\u00b2\n- Time, \\( t = 8 \\) s\n\nFirst, we find the velocity at the end of 8 seconds:\n\\[\nv = u + a t = 0 + 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the height reached during this phase:\n\\[\nh_1 = u t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2 = 0 \\times 8 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 8^2 = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 64 = 96 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\n### Phase 2: Coasting Ascent After Thruster Shuts Off\n\nAfter the thruster shuts off, the rocket continues to move upward under gravity until it reaches its apex. The acceleration is now due to gravity, \\( a = -g = -9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial velocity, \\( u = 24 \\) m/s\n- Final velocity at apex, \\( v = 0 \\) m/s\n- Acceleration, \\( a = -9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2\n\nFirst, we find the additional height gained during this phase:\n\\[\nv^2 = u^2 + 2 a h_2 \\implies 0 = 24^2 + 2(-9.81) h_2 \\implies 0 = 576 - 19.62 h_2 \\implies h_2 = \\frac{576}{19.62} \\approx 29.35 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nNow, the total maximum height \\( h \\) is:\n\\[\nh = h_1 + h_2 = 96 + 29.35 = 125.35 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\n### Phase 3: Descent with Parachute Deployed\n\nThe rocket descends from the apex to the ground at a constant speed of \\( v = 0.85 \\) m/s.\n\nGiven:\n- Height to descend, \\( h = 125.35 \\) m\n- Descent speed, \\( v = 0.85 \\) m/s\n\nThe time for descent is:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{descent}} = \\frac{h}{v} = \\frac{125.35}{0.85} \\approx 147.47 \\text{ s}\n\\]\n\n### Total Flight Time\n\nThe total flight time is the sum of the time during the ascent with the thruster on, the coasting ascent time, and the descent time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the coasting ascent time.\n\nGiven:\n- Initial velocity, \\( u = 24 \\) m/s\n- Final velocity, \\( v = 0 \\) m/s\n- Acceleration, \\( a = -9.81 \\) m/s\u00b2\n\nTime for coasting ascent:\n\\[\nv = u + a t \\implies 0 = 24 + (-9.81) t \\implies t = \\frac{24}{9.81} \\approx 2.45 \\text{ s}\n\\]\n\nNow, total flight time:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{thrust}} + t_{\\text{coast}} + t_{\\text{descent}} = 8 + 2.45 + 147.47 \\approx 157.92 \\text{ s}\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the calculations, the maximum height \\( h \\) is approximately 125.35 meters. However, the total flight time calculated is approximately 157.92 seconds, which does not match any of the provided options. There seems to be a discrepancy in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. \\( h=125.358 \\) m, \\( t=27.62 \\) s\n\nB. \\( h=105.358 \\) m, \\( t=27.62 \\) s\n\nC. \\( h=125.358 \\) m, \\( t=24.62 \\) s\n\nThe height matches option A and C, but the total time does not match any of them. There might be an error in the descent speed or the interpretation of the problem. If the descent speed was meant to be higher, it would reduce the descent time significantly.\n\nAssuming the descent speed was misread and should be higher, let's consider the option provided.\n\nIf we consider the total time should be around 27.62 seconds, then the descent time would be:\n\n\\[\nt_{\\text{descent}} = 27.62 - 8 - 2.45 = 17.17 \\text{ s}\n\\]\n\nThen, the descent speed would be:\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{h}{t_{\\text{descent}}} = \\frac{125.35}{17.17} \\approx 7.3 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that either the descent speed was misstated or there's an error in the options. Given the information provided, the correct height is approximately 125.35 meters, but the total time does not match any options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
