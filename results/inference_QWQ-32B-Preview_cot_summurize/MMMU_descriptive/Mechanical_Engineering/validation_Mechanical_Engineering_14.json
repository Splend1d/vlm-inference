                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit involved, but if I break it down, I can manage it.\n\nFirst, we have a 1000-kg mass being lowered at a uniform rate of 4 m/s by a drum. The drum has a diameter of 550 mm, which is 0.55 m, and weighs 2.5 kN. The radius of gyration is 250 mm, which is 0.25 m. There's a brake applying a torque of 2698 N\u00b7m to maintain the uniform descent.\n\nPart (a) asks for the kinetic energy in the system. Kinetic energy comes from both the translational motion of the mass and the rotational motion of the drum.\n\nFirst, let's find the kinetic energy of the mass. The formula for translational kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is its velocity.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( m = 1000 \\) kg\n\n- \\( v = 4 \\) m/s\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 \\times 4^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1000 \\times 16 = 8000 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the kinetic energy of the drum due to its rotation. The formula for rotational kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular velocity.\n\nThe moment of inertia for a body with radius of gyration \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[ I = m k^2 \\]\n\nBut wait, here the drum's weight is given as 2.5 kN. First, we need to find the mass of the drum. Weight \\( W = m g \\), so:\n\n\\[ m_{\\text{drum}} = \\frac{W}{g} = \\frac{2500 \\text{ N}}{9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2} \\approx 254.8 \\text{ kg} \\]\n\nNow, the moment of inertia \\( I \\) is:\n\n\\[ I = m_{\\text{drum}} k^2 = 254.8 \\times (0.25)^2 = 254.8 \\times 0.0625 \\approx 15.925 \\text{ kg\u00b7m}^2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) of the drum. Since the cable is lowering the mass at 4 m/s, and the drum has a diameter of 0.55 m, the circumference is:\n\n\\[ C = \\pi d = \\pi \\times 0.55 \\approx 1.728 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nThe linear speed \\( v \\) is related to the angular speed \\( \\omega \\) by:\n\n\\[ v = \\omega r \\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the drum, which is half the diameter:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{0.55}{2} = 0.275 \\text{ m} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} = \\frac{4}{0.275} \\approx 14.545 \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\nNow, the rotational kinetic energy is:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15.925 \\times (14.545)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\times 15.925 \\times 211.597 \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3367.2 \\approx 1683.6 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total kinetic energy in the system is:\n\n\\[ KE_{\\text{total}} = KE_{\\text{trans}} + KE_{\\text{rot}} = 8000 + 1683.6 \\approx 9683.6 \\text{ J} \\]\n\nSo, the answer for part (a) is approximately 9673 J, which matches option A and C.\n\nNow, part (b) asks for the additional brake torque required to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total kinetic energy that needs to be dissipated to bring the system to rest, which we've already calculated as approximately 9673 J.\n\nNext, we need to find out how much energy needs to be dissipated per unit time, which is power. The time given is 0.60 seconds, so the required power \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{KE_{\\text{total}}}{t} = \\frac{9673}{0.60} \\approx 16121.67 \\text{ W} \\]\n\nNow, torque \\( \\tau \\) and angular velocity \\( \\omega \\) are related to power by:\n\n\\[ P = \\tau \\omega \\]\n\nSo, the total torque required \\( \\tau_{\\text{total}} \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{P}{\\omega} = \\frac{16121.67}{14.545} \\approx 1107.6 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nHowever, the system already has a brake applying a torque of 2698 N\u00b7m to maintain the uniform descent. Wait a minute, this seems off.\n\nLet me double-check. The problem says that the uniform rate of descent is maintained by a brake applying a torque of 2698 N\u00b7m. So, this torque is already being applied to balance the system and maintain the uniform descent.\n\nNow, to bring the system to rest in 0.60 seconds, we need to add additional torque on top of the existing 2698 N\u00b7m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2698 N\u00b7m is the torque required to lower the mass at a uniform rate, and to stop it, we need to apply additional torque to decelerate it.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Maybe using Newton's second law for rotation.\n\nFirst, find the angular acceleration required to bring the drum to rest in 0.60 seconds.\n\nThe initial angular velocity \\( \\omega_0 = 14.545 \\) rad/s, final \\( \\omega_f = 0 \\) rad/s, time \\( t = 0.60 \\) s.\n\nAngular acceleration \\( \\alpha \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{\\omega_f - \\omega_0}{t} = \\frac{0 - 14.545}{0.60} \\approx -24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates deceleration.\n\nNow, the net torque required to produce this angular acceleration is:\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{net}} = I \\alpha = 15.925 \\times (-24.242) \\approx -385.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates the torque is opposing the motion.\n\nHowever, since the brake is already applying a torque of 2698 N\u00b7m to maintain the uniform descent, we need to find the additional torque required on top of that to achieve the deceleration.\n\nWait, actually, the 2698 N\u00b7m is the torque required to maintain the uniform descent. To decelerate the system, we need to increase the brake torque by an additional amount to achieve the required angular acceleration.\n\nSo, the total torque required to decelerate is \\( \\tau_{\\text{total}} = \\tau_{\\text{brake}} + \\tau_{\\text{additional}} \\).\n\nBut from the equation \\( \\tau_{\\text{net}} = I \\alpha \\), the net torque required is -385.7 N\u00b7m.\n\nHowever, the brake is already applying 2698 N\u00b7m to maintain uniform descent. So, perhaps the relationship is:\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{net}} = \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} - \\tau_{\\text{brake}} \\]\n\nAt uniform descent, \\( \\tau_{\\text{net}} = 0 \\), so \\( \\tau_{\\text{brake}} = \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} = 2698 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\).\n\nNow, to decelerate with \\( \\alpha = -24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\), the net torque required is \\( \\tau_{\\text{net}} = I \\alpha = -385.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{net}} = \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} \\]\n\nSet this equal to \\( I \\alpha \\):\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = I \\alpha \\]\n\nWe know \\( \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} = 2698 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\), \\( I = 15.925 \\text{ kg\u00b7m}^2 \\), \\( \\alpha = -24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ 2698 - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = 15.925 \\times (-24.242) \\]\n\n\\[ 2698 - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = -385.7 \\]\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = 2698 + 385.7 \\approx 3083.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the additional brake torque required is:\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{additional}} = \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} - \\tau_{\\text{brake}} = 3083.7 - 2698 \\approx 385.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia or the angular acceleration.\n\nLet me double-check the moment of inertia. The radius of gyration \\( k = 0.25 \\) m, and mass of the drum \\( m_{\\text{drum}} = \\frac{2500}{9.81} \\approx 254.8 \\) kg, so \\( I = 254.8 \\times (0.25)^2 = 15.925 \\text{ kg\u00b7m}^2 \\). That seems correct.\n\nNow, angular acceleration \\( \\alpha = \\frac{0 - 14.545}{0.60} \\approx -24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\). That also seems correct.\n\nSo, \\( \\tau_{\\text{net}} = I \\alpha = 15.925 \\times (-24.242) \\approx -385.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = -385.7 \\)\n\nGiven \\( \\tau_{\\text{gravity}} = 2698 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\),\n\n\\[ 2698 - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = -385.7 \\]\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = 2698 + 385.7 = 3083.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{additional}} = 3083.7 - 2698 = 385.7 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nHmm, this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider the kinetic energy approach again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the work done by the brake torque over the time period.\n\nThe kinetic energy that needs to be dissipated is 9673 J in 0.60 s, which requires a power of \\( P = \\frac{9673}{0.60} \\approx 16121.67 \\text{ W} \\).\n\nThen, the total torque required is \\( \\tau_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{P}{\\omega} = \\frac{16121.67}{14.545} \\approx 1107.6 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\).\n\nSince the brake is already applying 2698 N\u00b7m, the additional torque required would be \\( 1107.6 - 2698 \\), but that would be negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the brake torque is being added to counter the motion. So, the additional torque required would be the total torque needed minus the existing brake torque.\n\nBut earlier calculations suggest the additional torque is 385.7 N\u00b7m, which still doesn't match the options.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the linear motion of the mass as well.\n\nThe mass is being decelerated, so there's a deceleration acting on it.\n\nThe system is being brought to rest, so the mass is decelerating upwards.\n\nLet's apply Newton's second law to the mass.\n\nLet's denote upwards as positive.\n\nThe forces acting on the mass are:\n\n- Tension in the cable, \\( T \\), upwards\n\n- Weight, \\( W = m g = 1000 \\times 9.81 = 9810 \\text{ N} \\), downwards\n\nThe net force is \\( F_{\\text{net}} = T - W = m a \\), where \\( a \\) is the linear acceleration upwards.\n\nWe need to find \\( a \\).\n\nGiven that the angular acceleration of the drum is \\( \\alpha = -24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\), the linear acceleration \\( a \\) is:\n\n\\[ a = \\alpha r = -24.242 \\times 0.275 \\approx -6.667 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates the acceleration is downwards, but since we defined upwards as positive, this should be \\( a = -6.667 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\).\n\nWait, but if the system is decelerating to rest, and it was moving downwards at 4 m/s, then the acceleration should be upwards, so positive.\n\nMaybe I need to re-examine the sign convention.\n\nLet's redefine upwards as positive.\n\nThen, \\( v = -4 \\text{ m/s} \\) (since it's moving downwards), and \\( \\omega = \\frac{v}{r} = \\frac{-4}{0.275} \\approx -14.545 \\text{ rad/s} \\)\n\nThen, \\( \\alpha = \\frac{0 - (-14.545)}{0.60} \\approx 24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\)\n\nSo, \\( a = \\alpha r = 24.242 \\times 0.275 \\approx 6.667 \\text{ m/s}^2 \\), upwards.\n\nNow, applying Newton's second law to the mass:\n\n\\[ T - W = m a \\]\n\n\\[ T - 9810 = 1000 \\times 6.667 \\]\n\n\\[ T - 9810 = 6667 \\]\n\n\\[ T = 9810 + 6667 = 16477 \\text{ N} \\]\n\nNow, the torque due to tension \\( T \\) is \\( \\tau_T = T \\times r = 16477 \\times 0.275 \\approx 4522.5 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\)\n\nSimilarly, the torque due to the weight of the drum is \\( \\tau_W = W_{\\text{drum}} \\times r = 2500 \\times 0.275 = 687.5 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\)\n\nWait, but the weight of the drum acts at its center of mass, which is at the center, so it doesn't create a torque. Actually, the weight of the drum is already considered in its moment of inertia.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the net torque on the drum.\n\nThe net torque is the torque due to the tension in the cable minus the brake torque, and this equals the moment of inertia times angular acceleration.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{net}} = \\tau_T - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = I \\alpha \\]\n\nWe have:\n\n- \\( \\tau_T = T \\times r = 16477 \\times 0.275 \\approx 4522.5 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\)\n\n- \\( I = 15.925 \\text{ kg\u00b7m}^2 \\)\n\n- \\( \\alpha = 24.242 \\text{ rad/s}^2 \\)\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\[ 4522.5 - \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = 15.925 \\times 24.242 \\approx 385.7 \\]\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} = 4522.5 - 385.7 = 4136.8 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nTherefore, the additional brake torque required is:\n\n\\[ \\tau_{\\text{additional}} = \\tau_{\\text{brake, total}} - \\tau_{\\text{brake}} = 4136.8 - 2698 \\approx 1438.8 \\text{ N\u00b7m} \\]\n\nHmm, still not matching the options. Maybe I need to consider the direction of torques.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tension in the cable is not 16477 N.\n\nLet me recalculate the tension.\n\nFrom Newton's second"
