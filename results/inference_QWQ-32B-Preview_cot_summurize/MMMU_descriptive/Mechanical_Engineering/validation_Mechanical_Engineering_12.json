The left view is being asked for, and there are four options labeled a), b), c), and d).\n\nThe description states that all four options show a rectangular block with a small rectangular cutout in the middle, but the positions of the cutouts differ in each option. The correct left view should match the shape and position of the rectangular cutout in the middle of the rectangular block as seen from the left side.\n\nGiven that the top view shows the rectangular block with a cutout on the right side, and the cone on the left side, the left view should show the side of the cone and the side of the rectangular block with the cutout.\n\nHowever, since the question is specifically about selecting the correct left view and the answer provided is \"A. A\", it implies that option a) correctly represents the left view.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A. A**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
