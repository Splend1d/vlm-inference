Each diagram represents a cross-sectional view of a cylindrical object with threads. \n\n- Diagram (a) shows a single thread with a single line indicating the thread profile.\n- Diagram (b) shows a single thread with two lines indicating the thread profile.\n- Diagram (c) shows multiple threads with two lines indicating the thread profile.\n- Diagram (d) shows a single thread with a single line indicating the thread profile.\n\nBased on standard thread labeling methods, diagram (b) is incorrect because it uses two lines to indicate a single thread, which is not typical in thread representation.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich of the following thread labeling methods is incorrect().<image 1>\n\nA.
