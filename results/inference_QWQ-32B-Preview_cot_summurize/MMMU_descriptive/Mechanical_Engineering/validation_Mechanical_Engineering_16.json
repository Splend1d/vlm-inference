The block is shown at the top of the cylinder, and it is about to drop into the cylinder from a certain height \\( h \\). The cylinder is filled with a fluid, which is likely water, given its blue color. At the bottom of the cylinder, there is a spring labeled with the variable \\( k \\), indicating its stiffness. The height \\( h \\) from which the block will drop is also indicated in the diagram. The block is shown with an arrow pointing downward, suggesting its impending motion due to gravity. The spring is coiled and appears to be compressed when the block impacts it.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA block weighing W = 5.0 N drops inside a cylinder from a height h = 200 mm onto a spring having stiffness k = 90 N/m.

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum shortening of the spring when a block drops onto it from a certain height. We'll use the principles of energy conservation and Hooke's law to find the solution.\n\nGiven:\n- Weight of the block, \\( W = 5.0 \\) N\n- Dropping height, \\( h = 200 \\) mm = 0.2 m\n- Spring stiffness, \\( k = 90 \\) N/m\n\nWe need to find the maximum compression \\( x \\) of the spring.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Initial Potential Energy:**\n   The block has gravitational potential energy at the height \\( h \\) before it drops. This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as it falls and then into spring potential energy when it compresses the spring.\n\n   The initial potential energy is:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{initial}} = W \\times h = 5.0 \\, \\text{N} \\times 0.2 \\, \\text{m} = 1.0 \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Energy Conservation:**\n   At the maximum compression, all the initial potential energy is converted into the spring's potential energy and the gravitational potential energy at the compressed position.\n\n   Let \\( x \\) be the maximum compression of the spring. The final position of the block is at a height \\( -x \\) relative to its initial position (since it drops down by \\( h + x \\)).\n\n   The final gravitational potential energy is:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{final}} = W \\times (-x) = -5.0x \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n   The spring potential energy is:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{spring}} = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 90 \\times x^2 = 45x^2 \\, \\text{J}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Setting up the Energy Equation:**\n   According to the conservation of energy:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{initial}} + KE_{\\text{initial}} = PE_{\\text{final}} + PE_{\\text{spring}} + KE_{\\text{final}}\n   \\]\n   Since the block is dropped from rest, \\( KE_{\\text{initial}} = 0 \\), and at maximum compression, \\( KE_{\\text{final}} = 0 \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   PE_{\\text{initial}} = PE_{\\text{final}} + PE_{\\text{spring}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   1.0 = -5.0x + 45x^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n   Rearrange the equation:\n   \\[\n   45x^2 - 5.0x - 1.0 = 0\n   \\]\n   This is a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where:\n   \\[\n   a = 45, \\quad b = -5.0, \\quad c = -1.0\n   \\]\n   The solutions for \\( x \\) are given by:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-(-5.0) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5.0)^2 - 4 \\times 45 \\times (-1.0)}}{2 \\times 45}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5.0 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 180}}{90}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5.0 \\pm \\sqrt{205}}{90}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5.0 \\pm 14.32}{90}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculating the Possible Values:**\n   \\[\n   x_1 = \\frac{5.0 + 14.32}{90} = \\frac{19.32}{90} \\approx 0.2147 \\, \\text{m} = 214.7 \\, \\text{mm}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_2 = \\frac{5.0 - 14.32}{90} = \\frac{-9.32}{90} \\approx -0.1036 \\, \\text{m} = -103.6 \\, \\text{mm}\n   \\]\n   Since compression cannot be negative, we discard \\( x_2 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe maximum shortening of the spring is approximately \\( 214.7 \\) mm, which corresponds to option B. 214.64 mm.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{214.64 \\, \\text{mm}} \\]"
