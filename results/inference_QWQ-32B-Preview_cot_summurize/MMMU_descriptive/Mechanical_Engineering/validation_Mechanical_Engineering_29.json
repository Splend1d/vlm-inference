The shaft is supported by three torsional springs labeled \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\) along its length. At the top of the shaft, there is a circular disk with radius \\( R \\). Attached to the disk are two linear springs labeled \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\), which are connected to fixed points outside the disk. Additionally, there is a torsional spring labeled \\( k_4 \\) connected to the center of the disk.\n\nThe system appears to be designed to analyze the equivalent torsional spring constant of the combined system, considering both the torsional springs along the shaft and the linear springs attached to the disk. The angle \\( \\theta \\) represents the angular displacement of the disk relative to its initial position.\n\nGiven this setup, the equivalent torsional spring constant \\( k_{et} \\) can be calculated by combining the effects of all the springs involved. The torsional springs \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\) are in series along the shaft, while the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) contribute to the overall torsional stiffness through their connection to the disk.\n\nThe correct formula for the equivalent torsional spring constant \\( k_{et} \\) is:\n\n\\[ k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6) \\]\n\nThis formula accounts for the series combination of the torsional springs \\( k_1 \\), \\( k_2 \\), and \\( k_3 \\), the direct contribution of the torsional spring \\( k_4 \\) at the disk, and the contribution of the linear springs \\( k_5 \\) and \\( k_6 \\) through the radius \\( R \\) squared.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. \\( k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6) \\)\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nFind the equivalent torsional spring constant of the system shown in <image 1>.

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the correct equivalent torsional spring constant \\(k_{et}\\) for the system is given by option B:\n\n\\[k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6)\\]\n\nThis formula accounts for the series combination of the torsional springs \\(k_1\\), \\(k_2\\), and \\(k_3\\), the direct contribution of the torsional spring \\(k_4\\) at the disk, and the contribution of the linear springs \\(k_5\\) and \\(k_6\\) through the radius \\(R\\) squared.\n\nTo understand why this is the correct formula, let's break down the system step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Series Combination of Torsional Springs\n\nThe torsional springs \\(k_1\\), \\(k_2\\), and \\(k_3\\) are in series along the shaft. For torsional springs in series, the equivalent torsional spring constant \\(k_{eq}\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{k_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{k_1} + \\frac{1}{k_2} + \\frac{1}{k_3}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k_{eq}\\):\n\n\\[k_{eq} = \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2}\\]\n\n### Step 2: Contribution of Torsional Spring \\(k_4\\)\n\nThe torsional spring \\(k_4\\) is directly connected to the center of the disk, so its contribution to the equivalent torsional spring constant is simply \\(k_4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Contribution of Linear Springs \\(k_5\\) and \\(k_6\\)\n\nThe linear springs \\(k_5\\) and \\(k_6\\) are attached to the disk and connected to fixed points outside the disk. When the disk rotates by an angle \\(\\theta\\), the linear displacement at the point where the spring is attached is \\(R\\theta\\), where \\(R\\) is the radius of the disk.\n\nThe torsional stiffness due to a linear spring is given by:\n\n\\[k_t = k \\cdot R^2\\]\n\nTherefore, the equivalent torsional spring constants for \\(k_5\\) and \\(k_6\\) are:\n\n\\[k_{t5} = k_5 R^2\\]\\[k_{t6} = k_6 R^2\\]\n\nSince these are in parallel, their contributions add up:\n\n\\[k_{t\\text{linear}} = k_{t5} + k_{t6} = R^2 (k_5 + k_6)\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combining All Contributions\n\nThe total equivalent torsional spring constant \\(k_{et}\\) is the sum of the equivalent spring constant from the series combination of \\(k_1\\), \\(k_2\\), and \\(k_3\\), the direct contribution of \\(k_4\\), and the equivalent torsional stiffness from the linear springs \\(k_5\\) and \\(k_6\\):\n\n\\[k_{et} = k_{eq} + k_4 + k_{t\\text{linear}}\\]\\[k_{et} = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2 k_3}{k_2 k_3 + k_1 k_3 + k_1 k_2} \\right) + k_4 + R^2 (k_5 + k_6)\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is option B.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect\n\n- **Option A**: Incorrectly includes \\(k_5\\) directly instead of \\(R^2 k_5\\), and incorrectly groups \\(k_4\\) with \\(k_6\\) under \\(R^2\\).\n\n- **Option C**: Incorrectly includes \\(k_6\\) directly instead of \\(R^2 k_6\\), and incorrectly groups \\(k_4\\) with \\(k_5\\) under \\(R^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
