The pipe has a cylindrical shape and is shown in a perspective view where one end is pointing upwards and the other end is angled to the side.\n\n2. **Views (A, B, C, D)**:\n   - **View A**: This view shows the pipe from the top, looking directly down at the bend. The view is symmetrical with the bend forming a right angle.\n   - **View B**: This view shows the pipe from the front, looking straight at the bend. The view is also symmetrical with the bend forming a right angle.\n   - **View C**: This view shows the pipe from the side, looking at the bend. The view is asymmetrical, showing the bend at an angle.\n   - **View D**: This view shows the pipe from the back, looking through the bend. The view is symmetrical with the bend forming a right angle.\n\nBased on the description, the correct view is **View B** because it shows the pipe from the front, looking straight at the bend, which matches the orientation of the 3D object.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn the following figure, select the correct view ().<image 1>\n\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD. D\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the correct view is **View B**. The reasoning behind this choice is that View B shows the pipe from the front, looking straight at the bend, which aligns with the orientation of the 3D object described. The other views (A, C, and D) represent different perspectives that do not match the specified front view of the bent pipe.\n\nTo elaborate:\n\n- **View A** is a top-down view of the pipe, showing the bend from above. While this view is symmetrical and shows the right-angle bend, it does not correspond to the front view as described.\n\n- **View B** is the front view, directly facing the bend. This perspective should clearly show the right-angle bend as it is intended to be seen from the front, making it the correct choice.\n\n- **View C** is a side view of the pipe, showing the bend at an angle. This perspective is asymmetrical compared to the front and top views, which do not match the description of looking straight at the bend.\n\n- **View D** is the back view, looking through the bend. Although it is symmetrical and shows the right-angle bend, it represents the opposite side of the pipe compared to the front view.\n\nTherefore, **View B** is the correct representation of the pipe when viewed from the front, directly at the bend.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
