                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangular beam with dimensions 200 mm in length and 30 mm in height. There's a circular hole in the center with a diameter of 15 mm, and a notch on one side that goes in 25 mm from the edge. The beam is subjected to two horizontal forces of 65,000 N each, applied at opposite ends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find the maximum stress at both the hole and the notch. Stress is generally defined as force per unit area, but in this case, because of the complexities introduced by the hole and the notch, it's probably not as straightforward as just dividing the force by the cross-sectional area.\n\nI recall that in materials with discontinuities like holes and notches, stress concentrations can occur. This means that the stress at these points can be higher than the average stress in the material. There are formulas and charts to calculate stress concentration factors for different geometries.\n\nLet me start by calculating the average stress in the beam without considering the hole and notch. The total force is 65,000 N on each end, so the total force is 130,000 N. But actually, since the forces are equal and opposite, it's probably in pure tension or compression, but the arrow directions suggest they might be pulling towards each other, so perhaps it's in compression.\n\nWait, the arrows are pointing towards the center of the beam, so yes, it's in compression.\n\nSo, in compression, the stress would be the force divided by the cross-sectional area.\n\nBut the cross-sectional area is reduced because of the hole.\n\nThe original area is 30 mm * 200 mm = 6000 mm\u00b2.\n\nThe area of the hole is \u03c0*(d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0*(15/2)\u00b2 \u2248 176.71 mm\u00b2.\n\nSo, the net area is 6000 - 176.71 \u2248 5823.29 mm\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the average compressive stress is 130,000 N / 5823.29 mm\u00b2 \u2248 22.32 MPa.\n\nBut this doesn't consider the notch, and it doesn't account for stress concentrations.\n\nI think I need to look into stress concentration factors for holes and notches in compressed members.\n\nFor a circular hole in a compressed member, the stress concentration factor (Kt) can be found using standard tables or formulas.\n\nFrom my materials textbook, for a circular hole in a compressed member, Kt = 2*(1 + (d/t)), where d is the hole diameter and t is the thickness (height) of the beam.\n\nSo, d = 15 mm, t = 30 mm.\n\nTherefore, Kt = 2*(1 + 15/30) = 2*(1 + 0.5) = 2*1.5 = 3.\n\nSo, the maximum stress at the hole would be Kt times the average stress: 3 * 22.32 MPa \u2248 66.96 MPa.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options, and I think I might be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the forces are not additive like that. Let's look again.\n\nThe problem says \"two external forces, each of 65000 N, applied horizontally at opposite ends of the beam.\"\n\nIf they are applied horizontally and the beam is rectangular, perhaps it's in bending, not just compression.\n\nMaybe I need to consider bending stress in addition to compressive stress.\n\nLet me think about it again.\n\nIf the beam is rectangular, 200 mm long and 30 mm high, and forces are applied horizontally at both ends, it's likely in bending.\n\nIn that case, the stress due to bending is given by \u03c3 = M*y/I, where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the neutral axis, and I is the moment of inertia.\n\nFirst, I need to find the bending moment.\n\nAssuming the beam is simply supported at both ends with equal loads, the bending moment would be M = (w*L^2)/8, but in this case, it's two point loads.\n\nWait, actually, if it's two equal forces applied at the ends, and the beam is fixed or supported in some way, the bending moment would depend on the support conditions.\n\nBut perhaps it's a cantilever beam with forces applied at the free end, or something else.\n\nI need more information about the support conditions to determine the bending moment.\n\nLooking back at the description, it just says \"applied horizontally at opposite ends of the beam.\"\n\nI think it's safe to assume it's a simply supported beam with two point loads at the ends.\n\nIn that case, the maximum bending moment would be M = (P*L)/4, where P is the force and L is the length.\n\nBut wait, there are two forces of 65,000 N each, so total force is 130,000 N, but if both are applied at the ends, and the beam is simply supported at the ends, then each force would create its own moment.\n\nActually, for two equal point loads on a simply supported beam, the maximum bending moment is M = P*L/4.\n\nGiven that P = 65,000 N and L = 200 mm = 0.2 m, then M = 65,000 * 0.2 / 4 = 3,250 Nm.\n\nNow, I need to find the moment of inertia (I) of the beam's cross-section.\n\nThe cross-section is a rectangle with a height of 30 mm and width of 200 mm, but with a circular hole in the center.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a rectangular section is I = (b*h^3)/12, and for a circular hole, I = (\u03c0*d^4)/64, but since it's a hole, it's subtracted.\n\nSo, I = (200*30^3)/12 - (\u03c0*15^4)/64.\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst term: (200*27,000)/12 = 54,000,000/12 = 4,500,000 mm^4.\n\nSecond term: (3.1416*50,625)/64 \u2248 158,874.90/64 \u2248 2,482.42 mm^4.\n\nTherefore, I \u2248 4,500,000 - 2,482.42 \u2248 4,497,517.58 mm^4 = 4.49751758 x 10^-6 m^4.\n\nNow, the distance from the neutral axis to the top or bottom fiber is y = h/2 = 30/2 = 15 mm = 0.015 m.\n\nTherefore, the bending stress is \u03c3 = M*y/I = (3,250 * 0.015)/4.49751758e-6 \u2248 48.75 / 4.49751758e-6 \u2248 10,835,000 kPa = 10.835 MPa.\n\nBut this seems low compared to my earlier calculation, and also lower than the options provided.\n\nI must be missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the reduced section due to the hole when calculating the moment of inertia.\n\nActually, the moment of inertia I already accounted for the hole by subtracting its moment of inertia from the overall rectangular section.\n\nBut maybe I need to consider the stress concentration factors due to the hole and the notch.\n\nStress concentration factors are typically used in combination with the base stress to find the maximum stress at points of geometry changes.\n\nSo, perhaps I should calculate the base bending stress and then apply the stress concentration factor at the hole and the notch.\n\nFrom earlier, I calculated the bending stress as 10.835 MPa, but that seems low.\n\nLet me double-check the moment of inertia calculation.\n\nI = (b*h^3)/12 - (\u03c0*d^4)/64.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n(200*27,000)/12 = 4,500,000 mm^4.\n\n(\u03c0*50,625)/64 \u2248 2,482.42 mm^4.\n\nSo, I \u2248 4,497,517.58 mm^4, which seems correct.\n\nNow, M = P*L/4 = 65,000 N * 0.2 m / 4 = 3,250 Nm.\n\n\u03c3 = M*y/I = 3,250 * 0.015 / 4.49751758e-6 \u2248 10.835 MPa.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that there are two forces, but actually, in a simply supported beam with two end loads, the maximum bending moment is indeed P*L/4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the beam is fixed at both ends, in which case the bending moment would be different.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nFor a fixed beam with two end loads, the bending moment is M = P*L/12.\n\nSo, M = 65,000 * 0.2 / 12 \u2248 1,083.33 Nm.\n\nThis would lead to a lower bending stress, which is even further from the options.\n\nI think I need to assume it's a simply supported beam with two end loads, leading to M = P*L/4 = 3,250 Nm.\n\nNow, perhaps I need to consider the stress concentration factors for the hole and the notch.\n\nFor a circular hole in a compressed member, the stress concentration factor Kt can be found using the formula Kt = 2*(1 + (d/t)), as I did earlier.\n\nWith d = 15 mm and t = 30 mm, Kt = 3.\n\nSimilarly, for the notch, I need to find the stress concentration factor.\n\nNotches typically have higher stress concentration factors than holes.\n\nFrom standard tables, for a rectangular notch, Kt can be around 2 to 4, depending on the depth and geometry.\n\nGiven that the notch depth is 25 mm, which is quite significant compared to the height of 30 mm, I would expect a higher stress concentration.\n\nPerhaps Kt for the notch is around 4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum stress at the hole would be Kt * \u03c3_base = 3 * 10.835 MPa \u2248 32.505 MPa.\n\nAt the notch, it would be 4 * 10.835 MPa \u2248 43.34 MPa.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them match these values.\n\nWait, option B is 31.7 MPa and 34.83 MPa, which is close to my calculations, but not exact.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the stresses are additive or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the combined effect of compression and bending.\n\nWait, the beam is in compression due to the applied forces, and also bending.\n\nSo, the total stress would be the sum of the compressive stress and the bending stress.\n\nEarlier, I calculated the average compressive stress as 22.32 MPa, and the bending stress as 10.835 MPa.\n\nSo, the total stress would be 22.32 + 10.835 = 33.155 MPa.\n\nThen, applying the stress concentration factors:\n\nAt the hole: 3 * 33.155 \u2248 99.465 MPa.\n\nAt the notch: 4 * 33.155 \u2248 132.62 MPa.\n\nThese values are much higher than the options provided, so I must be doing something wrong.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the stress concentration factors are applied only to the bending stress, not the compressive stress.\n\nIn that case, the total stress at the hole would be the average compressive stress plus the stress concentration factor times the bending stress.\n\nSo, \u03c3_total = \u03c3_compression + Kt * \u03c3_bending.\n\nTherefore, at the hole:\n\n\u03c3_total = 22.32 + 3 * 10.835 \u2248 22.32 + 32.505 \u2248 54.825 MPa.\n\nAt the notch:\n\n\u03c3_total = 22.32 + 4 * 10.835 \u2248 22.32 + 43.34 \u2248 65.66 MPa.\n\nStill, these values don't match any of the options.\n\nMaybe I need to reconsider the approach.\n\nLet me look up the stress concentration factor for a circular hole in a compressed member.\n\nUpon checking a standard stress concentration table, for a circular hole in a compressed member, Kt = 2*(1 + (d/t)), which is what I used earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for a rectangular notch, Kt can vary, but for a depth of a/t, where a is the notch depth and t is the thickness, Kt can be found from charts.\n\nGiven that a = 25 mm and t = 30 mm, a/t = 0.833.\n\nFrom stress concentration charts, for a U-notch (which a rectangular notch might be similar to), Kt can be around 4 to 5.\n\nBut perhaps I need a more precise value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula for stress concentration at a notch.\n\nFor a sharp V-notch, Kt = 1 + 2*(a/t), but for a U-notch, it's different.\n\nThis is getting complicated, and I might not have the exact formula for the notch.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the flexural formula: \u03c3 = M*y/I.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider the reduced section due to the hole and the notch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the stress without considering the stress concentration factors and see if that matches the options.\n\nEarlier, I calculated the bending stress as 10.835 MPa, and the compressive stress as 22.32 MPa, totaling 33.155 MPa.\n\nIf I ignore the stress concentration factors, this value is close to option B: 31.7 MPa and 34.83 MPa.\n\nMaybe the question expects us to calculate the stresses without considering the stress concentrations, or perhaps using different assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the forces are not combined in the way I thought.\n\nWait, the forces are applied horizontally, and the beam is rectangular, so perhaps there is shear stress involved as well.\n\nI have been focusing on compressive and bending stresses, but maybe shear stress is significant here.\n\nThe shear stress due to the applied forces can be calculated as V/Q, where V is the shear force and Q is the statical moment of area.\n\nBut this might complicate things further.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should select the closest option based on my calculations.\n\nSince I have 33.155 MPa as the total stress without considering stress concentrations, and option B is 31.7 MPa and 34.83 MPa, which are somewhat close, I might go with option B.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident about this answer, as my calculations don't perfectly match the options.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in my approach, and I need to consider a different method to solve this problem.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
