The beam is shown in light blue with a length \\( L \\) indicated below it. The beam is subjected to a uniform temperature change denoted as \\( \\Delta T \\). At each end of the beam, there are reaction forces labeled \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_B \\), represented by red arrows pointing away from the supports, indicating that the beam is under compression due to the temperature increase. The diagram is used to illustrate the concept of thermal stress in a beam when its temperature is uniformly increased.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA W 8 X 28 beam of a length 10 ft is held between immoveable supports.

Thermal stress occurs when a material is subjected to a temperature change and is restrained from expanding or contracting freely.\n\nGiven:\n- Beam type: W 8 x 28\n- Length, \\( L = 10 \\) ft\n- Modulus of elasticity, \\( E = 29,000 \\) ksi\n- Coefficient of thermal expansion, \\( \\alpha = 6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\) per \\( ^\\circ F \\)\n- Temperature increase, \\( \\Delta T = 20^\\circ F \\)\n\nFirst, we need to find the change in length due to the temperature increase if the beam were free to expand. This is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_T = \\alpha \\times L \\times \\Delta T\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_T = 6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10 \\times 20 = 6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 200 = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ ft}\n\\]\n\nSince the beam is held between two immovable supports, it cannot expand freely. Therefore, it will be under compression, and we need to calculate the thermal stress developed in the beam.\n\nThe formula for thermal stress is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_T = E \\times \\epsilon\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\epsilon \\) is the strain due to temperature change. Since the beam is restrained, the strain is equal to the change in length per unit length, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\delta_T}{L} = \\alpha \\times \\Delta T\n\\]\n\nThus, the thermal stress is:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_T = E \\times \\alpha \\times \\Delta T\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_T = 29,000 \\times 6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 \\):\n\n\\[\n6.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 20 = 130 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.00013 \\text{ ft/ft}\n\\]\n\nNow, multiply by E:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_T = 29,000 \\times 0.00013 = 29,000 \\times 0.00013 = 3.77 \\text{ ksi}\n\\]\n\nSince the beam is in compression, the stress is negative:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma_T = -3.77 \\text{ ksi}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the thermal stress in the beam is \\boxed{-3.77 \\text{ ksi}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{-3.77 \\text{ ksi}} \\]"
