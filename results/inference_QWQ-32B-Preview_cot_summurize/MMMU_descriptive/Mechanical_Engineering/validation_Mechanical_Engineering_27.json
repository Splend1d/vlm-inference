                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to find the force \\( F \\) applied at point A that is just sufficient to keep the gate from opening. The gate is a quarter-circle with a radius of 8 feet, submerged in water, and hinged at point B. The gate is 10 feet wide into the paper and weighs 3000 pounds-force (lbf).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Forces Acting on the Gate:**\n   - **Weight of the gate (W):** Acts downward at the center of mass of the gate.\n   - **Hydrostatic force (F\\_h):** Acts horizontally at the centroid of the submerged area.\n   - **Force F:** Applied vertically downward at point A.\n   - **Reaction at hinge B (R\\_B):** This will have both horizontal and vertical components.\n\n2. **Determine the Center of Mass (Centroid) of the Gate:**\n   Since the gate is a quarter-circle, its centroid can be found using the formula for the centroid of a quarter-circle:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{y} = \\bar{x} = \\frac{4r}{3\\pi}\n   \\]\n   where \\( r = 8 \\) feet.\n   \\[\n   \\bar{y} = \\bar{x} = \\frac{4 \\times 8}{3\\pi} = \\frac{32}{3\\pi} \\approx 3.39 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   So, the weight acts at a point 3.39 feet from B along the centerline of the gate.\n\n3. **Calculate the Hydrostatic Force:**\n   The hydrostatic force acts horizontally at the centroid of the submerged area. For a quarter-circle gate, the submerged area is a quarter-circle with radius 8 feet.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (8)^2 = 16\\pi \\text{ square feet}\n   \\]\n   The pressure at the centroid of the area is:\n   \\[\n   p = \\rho g h\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (62.4 lbf/ft\u00b3), and \\( h \\) is the depth of the centroid.\n   The centroid of a quarter-circle is at a depth of:\n   \\[\n   h = r - \\frac{4r}{3\\pi} = 8 - \\frac{32}{3\\pi} \\approx 8 - 3.39 = 4.61 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   p = 62.4 \\times 4.61 \\approx 287.66 \\text{ lbf/ft}^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the hydrostatic force is:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = p \\times \\text{Area} = 287.66 \\times 16\\pi \\approx 287.66 \\times 50.27 \\approx 14460 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   However, this seems too high. Let's recompute the pressure and force correctly.\n\n   **Correct Calculation:**\n   The correct formula for the hydrostatic force on a submerged surface is:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = \\rho g \\bar{h} A\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\bar{h} \\) is the depth of the centroid of the area.\n   For a quarter-circle, the centroid is at:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{y} = \\bar{x} = \\frac{4r}{3\\pi}\n   \\]\n   So, the depth \\( \\bar{h} = r - \\bar{y} = 8 - \\frac{32}{3\\pi} \\approx 8 - 3.39 = 4.61 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   Then,\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 62.4 \\times 4.61 \\times 16\\pi \\approx 62.4 \\times 4.61 \\times 50.27 \\approx 14460 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This seems consistent, but it's unusually high. Maybe I need to check the area calculation.\n\n   **Rechecking Area:**\n   The area of a quarter-circle is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (8)^2 = 16\\pi \\approx 50.27 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   Correct.\n\n   **Rechecking Pressure:**\n   Pressure at centroid:\n   \\[\n   p = \\rho g \\bar{h} = 62.4 \\times 4.61 \\approx 287.66 \\text{ lbf/ft}^2\n   \\]\n   Correct.\n\n   **Rechecking Force:**\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = p \\times A = 287.66 \\times 50.27 \\approx 14460 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This seems correct, but it's much higher than expected. Maybe I need to consider the width of the gate.\n\n   **Considering Width:**\n   The gate is 10 feet wide into the paper. So, the actual area is:\n   \\[\n   A = 16\\pi \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\approx 502.7 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   Then,\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 62.4 \\times 4.61 \\times 502.7 \\approx 144600 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This is even higher, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the width should not be multiplied here.\n\n   **Clarification:**\n   The width of 10 feet is into the paper, so the area for hydrostatic force is the projected area, which is the quarter-circle area times the width.\n   \\[\n   A = 16\\pi \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\approx 502.7 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   But this seems inconsistent with the options provided. Maybe the width is already considered in the force calculation.\n\n   **Alternative Approach:**\n   Perhaps the width is already accounted for in the force options, so we should consider the force per unit width.\n\n   Let's assume the width is 1 ft and then scale up.\n\n   For width = 1 ft:\n   \\[\n   A = 16\\pi \\times 1 = 16\\pi \\approx 50.27 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 62.4 \\times 4.61 \\times 16\\pi \\approx 14460 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   Then for width = 10 ft:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 14460 \\times 10 = 144600 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This is still too high.\n\n   **Possible Mistake:**\n   Maybe the hydrostatic force is not correctly calculated. Let's use the formula for hydrostatic force on a submerged surface:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = \\rho g \\bar{h} A\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is the area of the submerged surface.\n\n   Given that the gate is a quarter-circle with radius 8 ft and width 10 ft:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2 \\times \\text{width} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (8)^2 \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\approx 502.65 \\text{ ft}^3\n   \\]\n   Wait, area should be in ft\u00b2, not ft\u00b3. Correcting that:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2 \\times \\text{width} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (8)^2 \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\approx 502.65 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   Depth of centroid:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{h} = r - \\frac{4r}{3\\pi} = 8 - \\frac{32}{3\\pi} \\approx 8 - 3.397 = 4.603 \\text{ ft}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 62.4 \\times 4.603 \\times 502.65 \\approx 144,576 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This is still very high compared to the options provided. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\n   **Alternative Approach:**\n   Maybe the hydrostatic force should be calculated differently for a curved surface. Let's consider the horizontal and vertical components of the hydrostatic force.\n\n   For a curved surface, the horizontal component of the hydrostatic force is:\n   \\[\n   F\\_{hx} = \\rho g \\bar{h} A\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is the projected area onto the vertical plane.\n\n   The projected area for a quarter-circle gate would be the area of the rectangle formed by the height and width of the gate.\n\n   However, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\n4. **Moment\u5e73\u8861 around hinge B:**\n   To find the force \\( F \\), we can take moments around the hinge point B. The sum of moments around B should be zero for equilibrium.\n\n   Let's denote:\n   - \\( F \\): Force applied vertically downward at point A.\n   - \\( W \\): Weight of the gate, acting downward at the centroid.\n   - \\( F\\_h \\): Horizontal hydrostatic force acting at the centroid of the submerged area.\n   - \\( R\\_B \\): Reaction force at the hinge B, which has horizontal and vertical components \\( R\\_{Bx} \\) and \\( R\\_{By} \\).\n\n   Since the gate is in equilibrium, the sum of moments around B is zero:\n   \\[\n   \\sum M\\_B = 0\n   \\]\n\n   Let's calculate the moments due to each force:\n\n   - **Moment due to F:**\n     Force \\( F \\) is applied vertically downward at point A, which is at the top of the gate, 8 feet from B along the centerline.\n     The moment arm is the perpendicular distance from B to the line of action of F, which is 8 feet.\n     Since F is downward, the moment is clockwise.\n     \\[\n     M\\_F = F \\times 8 \\text{ ft} \\quad (\\text{clockwise})\n     \\]\n\n   - **Moment due to W:**\n     The weight \\( W = 3000 \\) lbf acts downward at the centroid of the gate, which is at a distance of \\( \\bar{y} = \\frac{4r}{3\\pi} = \\frac{32}{3\\pi} \\approx 3.397 \\) ft from B along the centerline.\n     The moment arm is 3.397 ft.\n     Since W is downward, the moment is clockwise.\n     \\[\n     M\\_W = 3000 \\times 3.397 \\approx 10,191 \\text{ ft-lbf} \\quad (\\text{clockwise})\n     \\]\n\n   - **Moment due to F\\_h:**\n     The horizontal hydrostatic force \\( F\\_h \\) acts at the centroid of the submerged area, which is at a depth of \\( \\bar{h} = r - \\frac{4r}{3\\pi} = 8 - 3.397 = 4.603 \\) ft.\n     However, since the gate is curved, the direction of \\( F\\_h \\) is horizontal, perpendicular to the centerline of the gate.\n     To find the moment arm for \\( F\\_h \\), we need to find the perpendicular distance from B to the line of action of \\( F\\_h \\).\n\n     The centroid is located at a distance of \\( \\bar{h} \\) vertically below B, but since the gate is curved, the actual position needs to be considered.\n\n     Perhaps it's better to consider the moments due to the horizontal and vertical components of the hydrostatic force separately.\n\n     **Horizontal component of hydrostatic force:**\n     The horizontal component \\( F\\_{hx} \\) acts horizontally outward at the centroid of the submerged area.\n     The moment arm is the vertical distance from B to the centroid, which is \\( \\bar{h} = 4.603 \\) ft.\n     The moment due to \\( F\\_{hx} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     M\\_{hx} = F\\_{hx} \\times \\bar{h} \\quad (\\text{counterclockwise})\n     \\]\n\n     **Vertical component of hydrostatic force:**\n     The vertical component \\( F\\_{hy} \\) acts vertically upward (buoyant force).\n     The moment arm is the horizontal distance from B to the centroid.\n     However, since the gate is curved, determining the exact direction and moment arm is complex.\n\n     This approach seems too involved. Maybe I should consider the total force and its line of action.\n\n   **Simplifying Assumption:**\n   Assuming that the hydrostatic force acts horizontally at the centroid of the submerged area, and considering the gate's geometry, perhaps I can find the moment due to \\( F\\_h \\) around B.\n\n   Given that, the moment due to \\( F\\_h \\) is:\n   \\[\n   M\\_{h} = F\\_h \\times \\text{moment arm}\n   \\]\n   The moment arm is the perpendicular distance from B to the line of action of \\( F\\_h \\).\n\n   Since \\( F\\_h \\) is horizontal and acts at the centroid, which is at a vertical distance of \\( \\bar{h} = 4.603 \\) ft from B, the moment arm is \\( \\bar{h} \\).\n\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   M\\_{h} = F\\_h \\times 4.603 \\quad (\\text{counterclockwise})\n   \\]\n\n   Now, equate the sum of moments to zero:\n   \\[\n   M\\_F + M\\_W - M\\_h = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F \\times 8 + 10,191 - F\\_h \\times 4.603 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   We need to find \\( F \\), but we still need to determine \\( F\\_h \\).\n\n   **Recalculating Hydrostatic Force:**\n   Let's recalculate the hydrostatic force more carefully.\n\n   The hydrostatic force on a submerged surface is given by:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = \\rho g \\bar{h} A\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( \\rho = 62.4 \\) lbf/ft\u00b3 (density of water)\n   - \\( g = 32.2 \\) ft/s\u00b2 (acceleration due to gravity)\n   - \\( \\bar{h} = 4.603 \\) ft (depth of centroid)\n   - \\( A = 160\\pi \\approx 502.65 \\) ft\u00b2 (area of the gate)\n\n   However, in English units, the formula simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = \\rho \\bar{h} A = 62.4 \\times 4.603 \\times 502.65 \\approx 144,576 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This seems excessively high. Perhaps there is a mistake in the area calculation.\n\n   **Correct Area Calculation:**\n   The area of the quarter-circle gate is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi r^2 \\times \\text{width} = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (8)^2 \\times 10 = 160\\pi \\approx 502.65 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   This seems correct.\n\n   **Alternative Approach:**\n   Maybe the hydrostatic force should be considered per unit width, considering the gate is 10 ft wide.\n\n   Let's consider the gate as having a unit width (1 ft), then scale up the force accordingly.\n\n   For unit width:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1}{4} \\pi (8)^2 = 16\\pi \\approx 50.27 \\text{ ft}^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 62.4 \\times 4.603 \\times 16\\pi \\approx 62.4 \\times 4.603 \\times 50.27 \\approx 14,458 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   Then for 10 ft width:\n   \\[\n   F\\_h = 14,458 \\times 10 = 144,580 \\text{ lbf}\n   \\]\n   This is still very high compared to the options provided.\n\n   **Possible Misunderstanding:**\n   It seems there is a misunderstanding in the calculation of the hydrostatic force. Perhaps the force should be calculated differently for a curved surface.\n\n   For a curved surface, the total hydrostatic force consists of a horizontal component and a vertical component (buoyant force).\n\n   The horizontal component is calculated as above, but the vertical component is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the gate.\n\n   However, this is getting too complicated for the given problem. Maybe there is a simpler way to approach this.\n\n5. **Considering Only Weight and Applied Force:**\n   Perhaps the hydrostatic force is negligible or already accounted for in the weight of the gate. However, that seems unlikely.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe the hydrostatic force is acting to close the gate, and the force \\( F \\) is needed to counteract the tendency of the gate to open due to the weight.\n\n   But given the earlier calculations, the hydrostatic force seems too large compared to the weight and the applied force options.\n\n   **Possible Error in Approach:**\n   Maybe I need to consider that the hydrostatic force has both horizontal and vertical components, and their moments around B.\n\n   Let's try to calculate both components.\n\n   **Horizontal Component of Hydrostatic Force:**\n   \\[\n   F\\_{hx} = \\rho g \\bar"
