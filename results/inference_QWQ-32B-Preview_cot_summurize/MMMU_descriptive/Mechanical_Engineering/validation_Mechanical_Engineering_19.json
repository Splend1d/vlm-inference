                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the stiffness of springs changes when they are cut and how the overall stiffness affects the natural period of a mass-spring system.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for a mass-spring system, the natural period \\( \\tau_n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{\\text{eff}}}}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( k_{\\text{eff}} \\) is the effective stiffness of the spring system.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the effective stiffness for Image 1\n\nIn Image 1, the spring is cut into two equal halves, each of length \\( \\frac{l}{2} \\), and connected in parallel to the mass \\( m \\), with fixed walls at both ends.\n\nWhen a spring of stiffness \\( k \\) is cut into two equal parts, each half has twice the stiffness of the original spring. This is because stiffness is inversely proportional to length. So, each half has a stiffness of \\( 2k \\).\n\nSince these two halves are connected in parallel, the effective stiffness \\( k_{\\text{eff1}} \\) is the sum of their individual stiffnesses:\n\n\\[\nk_{\\text{eff1}} = 2k + 2k = 4k\n\\]\n\nGiven that the natural period for this configuration is 0.5 seconds, we can write:\n\n\\[\n0.5 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for \\( m \\) in terms of \\( k \\)\n\nFrom the above equation:\n\n\\[\n0.5 = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.5}{2\\pi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{4k}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{0.5}{2\\pi} \\right)^2 = \\frac{m}{4k}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nm = 4k \\left( \\frac{0.5}{2\\pi} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nm = 4k \\left( \\frac{0.25}{4\\pi^2} \\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{k}{4\\pi^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the effective stiffness for Image 2\n\nIn Image 2, the spring is cut into two unequal parts: one is \\( \\frac{l}{4} \\) and the other is \\( \\frac{3l}{4} \\). Again, they are connected in parallel to the mass \\( m \\), with fixed walls at both ends.\n\nWhen a spring of stiffness \\( k \\) is cut into parts, the stiffness of each part is inversely proportional to its length. So:\n\n- The stiffness of the \\( \\frac{l}{4} \\) part is \\( k_1 = k \\times \\frac{l}{\\frac{l}{4}} = 4k \\)\n\n- The stiffness of the \\( \\frac{3l}{4} \\) part is \\( k_2 = k \\times \\frac{l}{\\frac{3l}{4}} = \\frac{4k}{3} \\)\n\nThe effective stiffness \\( k_{\\text{eff2}} \\) when these two springs are in parallel is:\n\n\\[\nk_{\\text{eff2}} = k_1 + k_2 = 4k + \\frac{4k}{3} = \\frac{12k + 4k}{3} = \\frac{16k}{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Find the natural period for Image 2\n\nUsing the expression for natural period:\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k_{\\text{eff2}}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( m = \\frac{k}{4\\pi^2} \\) and \\( k_{\\text{eff2}} = \\frac{16k}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{k}{4\\pi^2}}{\\frac{16k}{3}}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{4\\pi^2} \\times \\frac{3}{16k}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{64\\pi^2}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = 2\\pi \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8\\pi}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\tau_n = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\approx 0.433 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the natural period of the system in the second configuration is approximately 0.433 seconds, which corresponds to option B.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
