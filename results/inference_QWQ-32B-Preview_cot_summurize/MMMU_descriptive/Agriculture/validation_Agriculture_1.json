There are several small, green fruits hanging from the branches, which are typical of Mountain papayas. Additionally, there are clusters of small, green flowers or buds scattered throughout the tree. The overall structure of the tree appears to be robust and healthy, with no visible signs of disease or damage. The background shows more trees and foliage, indicating that this tree is part of a larger forested area.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> What causes these unusual formations on Mountain papaya?\n\nA.
