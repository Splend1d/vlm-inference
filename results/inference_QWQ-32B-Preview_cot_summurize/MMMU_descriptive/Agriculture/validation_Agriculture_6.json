The earthworms are elongated, segmented, and have a reddish-brown color. They are burrowing or moving through the dark, moist soil. Earthworms are known for their role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe picture below shows a common soil organism. This organism is classified as:<image 1>\n\nA. macro-fauna\nB. micro-fauna\nC. meso-fauna\nD. micro-flora\n"

Earthworms are described as elongated, segmented, and reddish-brown in color, burrowing or moving through dark, moist soil. They play a significant role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling.\n\nGiven these details, we need to classify this organism into one of the categories provided: macro-fauna, micro-fauna, meso-fauna, or micro-flora.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each term refers to:\n\n1. **Macro-fauna**: These are larger soil animals that are visible to the naked eye and play a significant role in soil structure and nutrient cycling. Examples include earthworms, insects, and arthropods.\n\n2. **Micro-fauna**: These are microscopic animals in the soil, such as protozoa and some nematodes, which are too small to be seen without a microscope.\n\n3. **Meso-fauna**: These are small soil animals that are visible but very small, such as mites, springtails, and small insects. They are typically between 0.1 and 2 mm in size.\n\n4. **Micro-flora**: These are microscopic plants in the soil, primarily bacteria and fungi, which are crucial for decomposition and nutrient cycling.\n\nGiven that earthworms are described as elongated, segmented, and visible to the naked eye, they fall into the category of macro-fauna. Their size and visibility, along with their significant role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling, align with the characteristics of macro-fauna.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. macro-fauna"
