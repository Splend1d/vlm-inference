The affected area appears to have a yellowish-green hue with some brown spots concentrated towards the center. The surrounding tissue of the leaf is also yellowish-green, indicating potential stress or damage. The overall appearance suggests a localized infection or lesion on the leaf surface.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> What does it signify if no fungal fruiting bodies are found in the area affected by the fungal pathogen, even when they grow on the host leaf?\n\nA. The cause is not a fungal pathogen.\nB. The cause is either bacterial or viral.\nC. The cause could be a fungal pathogen.\nD. It is an abiotic problem of some sort.\nE.

The cause could be a fungal pathogen.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **Option A:** \"The cause is not a fungal pathogen.\" This is incorrect because the presence of fungal growth on the host leaf indicates that a fungal pathogen is involved, even if fruiting bodies are not visible.\n\n- **Option B:** \"The cause is either bacterial or viral.\" This is too narrow, as the description suggests a fungal involvement, and the presence of fungal growth confirms this.\n\n- **Option C:** \"The cause could be a fungal pathogen.\" This is correct because fungal infections can cause discoloration and lesions on leaves without immediately showing fruiting bodies. Fungal pathogens often have latent periods or may produce structures that are not yet visible.\n\n- **Option D:** \"It is an abiotic problem of some sort.\" This is incorrect because abiotic problems typically do not involve biological growth such as fungi.\n\n- **Option E:** \"I don't know and I don't want to guess.\" This is not applicable since, based on the information provided, it is possible to make an informed choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The cause could be a fungal pathogen."
