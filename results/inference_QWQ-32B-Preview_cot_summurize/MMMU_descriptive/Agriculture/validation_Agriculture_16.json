The leaf has a green background with distinct brownish spots indicating the site of the infection. Surrounding these brown spots, there is a noticeable yellow area that appears to be a reaction to the infection. This yellow area is circular and encircles the infected spots, creating a halo-like effect around them. The rest of the leaf maintains its green coloration, but the presence of the yellow halo around the infected areas is prominent.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> What is the common term for the yellow area surrounding the site of an infection?\n\nA. I don't know and I don't want to guess\nB. Corona\nC. Border\nD. Halo\nE. Toxin zone\n"
