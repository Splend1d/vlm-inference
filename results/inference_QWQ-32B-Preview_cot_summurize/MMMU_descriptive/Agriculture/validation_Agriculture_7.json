The leaf has a powdery white coating on its surface, which is characteristic of a fungal infection. The veins of the leaf are prominently visible, and there are areas where the leaf tissue appears to be discolored or damaged. The powdery white coating is distributed unevenly across the leaf surface, with some areas appearing more heavily affected than others. The overall appearance suggests a fungal infection commonly associated with certain plant diseases.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> For anyone experienced in potato cultivation, this should be a straightforward issue. It's a global concern, but can you identify the root cause?\n\nA. Downy mildew\nB. Early blight (Alternaria solani)\nC. Don't know and don't want to guess\nD. Powdery mildew\nE.
