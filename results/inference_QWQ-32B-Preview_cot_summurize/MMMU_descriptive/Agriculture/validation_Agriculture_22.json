The tree is located by the roadside in Littondale, Yorkshire. The outgrowths appear to be rough and raised, with dark, almost blackened patches. Surrounding the trunk are green leaves and branches, indicating that the tree is still alive and growing. The background consists of more trees and foliage, suggesting a natural environment.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> What could be the reason for the corky outgrowths on a young ash tree by the roadside in Littondale, Yorkshire?\n\nA. Fungal disease\nB. Bacterial disease\nC. Don't know or not sure\nD. Genetic abnormality\nE. Insect feeding\n"

Ash trees are known to be susceptible to various fungal infections, which can cause abnormal growths on the trunk and branches. The dark, almost blackened patches mentioned in the description could be indicative of fungal activity. Therefore, option A. Fungal disease seems to be the most plausible reason for these outgrowths.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that without seeing the actual image, this is an educated guess based on the description. Other options like bacterial diseases or insect feeding could also potentially cause such symptoms, but the description points more towards a fungal infection. Genetic abnormalities are less likely to cause such localized and specific outgrowths.\n\nTo confirm the exact cause, one would need to examine the tree more closely, possibly collect samples for laboratory analysis, or consult with a local arborist or plant pathologist who is familiar with the common ailments affecting ash trees in Littondale, Yorkshire.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
