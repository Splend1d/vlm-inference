                    "text": "Let's see. So, there's this graph showing the supply and demand for gasoline. The x-axis is the quantity in millions of gallons, from 300 to 900, and the y-axis is the price per gallon from $0.60 to $2.20. There's a demand curve that slopes downward, meaning that as prices go down, people want to buy more gasoline. The supply curve slopes upward, meaning that as prices go up, suppliers are willing to supply more gasoline.\n\nThe equilibrium point is where these two curves cross, at $1.40 per gallon and 600 million gallons. That's where the amount people want to buy matches the amount suppliers want to sell.\n\nNow, the government decides to cap the price at $1.30, which is below the equilibrium price of $1.40. So, it's setting a maximum price that can be charged for gasoline.\n\nFrom what I understand, when a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, it usually leads to a situation where the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. That's because at a lower price, more people want to buy gasoline, but suppliers are less willing to supply it at that lower price.\n\nSo, in this case, at $1.30 per gallon, the quantity demanded would be higher than the quantity supplied, leading to a shortage.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. A price below $1.30 would cause excess demand and hence a surplus.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Excess demand usually leads to a shortage, not a surplus. A surplus is when there's more supply than demand.\n\nB. A price below $1.30 would cause excess demand and hence a shortage.\n\nThis seems correct. Excess demand means more people want to buy than suppliers are willing to sell, leading to a shortage.\n\nC. Not certain.\n\nWell, based on my understanding, I can make an educated guess here.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"the price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon,\" so the price is set at $1.30, which is below the equilibrium price of $1.40.\n\nFrom the description, it mentions that at a price below equilibrium ($1.20), there is excess demand or shortage. Similarly, at $1.30, which is still below the equilibrium price, I would expect the same situation: excess demand and shortage.\n\nSo, option B seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nExcess demand means that the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied at that price, which indeed would lead to a shortage.\n\nOption A says \"excess demand and hence a surplus,\" but that doesn't make sense because excess demand typically leads to a shortage, not a surplus.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B: A price below $1.30 would cause a situation of excess demand and hence a shortage.\n\nWait, but the price is being capped at $1.30, which is below the equilibrium, so it's a price ceiling below the equilibrium price, leading to excess demand and shortage.\n\nYes, that matches with option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
