The categories and their amounts are as follows:\n\n- Wages and Salaries: 1000\n- Consumption: 1700\n- Investment: 700\n- Depreciation: 50\n- Government Expenditure: 100\n- Taxes: 300\n- Exports: 50\n- Imports: 40\n- Income receipts from rest of the world: 10\n- Income payment to rest of the world: 50\n\nBased on this information, the net exports for China can be calculated by subtracting imports from exports. \n\nExports: 50\nImports: 40\n\nNet Exports = Exports - Imports\nNet Exports = 50 - 40\nNet Exports = 10\n\nTherefore, the net exports for China are 10 billion.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nConsider the following table showing the breakdown of GDP (in billions) for China.  <image 1> What are net exports for China? \n\nA. 10\nB. 5\nC. 20\n"

In this case:\n\nExports: 50 billion\n\nImports: 40 billion\n\nNet Exports = Exports - Imports = 50 - 40 = 10 billion\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
