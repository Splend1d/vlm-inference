The data in the table is as follows:\n\n- At a price of $11, the quantity demanded is 1 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 15 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $10, the quantity demanded is 2 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 12 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $9, the quantity demanded is 4 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 9 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $8, the quantity demanded is 6 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 6 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $7, the quantity demanded is 8 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 3 million Frisbees.\n- At a price of $6, the quantity demanded is 10 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 1 million Frisbees.\n\nFrom this data, we can see that the equilibrium price is $8, where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied at 6 million Frisbees. If a price floor is imposed $2 above the equilibrium price, the new market price would be $8 + $2 = $10. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 10.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA recent study found that the demand and supply schedules for Frisbees are as follows:<image 1> Frisbee manufacturers persuade the government that Frisbee production improves scientists' understanding of aerodynamics and thus is important for national security.

                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about Frisbees and price floors. Let me see if I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, there's a table that shows different prices per Frisbee and how many people want to buy them (quantity demanded) and how many are being made (quantity supplied). The table looks like this:\n\n- At $11, people want 1 million Frisbees, but manufacturers are making 15 million.\n\n- At $10, demand is 2 million, supply is 12 million.\n\n- At $9, demand is 4 million, supply is 9 million.\n\n- At $8, demand is 6 million, supply is also 6 million.\n\n- At $7, demand is 8 million, supply is 3 million.\n\n- At $6, demand is 10 million, supply is 1 million.\n\nSo, the equilibrium price is where the amount people want to buy matches the amount being made, which is at $8, with 6 million Frisbees.\n\nNow, the manufacturers say that making Frisbees is important for national security because it helps understand aerodynamics. Congress believes them and decides to set a price floor $2 above the equilibrium price. A price floor is a minimum price that can be charged for a product.\n\nSo, if the equilibrium price is $8, and the price floor is $2 above that, then the new minimum price is $8 + $2 = $10.\n\nLooking back at the table, at $10, the quantity demanded is 2 million Frisbees, and the quantity supplied is 12 million.\n\nSo, with a price floor at $10, the market price can't go below that. Suppliers have to sell Frisbees at $10 or higher.\n\nGiven that, the new market price would be $10, because that's the minimum allowed by the price floor.\n\nWait a minute, but in reality, if the price is set above the equilibrium, there might be a surplus because suppliers are making more than what people are willing to buy at that price. But in this question, they're asking for the new market price, and since the price floor sets a minimum, and there's no indication that the price will go higher than that, I think the new market price is $10.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 10.\n\nBut let me double-check. The options are:\n\nA. 8\n\nB. 9\n\nC. 10\n\nD. 11\n\nOption A is the equilibrium price without the price floor, so that's not it.\n\nOption B is $9, which is between the equilibrium and the price floor, but the price floor sets the minimum at $10, so prices can't be below that.\n\nOption C is $10, which matches the calculation.\n\nOption D is $11, which is higher than the price floor, but there's no reason for the market price to go up to $11 when $10 is the minimum allowed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 10.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
