The midpoint formula is preferred because it provides a more accurate measure of elasticity by taking the average of the initial and final values for price and quantity.\n\nThe formula for PED using the midpoint method is:\n\n\\[\nPED = \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\\% \\text{ change in price}}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[\n\\% \\text{ change in quantity demanded} = \\frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{(Q_1 + Q_2)/2} \\times 100\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\% \\text{ change in price} = \\frac{P_2 - P_1}{(P_1 + P_2)/2} \\times 100\n\\]\n\nGiven the data:\n\n- At P1 = $8, Q1 (income = $12,000) = 50 DVDs\n\n- At P2 = $10, Q2 (income = $12,000) = 45 DVDs\n\nFirst, calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded:\n\n\\[\n\\% \\text{ change in Q} = \\frac{45 - 50}{(50 + 45)/2} \\times 100 = \\frac{-5}{47.5} \\times 100 \\approx -10.53\\%\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the percentage change in price:\n\n\\[\n\\% \\text{ change in P} = \\frac{10 - 8}{(8 + 10)/2} \\times 100 = \\frac{2}{9} \\times 100 \\approx 22.22\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate PED:\n\n\\[\nPED = \\frac{-10.53\\%}{22.22\\%} \\approx -0.47\n\\]\n\nSince elasticity is usually expressed in absolute terms, we can say that the price elasticity of demand is approximately 0.47.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 0.47.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
