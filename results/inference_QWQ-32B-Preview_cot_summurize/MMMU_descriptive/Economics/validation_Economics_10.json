                    "text": "If the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, what would drive the market toward the equilibrium?\n\nLet's see. First, I need to understand what equilibrium means in this context. From the description, at $6, the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied, which is 81 pizzas. So, $6 is the equilibrium price.\n\nNow, if the actual price is above $6, say $7, $8, $9, etc., what happens? Let's look at the quantities.\n\nAt $7:\n\n- Quantity demanded: 68 pizzas\n\n- Quantity supplied: 98 pizzas\n\nSo, suppliers are willing to supply 98 pizzas, but consumers only want to buy 68 pizzas. That means there's an excess supply, right? Because suppliers are making more than what consumers are buying.\n\nSimilarly, at $8:\n\n- Quantity demanded: 53 pizzas\n\n- Quantity supplied: 110 pizzas\n\nAgain, excess supply.\n\nAnd at $9:\n\n- Quantity demanded: 39 pizzas\n\n- Quantity supplied: 121 pizzas\n\nStill excess supply.\n\nSo, when the price is above equilibrium, there's excess supply.\n\nNow, how does the market move back to equilibrium? Well, with excess supply, suppliers might start to lower their prices to sell the extra pizzas. As the price decreases, the quantity supplied decreases (since suppliers are less willing to supply at lower prices), and the quantity demanded increases (since consumers are more willing to buy at lower prices). This continues until the price reaches equilibrium where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.\n\nSo, in this case, it's the excess supply that drives the market back to equilibrium.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. excess supply\n\nB. excess demand\n\nC. both\n\nD. neither\n\nIt seems like the answer should be A. excess supply.\n\nBut let's think again. Is there any role for excess demand in this scenario? Well, excess demand would occur if the price were below equilibrium, where quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied. But in this case, the price is above equilibrium, leading to excess supply, not demand.\n\nTherefore, only excess supply is driving the market back to equilibrium in this situation.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. excess supply.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
