The strategies available to each firm are \"Low output\" and \"High output.\" The payoffs, represented as profits, are shown in a table with Firm 1's strategies listed vertically on the left side and Firm 2's strategies listed horizontally at the top.\n\nThe payoffs are as follows:\n\n- If both firms choose \"Low output,\" the profit for each firm is 3.\n- If Firm 1 chooses \"Low output\" and Firm 2 chooses \"High output,\" the profit for Firm 1 is 0 and for Firm 2 is 5.\n- If Firm 1 chooses \"High output\" and Firm 2 chooses \"Low output,\" the profit for Firm 1 is 5 and for Firm 2 is 0.\n- If both firms choose \"High output,\" the profit for each firm is 2.\n\nAdditionally, there is a note indicating that \"Low output\" leads to a \"High price\" and \"High output\" leads to a \"Low price.\"\n\nBased on this information, the dominant strategy can be determined by analyzing the payoffs for each firm under different scenarios.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nConsider a prisoners' dilemma game by two oligopolist, which strategy is dominant? <image 1>\n\nA. Dominant strategy is 'High output' (low price) for both firms.\nB. Dominant strategy is 'Low output' (high price) for both firms.\nC. Dominant strategy is 'High output' (low price) for one of the firms and 'Low output' (high price) for the other.\n"

This is because, regardless of what the other firm does, each firm earns a higher profit by choosing \"High output.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nFor Firm 1:\n\n- If Firm 2 chooses \"Low output,\" Firm 1 gets 0 by choosing \"Low output\" and 5 by choosing \"High output.\" So, \"High output\" is better.\n\n- If Firm 2 chooses \"High output,\" Firm 1 gets 2 by choosing \"Low output\" and 2 by choosing \"High output.\" So, both choices give the same profit, but since \"High output\" is at least as good as \"Low output,\" it can be considered dominant.\n\nFor Firm 2:\n\n- If Firm 1 chooses \"Low output,\" Firm 2 gets 0 by choosing \"Low output\" and 5 by choosing \"High output.\" So, \"High output\" is better.\n\n- If Firm 1 chooses \"High output,\" Firm 2 gets 2 by choosing \"Low output\" and 2 by choosing \"High output.\" Again, both choices give the same profit, but \"High output\" is at least as good as \"Low output.\"\n\nTherefore, the dominant strategy is 'High output' (low price) for both firms.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
