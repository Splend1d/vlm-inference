The x-axis represents Real GDP in billions, ranging from 0 to 1100. The y-axis represents the Price Level, ranging from 0 to 1100. \n\nThere are three lines on the graph:\n1. **AD (Aggregate Demand)**: This line is downward sloping, starting at the top left corner and ending at the bottom right corner.\n2. **SRAS (Short-Run Aggregate Supply)**: This line is upward sloping, starting at the bottom left corner and ending at the top right corner.\n3. **LRAS (Long-Run Aggregate Supply)**: This line is vertical, intersecting the SRAS line at a point where the Real GDP is 500.\n\nThe intersection of the AD and SRAS lines determines the short-run equilibrium. At this point, the Real GDP is 500.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe graph below shows the AD-AS diagram for Spain. All numbers are in billions. <image 1> What is the size of real GDP in the short-run equilibrium?\n\nA. 500\nB. 450\nC. 400\nD. 600\n"

The Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) is a vertical line at Real GDP of 500 billion, intersecting the SRAS line at that point.\n\nIn the short-run equilibrium, the economy operates where AD meets SRAS. According to the description, this intersection occurs at Real GDP of 500 billion.\n\nTherefore, the size of real GDP in the short-run equilibrium is 500 billion.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{500} \\]"
