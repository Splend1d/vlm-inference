                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to understand how banks operate in terms of reserves and loans, and how changes in deposits affect the money supply, specifically M1.\n\nFirst, let's look at the initial balance sheet for TD:\n\n**Assets:**\n\n- Reserves: $493\n\n- Loans: $2,407\n\n**Liabilities:**\n\n- Deposits: $2,900\n\nThis tells us that TD has $493 in reserves and has lent out $2,407 to borrowers. The total assets match the total liabilities, which is $2,900.\n\nNow, we're told that TD is a typical bank that keeps only the required reserves. This means that any reserves beyond the required amount are excess reserves, which banks can lend out.\n\nWhen someone deposits $700 into TD, the bank's reserves increase by $700, assuming this is a new deposit. So, the new reserves would be $493 + $700 = $1,193.\n\nHowever, since TD only keeps required reserves, any excess reserves will be lent out, which in turn creates more deposits through the money multiplication process.\n\nTo find out the total change in M1 money supply, we need to determine the money multiplier and then calculate the change in money supply based on the initial change in reserves.\n\nThe money multiplier (m) is given by the formula:\n\nm = 1 / rr\n\nwhere rr is the required reserve ratio.\n\nBut we don't have the required reserve ratio directly provided. We need to find it using the initial balance sheet.\n\nFrom the initial balance sheet:\n\nReserves = $493\n\nDeposits = $2,900\n\nSo, the required reserve ratio (rr) is:\n\nrr = Reserves / Deposits = 493 / 2900 \u2248 0.17 or 17%\n\nNow, the money multiplier (m) is:\n\nm = 1 / 0.17 \u2248 5.88\n\nThis means that for every dollar of reserves, the banking system can create approximately $5.88 in money supply.\n\nBut wait, we need to consider that the initial deposit of $700 increases reserves by $700, and through the money multiplication process, the total money supply can increase by m times the initial change in reserves.\n\nHowever, there's a catch. The money multiplication process assumes that banks lend out their excess reserves, which then get deposited in other banks, and the process continues.\n\nBut in this case, TD is only keeping required reserves, so any excess reserves will be lent out.\n\nLet's calculate the required reserves after the new deposit:\n\nRequired reserves = rr * total deposits after new deposit\n\nTotal deposits after new deposit = original deposits + new deposit = 2900 + 700 = $3,600\n\nRequired reserves = 0.17 * 3600 = $612\n\nBut TD's reserves after the new deposit are $1,193, which is more than the required reserves of $612. So, the excess reserves are:\n\nExcess reserves = total reserves - required reserves = 1193 - 612 = $581\n\nThese excess reserves can be lent out, which will create new deposits in other banks, leading to further lending and money creation.\n\nThe total change in money supply can be calculated as:\n\nChange in money supply = money multiplier * change in reserves\n\nBut the change in reserves is the initial new deposit of $700, assuming that all excess reserves are lent out and the process continues.\n\nHowever, to be precise, the change in money supply is based on the change in excess reserves.\n\nWait, actually, the formula for the change in money supply is:\n\nChange in money supply = m * change in reserves\n\nwhere m is the money multiplier and change in reserves is the initial change in reserves.\n\nIn this case, the initial change in reserves is $700.\n\nSo, change in money supply = 5.88 * 700 \u2248 $4,116\n\nBut the options provided are:\n\nA. $4,118\n\nB. $3,418\n\nC. $700\n\nD. $5,118\n\nSo, option A is closest to our calculation of $4,116.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a slight miscalculation in the required reserve ratio.\n\nLet's double-check the required reserve ratio.\n\nInitial reserves: $493\n\nInitial deposits: $2,900\n\nrr = 493 / 2900 \u2248 0.17\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nMoney multiplier m = 1 / 0.17 \u2248 5.88\n\nChange in money supply = 5.88 * 700 = 4,116\n\nGiven that, option A is $4,118, which is very close to our calculation, possibly due to rounding differences.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. $4,118.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that only excess reserves lead to money multiplication, not the entire new deposit.\n\nIn that case, the initial change in reserves is $700, but only the excess reserves are lent out and create new money.\n\nWait, no. The standard formula is change in money supply equals money multiplier times change in reserves.\n\nBut perhaps in this context, it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the change in reserves as the excess reserves.\n\nBut according to the standard model, change in money supply equals m times change in reserves, where m is 1 / rr.\n\nSo, sticking to that, the answer should be A. $4,118.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
