The vertical axis represents the price level, while the horizontal axis represents real output (rY). There are three main curves in the graph:\n\n1. **AD Curve**: This is the aggregate demand curve, which slopes downward from left to right. It shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy.\n\n2. **SRAS Curve**: This is the short-run aggregate supply curve, which slopes upward from left to right. It shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied in the short run.\n\n3. **LRAS Curve**: This is the long-run aggregate supply curve, which is vertical. It represents the potential output of the economy in the long run, where all prices and wages have adjusted fully.\n\nPoint A is the intersection of the AD curve and the SRAS curve, indicating the current equilibrium in the economy. The LRAS curve intersects the SRAS curve at this point, suggesting that the economy is currently at its long-run equilibrium.\n\nGiven this setup, if the economy faces a boom (an increase in aggregate demand), the AD curve would shift to the right. However, the question asks how the economy returns to long-run equilibrium if wages are flexible. \n\nIn the context of flexible wages, if there is a boom, wages will adjust to bring the economy back to its long-run equilibrium. Specifically, if wages are flexible, they will rise to reduce the excess demand and bring the economy back to its long-run potential output.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\nB. Wages will rise.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nQuestion about the following graph: How can an economy return to the long-run equilibrium if it faces a boom and if wages are flexible? <image 1>\n\nA. Wages will fall.\nB. Wages will rise.\nC. Wages will remain unchanged.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the economy is initially at long-run equilibrium, where the aggregate demand (AD) curve intersects both the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve and the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve at point A. This indicates that the economy is producing at its potential output level, with no inflationary or deflationary pressures.\n\nNow, suppose the economy faces a boom, which is an increase in aggregate demand. This would cause the AD curve to shift to the right, leading to a new short-run equilibrium at a higher price level and higher output. However, this new equilibrium is not sustainable in the long run because it exceeds the economy's potential output.\n\nIf wages are flexible, they will adjust to bring the economy back to its long-run equilibrium. In this scenario, the increase in demand would lead to higher prices for goods and services. Firms, facing higher prices, would be willing to hire more workers and increase production in the short run, but only up to the point where wages also increase.\n\nAs wages rise, the cost of production for firms increases, which reduces their profit margins. This causes the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift upward and to the left, reflecting higher prices and lower output. This process continues until the economy returns to its long-run equilibrium, where the AD curve intersects both the SRAS and LRAS curves at the potential output level.\n\nTherefore, in the context of flexible wages, wages will rise in response to the boom to bring the economy back to its long-run equilibrium. This adjustment ensures that the economy does not sustain output above its potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Wages will rise.\n\nThis answer aligns with the principles of macroeconomics, particularly the concept of wage flexibility in the long run. Flexible wages act as a mechanism to adjust the economy back to its potential output by influencing the cost of production and, consequently, the aggregate supply.\n\nIt's important to note that if wages were inflexible, the economy might stay at the higher price level and output level for a longer period, potentially leading to sustained inflation. However, in the scenario described, with flexible wages, the economy self-corrects to the long-run equilibrium.\n\nIn summary, the flexibility of wages plays a crucial role in ensuring that the economy returns to its long-run equilibrium after a shock like a boom in aggregate demand. The rise in wages helps to align the economy's actual output with its potential output, maintaining price stability and full employment in the long run."
