But perhaps there's a misunderstanding because the options suggest a different answer. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the supply schedule is not constant at 8,000 for all prices. Perhaps it's increasing with price, but in the initial description, it seems that supply is fixed at 8,000 for all price levels given. If that's the case, then indeed, equilibrium is at $12.\n\nBut perhaps the supply schedule changes with price, and I need to consider that. Let me check the initial description again.\n\nThe first image shows a table with three columns: PRICE, QUANTITY DEMANDED, and QUANTITY SUPPLIED.\n\nPrices listed are $4, $8, $12, $16, and $20.\n\nQuantities:\n\n- At $4: 10,000 demanded, 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $8: 8,000 demanded, 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $12: 6,000 demanded, 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $16: 4,000 demanded, 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $20: 2,000 demanded, 8,000 supplied\n\nThis suggests that supply is fixed at 8,000 for all price levels, which is unusual because typically supply increases with price. Maybe it's a fixed supply in the short run.\n\nGiven that, adding the new demand:\n\n- At $4: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000 demanded; 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $8: 8,000 + 3,000 = 11,000 demanded; 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $12: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000 demanded; 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $16: 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000 demanded; 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $20: 2,000 + 0 = 2,000 demanded; 8,000 supplied\n\nSo, equilibrium is at $12, where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied at 8,000.\n\nBut the options include $11 and $13, which are not in the original price list. Maybe the supply schedule is not fixed, and I need to interpolate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the supply schedule is not provided correctly, and I need to consider that supply increases with price.\n\nLet me consider that supply might be increasing with price, and perhaps the initial table shows only the equilibrium point, and supply changes with price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the supply is fixed at 8,000, and the price adjusts to clear the market.\n\nIn that case, with the new total demand:\n\n- At $4: 14,000 > 8,000 \u2192 price will rise\n\n- At $8: 11,000 > 8,000 \u2192 price will rise\n\n- At $12: 8,000 = 8,000 \u2192 equilibrium at $12\n\n- At $16: 5,000 < 8,000 \u2192 price will fall\n\n- At $20: 2,000 < 8,000 \u2192 price will fall\n\nSo, indeed, equilibrium is at $12.\n\nBut since the options include $11 and $13, perhaps the supply schedule is not fixed, and I need to estimate between the given prices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the supply schedule is not provided correctly, and I need to consider a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the supply schedule is not fixed at 8,000 for all prices. Maybe it's increasing with price, and the initial table shows the quantities at different prices.\n\nLet me assume that the supply schedule is as follows:\n\n- At $4: 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $8: 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $12: 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $16: 8,000 supplied\n\n- At $20: 8,000 supplied\n\nIf supply is fixed at 8,000 regardless of price, then equilibrium occurs where total demand equals 8,000.\n\nFrom the new total demand schedule:\n\n- At $12: 8,000 demanded\n\nTherefore, equilibrium is at $12.\n\nBut since the options include $11 and $13, perhaps the supply schedule is not fixed, and I need to interpolate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the options provided.\n\nGiven the information provided, the equilibrium price is $12.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{12} \\]"
