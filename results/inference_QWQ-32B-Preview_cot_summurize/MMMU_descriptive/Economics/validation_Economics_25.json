So, the current equilibrium price is $8, and the equilibrium quantity is 8,000 tickets.\n\n3. **Account for the new students:**\n   - The college is increasing enrollment by 5,000 students, who have their own demand schedule for basketball tickets.\n\n4. **Combine the old demand schedule and the new students' demand schedule:**\n   - For each price point, add the quantity demanded by the old students and the quantity demanded by the new students to get the total quantity demanded.\n\n5. **Create the new demand schedule:**\n   - At $4:\n     - Old demand: 10,000\n     - New students' demand: 4,000\n     - Total demand: 10,000 + 4,000 = 14,000\n   - At $8:\n     - Old demand: 8,000\n     - New students' demand: 3,000\n     - Total demand: 8,000 + 3,000 = 11,000\n   - At $12:\n     - Old demand: 6,000\n     - New students' demand: 2,000\n     - Total demand: 6,000 + 2,000 = 8,000\n   - At $16:\n     - Old demand: 4,000\n     - New students' demand: 1,000\n     - Total demand: 4,000 + 1,000 = 5,000\n   - At $20:\n     - Old demand: 2,000\n     - New students' demand: 0\n     - Total demand: 2,000 + 0 = 2,000\n\n6. **Determine the new equilibrium:**\n   - The supply schedule remains unchanged:\n     - At $4: 8,000\n     - At $8: 8,000\n     - At $12: 8,000\n     - At $16: 8,000\n     - At $20: 8,000\n   - Equilibrium occurs where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.\n   - Looking at the new demand schedule:\n     - At $4: Demand = 14,000; Supply = 8,000 \u2192 Surplus of 6,000\n     - At $8: Demand = 11,000; Supply = 8,000 \u2192 Surplus of 3,000\n     - At $12: Demand = 8,000; Supply = 8,000 \u2192 Equilibrium\n     - At $16: Demand = 5,000; Supply = 8,000 \u2192 Shortage of 3,000\n     - At $20: Demand = 2,000; Supply = 8,000 \u2192 Shortage of 6,000\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The new equilibrium is at $12, where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied at 8,000 tickets.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the new equilibrium quantity, and the options provided are:\nA. 6000\nB. 7000\nC. 8000\nD. 9000\n\nBased on the calculation, the new equilibrium quantity is 8,000 tickets.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
