Curve 2 is a downward-sloping line that intersects several points labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Point B is located at an unemployment rate of approximately 6% and an inflation rate of approximately 3%.\n\nIf the economy starts at point B and the money supply growth rate increases, in the long run, the economy would move along Curve 2. Since Curve 2 is downward sloping, an increase in the money supply growth rate would typically lead to higher inflation and lower unemployment. Therefore, the economy would move to a point with a higher inflation rate and a lower unemployment rate than point B.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. moves to C.\nB. moves to D.\nC. stays at B.\n\nThe correct answer is:\nA. moves to C.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> If the economy starts at B and the money supply growth rate increases, in the long run the economy\n\nA. moves to C.\nB. moves to D.\nC. stays at B.\n"

Here's why:\n\nThe graph has two curves: Curve 1, which is a vertical line at about 6% unemployment, and Curve 2, which is downward sloping and passes through points A, B, C, D, and E. Point B is at approximately 6% unemployment and 3% inflation.\n\nWhen the money supply growth rate increases, in the long run, according to the description, the economy moves along Curve 2. Since Curve 2 is downward sloping, an increase in the money supply growth rate typically leads to higher inflation and lower unemployment.\n\nStarting at point B, with an increase in the money supply growth rate, the economy would move to a point on Curve 2 that has higher inflation and lower unemployment. Looking at the options:\n\n- A. moves to C: This likely implies moving to a point with higher inflation and lower unemployment.\n\n- B. moves to D: This might imply moving in a different direction, possibly not aligning with the described movement.\n\n- C. stays at B: This suggests no change, which contradicts the expected movement due to the increase in money supply growth rate.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct choice, assuming that point C is positioned at a higher inflation rate and lower unemployment rate than point B on Curve 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{a} \\]"
