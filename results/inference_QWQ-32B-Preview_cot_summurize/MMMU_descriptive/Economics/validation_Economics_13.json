The table provides data on the prices of Apples and Textbooks in Japan for three years: 2014, 2015, and 2016. Here is the detailed description of the table:\n\n- The first column is labeled \"Year.\"\n- The second column is labeled \"Price of Apples.\"\n- The third column is labeled \"Price of Textbooks.\"\n\nThe data in the table is as follows:\n\n| Year | Price of Apples | Price of Textbooks |\n|------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| 2014 | $1.40           | 200                |\n| 2015 | $1.10           | 140                |\n| 2016 | $1.10           | 200                |\n\nBased on this description, you can answer the question regarding the price of the basket in 2014.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nSuppose that a typical market based in Japan consists of 200 Apples and 290 Textbooks.

The basket consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- In 2014, the price of apples is $1.40 each.\n\n- In 2014, the price of textbooks is 200 (assuming this is in yen, but since the prices are given in dollars for apples, we might need to clarify the currency. However, for this calculation, I'll assume that the prices are consistent in terms of currency.)\n\nFirst, calculate the cost of apples in the basket for 2014:\n\nCost of apples = number of apples * price per apple\n\nCost of apples = 200 * $1.40\n\nCost of apples = $280\n\nNext, calculate the cost of textbooks in the basket for 2014:\n\nCost of textbooks = number of textbooks * price per textbook\n\nCost of textbooks = 290 * 200\n\nCost of textbooks = 58,000 (assuming the currency is yen, but for consistency, let's assume it's dollars)\n\nNow, add the cost of apples and textbooks to get the total price of the basket in 2014:\n\nTotal price = cost of apples + cost of textbooks\n\nTotal price = $280 + $58,000\n\nTotal price = $58,280\n\nTherefore, the price of the basket in 2014 is $58,280.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
