                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we've got the residents of Whoville who love drinking Zlurp, and each resident has a specific willingness to pay for each bottle. The willingness to pay decreases with each additional bottle, which makes sense as they might get less utility from each subsequent bottle.\n\nFirst, let's understand the initial situation before the tax is imposed. The cost of producing Zlurp is $1.50, and the competitive suppliers sell it at this price. Since the supply curve is horizontal at $1.50, it means that suppliers are willing to supply any quantity at this price, and no higher.\n\nNow, Mayor Grinch imposes a $1 tax on Zlurp. This tax will affect the price that consumers pay and the price that suppliers receive. Typically, in such scenarios, the tax is shared between consumers and producers, depending on the price elasticities of demand and supply. However, since the supply curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal), the entire tax burden will fall on the consumers. This is because suppliers are unwilling to accept any price below $1.50 + $1 = $2.50, but since the supply curve is horizontal at $1.50, they will only supply if the price reaches $2.50. Therefore, the price that consumers pay will increase by the full amount of the tax, from $1.50 to $2.50, and suppliers will still receive $1.50 per bottle.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many bottles each resident will buy after the tax is imposed. We look at their willingness to pay for each bottle and compare it to the new price of $2.50.\n\nLet's list the willingness to pay for each bottle:\n\n1. First bottle: $5\n\n2. Second bottle: $4\n\n3. Third bottle: $3\n\n4. Fourth bottle: $2\n\n5. Fifth bottle: $1\n\n6. Further bottles: $0\n\nNow, at the new price of $2.50, a resident will buy all bottles for which their willingness to pay is greater than or equal to $2.50.\n\nLooking at the list:\n\n- First bottle: $5 \u2265 $2.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Second bottle: $4 \u2265 $2.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Third bottle: $3 \u2265 $2.50 \u2192 buy\n\n- Fourth bottle: $2 \u2265 $2.50 \u2192 do not buy\n\n- Fifth bottle: $1 < $2.50 \u2192 do not buy\n\n- Further bottles: $0 < $2.50 \u2192 do not buy\n\nSo, each resident will buy 3 bottles at $2.50 each.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the external cost. The external cost is typically the cost imposed on society that is not borne by the individuals involved in the transaction. In this case, the tax is $1 per bottle, and it's imposed on the consumers.\n\nHowever, the question is a bit unclear about what is meant by \"external cost.\" In standard economic terms, external cost refers to the cost imposed on a third party as a result of an economic activity. In this scenario, the tax is imposed by the mayor, and it's paid by the consumers. The suppliers receive $1.50 per bottle, as before, and the government collects $1 per bottle in tax.\n\nPerhaps the external cost here refers to the deadweight loss caused by the tax, which is the loss in total surplus (consumer plus producer surplus) that is not captured by the government as tax revenue.\n\nTo calculate the deadweight loss, we need to find the change in consumer surplus and producer surplus and subtract the tax revenue.\n\nFirst, let's find the consumer surplus before and after the tax.\n\nBefore the tax:\n\n- Price is $1.50\n\n- Willingness to pay for the first 3 bottles is $5, $4, and $3\n\n- Consumer surplus for each bottle:\n\n- First bottle: $5 - $1.50 = $3.50\n\n- Second bottle: $4 - $1.50 = $2.50\n\n- Third bottle: $3 - $1.50 = $1.50\n\n- Total consumer surplus per resident: $3.50 + $2.50 + $1.50 = $7.50\n\nAfter the tax:\n\n- Price is $2.50\n\n- Willingness to pay for the first 3 bottles is $5, $4, and $3\n\n- Consumer surplus for each bottle:\n\n- First bottle: $5 - $2.50 = $2.50\n\n- Second bottle: $4 - $2.50 = $1.50\n\n- Third bottle: $3 - $2.50 = $0.50\n\n- Total consumer surplus per resident: $2.50 + $1.50 + $0.50 = $4.50\n\nChange in consumer surplus: $4.50 - $7.50 = -$3.00\n\nNow, let's find the producer surplus before and after the tax.\n\nBefore the tax:\n\n- Price is $1.50\n\n- Cost of production is $1.50\n\n- Producer surplus per bottle: $1.50 - $1.50 = $0\n\n- Total producer surplus per resident: 0\n\nAfter the tax:\n\n- Price received by suppliers is still $1.50\n\n- Cost of production is $1.50\n\n- Producer surplus per bottle: $1.50 - $1.50 = $0\n\n- Total producer surplus per resident: 0\n\nChange in producer surplus: 0\n\nTax revenue per resident: $1 per bottle * 3 bottles = $3.00\n\nNow, deadweight loss is the change in total surplus minus the tax revenue.\n\nChange in total surplus: change in consumer surplus + change in producer surplus = -$3.00 + 0 = -$3.00\n\nDeadweight loss: change in total surplus - tax revenue = -$3.00 - $3.00 = -$6.00\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Deadweight loss should be the area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves beyond the new quantity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is simply the tax amount, which is $1 per bottle, and since each resident buys 3 bottles, the total external cost per resident is $1 * 3 = $3.\n\nBut the options are 1, 2, 3, 4, so maybe it's $3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps external cost refers to the reduction in consumer surplus, which is $3.00.\n\nBut I think the most standard interpretation is that the external cost is the deadweight loss.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the deadweight loss.\n\nLet's try to graph this.\n\nSince the supply curve is horizontal at $1.50, and the demand curve is step-shaped based on the willingness to pay.\n\nBefore the tax, the equilibrium is at price $1.50, and quantity is 3 bottles per resident.\n\nAfter the tax, the price paid by consumers is $2.50, and the price received by producers is $1.50, as before.\n\nThe quantity demanded at $2.50 is 3 bottles, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut actually, looking back, at $2.50, the willingness to pay for the fourth bottle is $2, which is less than $2.50, so they don't buy it. So, they buy up to the third bottle.\n\nWait, but the third bottle has a willingness to pay of $3, which is greater than $2.50, so they buy it.\n\nThe fourth bottle has a willingness to pay of $2, which is less than $2.50, so they don't buy it.\n\nSo, quantity demanded is 3 bottles at $2.50.\n\nNow, deadweight loss is the area of the triangle between the demand and supply curves beyond the new quantity.\n\nIn this case, since the supply curve is horizontal at $1.50, and the demand curve steps down at each bottle, we need to calculate the area where the demand is above the supply plus tax.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of consumer and producer surplus.\n\nBefore the tax:\n\n- Consumer surplus: $7.50 per resident\n\n- Producer surplus: $0 per resident\n\nAfter the tax:\n\n- Consumer surplus: $4.50 per resident\n\n- Producer surplus: $0 per resident\n\n- Tax revenue: $3.00 per resident\n\nChange in total surplus: $4.50 + $0 - $7.50 - $0 = -$3.00\n\nTax revenue: $3.00\n\nDeadweight loss: change in total surplus - tax revenue = -$3.00 - $3.00 = -$6.00\n\nThis doesn't make sense because deadweight loss can't be negative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps deadweight loss is just the change in total surplus without considering tax revenue.\n\nWait, no, deadweight loss is the loss in total surplus that is not captured by the tax revenue.\n\nSo, in this case, the loss in consumer surplus is $3.00, and there is no change in producer surplus. The tax revenue is $3.00, which is captured by the government.\n\nTherefore, the deadweight loss is the loss in consumer surplus that is not offset by tax revenue, which is $3.00 - $3.00 = $0.\n\nBut that can't be right because imposing a tax usually creates deadweight loss.\n\nWait, perhaps in this specific case, where the supply curve is perfectly elastic, the deadweight loss is zero because the producers' surplus doesn't change, and the tax revenue exactly offsets the loss in consumer surplus.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right either, because there is a reduction in consumer surplus that is not compensated by any increase in producer surplus or tax revenue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deadweight loss is the area between the demand curve and the supply curve plus tax, from the new quantity to the old quantity.\n\nBut in this case, since the quantity remains the same (3 bottles), there is no change in quantity, so the deadweight loss would be zero.\n\nWait, but if the quantity demanded is the same after the tax, then there is no deadweight loss.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because usually, a tax introduces deadweight loss by distorting prices and reducing the quantity traded.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, since the supply curve is perfectly elastic, the quantity demanded doesn't change despite the price increase, because the suppliers are willing to supply any quantity at $1.50, and the tax is entirely passed on to consumers.\n\nBut according to the demand schedule, at $2.50, they still buy 3 bottles, even though the fourth bottle has a willingness to pay of $2, which is less than $2.50.\n\nSo, the quantity demanded remains 3 bottles, same as before.\n\nTherefore, there is no deadweight loss in this specific case.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a deadweight loss, but I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the external cost is not the deadweight loss, but the tax revenue itself.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because tax revenue is captured by the government, not a cost to society.\n\nAlternatively, maybe external cost refers to the excess burden of the tax, which is another term for deadweight loss.\n\nBut as per my earlier calculation, it seems to be zero in this case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is the amount by which the tax exceeds the marginal cost.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps the external cost is the difference between the price paid by consumers and the marginal cost of production.\n\nMarginal cost is $1.50, and price paid is $2.50, so the external cost per bottle is $2.50 - $1.50 = $1.00, which is the tax amount.\n\nSince each resident buys 3 bottles, the total external cost per resident is $1 * 3 = $3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the external cost is only the amount by which the tax reduces the consumer surplus, which is $3.00, as calculated earlier.\n\nBut according to the standard definition, external cost is the deadweight loss, which in this case seems to be zero.\n\nHowever, given the options and the possible confusion in the question, perhaps the intended answer is C. 3\n\nI'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{3} \\]"
