                    "text": "So I have this problem here about calculating the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for the year 2015, and it's set in Japan. The base year is 2015, which makes things a bit straightforward because in CPI calculations, the base year always has an index of 100. But let's make sure I understand all the parts here.\n\nFirst, there's a typical market basket that consists of 200 apples and 290 textbooks. Then, there's a table showing the prices of apples and textbooks for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The prices are:\n\n- 2014: Apples $1.40, Textbooks $200\n\n- 2015: Apples $1.10, Textbooks $140\n\n- 2016: Apples $1.10, Textbooks $200\n\nThe question is asking for the CPI in 2015, with 2015 as the base year. The options are 100, 200, 300, or 400.\n\nOkay, so CPI is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Cost of market basket in current year}}{\\text{Cost of market basket in base year}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSince 2015 is the base year, the cost in the base year would be the cost of the market basket in 2015, using 2015 prices.\n\nSo, let's calculate the cost of the market basket in 2015:\n\n- Cost of apples in 2015: 200 apples * $1.10 = $220\n\n- Cost of textbooks in 2015: 290 textbooks * $140 = $40,600\n\n- Total cost in 2015: $220 + $40,600 = $40,820\n\nNow, since 2015 is the base year, the CPI in 2015 is:\n\n\\[ \\text{CPI}_{2015} = \\left( \\frac{40,820}{40,820} \\right) \\times 100 = 100 \\]\n\nSo, the CPI in 2015 should be 100.\n\nWait a minute, but let's double-check if there's any trick here. Sometimes, questions might involve using different years' quantities or something like that, but in this case, it seems straightforward. The base year always has a CPI of 100 by definition.\n\nMoreover, the question specifies that the base year is 2015, and it's asking for the CPI in 2015. So, unless there's additional information or a different method required, the answer should be 100.\n\nLet me just consider if the market basket quantities change over years, but the problem says it's a typical market basket consisting of 200 apples and 290 textbooks, without specifying that these quantities change over time. So, I think it's safe to assume that the market basket quantities are constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 100.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
