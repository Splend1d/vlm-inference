                    "text": "To determine whether unemployment in Santher's economy is relatively high or low based on Table 11.4, we need to analyze the relationship between the price level, aggregate demand (AD), and aggregate supply (AS). The table provides data at different price levels, showing corresponding AD and AS values.\n\nFirst, let's understand what AD and AS represent:\n\n- **Aggregate Demand (AD):** This is the total demand for final goods and services in an economy at different price levels.\n\n- **Aggregate Supply (AS):** This is the total supply of goods and services that firms in an economy plan to sell at different price levels.\n\nEquilibrium in the AD/AS model occurs where AD equals AS, which determines the equilibrium price level and real GDP.\n\nLooking at the table:\n\n- At a price level of 50: AD = 1,000, AS = 250\n\n- At a price level of 60: AD = 950, AS = 580\n\n- At a price level of 70: AD = 900, AS = 750\n\n- At a price level of 80: AD = 850, AS = 850\n\n- At a price level of 90: AD = 800, AS = 900\n\nWe can see that equilibrium occurs at the price level where AD equals AS. From the table, this happens at a price level of 80, where both AD and AS are 850.\n\nNow, to relate this to unemployment, we need to consider the relationship between real GDP and potential GDP. Potential GDP is the level of GDP an economy can produce when all its resources are fully employed.\n\n- If real GDP is equal to potential GDP, the economy is at full employment, and unemployment is at its natural rate.\n\n- If real GDP is below potential GDP, there is a recessionary gap, indicating higher unemployment.\n\n- If real GDP is above potential GDP, there is an inflationary gap, indicating lower unemployment.\n\nIn the table, at equilibrium, real GDP is 850 at a price level of 80. To determine whether this represents high or low unemployment, we need to know how this real GDP compares to potential GDP.\n\nHowever, the table does not provide information about potential GDP. Without knowing potential GDP, we cannot definitively say whether the economy is experiencing high or low unemployment.\n\nAdditionally, the table shows that at lower price levels, AD exceeds AS, which might suggest inflationary pressures if the economy tries to operate above its potential. Conversely, at higher price levels, AS exceeds AD, which might indicate recessionary pressures and higher unemployment.\n\nBut again, without knowing potential GDP or the specific relationship between real GDP and potential GDP, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about the unemployment rate.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the information provided in Table 11.4, it is not possible to determine whether unemployment in Santher's economy is relatively high or low.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
