A black line labeled \"LRAS1\" at a Real GDP value of approximately 100.\n2. A red line labeled \"LRAS2\" at a Real GDP value of approximately 300.\n\nThe graph illustrates a shift in the LRAS curve from LRAS1 to LRAS2, indicating an increase in potential output or real GDP for Brazil.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe graph below shows the Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curves (LRAS) for Brazil. <image 1> What event could shift LRAS from LRAS1 (black color) to LRAS2 (red color) in Brazil (select one)?\n\nA.

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the graph shows a shift in the Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS) curve from LRAS1 to LRAS2, with LRAS2 being at a higher level of real GDP compared to LRAS1. Specifically, LRAS1 is at approximately 100 on the real GDP axis, and LRAS2 is at approximately 300. This shift indicates an increase in Brazil's potential output or real GDP.\n\nIn macroeconomics, the LRAS curve represents the economy's potential output when all resources are fully employed, and it is typically vertical because potential output is determined by the quantity and quality of resources and technology, not by the price level.\n\nA shift in the LRAS curve to the right (from LRAS1 to LRAS2) suggests that Brazil's potential output has increased. This can be caused by several factors that enhance the economy's productive capacity, such as an increase in the labor force, an improvement in human capital, an increase in capital stock, or advancements in technology.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Increase in capital.\n\nB. Decrease in labor.\n\nC. Decrease in human capital.\n\nOption A, an increase in capital, would likely lead to an increase in potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the right, which aligns with the shift from LRAS1 to LRAS2.\n\nOption B, a decrease in labor, would typically lead to a decrease in potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the left, which is contrary to what is shown in the graph.\n\nOption C, a decrease in human capital, would also likely lead to a decrease in potential output, shifting the LRAS curve to the left.\n\nTherefore, the event that could shift LRAS from LRAS1 to LRAS2 in Brazil is an increase in capital.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
