The plasmid is shown as a closed circle, indicating that it is in its supercoiled form. Various features of the plasmid are labeled, including the T7 promoter, lac operator, lacI promoter, KanR (kanamycin resistance gene), ori (origin of replication), f1 ori (f1 origin of replication), T7 terminator, and several other elements such as the 6xHis tag, thrombin site, RBS (ribosome binding site), and HindIII restriction site at position 173.\n\nGiven that the plasmid is depicted as a closed circle, it is in its supercoiled form. When a restriction enzyme like HindIII is used to cut the plasmid at the HindIII site, it will introduce a single cut into the circular DNA, converting the supercoiled form into a linear form. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nE. Supercoiled to linear\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nConsider the following plasmid, pET28a, a popular expression vector that is used for protein expression in bacteria: <image 1>. You freshly purified plasmid from overnight bacterial culture using extraction kit, also known as miniprep. You confirmed the quality of plasmids by checking DNA and protein ratio (A260/280) and running them on a DNA agarose gel. They looked pure as they should be. You would now like to digest this vector for gene manipulation (molecular cloning) to generate vectors suitable for molecular cloning. If you cut the above plasmid with restriction enzyme called HindIII, the form of DNA will be changed from _________\n\nA. Linear to supercoiled\nB. Nicked to linear\nC. Nicked to supercoiled\nD. Supercoiled to nicked\nE. Supercoiled to linear\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the plasmid pET28a is initially in its supercoiled form, as indicated by the closed circle in the image. When you cut this plasmid with the restriction enzyme HindIII at the specified HindIII site, you introduce a single cut into the circular DNA molecule. This conversion from a supercoiled circular DNA to a linear DNA molecule is a standard outcome of digesting a supercoiled plasmid with a restriction enzyme that cuts once.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. Supercoiled to linear\n\nTo elaborate further:\n\n- **Supercoiled DNA**: This is the naturally occurring form of circular plasmids in bacteria. It is compact and energy-efficient due to the winding and coiling of the DNA strands.\n\n- **Linear DNA**: When a supercoiled plasmid is cut once by a restriction enzyme, it loses its circularity and becomes linear. This form is less compact and more extended compared to the supercoiled form.\n\n- **Nicked DNA**: This refers to a circular DNA molecule that has been cut once, but still maintains its circularity due to the presence of nicks (single-strand breaks). However, in the case of HindIII cutting pET28a, the plasmid is converted to a linear molecule, not a nicked circular one.\n\nGiven that the plasmid starts as supercoiled and is converted to linear upon digestion with HindIII, option E accurately describes this transformation.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
