A blue line labeled \"Average temperature\" that shows the decrease in temperature with increasing altitude.\n2. A black line labeled \"Species 1\" that peaks at around 500 meters altitude.\n3. A gray line labeled \"Species 2\" that peaks at around 1000 meters altitude.\n4. Another gray line labeled \"Species 3\" that peaks at around 1500 meters altitude.\n\nFrom the graph, it is clear that Species 1 is found below an altitude of 500 meters, while Species 2 and Species 3 are found at higher altitudes.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nConsider the diagram in <image 1> regarding a mountainous region. The diagram shows the average winter temperature (left-hand y-axis) at different altitudes (x-axis) and the abundance of three tree species (right-hand y-axis) at different altitudes (x-axis).

Species 1 only\n\nB. Species 2 only\n\nC. Species 3 only\n\nD. Species 1 and 2 only\n\nE. Species 2 and 3 only\n\nBased on the description, Species 1 is the only species that is found below 500 meters altitude, as Species 2 and Species 3 are found at higher altitudes, peaking at 1000 and 1500 meters, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Species 1 only\n\nThis conclusion is directly supported by the information provided in the description of the graph."
