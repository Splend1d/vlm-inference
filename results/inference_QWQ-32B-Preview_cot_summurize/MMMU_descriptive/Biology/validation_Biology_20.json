                    "text": "So I have this question about the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, and I need to figure out how much oxygen is delivered to cells at a certain oxygen partial pressure compared to the maximum possible. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve represents. From the description, it's a graph where the x-axis is PO2 in mmHg, ranging from 0 to 120, and the y-axis is oxyhemoglobin saturation in percent, from 0% to 100%. The curve starts at the bottom left and rises steeply, then levels off towards the top right. This means that at low PO2, hemoglobin doesn't bind oxygen well, but as PO2 increases, hemoglobin binds more oxygen until it's almost fully saturated.\n\nSo, the curve shows how much oxygen hemoglobin is carrying at different oxygen partial pressures. Now, the question is asking about oxygen delivery to cells at a PO2 of 20 mmHg, given that the PO2 in the lungs is 60 mmHg. I need to find out what percentage of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered under these conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the oxyhemoglobin saturation at these two PO2 levels. From the curve, at PO2 = 60 mmHg, which is in the lungs, hemoglobin is highly saturated, probably around 95-98% saturated. At PO2 = 20 mmHg, which is in the tissues, hemoglobin is less saturated, maybe around 70-75%.\n\nBut I need to be more precise. Maybe I can recall some approximate values or try to estimate from the curve description. Typically, at 60 mmHg PO2, hemoglobin is about 95% saturated, and at 20 mmHg, it's about 75% saturated. But I should confirm this.\n\nLet me think about the shape of the curve. It's S-shaped, with a steep part in the middle and flatter parts at the top and bottom. The steep part is where small changes in PO2 cause large changes in saturation, which is why it's so sensitive in that range.\n\nSo, if PO2 in the lungs is 60 mmHg, and in the tissues, it's 20 mmHg, I need to find the difference in saturation between these two points. That difference represents the amount of oxygen released to the tissues.\n\nAt 60 mmHg, saturation is approximately 95%.\nAt 20 mmHg, saturation is approximately 75%.\n\nSo, the amount of oxygen released is 95% - 75% = 20%.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount of oxygen delivered to cells at PO2 = 20 mmHg as a percentage of the maximum HbO2 if all available oxygen in the RBCs was transferred to cells.\n\nWait, maximum HbO2 would be if hemoglobin was fully saturated, which is 100%. But in reality, at PO2 = 60 mmHg, it's 95% saturated. So, the maximum HbO2 in this context is 95%.\n\nSo, the oxygen delivered is the difference between lung saturation and tissue saturation, which is 20%, as a percentage of the maximum HbO2, which is 95%.\n\nSo, the percentage delivered is (20% / 95%) * 100% \u2248 21.05%.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 17%\n\nB. 22%\n\nC. 65%\n\nD. 70%\n\nE. 82%\n\n21.05% is closest to 22%, so the answer would be B. 22% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my assumptions. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps maximum HbO2 refers to the total oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, which is 100%. But in reality, at PO2 = 60 mmHg, it's 95% saturated.\n\nSo, the oxygen content in the blood leaving the lungs is 95% of maximum oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\nAt PO2 = 20 mmHg in the tissues, hemoglobin is 75% saturated, so it's releasing some oxygen.\n\nThe amount delivered is the difference: 95% - 75% = 20% of the maximum oxygen-carrying capacity.\n\nBut the question says \"assuming maximum HbO2 to be the level of oxygen delivery if all available oxygen in the RBC's was transferred to cells.\"\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nIf all available oxygen in the RBCs was transferred to cells, that would be the entire amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin being released.\n\nBut in reality, only some of it is released, depending on the PO2 in the tissues.\n\nSo, perhaps maximum HbO2 is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the lungs, which is 95% of capacity.\n\nThe amount delivered is 20% of that maximum, which is 20% of 95%, which is indeed 19%.\n\nWait, earlier I said 20% / 95% = 21.05%, but that's not correct.\n\nActually, if maximum HbO2 is 95%, and the amount delivered is 20% of that, then it's 20% of 95%, which is 19%.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options directly. Maybe I need to consider oxygen content in terms of mL/O2 per dL of blood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the oxygen content in terms of CaO2, which is (0.003 * PaO2) + (1.34 * Hb * SaO2).\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps maximum HbO2 is 100% saturation, which is not achievable in vivo, but theoretically.\n\nIn that case, at PO2 = 60 mmHg, SaO2 is 95%, and at PO2 = 20 mmHg, it's 75%.\n\nSo, the amount delivered is 95% - 75% = 20% of maximum HbO2, which is 100%.\n\nSo, 20% of 100% is 20%, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, the options are in percentage of maximum HbO2.\n\nThe question says \"assume maximum HbO2 to be the level of oxygen delivery if all available oxygen in the RBC's was transferred to cells.\"\n\nSo, maximum HbO2 would be if all oxygen bound to hemoglobin was released to the cells, which would be 95% in this case, since that's how much is bound at PO2 = 60 mmHg.\n\nBut in reality, only 20% of that is released, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, the percentage delivered is (20% / 95%) * 100% \u2248 21.05%, which is closest to 22% (option B).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum HbO2 is considered to be 100%, and the amount delivered is 20% of that, which is 20%, but again, closest to 22%.\n\nBut maybe I need to use the actual oxygen content.\n\nLet's try calculating oxygen content.\n\nAssuming Hb concentration is 15 g/dL, and the oxygen-carrying capacity is 1.34 mL O2 per g Hb.\n\nSo, maximum HbO2 is 15 * 1.34 = 20.1 mL O2 per dL blood.\n\nAt PO2 = 60 mmHg, SaO2 is 95%, so CaO2 is (0.003 * 60) + (15 * 1.34 * 0.95) \u2248 0.18 + 19.185 = 19.365 mL O2 per dL.\n\nAt PO2 = 20 mmHg, SaO2 is 75%, so CaO2 is (0.003 * 20) + (15 * 1.34 * 0.75) \u2248 0.06 + 15.195 = 15.255 mL O2 per dL.\n\nSo, the amount of oxygen delivered is 19.365 - 15.255 = 4.11 mL O2 per dL.\n\nMaximum HbO2 is 20.1 mL O2 per dL.\n\nSo, the percentage delivered is (4.11 / 20.1) * 100% \u2248 20.45%, which is closest to 22% (option B).\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 22% of the maximum HbO2 would be delivered.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
