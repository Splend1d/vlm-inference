The chart shows the relationships between these individuals as follows:\n\n- Individual #1 is connected to individual #2, indicating they are likely parents.\n- Individual #3 is connected to individual #5, suggesting they are likely parent and child.\n- Individual #4 is connected to individual #6, suggesting they are likely parent and child.\n- Individual #5 and individual #6 are connected to individual #7, indicating they are likely parents of #7.\n\nThe connections are represented by lines, with circles and squares indicating females and males, respectively. The chart does not provide any additional information about the genotypes or phenotypes of the individuals beyond their relationships.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIf individual #1 in the following pedigree <image 1> is a heterozygote for a rare, AR disease, what is the probability that individual #7 will be affected by the disease? Assume that #2 and the spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers.\n\n"

Individual #1 is a heterozygote for this disease, and #2 and the spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationships between these individuals based on the description:\n\n- #1 is connected to #2, likely parents.\n\n- #3 is connected to #5, probably parent and child.\n\n- #4 is connected to #6, likely parent and child.\n\n- #5 and #6 are connected to #7, so they're parents of #7.\n\nAlso, the chart uses circles for females and squares for males, but that doesn't directly affect the calculation here.\n\nNow, the disease is autosomal recessive, which means you need two copies of the recessive allele to be affected. Individual #1 is a heterozygote, so they have one dominant and one recessive allele (let's call them A and a, so #1 is Aa).\n\nGiven that #2 and the spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers, that means #2 is AA, and the spouses of #3 and #4 are also AA.\n\nLet me try to map out the genotypes:\n\n- #1: Aa\n\n- #2: AA\n\n- Since #1 and #2 are parents, their offspring (#3 and #4, I assume) would have genotypes based on Mendel's laws.\n\nSo, the possible genotypes for #3 and #4:\n\n- Each has a 50% chance of being AA (from #1's A and #2's A) and 50% chance of being Aa (from #1's a and #2's A).\n\nWait, but the description says that #3 is connected to #5, and #4 to #6, suggesting #3 and #4 are parents of #5 and #6 respectively, but looking back, it says #3 is connected to #5, likely parent and child, and same for #4 and #6. So, #3 is a parent of #5, and #4 is a parent of #6.\n\nLet me try to sketch this:\n\n- #1 and #2 are parents.\n\n- #3 is a child of #1 and #2.\n\n- #4 is another child of #1 and #2.\n\n- #5 is a child of #3 and (spouse).\n\n- #6 is a child of #4 and (spouse).\n\n- #5 and #6 are parents of #7.\n\nGiven that #2 and the spouses of #3 and #4 are not carriers, so their genotypes are AA.\n\nSo, genotypes:\n\n- #1: Aa\n\n- #2: AA\n\n- #3: possible AA or Aa (50% each)\n\n- #4: possible AA or Aa (50% each)\n\n- Spouse of #3: AA\n\n- Spouse of #4: AA\n\n- #5: child of #3 and spouse (AA)\n\n- #6: child of #4 and spouse (AA)\n\n- #7: child of #5 and #6\n\nOkay, now I need to find the probability that #7 is affected, which means #7 is aa.\n\nFor #7 to be aa, both #5 and #6 must pass on the a allele.\n\nSo, #5 must be Aa, and #6 must be Aa, because their spouses are AA, and #3 and #4 could be AA or Aa.\n\nWait, but #5 is a child of #3 (possible Aa) and spouse (AA), so #5 could be AA or Aa, depending on #3's genotype.\n\nSimilarly, #6 could be AA or Aa, depending on #4's genotype.\n\nSo, let's consider the possibilities:\n\nFirst, determine #3's genotype:\n\n- #3 is a child of #1 (Aa) and #2 (AA), so:\n\n- 50% chance of being AA\n\n- 50% chance of being Aa\n\nSimilarly, #4 has the same probabilities:\n\n- 50% AA\n\n- 50% Aa\n\nNow, #5 is a child of #3 and spouse (AA):\n\n- If #3 is AA, then #5 is AA (since spouse is AA)\n\n- If #3 is Aa, then #5 has 50% chance of being AA and 50% chance of being Aa\n\nSimilarly, #6 is a child of #4 and spouse (AA):\n\n- If #4 is AA, #6 is AA\n\n- If #4 is Aa, #6 has 50% chance of being AA and 50% chance of being Aa\n\nNow, #7 is a child of #5 and #6, so #7's genotype depends on the genotypes of #5 and #6.\n\nWe need #7 to be aa, which requires both #5 and #6 to be Aa.\n\nSo, first find the probability that both #5 and #6 are Aa.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities step by step.\n\nFirst, find the probability that #3 is Aa: 50%\n\nSimilarly, probability that #4 is Aa: 50%\n\nNow, given that:\n\n- If #3 is Aa, then #5 has 50% chance of being Aa\n\n- If #3 is AA, #5 is AA\n\nSimilarly for #4 and #6.\n\nSo, probability that #5 is Aa is:\n\nP(#3 is Aa) * P(#5 is Aa | #3 is Aa) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, probability that #6 is Aa is 0.25\n\nNow, assuming that #5 and #6's genotypes are independent, the probability that both are Aa is 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nNow, if both #5 and #6 are Aa, the probability that #7 is aa is 0.25 (since it's a standard Mendelian cross: Aa x Aa has 1/4 aa).\n\nTherefore, the total probability that #7 is aa is:\n\nP(#5 is Aa and #6 is Aa) * P(#7 is aa | #5 is Aa and #6 is Aa) = 0.0625 * 0.25 = 0.015625\n\nWhich is 1.5625%\n\nBut let's double-check this calculation to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider all possible combinations:\n\nFirst, #3's genotype:\n\n- AA (50% chance)\n\n- Aa (50% chance)\n\nSimilarly for #4.\n\nNow, for #5:\n\n- If #3 is AA, #5 is AA\n\n- If #3 is Aa, #5 is AA (50%) or Aa (50%)\n\nSimilarly for #6.\n\nSo, overall:\n\nP(#5 is AA) = P(#3 is AA) * 1 + P(#3 is Aa) * 0.5 = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.25 = 0.75\n\nP(#5 is Aa) = P(#3 is Aa) * 0.5 = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nSame for #6.\n\nNow, P(#5 is Aa and #6 is Aa) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nThen, P(#7 is aa | #5 is Aa and #6 is Aa) = 0.25\n\nSo, P(#7 is aa) = 0.0625 * 0.25 = 0.015625, which is 1.5625%\n\nAlternatively, expressing it as a fraction: 1/64\n\nSo, the probability that individual #7 is affected by the disease is 1/64 or approximately 1.56%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{64}} \\]"
