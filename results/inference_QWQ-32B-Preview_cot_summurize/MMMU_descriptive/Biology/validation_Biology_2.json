The vacuole appears as a dark, circular region within the cell. There is a scale bar in the image labeled \"5 \u00b5m,\" indicating the length of the bar is 5 micrometers (\u00b5m). The vacuole is approximately the same size as this scale bar, suggesting its diameter is close to 5 \u00b5m.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nUsing the scale bar, estimate the diameter of the vacuole in <image 1>.\n\nA. 5.0 nm\nB. 50 um\nC. 7.5 um\nD. 5.2 um\n"
