Each structure represents a disaccharide, which is a type of carbohydrate composed of two monosaccharides linked together.\n\n- **Structure A**: This structure shows a disaccharide with two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. The glucose units are in a pyranose ring form, with hydroxyl (OH) groups attached at various positions.\n  \n- **Structure B**: This structure also shows a disaccharide with two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. The glucose units are in a pyranose ring form, similar to Structure A, but the orientation of the hydroxyl groups differs slightly.\n\n- **Structure C**: This structure depicts a disaccharide with two glucose molecules linked by a beta-1,4-glycosidic bond. The glucose units are in a pyranose ring form, with hydroxyl groups attached at various positions.\n\n- **Structure D**: This structure shows a disaccharide with two fructose molecules linked by a beta-2,1-glycosidic bond. The fructose units are in a furanose ring form, with hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) groups attached.\n\n- **Structure E**: This structure depicts a disaccharide with two galactose molecules linked by a beta-1,4-glycosidic bond. The galactose units are in a pyranose ring form, with hydroxyl groups attached at various positions.\n\nBased on this description, the primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is maltose, which is represented by Structure A or Structure B.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is\n\nA. <image 1>\nB. <image 2>\nC. <image 3>\nD. <image 4>\nE. <image 5>\n"

Maltose is composed of two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond.\n\nLooking at the descriptions provided:\n\n- **Structure A**: Two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond.\n\n- **Structure B**: Also two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond, but with a slight difference in the orientation of hydroxyl groups.\n\n- **Structure C**: Two glucose molecules linked by a beta-1,4-glycosidic bond.\n\n- **Structure D**: Two fructose molecules linked by a beta-2,1-glycosidic bond.\n\n- **Structure E**: Two galactose molecules linked by a beta-1,4-glycosidic bond.\n\nSince maltose is specifically the disaccharide formed by two glucose molecules linked by an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond, both Structure A and Structure B fit this description. However, the question likely expects a single answer, and given that the only difference between A and B is the orientation of hydroxyl groups, which doesn't change the fundamental nature of the disaccharide, either could be correct.\n\nGiven that the question is multiple-choice with options A through E corresponding to the structures, and the description states that the primary disaccharide digestion product of starch is maltose, which is represented by Structure A or Structure B, the answer should be either A or B.\n\nAssuming that \"image 1\" corresponds to Structure A and \"image 2\" corresponds to Structure B, both would be correct representations of maltose. However, since the question likely expects a single answer, and considering that maltose is typically represented in its most common form, which is Structure A, the answer should be A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
