The ribosome consists of two subunits: a large subunit and a small subunit. \n\n- The large ribosomal subunit is represented by a larger, oval-shaped structure with several components labeled.\n- The small ribosomal subunit is shown as a smaller, circular structure with mRNA bound to it.\n- The mRNA strand runs horizontally across the image from left to right, with the 5' end on the left and the 3' end on the right.\n- There are several labeled components within and around the ribosome:\n  - **A**: Points to a chain of amino acids (N).\n  - **B**: Points to a part of the large ribosomal subunit.\n  - **C**: Points to another part of the large ribosomal subunit.\n  - **D**: Points to a tRNA molecule bound to the ribosome.\n  - **E**: Points to another tRNA molecule.\n  - **F**: Points to a third tRNA molecule.\n  - **G**: Points to the small ribosomal subunit.\n  - **H**: Points to a part of the small ribosomal subunit.\n  - **I**: Points to a part of the large ribosomal subunit.\n\nBased on this description, the arrow labeled **B** points to a large ribosomal unit. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. B\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich arrow in <image 1> points to a large ribosomal unit?\n\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD. D\nE. E\nF. F\nG. G\nH. H\nI. I\n"
