The text is presented in a bold, orange font against a dark background. The poem reads:\n\n\"DREAMS\n\nHold onto dreams\nFor if dreams die\nLife is like a\nbroken-winged bird\nThat cannot fly\nHold fast to dreams\nFor when dreams go\nLife is a barren field\nFrozen with snow\"\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a hashtag: #dontgiveupworld. The overall design includes a subtle illustration of a bird in flight, which is integrated into the background.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich of the following options best relates to the poem 'Dreams' <image 1>?\n\nA. The father is compared to a gypsy.\nB. The danger of letting go of a dream.\nC. Keep hold of your dream.\nD. Let's celebrate bold women!\n"

Keep hold of your dream.\n\nThis choice directly aligns with the central message of the poem, which emphasizes the importance of holding onto dreams and the dire consequences if they are lost. The poem uses vivid metaphors to illustrate that without dreams, life becomes meaningless and barren. Therefore, option C captures the essence of the poem's advice to cherish and maintain one's dreams.\n\nOption A mentions a comparison to a gypsy, which is not present in the poem. Option B discusses the danger of letting go of a dream, which is related but not as directly positive as option C, which actively encourages holding onto dreams. Option D seems unrelated to the content of the poem, focusing instead on celebrating bold women, which is not addressed in \"Dreams.\"\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9009\u9879C\u662f\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
