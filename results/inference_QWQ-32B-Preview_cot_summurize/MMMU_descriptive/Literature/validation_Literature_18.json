Prominently displayed in the center is an image of a jaguar, surrounded by smaller circular images showcasing different animals and natural phenomena, such as a bird, a volcano erupting, and a dolphin jumping out of the water. The text on the cover includes phrases like \"Celebrate,\" \"Everything,\" \"More Than 500 Incredible Photos,\" and \"Awesome Animals.\" The National Geographic logo is also visible at the top left corner of the cover.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRefer to the figure <image 1>, which term best refers to sources that give verifiable factual information or explain some aspect of the biological, social, or physical world?\n\nA.

Informational Books\n\nThis choice is appropriate because informational books are designed to provide factual information and educate readers about various subjects, often including science, nature, and social studies. The cover description mentions \"more than 500 incredible photos\" and \"awesome animals,\" which aligns with the content typically found in informational books aimed at children, especially those interested in nature and wildlife.\n\nOption A, Epics, refers to long narrative poems that relate the adventures of a hero, which doesn't match the description provided.\n\nOption B, Multigenre Books, refers to collections of texts that include various genres such as fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and more, but the description doesn't indicate a mix of genres.\n\nOption D, Reference Books, typically include encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other works meant for looking up specific information. While the almanac might have some reference elements, the description emphasizes its informational and educational content rather than its use as a reference tool.\n\nTherefore, \"Informational Books\" is the most suitable term for the source described."
