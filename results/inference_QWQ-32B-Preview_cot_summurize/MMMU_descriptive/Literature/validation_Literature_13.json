The book has a face drawn on its cover, with eyes, nose, and mouth. It says \"DON'T JUDGE ME\" on the front cover and \"READ ME\" vertically along the spine. The book has a hardcover, which is typically made of two boards that make it durable and allow it to stand on a shelf.\n\nThe question is asking for the term that refers to these usually two boards that make the book more durable and allow it to stand on a shelf. The options are:\n\nA. Hates\n\nB. Motif\n\nC. Drifts\n\nD. Covers\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these terms mean in the context of books.\n\n\"Hates\" doesn't seem related to books or their parts. It's a verb meaning to feel intense dislike for someone or something.\n\n\"Motif\" is a decorative design or a recurring subject in art or literature. While a book cover might have a motif, it's not specific to the boards that make up the hardcover.\n\n\"Drifts\" is not a term I associate with books. It could refer to floating or moving aimlessly, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\n\"Covers\" refers to the protective outer parts of a book. In the case of a hardcover book, the covers are made of cardboard covered with paper, leather, or other materials.\n\nGiven that, the term that refers to the two boards making the book durable and allowing it to stand on a shelf is \"covers.\" Hardcovers have covers made of these boards, which provide structure and support.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. Covers.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there a more specific term for these boards?\n\nIn bookbinding, the rigid part of a hardcover book is called the \"case,\" which consists of the front and back covers (boards) and the spine piece, all of which are usually made of cardboard covered with material.\n\nHowever, among the given options, \"covers\" is the most appropriate term that refers to these boards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Covers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
