The question is: \"Which term refers to the part that follows the exposition where the conflict is introduced?\" The options are falling action, climax, exposition, and rising action.\n\nFirst, let's recall what these terms mean in the context of a story or a plot structure.\n\n- Exposition: This is the beginning of the story where characters, setting, and initial situation are introduced.\n\n- Rising Action: This is the part of the story where the main conflicts and complications begin to unfold. It's where the tension and excitement build up.\n\n- Climax: This is the turning point of the story, the moment of highest tension where the outcome is uncertain.\n\n- Falling Action: This is the part after the climax where the conflict begins to resolve, and the story starts winding down.\n\n- Resolution: This is the end of the story where all loose ends are tied up, and the story concludes.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the term that refers to the part that follows the exposition where the conflict is introduced. Based on the definitions above, that would be the rising action. In the rising action, the main conflicts and complications start to unfold.\n\nLooking back at the description of the image, it mentions a line graph with four points. The first two points form an upward-sloping line, indicating an increase or rise, which could correspond to the rising action where tension and conflicts increase. The third point is at the peak, possibly representing the climax. The fourth point is connected with a downward-sloping line, indicating a decrease or fall, which could be the falling action.\n\nThere's also an orange arrow pointing downwards next to the second point, suggesting a transition from the rising part to the falling part. This might indicate the climax point where the action starts to descend.\n\nGiven this, if the question is about what follows the exposition where the conflict is introduced, it should be the rising action.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. rising action.\n\nBut to make sure, let's think again. Exposition is the beginning where things are set up, and rising action is where the conflict is introduced and builds up. Climax is the peak of the conflict, and falling action is when the conflict starts to resolve.\n\nTherefore, immediately following the exposition where the conflict is introduced, it's the rising action.\n\nI think D. rising action is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
