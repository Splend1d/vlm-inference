The central figure appears to be a religious icon, possibly Jesus Christ, seated and surrounded by several other figures who seem to be disciples or followers. The artwork is richly colored with gold accents and intricate designs, typical of medieval religious manuscripts. The text surrounding the illustration is written in a formal script, likely Latin, which was commonly used in religious texts during that period. The overall style and content suggest that this is a page from a religious manuscript, possibly a Bible or a book of saints' lives.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRefer to the figure <image 1>, which term refers to stories that are based on religious writings or taken intact from religious manuscripts?\n\nA. Religious Stories\nB. Parables\nC. Retold Tale\nD. Legends\n"

The question asks for a term that refers to stories based on religious writings or taken intact from religious manuscripts.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Religious Stories - This is a broad term that could encompass any narrative with religious themes or figures. It's general and might not specifically indicate that the stories are directly from religious manuscripts.\n\nB. Parables - These are succinct, allegorical stories used to illustrate moral or spiritual lessons, often found in religious texts. However, parables are typically short and meant to teach a specific principle, not necessarily entire stories taken from religious manuscripts.\n\nC. Retold Tale - This suggests a narrative that has been recounted or adapted from its original form. While religious stories are often retold, this term doesn't specifically connect to religious writings or manuscripts.\n\nD. Legends - These are traditional stories that often involve supernatural elements and heroic figures. Legends can be part of religious traditions, but they are not necessarily directly taken from religious manuscripts.\n\nGiven the context of the image being from a religious manuscript and featuring a central religious figure, the term that most accurately refers to stories based on religious writings or taken intact from religious manuscripts would be \"religious stories.\" Although \"parables\" are found in religious texts, they are a specific type of story within religious literature, whereas \"religious stories\" is a broader category that can include various types of narratives from religious manuscripts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. Religious Stories.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
