The children appear engaged and focused on the story. The classroom has pink cabinets and shelves in the background, and there are various educational materials and books visible. The scene suggests a shared reading experience, which aligns with the concept of using Big Books in a group setting for beginning readers.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRefer to the figure <image 1>, which term describes an adaptation of a natural home-based learning strategy used with groups of beginning readers in school settings, where Big Books are presented to groups in a sequence proposed by Holdaway?\n\nA. Memoirs\nB. Concept Picture Book\nC. Survival And Adventure\nD. Shared-book Experience\n"

Shared-book Experience.\n\nThe scenario described involves an adult reading a book to a group of young children in a classroom setting, which aligns with the concept of shared reading or shared-book experience. This approach is often used with Big Books, which are large-format books designed for group reading. The children are engaged and focused, indicating active participation in the reading experience.\n\nOption A, Memoirs, refers to autobiographical accounts and does not relate to the group reading context described.\n\nOption B, Concept Picture Book, refers to books that introduce abstract concepts through illustrations, but again, this doesn't specifically describe the group reading experience depicted.\n\nOption C, Survival And Adventure, suggests a genre of literature, likely involving stories of overcoming challenges, which doesn't fit the description of a classroom reading session with young children.\n\nTherefore, D. Shared-book Experience is the most appropriate term that describes the adaptation of a natural home-based learning strategy used with groups of beginning readers in school settings, as per Holdaway's sequence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
