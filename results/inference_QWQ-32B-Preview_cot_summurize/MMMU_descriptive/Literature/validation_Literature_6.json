The line is black and extends horizontally across the width of the image. The question asks which term refers to lines that give the impression of calm and tranquility, such as those seen in the ocean and open prairies.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Diagonal line: Diagonal lines often suggest movement, direction, or tension. They don't typically convey calm and tranquility.\n\nB. Horizontal line: Horizontal lines are often associated with stability, calmness, and tranquility. In nature, horizons over oceans or open prairies are classic examples of horizontal lines that evoke a sense of peace and serenity.\n\nC. Vertical line: Vertical lines usually represent height, grandeur, and strength. They can inspire feelings of admiration or awe but may not necessarily convey calm and tranquility.\n\nD. List spacing: This term seems out of place in this context. List spacing refers to the space between items in a list and isn't related to the visual impression of lines in an image.\n\nGiven that the image shows a horizontal line and the question mentions lines that give the impression of calm and tranquility, such as those seen in the ocean and open prairies, the most appropriate answer is B. Horizontal line.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
