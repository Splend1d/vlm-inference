They appear to be focused on their tasks, with one person using a pink pen and the other using a purple marker. The setting seems to be an educational environment, possibly a classroom, as indicated by the presence of desks and chairs. There are papers and writing materials on the table, suggesting that they are involved in an activity related to reading or writing. The overall atmosphere is one of concentration and learning.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRefer to the figure <image 1>, which term best describes the practice where, after reading a book, a sketch is created reflecting upon the significance of the story or its connections, and then shared?\n\nA. Fact Book Stretch\nB. Sketch to Stretch\nC. Science Fiction Stretch\nD. Informational Picture Book\n"

Option C, \"Science Fiction Stretch,\" seems too narrow as it specifies a genre, whereas the description doesn't limit the type of book being read. Option D, \"Informational Picture Book,\" refers to a type of book rather than an activity related to reading and creating sketches.\n\nTherefore, \"Sketch to Stretch\" is the most appropriate term among the given options for the described practice."
