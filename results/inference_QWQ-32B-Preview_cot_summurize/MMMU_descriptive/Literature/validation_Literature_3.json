The background with wavy lines suggests a sense of curiosity or exploration, reinforcing the idea that the person is seeking to comprehend something unclear.\n\nGiven this context, the question asks which term refers to words or phrases in a sentence that help the reader understand the meaning of an unknown word. The options are:\n\nA. Inference\n\nB. Message\n\nC. Context Clue\n\nD. Text Evidence\n\nTo answer this question, let's consider what each term means:\n\n- **Inference** is the process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true. In reading, it involves using the information provided to make logical guesses about what is not directly stated.\n\n- **Message** generally refers to the main idea or theme that the author is trying to convey through the text.\n\n- **Context Clue** are hints or clues within the text that help readers understand the meaning of unfamiliar words or phrases. These can be found in the surrounding words, sentences, or even the overall context of the passage.\n\n- **Text Evidence** refers to the specific parts of the text that support a particular interpretation or conclusion. It's the data from the text that a reader uses to make inferences or draw conclusions.\n\nGiven these definitions, the term that specifically refers to words or phrases in a sentence that help the reader understand the meaning of an unknown word is **Context Clue**.\n\nIn the image, the person is closely examining the text, perhaps trying to make sense of \"like that sci,\" which might contain an unknown word (\"sci\"). The magnifying glass symbolizes a close attention to detail, which is akin to looking for context clues in text to understand unknown words.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Context Clue"
