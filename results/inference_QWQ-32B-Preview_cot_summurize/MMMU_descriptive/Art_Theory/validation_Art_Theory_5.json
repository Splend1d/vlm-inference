So, the question is: \"The use of stone in such prehistoric structures as Stonehenge illustrates an architectural tradition that...\" and then it gives four options.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what I know about Stonehenge. Stonehenge is a famous prehistoric monument in England, consisting of a circular arrangement of large stones. It was built in several stages, starting around 5,000 years ago. The most prominent features are the large sandstone lintels that are placed horizontally on top of vertical stone pillars, forming a kind of circle or horseshoe shape.\n\nOption A says: \"employed a mortise and tenon system for supporting lintels.\" Hmm, I think I've heard about that. A mortise and tenon joint is a way to connect two pieces of wood or stone by cutting a slot (mortise) in one piece and inserting a projecting piece (tenon) from the other piece into it. This creates a strong joint. In the case of Stonehenge, the horizontal lintels are supported on top of the vertical stones, and they are held in place by mortise and tenon joints. So, that seems plausible.\n\nOption B mentions: \"showed the enduring power of concrete to unify large blocks of stone.\" Wait, concrete wasn't used in prehistoric times like that. Concrete is a more modern building material, developed much later. So, this can't be right for Stonehenge.\n\nOption C says: \"maintained the stability of structures using a corbeled arch.\" A corbeled arch is a type of arch where successive layers of stone are laid out further from the center until they meet at the top. This is different from the lintel system used in Stonehenge, where horizontal stones are placed directly on top of vertical ones without overlapping courses. So, this doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption D talks about: \"unifying architectural works with carefully planned gardens.\" While it's possible that Stonehenge had some kind of landscaping or surrounding features, I don't recall any specific information about carefully planned gardens being a key aspect of its architecture. The main focus was on the stone structures themselves.\n\nGiven that, Option A seems to be the most accurate description of the architectural tradition illustrated by Stonehenge. The use of mortise and tenon joints to support the lintels is a key feature of its construction.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
