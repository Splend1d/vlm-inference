The artwork features a scene with two figures in a forested landscape. One figure appears to be a warrior or hunter, dressed in elaborate clothing and armor, holding a bow and arrow. The other figure is seated near a tree, possibly a servant or companion. The background is filled with dense trees and foliage, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. The painting is surrounded by text written in Arabic script, arranged in vertical columns around the edges of the image. The overall composition and style suggest a narrative scene, likely from a historical or mythological context. The use of shading and perspective in the trees and figures indicates an attention to detail and depth, which may reflect influences from Western artistic techniques.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> The work in the image shows the influence of Western art in its use of\n\nA. classical contrapposto\nB. atmospheric perspective\nC. Di sotto in s\u00f9\nD. tenebrism\n"

The description mentions that the background is filled with dense trees and foliage, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere, which aligns with the use of atmospheric perspective.\n\nOption A, classical contrapposto, refers to a specific pose in sculpture where the figure's weight is shifted onto one leg, creating a sense of movement and naturalism. While this could be present in the figures, the description doesn't specifically mention this pose.\n\nOption C, Di sotto in s\u00f9, is an Italian term that means \"from below upwards\" and refers to a viewpoint or perspective where the viewer looks up at the subject. There's no indication in the description that the scene is viewed from below.\n\nOption D, tenebrism, is a dramatic use of light and dark in painting, often to create a sense of drama or tension. While the description mentions shading, it doesn't specify that light is used in a particularly dramatic way.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, atmospheric perspective seems to be the most appropriate choice."
