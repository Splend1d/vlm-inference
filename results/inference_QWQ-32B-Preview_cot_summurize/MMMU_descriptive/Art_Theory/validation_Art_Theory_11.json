The structure has a central nave flanked by two side aisles, each separated by columns or piers. At one end of the building, there is a semi-circular apse, which is typically found in churches. The overall design suggests a longitudinal arrangement with a clear division between the nave and the side aisles.\n\nThe second image shows a cross-sectional view of a similar building. It features a high central nave with a pitched roof supported by columns or piers. The side aisles are lower than the central nave and have their own roofs. The structure also includes an apse at one end, which is consistent with the floor plan shown in the first image.\n\nBoth images depict architectural elements commonly found in basilicas, such as the central nave, side aisles, and apse. Basilicas were originally Roman public buildings used for various civic functions but later adapted for Christian worship. The design elements in these images align closely with the characteristics of basilicas.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe design of the church illustrated was most influenced by <image 1> <image 2>\n\nA. baths\nB. temples\nC. basilicas\nD. forums\n"

Originally, basilicas were Roman public buildings used for various civic functions, but they were later adapted for Christian worship. The design of these structures provided a spacious interior suitable for large gatherings, which made them ideal for religious purposes.\n\nOption A, baths, typically feature a series of rooms for different temperatures and activities, not the nave and aisle arrangement seen in the images.\n\nOption B, temples, in Roman architecture, usually have a different design, often featuring a cella (inner chamber) and a portico, without the longitudinal division into nave and aisles.\n\nOption D, forums, were public squares surrounded by buildings of various functions, not a single building with a nave and aisle structure.\n\nTherefore, given the architectural features described, the design of the church was most influenced by basilicas."
