The chair has a red backrest and a blue seat, both of which appear to be flat panels. The frame of the chair is constructed from dark wooden beams, which are connected at various points by small yellow blocks. The overall structure suggests a sturdy build, typical of furniture made from wood and plywood. The chair is placed on a wooden floor against a plain wall.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat material is the chair made of? <image 1>\n\nA. cast iron\nB. plastic\nC. steel\nD. plywood\n"

The description mentions \"dark wooden beams\" and a \"sturdy build, typical of furniture made from wood and plywood.\" Therefore, the most appropriate answer from the given options would be D. plywood.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the chair also incorporates other materials, such as the red backrest and blue seat, which are described as \"flat panels,\" possibly made of a different material like plastic or painted wood. Additionally, there are small yellow blocks used to connect the wooden beams, which could be made of a different material altogether, perhaps plastic or metal.\n\nBut given the options provided\u2014cast iron, plastic, steel, and plywood\u2014the best choice is D. plywood, as it aligns with the description of the chair's frame being constructed from dark wooden beams and having a structure typical of wood and plywood furniture.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
