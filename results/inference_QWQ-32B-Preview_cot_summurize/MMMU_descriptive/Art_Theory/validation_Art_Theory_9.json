The figure is wearing a laurel wreath on his head and has long hair. He is holding a sword in his right hand, which rests on the ground, and his left hand is placed on his hip. The figure's right foot is resting on a helmet, and there is a small animal, possibly a dog, at his feet. The statue is highly detailed, with intricate work on the muscles and anatomy of the figure. The overall style and composition suggest it is a work from the Renaissance period.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWho created the figure on the left? <image 1>\n\nA. Bemini\nB. Donatello\nC. Ghiberti\nD. Verrocchio\n"
