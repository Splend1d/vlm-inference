The figures appear to be dressed in ancient attire, with one figure having long hair and the other wearing a headpiece. The sculpture is made of a reddish-brown material and shows signs of age, with some wear and discoloration. The overall style and subject matter suggest that this is an ancient funerary sculpture, likely from the Etruscan or early Roman period.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhere were works such as <image 1> shown typically placed in?\n\nA. an atrium\nB. a necropolis\nC. a treasury\nD. a temple\n"

Given this context, the most appropriate placement for such works would be in a necropolis.\n\nA necropolis is a large cemetery, often associated with ancient cities, where elaborate tombs and funerary monuments were constructed to honor the deceased. Funerary sculptures, such as the one described, were commonly placed within or above the tombs in necropolises to commemorate the lives of the individuals interred there.\n\nAn atrium, on the other hand, is a central courtyard in a Roman house, typically used for domestic activities and receptions. While it's possible that some funerary portraits or memorials might be displayed in private homes, large sculptures like the one described are more likely to be found in burial sites.\n\nA treasury is a place where valuable items are stored, often associated with temples or religious sites. While funerary offerings might be placed in treasuries, the sculptures themselves are more directly associated with the burial sites.\n\nA temple is a religious building dedicated to the worship of deities. While temples might contain sculptures and art related to religious practices, funerary sculptures are more specifically related to burial and commemoration, making a necropolis a more fitting location.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable answer is B. a necropolis.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
