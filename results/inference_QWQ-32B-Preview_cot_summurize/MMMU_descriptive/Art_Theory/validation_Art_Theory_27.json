The walls have arched windows and decorative elements, including calligraphy, suggesting a Byzantine influence with the use of domes, arches, and mosaics.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the building seems to be either a cathedral or a mosque, influenced by Byzantine architecture. Now, considering the options provided:\n\nA. Abd al-Malik: He was a Umayyad caliph who commissioned the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which features a central dome and is an important early Islamic architectural monument. However, the description seems to suggest a larger structure with multiple domes and a more extensive interior, which might not fully align with the Dome of the Rock.\n\nB. Justinian: He was the Byzantine Emperor who commissioned the construction of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which is renowned for its massive central dome supported by piers and features intricate mosaics and arches. The Hagia Sophia is a prime example of Byzantine architecture and matches the description provided quite closely.\n\nC. Charlemagne: He was the Frankish king and Roman emperor who commissioned the Palace of Aachen, which includes the Aachen Cathedral. While this cathedral was influenced by Byzantine architecture and features a central dome, it might not match the level of detail and scale suggested in the description.\n\nD. Shah Jahan: He was the Mughal emperor who commissioned the Taj Mahal, which is a mausoleum known for its Mughal architecture, featuring domes and arches, but it is more characterized by its white marble and intricate carvings rather than the Byzantine elements described.\n\nConsidering the description's emphasis on Byzantine influence, the central dome supported by piers, and the intricate mosaics and arches, the most likely patron is Justinian, who commissioned the Hagia Sophia, which embodies these characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Justinian.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
