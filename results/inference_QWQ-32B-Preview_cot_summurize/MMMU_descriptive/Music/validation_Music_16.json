Therefore, the answer is D. <image 4>\n\nTo elaborate, dotted durations in music notation are used to extend the length of a note or rest beyond its standard value. A single dot adds half of the original duration, a double dot adds half of the single dot's value plus half of that additional value, and so on. Therefore, rests with one, two, or three dots have dotted durations, while a rest with no dots has a simple, undotted duration.\n\nIn this case, Image 4 is the rest without any dots, making it the one without a compound dotted duration."
