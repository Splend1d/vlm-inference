All the staffs A, B, C, and D are in compound meters as per the time signatures given: 6/8, 3/4, 9/8, and 12/8 respectively. However, it's important to note that 3/4 is typically considered a simple meter, not compound. Compound meters are usually 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8, where the beat is divided into three parts. So, if we strictly define compound meters as those with a numerator that is a multiple of 3 and where the beat is divided into three parts, then only staffs A, C, and D are in compound meters. Staff B, with 3/4 time, is in simple meter because each beat is divided into two parts. Therefore, the correct answer should be ABC, but since that option is not provided, and given the options, none of them correctly represent only compound meters. However, based on the description provided, which states that A, C, and D are compound meters, and B is also included in the answer, it seems there might be a confusion in the classification of time signatures. 3/4 is simple triple, not compound. So, the accurate answer should be that only A, C, and D are in compound meters, but according to the given options, D. ABCD is selected, which includes B, which is not technically a compound meter."
