Both staves have a key signature of four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#), indicating the key of A major or F# minor. The time signature is 4/4, which means there are four beats per measure and a quarter note gets one beat.\n\nOn both staves, there is a chord symbol written as \"A\u00d87.\" This indicates an A diminished seventh chord. The chord symbol includes a small circle with a slash through it (\u00d8) followed by the number 7, which signifies a diminished seventh chord.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. A\u00d87\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Name the harmony in the above example.\n\nA. C\u00b07\nB. A\u00d87\nC. G\u00b07\nD. Eb\u00d87\n"
