The bar contains a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note, then a quarter note tied to an eighth note, and finally a quarter note.\n\nThe second image presents three options for rewriting the bar in simple time:\n\n- Option A: The bar has a time signature of 4/4. It starts with a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note, then a quarter note tied to an eighth note, and finally a quarter note.\n- Option B: The bar has a time signature of 2/4. It starts with a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note, then a quarter note tied to an eighth note, and finally a quarter note.\n- Option C: The bar has a time signature of 3/4. It starts with a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note, then a quarter note tied to an eighth note, and finally a quarter note.\n\nEach option has a different time signature but the same rhythmic pattern as the original bar in compound time.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1><image 2>\n\nA. box 1\nB. box 2\nC. box 3\nD.
