The key signature indicates that the piece is in the key of B-flat major, as evidenced by the two flats (B-flat and E-flat) in the key signature at the beginning of the staff. \n\n- Bracket A highlights a chord consisting of the notes B-flat, D, and F.\n- Bracket B highlights a chord consisting of the notes C, E-flat, and G.\n- Bracket C highlights a chord consisting of the notes B-flat, D, and F again.\n\nGiven the key of B-flat major, we can analyze these chords:\n- Bracket A's chord (B-flat, D, F) is a B-flat major chord, which is the tonic chord (I) in the key of B-flat major.\n- Bracket B's chord (C, E-flat, G) is a C minor chord, which is the ii chord (II) in the key of B-flat major.\n- Bracket C's chord (B-flat, D, F) is the same as Bracket A, indicating it is also a B-flat major chord, the tonic chord (I).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the chord marked by Bracket C is:\n\nD. Ic\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nTick one box to name each of the marked chord C. The key is Bb major. <image 1>\n\nA. Va\nB. Vb\nC. Ib\nD. Ic\n"

The options given are:\n\nA. Va\n\nB. Vb\n\nC. Ib\n\nD. Ic\n\nGiven that the tonic chord is I, and considering the options, the correct answer should be related to the tonic chord. The options Ib and Ic both relate to the tonic chord, but the description specifies that Bracket C is a B-flat major chord, which is the same as Bracket A, identified as Ic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nD.
