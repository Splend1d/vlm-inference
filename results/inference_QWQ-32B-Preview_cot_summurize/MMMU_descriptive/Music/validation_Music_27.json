The melody consists of two lines of music, each containing a series of notes and accidentals (sharp, flat, and natural symbols). The key signature at the beginning of the staff indicates that the piece is in the key of A-flat major, as there are four flats (B-flat, E-flat, A-flat, and D-flat) in the key signature.\n\nEnharmonic modulation occurs when a note is rewritten using a different accidental to represent the same pitch. In this melody, there are several instances where notes are written with different accidentals but represent the same pitch:\n\n1. In the first measure, the note G is written as G-flat.\n2. In the second measure, the note F is written as E-sharp.\n3. In the third measure, the note B is written as A-sharp.\n4. In the fourth measure, the note E is written as D-sharp.\n\nTherefore, there are four instances of enharmonic modulation in the melody.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> How many times does enharmonic modulation appear in the following melody?\n\nA. 1\nB. 3\nC. 2\nD. 4\n"

In the first measure, G is written as G-flat.\n\n2. In the second measure, F is written as E-sharp.\n\n3. In the third measure, B is written as A-sharp.\n\n4. In the fourth measure, E is written as D-sharp.\n\nEach of these examples demonstrates a note being represented by a different accidental while sounding the same pitch, which is the definition of enharmonic modulation. Therefore, there are four instances of enharmonic modulation in the melody.\n\nOption A (1) is incorrect because there are multiple instances, not just one.\n\nOption B (3) is incorrect because there are four instances, not three.\n\nOption C (2) is incorrect for the same reason; there are more than two instances.\n\nHence, the correct choice is D. 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
