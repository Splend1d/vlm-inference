The piece is written in the key of G major, as indicated by the one sharp (F#) in the key signature. The dynamics are marked throughout the piece, with the flute part having forte (ff), mezzo-piano (mp), forte (f), and pianissimo (pp) markings. The piano part also has similar dynamic markings.\n\nIn bar 8, both the flute and piano parts have a pianissimo (pp) marking, indicating that this bar should be played very softly. This is the quietest dynamic marking used in the piece.\n\nBased on this description, the answer to the question is:\n\nA. True\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> Bar 8 is the quietest bar in the music, true or false?\n\nA. True\nB. False\n"
