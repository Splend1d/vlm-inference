The note is a quarter note (indicated by the filled-in oval head and stem). There is also a clef symbol at the beginning of the staff, which appears to be a bass clef, indicating that the staff represents the lower range of pitches.\n\nBased on this description, the note is located on the G line of the bass clef staff. In the key of E major, the leading note (the seventh scale degree) is D#. Since the note shown is G, it does not correspond to the leading note in E major.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nB. False\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nDetermine True or False: This is the leading note in E major. <image 1>\n\nA. True\nB. False\n"
