The description says there's a treble clef, and on the staff, there's a note on the second line from the bottom, labeled with a flat symbol, making it an A flat. The question is whether this note is the mediant in F major, and I have to choose between true or false.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the mediant is in music theory. The mediant is the third degree of the scale. So, in F major, I need to find out what the third note of the F major scale is.\n\nLet me list the notes in F major. F major has one flat: B flat. So the scale is F, G, A, B flat, C, D, E, and back to F.\n\nSo, the first note is F (the tonic), the second is G (the supertonic), and the third is A (the mediant).\n\nBut wait, in F major, is A natural or A flat? In the F major scale, A is natural, not flat. So the mediant is A natural.\n\nHowever, the note in the image is A flat, which is a semitone lower than A natural.\n\nTherefore, A flat is not the mediant in F major. The mediant is A natural.\n\nSo, the answer should be false.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's confirm the scale again.\n\nF major scale: F, G, A, B flat, C, D, E, F.\n\nYes, A is the third degree, which is the mediant.\n\nSince the note in question is A flat, which is different from A natural, it cannot be the mediant in F major.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. False.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
