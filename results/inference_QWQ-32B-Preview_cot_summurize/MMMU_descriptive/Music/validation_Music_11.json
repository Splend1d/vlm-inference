This type of ornament is typically referred to as an \"appoggiatura.\"\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. appoggiatura\n\nTo provide more context, let's briefly discuss the other options to understand why they are not the correct choice in this scenario:\n\nA. Acciaccatura: An acciaccatura is a type of ornamental note that is usually smaller and often has a stroke through the stem, indicating that it should be played as quickly as possible before the main note. It is similar to an appoggiatura but is generally shorter and more accented.\n\nC. Lower mordent: A mordent is a rapid alternation between a principal note and a lower or upper neighboring pitch. A lower mordent specifically alternates between the principal note and the note below it. This is different from the described ornament, which consists of two separate notes without the rapid alternation.\n\nD. Upper turns: A turn is an ornament that consists of the note above the main note, the main note, the note below the main note, and then back to the main note again. An upper turn would start with the note above the main note. This does not match the description of a quarter note followed by an eighth note as an ornament.\n\nGiven these distinctions, the ornament described is clearly an appoggiatura, making option B the correct choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
