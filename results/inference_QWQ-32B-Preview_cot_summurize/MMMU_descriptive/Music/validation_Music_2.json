The notes are labeled with accidentals (flats and naturals) to indicate their pitch. The question asks whether this is the correctly written chromatic scale beginning on B-flat. \n\nTo determine if the statement is true or false, we need to check if the notes follow the correct sequence for a chromatic scale starting on B-flat. A chromatic scale consists of all twelve notes in Western music, each separated by a half step (semitone). Starting from B-flat, the sequence should be: B-flat, C, C-sharp (or D-flat), D, D-sharp (or E-flat), E, F, F-sharp (or G-flat), G, G-sharp (or A-flat), A, A-sharp (or B), and then back to B-flat.\n\nIn the image, the notes are:\n- B-flat (B\u266d)\n- C\n- C-sharp (C\u266f)\n- D\n- D-sharp (D\u266f)\n- E\n- F\n- F-sharp (F\u266f)\n- G\n- G-sharp (G\u266f)\n- A\n- A-sharp (A\u266f)\n- B-flat (B\u266d)\n\nThis sequence matches the correct chromatic scale starting on B-flat. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nTrue or False. <image 1>\n\nA. True\nB. False\n"
