                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the graph that best displays the relationship between a person's level of arousal and their performance on a challenging task is Graph E.\n\nThe relationship between arousal and performance on challenging tasks is often described by the Yerkes-Dodson Law. This law suggests that there is an optimal level of arousal for performance on complex tasks. When arousal is too low, performance suffers due to lack of engagement and motivation. As arousal increases, performance improves up to a point, but beyond that optimal level, performance begins to deteriorate due to over-arousal, which can lead to anxiety and distraction.\n\nGraph E depicts an inverted U-shaped curve, which aligns with the Yerkes-Dodson Law. In this graph, performance increases as arousal increases up to a certain point, representing the optimal level of arousal for the task. Beyond this point, as arousal continues to increase, performance decreases, which is consistent with the law's prediction for complex tasks.\n\nLet's briefly consider why the other graphs are less suitable:\n\n- **Graph A**: Shows a U-shaped curve where performance decreases as arousal increases to a certain point, then increases again. This suggests that very high arousal could lead to better performance, which contradicts the Yerkes-Dodson Law for challenging tasks.\n\n- **Graph B**: A straight line with a negative slope indicates that performance decreases linearly as arousal increases. This suggests that higher arousal always leads to poorer performance, which is not in line with the law, as moderate arousal can improve performance.\n\n- **Graph C**: A V-shaped curve where performance decreases sharply as arousal increases to a certain point, then increases sharply again. Similar to Graph A, this implies that extremely high arousal can lead to better performance, which is not supported by the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\n- **Graph D**: A straight line with a positive slope suggests that performance increases linearly as arousal increases. This would imply that higher arousal always leads to better performance, which again contradicts the law, especially for complex tasks where too much arousal can impair performance.\n\nTherefore, Graph E is the most accurate representation of the relationship between arousal and performance on challenging tasks according to the Yerkes-Dodson Law.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
