Each domain has six symptoms listed under it:\n\n- **Emotional:**\n  - Frustration\n  - Moodiness\n  - Agitation\n  - Feeling overwhelmed\n  - Low self-esteem\n  - Loneliness or isolation\n\n- **Physical:**\n  - Decreased energy\n  - Headaches\n  - Diarrhea, constipation, or general stomach upset\n  - Chest pain, rapid heartbeat\n  - Loss of sex drive\n  - Frequent colds\n\n- **Cognitive:**\n  - Frequent anxiety or worry\n  - Poor concentration\n  - Forgetfulness\n  - Inability to focus or concentrate\n  - Negativity\n  - Poor judgment\n\n- **Behavioral:**\n  - Changes in appetite\n  - Changes in sleep\n  - Procrastination\n  - Nervous habits (nail biting or fidgeting)\n  - Increased substance use or abuse\n  - Isolation from others\n\n**Figure 1** is a bar graph titled \"Mean Number of Symptoms Reported\" with the x-axis labeled \"Symptom Category\" and the y-axis labeled \"Mean Number of Symptoms Reported.\" The graph compares the mean number of symptoms reported before and after an intervention across the four categories: Emotional, Cognitive, Behavioral, and Physical. The bars are color-coded:\n- Dark red for \"Pre Intervention\"\n- Light pink for \"Post Intervention\"\n\nThe graph shows that the mean number of symptoms reported decreased in all four categories after the intervention. Specifically:\n- Emotional symptoms decreased from approximately 6 to 2.\n- Cognitive symptoms decreased from approximately 6 to 3.\n- Behavioral symptoms decreased from approximately 5 to 4.\n- Physical symptoms decreased from approximately 5 to 6.\n\nBased on this information, the deep breathing program is best described as:\n\nB. Emotion focused coping because it teaches patients to manage emotions that accompany perception of stress.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with cancer often experience significant amounts of stress. Some patients cope with stress by adopting unhealthy habits (like drinking, smoking, or withdrawing from social relationships), which can increase symptom severity and result in poor quality of life both during and after cancer treatment. Conversely, individuals who manage stress with healthy techniques can experience symptom relief and improved quality of life. A group of oncologists hope to promote healthy stress reduction and decide to focus their efforts on deep breathing. They postulate that a deep breathing exercise will induce the relaxation response, a physical state of deep rest that is the physiological opposite of a stress response (or fight or flight). They believe that when patients learn to breathe more slowly and deeply, their muscles will relax, blood pressure will decrease, and heart rates will slow down (all characteristics of the relaxation response). When testing the exercise with two patients they notice significant decreases in blood pressure, muscle tension, and heart rate. They conclude that the exercise could decrease select physical symptoms of stress. The oncologists decide to expand their testing, and develop several deep-breathing exercises to be delivered in a group format. They believe that the combined exercises will help patients cope during times of stress. The program consists of 30-minute guided group breathing classes that occur biweekly for 8 weeks. Patients are also asked to complete home deep breathing practices. To test their theory, they recruit 10 adult cancer patients to participate in their program. The patient group is homogenous in type and stage of cancer. All patients have recently received their cancer diagnosis. The patients are all between 45 and 55 years old (mean age 48.6) and there are equal numbers of men and women in the group. Each patient completes a stress symptom checklist both before and after the intervention. The stress symptoms checklist can be found in Table 1. The symptom checklist is divided into four categories, with six possible symptoms in each category. Patients are instructed to circle any and all symptoms they are currently experiencing. The results from the study can be found in Figure 1 <image 1>. Which coping strategy best describes the deep breathing program?\n\nA. Appraisal focused coping because it challenges patient's assumptions about cancer and relaxation.\nB. Emotion focused coping because it teaches patients to manage emotions that accompany perception of stress.\nC. Problem focused coping because the program is aimed at learning more about stress and taking control.\nD. Avoidance focused coping because patients distance themselves from their physiological reaction to stressful experiences.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided, the deep breathing program is best described as emotion-focused coping. This is because the program aims to help patients manage their emotional responses to stress by inducing the relaxation response through deep breathing exercises. By teaching patients to breathe more slowly and deeply, the program helps them relax their muscles, decrease blood pressure, and slow heart rates, which are all physical manifestations of reduced emotional stress. The focus is on managing the emotional and physiological symptoms associated with stress rather than directly addressing the stressor itself or avoiding it. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate description of the coping strategy employed in this program."
