                    "text": "I've got this newspaper clipping about a psychological study that's looking for college students to participate in research on authority and behavior. The study involves five 30-minute sessions during the fall semester, and it mentions that there are confederates involved. Participants can leave at any time without penalty, and all IRB procedures will be followed. The details are available in room 248 of Jordan Hall.\n\nSo, the question is asking about the most likely independent variable in this study. The options are:\n\nA. Perception of authority\n\nB. Conformity\n\nC. Perception of behavior\n\nD. Response to authority\n\nE. Age\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an independent variable is. In an experiment, the independent variable is the one that is manipulated by the researcher to observe its effect on the dependent variable. So, in this context, it's what the researchers are changing or controlling to see how participants react.\n\nThe study is about \"authority and behavior.\" From the description, it seems like they're interested in how people behave in response to different kinds of authority. The mention of confederates suggests that there might be people in the study who are part of the research team and perhaps portraying different levels or types of authority.\n\nOption A is \"perception of authority.\" This sounds more like a dependent variable because it's something that might be measured based on how participants respond to the authority figures.\n\nOption B is \"conformity.\" Conformity is often studied in social psychology, especially in relation to authority and group behavior. However, conformity is typically a dependent variable\u2014it's the behavior being measured in response to group pressure or authority.\n\nOption C is \"perception of behavior.\" This is a bit vague. It might refer to how participants perceive the behavior of others, but it's not clear how it would function as an independent variable in this study.\n\nOption D is \"response to authority.\" This seems promising because the study is about how people behave in response to authority. However, \"response to authority\" sounds more like a dependent variable, as it's the outcome being measured.\n\nOption E is \"age.\" The study specifies that they are looking for college students, so age might be a characteristic of the participants, but it doesn't seem directly relevant to the manipulation in the study. Unless they are looking at how different age groups respond to authority, which isn't mentioned.\n\nWait, but the study is specifically looking at college students, so age might be somewhat controlled, assuming that college students are within a certain age range.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the independent variable is the type or level of authority that is presented to the participants. For example, the researchers might be manipulating the authority figure's status, credentials, or manner of speaking to see how that affects participants' behavior.\n\nBut none of the options directly state \"type of authority\" or \"level of authority.\" Option A is \"perception of authority,\" which is closer to how participants view authority, but not the authority itself.\n\nOption D, \"response to authority,\" seems to be more about the outcome rather than what's being manipulated.\n\nPerhaps the independent variable is something that isn't explicitly listed in the options, and I need to choose the closest one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"perception of authority\" is being manipulated, but that seems unlikely. Usually, perception is something that's measured.\n\nWait, perhaps the researchers are manipulating the perception of authority by presenting different authority figures or different cues that suggest varying levels of authority.\n\nIn that case, the independent variable could be the perception of authority, and the dependent variable would be the participants' behavior or response.\n\nBut that seems a bit convoluted. I think it's more straightforward to consider the type or level of authority as the independent variable.\n\nGiven the options, \"perception of authority\" (Option A) might be the closest, as it could represent how the authority is perceived, which is being manipulated by the researchers.\n\nHowever, I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nLet me consider the classic Stanley Milgram experiment on obedience to authority. In that study, the independent variable was the perceived authority of the experimenter, and the dependent variable was the participants' willingness to administer shocks.\n\nIn this case, the study is about authority and behavior, so it might be similar.\n\nTherefore, the independent variable would be the authority figure or the authority condition being manipulated.\n\nSince none of the options directly say \"authority figure\" or \"authority condition,\" I need to choose the most appropriate one.\n\nOption A, \"perception of authority,\" seems closest because it involves how participants perceive the authority, which could be manipulated by the researchers.\n\nOption D, \"response to authority,\" seems more like the dependent variable, as it's the outcome being measured.\n\nTherefore, I think Option A, \"perception of authority,\" is the most likely independent variable in this study.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
