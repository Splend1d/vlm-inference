All groups were given the same set of questions in an exam, but the exam began with a brief introductory statement that differed for each group, establishing differing expectations for student performance, as follows: Group A: The introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam. Group B: The introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam. Group C: The introduction included statistics that showed female students performing worse than male students on similar exams. Group D: The introduction contained no information on expected performance. The results of the experiment are given in the bar graph below: <image 1> What phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B?\n\nA. Social facilitation\nB.

                    "text": "After reviewing the description of the bar graph and the experiment, I need to determine which phenomenon best explains the performance differences between Groups A and B. Let's break down the information and analyze each option step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the experiment setup:\n\n- **Group A:** Introduction stated that most students are expected to pass the exam.\n\n- **Group B:** Introduction stated that most students are expected to fail the exam.\n\n- **Group C:** Introduction included statistics showing female students performing worse than male students on similar exams.\n\n- **Group D:** Introduction contained no information on expected performance.\n\nFrom the bar graph:\n\n- **Group A:** Males ~85, Females ~80\n\n- **Group B:** Males ~70, Females ~65\n\n- **Group C:** Males ~75, Females ~65\n\n- **Group D:** Males ~70, Females ~75\n\nThe question specifically asks about the performance differences between Groups A and B.\n\nLooking at Groups A and B:\n\n- Group A had higher average scores for both males and females compared to Group B.\n\n- Males in Group A scored ~85 vs ~70 in Group B.\n\n- Females in Group A scored ~80 vs ~65 in Group B.\n\nSo, there is a significant difference in performance based on the introductory statement about expectations.\n\nNow, let's consider each option to see which one best explains this phenomenon.\n\n**A. Social facilitation**\n\nSocial facilitation refers to the phenomenon where individuals perform better on simple or well-practiced tasks and worse on complex or new tasks when in the presence of others. However, in this experiment, all groups took the exam under the same conditions, so the presence of others isn't varying between groups. Therefore, social facilitation doesn't seem to be the best explanation here.\n\n**B. Group polarization**\n\nGroup polarization occurs when the views of individuals in a group become more extreme after discussion within the group. In this experiment, students were individually taking an exam, and there was no group discussion involved. Thus, group polarization doesn't seem applicable here.\n\n**C. Self-serving bias**\n\nSelf-serving bias is the tendency for individuals to attribute their successes to internal factors and their failures to external factors. While this might influence how students perceive their performance, it doesn't directly explain why Group A performed better than Group B based on the introductory statement.\n\n**D. Unstable attribution**\n\nI'm not familiar with \"unstable attribution\" as a specific psychological term. It might be a misnomer or a less common concept. Without a clear definition, it's hard to determine if this explains the performance differences.\n\n**E. The Pygmalion effect**\n\nThe Pygmalion effect, also known as the Rosenthal effect, refers to the phenomenon where higher expectations lead to improved performance in individuals. In this experiment, Group A was told that most students are expected to pass, which is a positive expectation, while Group B was told that most students are expected to fail, a negative expectation.\n\nGiven this, the Pygmalion effect seems to align well with the observed differences between Groups A and B. Positive expectations in Group A likely led to better performance, whereas negative expectations in Group B led to poorer performance.\n\nLet's double-check by considering the other groups.\n\n- **Group C:** Introduction included statistics showing females performing worse, which might induce stereotype threat, leading to lower performance in females, as seen in the data.\n\n- **Group D:** No information on expected performance, and females performed slightly better than males on average compared to other groups.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the difference between Groups A and B, which seems most directly explained by the Pygmalion effect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is **E. The Pygmalion effect**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{E} \\]"
