Dual-task condition (white bar)\n2. Baseline (single-task) condition (hatched bar)\n\nFor the \"Prose\" type of memory:\n- The dual-task condition has a bar reaching approximately 25%.\n- The baseline (single-task) condition has a bar reaching approximately 20%.\n\nFor the \"Photograph\" type of memory:\n- The dual-task condition has a bar reaching approximately 60%.\n- The baseline (single-task) condition has a bar reaching approximately 75%.\n\nThe graph indicates that memory performance is lower in the dual-task condition compared to the baseline condition for both prose and photographs, but the difference is more pronounced for photographs.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nTo investigate people's ability to divide their attention between two different tasks, college students were asked to listen to a passage of expository prose and at the same time to inspect a set of photographs, unrelated to the passage, that were projected one by one at a rapid rate. At the end of the dual-task presentation, the students were tested both for their memory of the passage and their memory of the photographs. To establish a baseline for this dual-task condition, the same students also were tested for their memory when each of the component tasks was presented alone.

When conducting an experiment that involves comparing different conditions, such as a baseline (single-task) condition and a dual-task condition, it's crucial to ensure that any differences observed between the conditions are due to the tasks themselves and not to other extraneous variables.\n\nOne such variable is the order in which the conditions are presented. Participants might perform differently based on whether they experience the dual-task condition before or after the baseline condition. For example, if they do the dual-task condition first, they might be more fatigued or distracted when they move to the baseline condition, which could affect their performance. Conversely, if they do the baseline condition first, they might become more adept at the tasks by the time they reach the dual-task condition, potentially performing better than they would have otherwise.\n\nTo control for these order effects, researchers use a technique called counterbalancing. This involves varying the order in which participants experience the different conditions. Some participants would do the baseline condition first, followed by the dual-task condition, while others would do the dual-task condition first, followed by the baseline condition. By averaging the results across all participants, the effects of order can be balanced out, ensuring that any differences observed are due to the conditions themselves rather than the sequence in which they were presented.\n\nOption B, a consistent order in which participants are tested in the baseline and dual-task conditions, is not ideal because it could introduce order effects that bias the results. For example, if all participants do the dual-task condition first and then the baseline condition, any changes in performance between the two conditions might be due to fatigue or practice rather than the tasks themselves.\n\nOption C, having an equal number of men and women as participants, is important for generalizing the results to the broader population, but it's not directly related to controlling for variables within the experiment itself. While gender can be a relevant factor in some studies, in the context of this experiment on divided attention, it's likely not the most critical aspect to control.\n\nOption D, verifying that participants believe themselves capable of dividing attention, touches on participants' expectations or self-efficacy, which could potentially influence their performance. However, in an experimental design aimed at measuring actual performance, it's more important to control for variables that could directly affect the outcome, such as order effects. Moreover, participants' beliefs about their ability to divide attention might not necessarily correlate with their actual performance.\n\nTherefore, among the given options, counterbalancing the order of conditions (option A) is the most important aspect to include in the experimental design to ensure that the results are valid and reliable.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
