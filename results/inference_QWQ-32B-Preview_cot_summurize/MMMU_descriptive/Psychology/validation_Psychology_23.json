Proponents argue that human cognition evolved from primary sensorimotor processing and this necessitates understanding cognitive mechanisms as an interaction between the mind and body. An example of embodied cognition can be seen in mental imagery. There is strong evidence in favor of the visual imagery of an action conflicting with the performance of that action, such as visualizing an 'X' while writing an 'O'. Memory is also believed to be embodied. Proponents of theories of embodied cognition view memory as a representation of the event or object, linked to the sensorimotor information, which defines the possibilities of that event or object. To test whether sensorimotor experience aids decision making, researchers asked professional hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey to read aloud either sentences that described hockey-specific situations or situations encountered in a normal day. An example of a hockey specific situation was reading the sentence \"the player knocked over the net\" and a picture of a hockey net tipped over (match) or right side up (mismatch) was displayed. An example of a situation encountered in a normal day was \"an umbrella was put into the closet\", with a closed (match) or open (mismatch) umbrella pictured. The subject pressed a button to indicate the sentence had been read; a fixation point was shown for 500 msec before a picture was displayed. The time was recorded between the picture presentation and the response of match or mismatch. Figure 1 shows the data from this experiment. Figure 1: The mean accuracy for matched and mismatched sentence/picture combinations for expert hockey players and people unfamiliar with hockey. Results for both hockey and nonhockey related scenarios are displayed. <image 1> How does the model for embodied cognition differ from the information-processing model?\n\nA.

                    "text": "So I've got this question here about embodied cognition and how its model differs from the information-processing model. First, I need to understand what both of these models are about.\n\nStarting with the information-processing model, I know that it compares the human mind to a computer. Just like a computer processes information by following set rules, the mind is thought to process information through a series of cognitive steps. It's all about inputs, processing, and outputs, right? So, it's rule-based and logic-driven.\n\nNow, embodied cognition is different. This theory suggests that our cognitive processes are deeply connected to our physical experiences and interactions with the environment. So, it's not just about internal mental processes; it's about how our body and the world around us shape our thinking.\n\nLooking back at the question, it asks how the embodied cognition model differs from the information-processing model. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. The information-processing model is often characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as a product of represented actions, environment, and past experience.\n\nThis seems accurate. The information-processing model sees the mind as a computer, while embodied cognition sees cognition as influenced by actions, environment, and past experiences.\n\nB. Both models are characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer, rule based and logic driven; however, the embodied cognition model views cognition as passive and problem solving as being based on the computation of inputs and outputs.\n\nThis doesn't sound right. Embodied cognition isn't about passively computing inputs and outputs; it's about active engagement with the environment.\n\nC. They are essentially the same.\n\nNo, they have different perspectives on cognition, so they're not the same.\n\nD. The embodied cognition model is characterized by a metaphor of mind like a computer; however, the information-processing model views cognition as a product of represented actions, environment, and past experience.\n\nThis reverses the models' characteristics, so it's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. The information-processing model is like a computer, while embodied cognition views cognition as a product of actions, environment, and past experience.\n\nTo reinforce this, think about the example given in the question about mental imagery and how visualizing an action can interfere with performing it. This suggests that our thoughts are connected to our physical actions, which aligns with embodied cognition. Also, the memory being linked to sensorimotor information supports the idea that our cognitive processes are grounded in our physical experiences.\n\nIn contrast, the information-processing model would likely view memory and mental imagery as internal representations processed independently of the body's physical actions.\n\nSo, in summary, the key difference is that the information-processing model sees cognition as internal and computational, while embodied cognition sees it as intertwined with the body and the environment.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
