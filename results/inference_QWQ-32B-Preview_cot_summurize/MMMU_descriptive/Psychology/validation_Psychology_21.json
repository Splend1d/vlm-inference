The ethnicities listed are \"African American,\" \"White,\" \"Hispanic American,\" and \"Asian American and other.\" The bars represent the percentage rates as follows:\n- African American: Approximately 16%\n- White: Approximately 8%\n- Hispanic American: Approximately 15%\n- Asian American and other: Approximately 11%\n\nThe second graph is titled \"Rates of mood disorder diagnosis for individuals admitted for psychiatric care by ethnicity.\" It shows the percentage rates of mood disorder diagnoses among individuals admitted for psychiatric care, also categorized by the same ethnicities. The bars represent the percentage rates as follows:\n- African American: Approximately 8%\n- White: Approximately 16%\n- Hispanic American: Approximately 15%\n- Asian American and other: Approximately 11%\n\nBoth graphs use blue bars to represent the respective diagnoses (schizophrenia and mood disorders) across the different ethnic groups.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nUnderstanding the various causes of psychological disorders is a central focus of research in psychology. Further, clinical psychologists must consider factors that influence the incidence rate and characteristics of clinical populations that they treat. The following graphs depict data from a study by L. R. Snowden and F. K. Cheung, who examined demographic differences in the incidence rate of schizophrenia. The first figure shows the percentage rates for schizophrenia diagnosis among individuals admitted for psychiatric care who classified themselves as\"African American,\" White,\" \"Hispanic American,\" or \"Asian American and other.\" <image 1> The following graph shows the percentage rates for mood disorder diagnosis among individuals admitted for psychiatric care, by the same ethnicity classifications. <image 2> Based on psychological research investigating the causes of schizophrenia, which of the following is NOT true?\n\nA. Schizophrenia has a genetic component that can be inherited from biological parents, but genetic factors alone cannot account for the development of the disorder.\nB. The production and activity of specific chemical substances in the brain have been found to be associated with schizophrenia.\nC. Environmental factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia.\nD. A person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.\n"

                    "text": "So I've got these two bar graphs here, and they're showing rates of schizophrenia and mood disorder diagnoses for different ethnic groups among people who were admitted for psychiatric care. The first graph is about schizophrenia, and the second one is about mood disorders. Both graphs have the same ethnic categories: African American, White, Hispanic American, and Asian American and other.\n\nLooking at the schizophrenia graph, it seems like African Americans have the highest rate at about 16%, followed by Hispanic Americans at around 15%, Asian Americans and others at about 11%, and Whites at approximately 8%. In the mood disorder graph, the rates are different: Whites have the highest rate at around 16%, African Americans have about 8%, Hispanic Americans have around 15%, and Asian Americans and others have about 11%.\n\nSo, based on these graphs, there are some interesting differences in how these diagnoses are distributed across ethnic groups. For example, African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to Whites, but less likely to be diagnosed with mood disorders. Whites show the opposite pattern: lower schizophrenia rates but higher mood disorder rates.\n\nNow, the question is related to the causes of schizophrenia and which statement is NOT true based on psychological research. The options are:\n\nA. Schizophrenia has a genetic component that can be inherited from biological parents, but genetic factors alone cannot account for the development of the disorder.\n\nB. The production and activity of specific chemical substances in the brain have been found to be associated with schizophrenia.\n\nC. Environmental factors contribute to the development of schizophrenia.\n\nD. A person has a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.\n\nSo, let's think about each option:\n\nA. This seems accurate. Schizophrenia does have a genetic component, meaning it can run in families, but it's not solely determined by genetics. There are likely multiple genes involved, and environmental factors also play a role.\n\nB. This is also correct. There's a lot of research indicating that imbalances in certain neurotransmitters, like dopamine and serotonin, are associated with schizophrenia.\n\nC. Again, this is consistent with what I know. Environmental factors, such as prenatal exposures, childhood trauma, and stress, have been implicated in the development of schizophrenia.\n\nD. This one stands out. If both parents have schizophrenia, does that mean their child will definitely develop it? From what I understand, even with both parents affected, the risk isn't 100%. There's a increased risk, certainly, but it's not deterministic.\n\nSo, based on this, option D seems not to be true, making it the correct answer to the question.\n\nBut just to double-check, let's consider the heritability of schizophrenia. I know that if one identical twin has schizophrenia, the concordance rate for the other twin is around 40-60%, not 100%. Similarly, if both parents have schizophrenia, the risk to their offspring is higher than in the general population, but still not 100%. So, yes, option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the statement that is NOT true is D: A person does not have a 100% chance of developing schizophrenia if both of his or her parents have schizophrenia.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
