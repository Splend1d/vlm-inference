The x-axis ranges from 1 to 12, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 20. The graph shows a downward trend, indicating that as the group size increases, the amount of effort decreases. There are several data points plotted on the graph, and a smooth curve connects these points, illustrating the general trend. The curve starts high at a group size of 1 and gradually declines as the group size increases, suggesting that individuals tend to exert less effort as the size of the group grows larger.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> The graph above depicts the extent to which individuals in groups of various sizes exerted themselves while they performed a certain task. What does the information illustrate?\n\nA. Social loafing\nB. Social facilitation\nC. Group polarization\nD. Groupthink\nE. Minority influence\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the graph shows a downward trend where the amount of effort decreases as the group size increases. This suggests that individuals exert less effort when they are in larger groups compared to smaller groups or when they are alone. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as \"social loafing.\"\n\nSocial loafing is a concept in social psychology that refers to the tendency for individuals to put in less effort when they are working in a group than when they are working alone. This can happen for various reasons, such as individuals feeling less accountable for the overall outcome when they are part of a larger group, or assuming that others will pick up the slack.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n\nA. Social loafing\n\nB. Social facilitation\n\nC. Group polarization\n\nD. Groupthink\n\nE. Minority influence\n\nThe correct answer is A. Social loafing.\n\nTo elaborate further:\n\n- **Social facilitation** (option B) is a different concept, which refers to the phenomenon where individuals perform better on simple or well-rehearsed tasks when in the presence of others, but perform worse on complex or new tasks.\n\n- **Group polarization** (option C) occurs when the views of a group become more extreme after discussion, moving further away from a neutral center.\n\n- **Groupthink** (option D) is a psychological phenomenon where group members strive for harmony and consensus at the expense of critical thinking and rational decision-making.\n\n- **Minority influence** (option E) refers to the process by which a minority subgroup can influence the beliefs or behaviors of the majority group.\n\nNone of these concepts directly relate to the decrease in individual effort as group size increases, which is clearly illustrated by the graph's downward trend. Therefore, social loafing is the most appropriate choice among the given options.\n\n## Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
