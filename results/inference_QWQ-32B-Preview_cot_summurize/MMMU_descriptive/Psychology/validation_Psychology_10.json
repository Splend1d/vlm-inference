The lobes are labeled with numbers 1 through 4:\n\n1. The region labeled \"1\" is located at the front of the brain.\n2. The region labeled \"2\" is situated behind the first region, towards the top and slightly to the back.\n3. The region labeled \"3\" is positioned further back, near the rear of the brain.\n4. The region labeled \"4\" is located at the bottom of the brain, below the other three regions.\n\nBased on this description, the lobes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe, respectively. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nRefer to the figure <image 1>. Which correctly names the lobes labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively?\n\nA. Temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, frontal lobe\nB. Frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, parietal lobe\nC. Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, temporal lobe\nD. Temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe\n"

The description indicates that region 1 is at the front of the brain, which corresponds to the frontal lobe. Region 2 is behind region 1, towards the top and slightly to the back, which matches the position of the parietal lobe. Region 3 is further back, near the rear of the brain, which is the location of the occipital lobe. Finally, region 4 is at the bottom of the brain, below the other three regions, corresponding to the temporal lobe. Therefore, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 aligns with frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, respectively."
