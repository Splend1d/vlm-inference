The table is divided into four main categories: \"Test\" (positive or negative) and \"hepatic schistosomiasis\" (Yes or No). Here are the details:\n\n- In the \"positive\" test category:\n  - For those with hepatic schistosomiasis (\"Yes\"), there are 117 individuals.\n  - For those without hepatic schistosomiasis (\"No\"), there are 53 individuals.\n  - The total number of individuals with a positive test result is 170.\n\n- In the \"negative\" test category:\n  - For those with hepatic schistosomiasis (\"Yes\"), there are 8 individuals.\n  - For those without hepatic schistosomiasis (\"No\"), there are 312 individuals.\n  - The total number of individuals with a negative test result is 320.\n\n- The overall totals are:\n  - Total individuals with hepatic schistosomiasis (\"Yes\"): 125.\n  - Total individuals without hepatic schistosomiasis (\"No\"): 365.\n  - Grand total of all individuals tested: 490.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nSkin tests were used to screen for hepatic schistosomiasis in rural villages along the river and the results were shown in the table.<image 1>The Pr+ was\n\nA. 0.69\nB. 0.98\nC. 0.02\nD. 0.94\n"

Pr+ likely stands for the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease. In other words, it's the proportion of true positive results among all positive test results.\n\nThe formula for positive predictive value (PPV) is:\n\n\\[ PPV = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- TP (True Positives) are the number of individuals who have the disease and test positive.\n- FP (False Positives) are the number of individuals who do not have the disease but test positive.\n\nFrom the contingency table:\n\n- TP (True Positives): 117 (hepatic schistosomiasis Yes and test positive)\n- FP (False Positives): 53 (hepatic schistosomiasis No and test positive)\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ PPV = \\frac{117}{117 + 53} = \\frac{117}{170} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate this fraction:\n\n\\[ \\frac{117}{170} \\approx 0.6882 \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places:\n\n\\[ 0.69 \\]\n\nTherefore, the positive predictive value (Pr+) is approximately 0.69.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 0.69\nB. 0.98\nC. 0.02\nD. 0.94\n\nThe correct answer is A. 0.69.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
