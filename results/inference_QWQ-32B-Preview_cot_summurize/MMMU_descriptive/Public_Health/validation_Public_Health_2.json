The study aimed to investigate the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension. The table provides unstratified information on the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. Here are the details from the table:\n\n- **Drinking Alcohol**: This column indicates whether the subjects drank alcohol or not.\n- **Cases (%)**: This column shows the number and percentage of individuals who had hypertension.\n- **Control (%)**: This column shows the number and percentage of individuals who did not have hypertension.\n- **Total**: This column shows the total number of individuals in each category.\n\nThe specific data in the table is as follows:\n\n- **Yes (Drinking Alcohol)**:\n  - Cases: 73 (47.4%)\n  - Control: 202 (34.6%)\n  - Total: 275\n\n- **No (Not Drinking Alcohol)**:\n  - Cases: 81 (52.6%)\n  - Control: 381 (65.4%)\n  - Total: 462\n\n- **Total**:\n  - Cases: 154\n  - Control: 583\n  - Total: 737\n\nThis table helps in analyzing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension by comparing the percentages and numbers of cases and controls in each category.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn order to study the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, a case-control study was conducted in 1992 by the Epidemiology Department of Shandong Medical University on the basis of community-based population screening, in which 154 new cases of hypertension were randomly selected as a case group and 583 normal people as a control group. The past alcohol consumption of the study subjects was investigated, along with variables such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI>24 as overweight). Considering that body mass index may be a potential confounder when analysing the relationship between drinking alcohol and hypertension, it needs to be analysed and judged. The following table presents unstratified information on the relationship between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive disorders. <image 1> The cOR between the drinking alcohol and hypertensive is\n\nA. 1.70\nB. 2.50\nC. 3.20\nD. 4.80\n"

The cOR is a measure of association between an exposure (drinking alcohol) and an outcome (hypertension) in a case-control study.\n\nThe formula for the crude odds ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cOR} = \\frac{\\text{odds of exposure in cases}}{\\text{odds of exposure in controls}} = \\frac{a/d}{b/c}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a \\) = number of cases who drank alcohol\n- \\( b \\) = number of cases who did not drink alcohol\n- \\( c \\) = number of controls who drank alcohol\n- \\( d \\) = number of controls who did not drink alcohol\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- **Drinking Alcohol (Yes)**:\n  - Cases: 73\n  - Controls: 202\n\n- **Not Drinking Alcohol (No)**:\n  - Cases: 81\n  - Controls: 381\n\nSo, assigning the values:\n\n- \\( a = 73 \\)\n- \\( b = 81 \\)\n- \\( c = 202 \\)\n- \\( d = 381 \\)\n\nNow, plug these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cOR} = \\frac{73 / 81}{202 / 381}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the odds of exposure in cases:\n\n\\[\n\\text{odds of exposure in cases} = \\frac{73}{81} \\approx 0.9012\n\\]\n\nNext, calculate the odds of exposure in controls:\n\n\\[\n\\text{odds of exposure in controls} = \\frac{202}{381} \\approx 0.5299\n\\]\n\nNow, divide the two odds to get the cOR:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cOR} = \\frac{0.9012}{0.5299} \\approx 1.70\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the crude odds ratio between drinking alcohol and hypertension is approximately 1.70.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
