                    "text": "So I have this table that shows the incidence of a certain disease in smoking and non-smoking populations. The incidence is given per 100,000 people. For smokers, it's 48.0 per 100,000, and for non-smokers, it's 25.4 per 100,000. The question is asking for the AR% comparing smoking and non-smoking in relation to the disease. AR% probably stands for attributable risk percentage, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me look that up.\n\nOkay, attributable risk (AR) is a measure used in epidemiology to quantify the proportion of disease in the exposed group that is due to the exposure. Attributable risk percent (AR%) is the AR expressed as a percentage of the total disease incidence in the exposed group. The formula for AR% is: AR% = (Ie - Iu) / Ie * 100%, where Ie is the incidence in the exposed group and Iu is the incidence in the unexposed group.\n\nIn this case, the exposed group is smokers, and the unexposed group is non-smokers. So, Ie is 48.0 per 100,000, and Iu is 25.4 per 100,000. Plugging these values into the formula, AR% = (48.0 - 25.4) / 48.0 * 100% = 22.6 / 48.0 * 100% \u2248 47.08%.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 48.0 - this is just the incidence in smokers, not AR%.\n\nB. 48.0 - 25.4 = 22.6 - this is the attributable risk (AR), not AR%.\n\nC. 48.0 / 25.4 = 1.89 - this is the relative risk.\n\nD. (48.0 - 25.4) / 48.0 - this is the AR% without multiplying by 100%.\n\nWait, option D is (48.0 - 25.4) / 48.0, which is 22.6 / 48.0 \u2248 0.4708, which is 47.08% when multiplied by 100%. So, it's essentially the AR%.\n\nBut in the options, it's not multiplied by 100%, so it's 0.4708, which is the decimal form of the percentage.\n\nI think the question might be expecting the percentage form, but since it's not specified, and option D matches the calculation, perhaps D is the correct choice.\n\nAlternatively, if they want the percentage, they should have included the percentage sign or specified it in the options.\n\nWait, option D is (48.0 - 25.4) / 48.0, which is the formula for AR%, but without specifying to multiply by 100%. So, it's likely that D is the correct choice.\n\nOptions A, B, and C don't represent AR%. A is just the incidence in smokers, B is the AR, and C is the relative risk.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n"
