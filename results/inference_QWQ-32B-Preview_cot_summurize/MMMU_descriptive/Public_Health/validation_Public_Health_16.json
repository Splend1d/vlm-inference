The table is divided into several columns and rows, with the following structure:\n\n- **Age groups (years)**: This column lists different age ranges (25~, 30~, 35~, 40~, 45~49).\n- **MI group**: This column shows the number of cases in the myocardial infarction group within each age range.\n- **Control group**: This column shows the number of cases in the control group within each age range.\n- **OC exposure**:\n  - **MI**: This sub-column shows the number of cases in the myocardial infarction group who were exposed to OC within each age range.\n  - **Control**: This sub-column shows the number of cases in the control group who were exposed to OC within each age range.\n\nThe table also includes totals at the bottom for each column.\n\nHere are the specific numbers from the table:\n\n- **Age groups (years)**:\n  - 25~: \n    - MI group: 6 (2.6%)\n    - Control group: 286 (16.4%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 4 (66.7%)\n      - Control: 62 (21.7%)\n  - 30~:\n    - MI group: 21 (9.0%)\n    - Control group: 423 (24.3%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 9 (42.9%)\n      - Control: 33 (7.8%)\n  - 35~:\n    - MI group: 37 (15.8%)\n    - Control group: 356 (20.4%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 4 (10.8%)\n      - Control: 26 (7.3%)\n  - 40~:\n    - MI group: 71 (30.3%)\n    - Control group: 371 (21.3%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 6 (8.5%)\n      - Control: 9 (2.4%)\n  - 45~49:\n    - MI group: 99 (42.3%)\n    - Control group: 306 (17.6%)\n    - OC exposure:\n      - MI: 6 (6.1%)\n      - Control: 5 (1.6%)\n\n- **Total**:\n  - MI group: 234 (100.0%)\n  - Control group: 1742 (100.0%)\n  - OC exposure:\n    - MI: 29 (12.4%)\n    - Control: 135 (7.7%)\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe introduction of the oral contraceptive(OC) in the 1960s provided an additional effective means of family planning, but it also had unanticipated side effects, particularly the susceptibility to thromboembolism. Women taking OC had an increased risk of pulmonary, cerebral, and coronary thrombosis or embolism.A larger case-control study was conducted in the United States between 1976-1978 by Shapiro et al. to explore the relationship between OC use and myocardial infarction(MI) in women under 50 years of age.The age distribution of the MI and control groups and OC exposure among MI patients and controls in each age group were shown in the table below.<image 1> The 95% CI for OR in 25-29 years was\n\nA.

                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the odds ratio (OR) in the age group 25-29 years based on the data provided in the table.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant data from the table for the 25-29 age group:\n\n- MI group:\n\n- Total cases: 6\n\n- OC exposed: 4\n\n- Control group:\n\n- Total cases: 286\n\n- OC exposed: 62\n\nNext, we need to organize this data into a 2x2 contingency table format to calculate the OR and its CI.\n\nThe 2x2 table would look like this:\n\n|               | MI Group | Control Group |\n|---------------|----------|---------------|\n| OC Exposed    | 4        | 62            |\n| OC Not Exposed| 2        | 224           |\n\nNote:\n\n- OC Not Exposed in MI Group = Total MI cases - OC exposed in MI Group = 6 - 4 = 2\n\n- OC Not Exposed in Control Group = Total Control cases - OC exposed in Control Group = 286 - 62 = 224\n\nNow, we can calculate the odds ratio (OR):\n\nOR = (Exposed in MI * Not Exposed in Control) / (Exposed in Control * Not Exposed in MI)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nOR = (4 * 224) / (62 * 2) = (896) / (124) \u2248 7.2258\n\nNext, we need to calculate the 95% CI for this OR. The formula for the CI of the OR is:\n\nCI = e^(ln(OR) \u00b1 (1.96 * sqrt(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d)))\n\nwhere:\n\n- a = Exposed in MI = 4\n\n- b = Not Exposed in MI = 2\n\n- c = Exposed in Control = 62\n\n- d = Not Exposed in Control = 224\n\nFirst, calculate ln(OR):\n\nln(7.2258) \u2248 1.977\n\nNext, calculate the standard error (SE):\n\nSE = sqrt(1/4 + 1/2 + 1/62 + 1/224) \u2248 sqrt(0.25 + 0.5 + 0.0161 + 0.0045) \u2248 sqrt(0.7706) \u2248 0.878\n\nNow, calculate the 95% CI:\n\nLower limit = e^(ln(OR) - 1.96 * SE) = e^(1.977 - 1.96 * 0.878) \u2248 e^(1.977 - 1.721) \u2248 e^(0.256) \u2248 1.291\n\nUpper limit = e^(ln(OR) + 1.96 * SE) = e^(1.977 + 1.96 * 0.878) \u2248 e^(1.977 + 1.721) \u2248 e^(3.698) \u2248 40.37\n\nTherefore, the 95% CI for OR in the 25-29 age group is approximately (1.29 to 40.37).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. (1.29~40.37)\n\nThis matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlternative method using the formula for the SE of ln(OR):\n\nSE = sqrt[(1/a) + (1/b) + (1/c) + (1/d)] = sqrt[(1/4) + (1/2) + (1/62) + (1/224)] = sqrt[0.25 + 0.5 + 0.0161 + 0.0045] = sqrt[0.7706] \u2248 0.878\n\nThen, 95% CI for ln(OR):\n\nLower limit = ln(OR) - 1.96 * SE = 1.977 - 1.96 * 0.878 \u2248 1.977 - 1.721 \u2248 0.256\n\nUpper limit = ln(OR) + 1.96 * SE = 1.977 + 1.96 * 0.878 \u2248 1.977 + 1.721 \u2248 3.698\n\nExponentiating back:\n\nLower limit: e^0.256 \u2248 1.291\n\nUpper limit: e^3.698 \u2248 40.37\n\nThus, the 95% CI is indeed approximately (1.29 to 40.37).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. (1.29~40.37)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
