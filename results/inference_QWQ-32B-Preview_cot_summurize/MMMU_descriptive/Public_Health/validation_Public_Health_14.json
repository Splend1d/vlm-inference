The table is divided into two main columns: \"Case group\" and \"Control group.\" Each column has three rows:\n\n1. The first row under each column is labeled \"A history of exposure.\"\n   - In the Case group, there are 400 individuals.\n   - In the Control group, there are 100 individuals.\n\n2. The second row under each column is labeled \"No history of exposure.\"\n   - In the Case group, there are 100 individuals.\n   - In the Control group, there are 400 individuals.\n\n3. The third row under each column is labeled \"Total.\"\n   - The total number of individuals in the Case group is 500.\n   - The total number of individuals in the Control group is also 500.\n\nThe table provides the distribution of individuals with and without a history of exposure between the case and control groups.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn a case-control study, the results were shown in the table below.
