The table has four columns and three rows, excluding the header row. Here is the detailed description:\n\n- **Header Row:**\n  - Areas\n  - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination (RMB 10,000)\n  - Direct benefits (RMB 10,000)\n  - Indirect benefits (RMB 10,000)\n\n- **Data Rows:**\n  - **High endemic area:**\n    - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination: 18\n    - Direct benefits: 286\n    - Indirect benefits: 683\n  - **Middle endemic area:**\n    - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination: 22\n    - Direct benefits: 345\n    - Indirect benefits: 1571\n  - **Low endemic area:**\n    - Total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination: 42\n    - Direct benefits: 562\n    - Indirect benefits: 1852\n\nThe table provides information on the total cost of Hepatitis B vaccination and the direct and indirect benefits in RMB 10,000 for each of the three endemic areas: high, middle, and low.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe costs and benefits of hepatitis B vaccination (10 $\\mu $gX3) to achieve a certain level of protection were analysed by an academic who chose high, middle and low endemic areas of hepatitis B.
