The table is divided into four main columns: \"Test results,\" \"Patients with cervical lesions,\" and \"Patients with non-cervical lesions.\" Each column has further sub-columns for the specific test results.\n\nHere is the detailed breakdown of the table:\n\n### Test Results:\n- **Electronic Colposcopy**:\n  - Positive (+)\n  - Negative (-)\n\n- **TCT**:\n  - Positive (+)\n  - Negative (-)\n\n### Patients with Cervical Lesions:\n- **+ (Positive)**:\n  - Electronic Colposcopy: 15\n  - TCT: 5\n  - Both: 70\n  - Neither: 10\n\n### Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions:\n- **+ (Positive)**:\n  - Electronic Colposcopy: 10\n  - TCT: 220\n  - Both: 25\n  - Neither: 245\n\n### Total:\n- **Patients with Cervical Lesions**: 100\n- **Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions**: 500\n\nThe table provides a comprehensive summary of the test results for both screening methods across patients with and without cervical lesions.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA maternal and child health facility wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of two methods of screening for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III), electronic colposcopy and cervical liquid-based cytology (TCT). 600 gynaecological outpatient cases were examined by both methods, and all cases were confirmed with cervical histopathology (the gold standard) at the same time. The results of all examinations were summarised in the table.<image 1> The +LR of the parallel test was\n\nA. 1.76\nB. 14\nC. 12.14\nD. 8.67\n"

                    "text": "To answer this question, we need to calculate the positive likelihood ratio (+LR) for the parallel testing strategy using both electronic colposcopy and TCT for screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I-III). The parallel test means that a positive result is considered if either one of the two tests is positive.\n\nFirst, let's understand the concept of likelihood ratios. The positive likelihood ratio (+LR) is a measure used in diagnostic testing to interpret the results of a test. It compares the probability of a positive test result in patients with the disease to the probability of a positive test result in patients without the disease. It is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n+LR = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{specificity}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, in this scenario, we are dealing with a combination of two tests in a parallel fashion. Therefore, we need to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the combined test.\n\nFrom the table provided in the description, we have the following data:\n\n### Patients with Cervical Lesions (Diseased group, D+):\n\n- Electronic Colposcopy positive: 15\n\n- TCT positive: 5\n\n- Both positive: 70\n\n- Neither positive: 10\n\nTotal patients with cervical lesions: 100\n\n### Patients with Non-Cervical Lesions (Non-diseased group, D-):\n\n- Electronic Colposcopy positive: 10\n\n- TCT positive: 220\n\n- Both positive: 25\n\n- Neither positive: 245\n\nTotal patients with non-cervical lesions: 500\n\nFirst, let's organize the data to find out the number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) for the parallel testing strategy.\n\nIn parallel testing:\n\n- A test is considered positive if either electronic colposcopy or TCT is positive.\n\n- A test is considered negative only if both electronic colposcopy and TCT are negative.\n\n### For the Diseased group (D+):\n\n- TP (either electronic colposcopy or TCT positive):\n\n  - Electronic Colposcopy positive: 15\n\n  - TCT positive: 5\n\n  - Both positive: 70\n\n  - However, since both positive is already included in both individual positives, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n  - TP = (Electronic Colposcopy positive) + (TCT positive) - (Both positive)\n\n  - TP = 15 + 5 - 70 = -50\n\n  This result doesn't make sense because the number of positives can't be negative. There must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the table.\n\nWait a minute. The table seems to be presenting overlapping data in a way that's confusing. Let's try to interpret it differently.\n\nLooking back at the description:\n\n- \"Patients with cervical lesions: + (Positive): Electronic Colposcopy: 15, TCT: 5, Both: 70, Neither: 10\"\n\n- \"Patients with non-cervical lesions: + (Positive): Electronic Colposcopy: 10, TCT: 220, Both: 25, Neither: 245\"\n\nThis seems inconsistent because if \"both\" are positive, it should include those who have both tests positive.\n\nLet me try to reframe the data.\n\nAssuming:\n\n- In patients with cervical lesions:\n\n  - Only electronic colposcopy positive: 15\n\n  - Only TCT positive: 5\n\n  - Both positive: 70\n\n  - Neither positive: 10\n\n  Total: 15 + 5 + 70 + 10 = 100, which matches.\n\n- In patients with non-cervical lesions:\n\n  - Only electronic colposcopy positive: 10\n\n  - Only TCT positive: 220\n\n  - Both positive: 25\n\n  - Neither positive: 245\n\n  Total: 10 + 220 + 25 + 245 = 500, which matches.\n\nNow, for the parallel testing:\n\n- A positive test is if either electronic colposcopy or TCT is positive.\n\n### For the Diseased group (D+):\n\n- TP (either electronic colposcopy or TCT positive):\n\n  - Only electronic colposcopy positive: 15\n\n  - Only TCT positive: 5\n\n  - Both positive: 70\n\n  - TP = 15 + 5 + 70 = 90\n\n- FN (neither positive): 10\n\n### For the Non-diseased group (D-):\n\n- FP (either electronic colposcopy or TCT positive):\n\n  - Only electronic colposcopy positive: 10\n\n  - Only TCT positive: 220\n\n  - Both positive: 25\n\n  - FP = 10 + 220 + 25 = 255\n\n- TN (neither positive): 245\n\nNow, we can calculate sensitivity and specificity for the parallel testing strategy.\n\n### Sensitivity:\n\n\\[\n\\text{sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{90}{90 + 10} = \\frac{90}{100} = 0.90\n\\]\n\n### Specificity:\n\n\\[\n\\text{specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{245}{245 + 255} = \\frac{245}{500} = 0.49\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the positive likelihood ratio (+LR):\n\n\\[\n+LR = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{specificity}} = \\frac{0.90}{1 - 0.49} = \\frac{0.90}{0.51} \\approx 1.76\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the +LR of the parallel test is approximately 1.76.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 1.76\n\nB. 14\n\nC. 12.14\n\nD. 8.67\n\nOption A seems to match our calculation.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Double-checking:\n\n- TP = 90 (from diseased group: 15 + 5 + 70)\n\n- FN = 10 (diseased group: neither positive)\n\n- FP = 255 (non-diseased group: 10 + 220 + 25)\n\n- TN = 245 (non-diseased group: neither positive)\n\n- Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 90 / 100 = 0.90\n\n- Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 245 / 500 = 0.49\n\n- +LR = sensitivity / (1 - specificity) = 0.90 / 0.51 \u2248 1.76\n\nThe calculation seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1.76.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
