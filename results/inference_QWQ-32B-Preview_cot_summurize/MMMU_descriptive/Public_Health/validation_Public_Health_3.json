The table shows the number of cases observed in each group over a 3-year follow-up period: 1 case in the vaccination group and 10 cases in the control group.\n\nThe question is about determining the main outcome of the study, which aimed to assess the preventive and immunological effects of a newly developed hepatitis A vaccine in 7-year-old susceptible children.\n\nGiven the context, the study is likely an intervention study where one group received the vaccine and the other did not, serving as the control. The primary interest would be to see if the vaccine reduces the occurrence of hepatitis A in the vaccinated group compared to the control group.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Incidence of hepatitis A\n\nB. Prevalence of hepatitis A\n\nC. Secondary attack rate of hepatitis A\n\nD. Survival rate of hepatitis A\n\nLet's consider what each of these terms means:\n\n1. **Incidence** refers to the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific period of time. Since the study is following participants over 3 years and counting new cases, incidence seems relevant.\n\n2. **Prevalence** is the proportion of individuals in a population who have a particular disease at a specific point in time or over a period. While related, it doesn't specifically measure new cases over time.\n\n3. **Secondary attack rate** is used in infectious disease studies to measure the risk of infection among contacts of infected individuals. This doesn't directly relate to the vaccine's effectiveness in a general population.\n\n4. **Survival rate** refers to the proportion of individuals surviving a particular disease over a period of time. Since hepatitis A is generally self-limiting with few fatalities, especially in children, this seems less relevant to the study's main outcome.\n\nGiven that the study is assessing the preventive effects of the vaccine, it is most interested in preventing new cases of hepatitis A. Therefore, the main outcome would be the incidence of hepatitis A in the vaccination group compared to the control group.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Incidence of hepatitis A\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
