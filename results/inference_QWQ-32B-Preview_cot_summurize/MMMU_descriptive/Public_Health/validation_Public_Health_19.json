The systolic blood pressure values (in mmHg) are as follows: 118, 122, 128, 134, 144, 128, 162, 154, 146, and 128. The corresponding BMI values are: 19, 22, 28, 29, 34, 21, 32, 38, 22, and 21.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA researcher recorded systolic blood pressure and body mass index in 10 men aged 35-45 years, and the data are shown in the table below. <image 1> Linear regression analysis with systolic blood pressure as the dependent variable and body mass index as the independent variable yielded a regression coefficient of b = 1.648, SS back = 1044.352, and SS total = 1,878.400.
