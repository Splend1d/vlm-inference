The vaccination group consists of 5044 persons, while the placebo group consists of 4873 persons. The table is divided into several categories:\n\n1. **Serious adverse reactions**:\n   - Within 28 days after injection: Both groups have 45 incidents.\n   - Within 14 months after injection: The vaccination group has 111 incidents, and the placebo group has 131 incidents.\n\n2. **Other adverse reactions within 7 days after injection**:\n   - Any adverse reactions: The vaccination group has 2593 incidents, and the placebo group has 2639 incidents.\n   - Tertiary adverse reactions: The vaccination group has 150 incidents, and the placebo group has 158 incidents.\n\nThe table provides a clear comparison of adverse reactions between the two groups across different time frames and severity levels.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn February 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the same issue two epidemiological trials (field trials) of inactivated EV71 vaccine conducted by scholars in China respectively. One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in placebo group was\n\nA. 51.4%\nB. 52.4%\nC. 3.1%\nD. 10.8%\n"

                    "text": "I'm looking at this table about adverse reactions from a vaccine study. There are two groups: the vaccination group with 5044 people and the placebo group with 4873 people. The table compares adverse reactions in these groups over different time periods and severities.\n\nFirst, there's a section on serious adverse reactions. It shows that within 28 days after injection, both groups have 45 incidents. Then, within 14 months after injection, the vaccination group has 111 incidents, and the placebo group has 131 incidents. So, over a longer period, there are more serious adverse reactions in both groups, but slightly more in the placebo group.\n\nNext, there's a section on other adverse reactions within 7 days after injection. It breaks this down into \"any adverse reactions\" and \"tertiary adverse reactions.\" For any adverse reactions, the vaccination group has 2593 incidents, and the placebo group has 2639 incidents. For tertiary adverse reactions, the vaccination group has 150 incidents, and the placebo group has 158 incidents.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group. Looking at the table, the placebo group has 158 tertiary adverse reactions.\n\nBut to find the incidence, I need to calculate the proportion of the placebo group that experienced tertiary adverse reactions. So, it's 158 out of 4873 people.\n\nTo find the percentage, I'll divide 158 by 4873 and then multiply by 100.\n\nLet me do the math:\n\n158 \u00f7 4873 = approximately 0.0324\n\nThen, 0.0324 \u00d7 100 = 3.24%\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 51.4%\n\nB. 52.4%\n\nC. 3.1%\n\nD. 10.8%\n\nThe closest answer to 3.24% is C. 3.1%.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if 158 out of 4873 is indeed 3.24%.\n\nLet me calculate it again:\n\n158 divided by 4873 is approximately 0.03242, which is 3.242%.\n\nGiven that, option C is 3.1%, which is slightly lower, but it's the closest among the choices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a different calculation. Perhaps it's based on the serious adverse reactions or another part of the table.\n\nLet me double-check the table.\n\nThe table has:\n\n- Serious adverse reactions: both groups have 45 within 28 days, then 111 and 131 within 14 months.\n\n- Other adverse reactions within 7 days: any reactions are 2593 and 2639, and tertiary reactions are 150 and 158.\n\nThe question specifies \"the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group.\"\n\nSo, it's clearly referring to the tertiary adverse reactions, which are 158 in the placebo group.\n\nThe total number in the placebo group is 4873.\n\nSo, 158 out of 4873 is about 3.24%, and the closest option is C. 3.1%.\n\nMaybe there's a misinterpretation of the table.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the incidence is calculated differently, incorporating the number of persons who experienced reactions.\n\nWait, the table shows the number of incidents, not the number of persons experiencing reactions.\n\nBut in vaccine trials, adverse reactions can be multiple per person.\n\nHowever, incidence usually refers to the proportion of people who experience the adverse reaction, not the number of incidents.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to find out how many people in the placebo group had at least one tertiary adverse reaction.\n\nBut the table shows \"number of incidents,\" not \"number of persons with at least one incident.\"\n\nThe description says \"the number of incidents,\" so it's possible that some people had multiple adverse reactions.\n\nIn that case, the incidence would be the number of people who had at least one tertiary adverse reaction, not the total number of incidents.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to know how many unique persons had at least one tertiary adverse reaction.\n\nBut the table doesn't provide that information directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the incidence to be the total number of tertiary adverse reactions per person.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me look back at the question:\n\n\"The incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group was\"\n\nGiven that \"incidence\" typically refers to the proportion of people who experience the adverse reaction, I think the question is expecting the percentage of people in the placebo group who had at least one tertiary adverse reaction.\n\nHowever, the table shows the number of incidents, not the number of persons who had at least one incident.\n\nWithout knowing how many unique persons had tertiary adverse reactions, I can't calculate the exact incidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each incident corresponds to a different person, which is unlikely, given that some people might have multiple adverse reactions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the incidence is calculated based on person-years or another measure, but that seems more complex.\n\nGiven the information provided, the best estimate is to assume that the number of incidents roughly corresponds to the number of persons, although this may not be accurate.\n\nIf I make that assumption, then the incidence would be 158 out of 4873, which is about 3.24%, matching option C (3.1%).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to account for the follow-up time, but the question seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the incidence is calculated differently in vaccine trials.\n\nWait, the question says \"the incidence of tertiary adverse reactions in the placebo group was\"\n\nGiven the options, it seems like it's asking for a percentage, and the closest match to my calculation is C. 3.1%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the incidence is calculated based on the serious adverse reactions.\n\nBut the question specifically mentions tertiary adverse reactions, which are listed separately in the table.\n\nSo, I think C. 3.1% is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
