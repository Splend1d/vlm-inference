                    "text": "I have this case-control study data about drinking water and rectal cancer, and I need to find the adjusted odds ratio (OR). The study considers that place of residence might be a confounder, so they divided the data into rural and urban areas. I have a table with cases and controls for drinking surface water and deep water in both rural and urban settings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what an odds ratio is. The odds ratio compares the odds of an outcome in one group to the odds in another group. In this case, it's comparing the odds of having rectal cancer (cases) versus not having it (controls) for people who drink surface water versus those who drink deep water.\n\nSince the study adjusted for place of residence, I think I need to calculate the odds ratio within each stratum (rural and urban) and then combine them to get the adjusted OR.\n\nLet's start by looking at the rural area:\n\n- Drinking surface water:\n\n  - Cases: 20 (40.0%)\n\n  - Controls: 50 (25.0%)\n\n- Drinking deep water:\n\n  - Cases: 30 (60.0%)\n\n  - Controls: 150 (75.0%)\n\n- Total:\n\n  - Cases: 50\n\n  - Controls: 200\n\nAnd for the urban area:\n\n- Drinking surface water:\n\n  - Cases: 150 (75.0%)\n\n  - Controls: 30 (60.0%)\n\n- Drinking deep water:\n\n  - Cases: 50 (25.0%)\n\n  - Controls: 20 (40.0%)\n\n- Total:\n\n  - Cases: 200\n\n  - Controls: 50\n\nWait, the totals seem off. In the urban area, the total cases are 150 + 50 = 200, and controls are 30 + 20 = 50. That matches the \"Total\" row.\n\nBut in the rural area, cases are 20 + 30 = 50, and controls are 50 + 150 = 200. That also matches.\n\nNow, to calculate the odds ratio within each stratum.\n\nFirst, for the rural area:\n\nThe odds of rectal cancer for those drinking surface water:\n\nOdds = Cases / Controls = 20 / 50 = 0.4\n\nThe odds of rectal cancer for those drinking deep water:\n\nOdds = 30 / 150 = 0.2\n\nSo, the odds ratio for rural area = (0.4 / 0.2) = 2.0\n\nNext, for the urban area:\n\nOdds for surface water:\n\n150 / 30 = 5.0\n\nOdds for deep water:\n\n50 / 20 = 2.5\n\nOdds ratio for urban area = 5.0 / 2.5 = 2.0\n\nHmm, both strata have the same odds ratio of 2.0. Does that mean the overall adjusted OR is also 2.0?\n\nWait, maybe I need to calculate the combined odds ratio, taking into account the different sizes of the strata.\n\nI recall there's a method called Mantel-Haenszel adjustment for this.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio is a way to combine the odds ratios from different strata, adjusting for the confounding variable.\n\nThe formula for Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR_MH) is:\n\nOR_MH = (sum of (a_i * b_i)) / (sum of (c_i * d_i))\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_i = number of cases drinking surface water in stratum i\n\n- b_i = number of controls drinking deep water in stratum i\n\n- c_i = number of cases drinking deep water in stratum i\n\n- d_i = number of controls drinking surface water in stratum i\n\nWait, I think I need to arrange the data in 2x2 tables for each stratum.\n\nLet me create 2x2 tables for rural and urban areas.\n\n### Rural Area\n\n|           | Surface Water | Deep Water | Total |\n\n|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|\n\n| Cases     | 20            | 30         | 50    |\n\n| Controls  | 50            | 150        | 200   |\n\n| Total     | 70            | 180        | 250   |\n\n\n\n### Urban Area\n\n|           | Surface Water | Deep Water | Total |\n\n|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|\n\n| Cases     | 150           | 50         | 200   |\n\n| Controls  | 30            | 20         | 50    |\n\n| Total     | 180           | 70         | 250   |\n\n\n\nNow, for Mantel-Haenszel calculation:\n\nFor each stratum (rural and urban), we have:\n\n- a = cases with surface water\n\n- b = controls with deep water\n\n- c = cases with deep water\n\n- d = controls with surface water\n\n\n\nSo, for rural:\n\na = 20\n\nb = 150\n\nc = 30\n\nd = 50\n\n\n\nFor urban:\n\na = 150\n\nb = 20\n\nc = 50\n\nd = 30\n\n\n\nNow, calculate the numerator and denominator for OR_MH.\n\n\n\nNumerator: sum of (a_i * b_i)\n\n= (20 * 150) + (150 * 20) = 3000 + 3000 = 6000\n\n\n\nDenominator: sum of (c_i * d_i)\n\n= (30 * 50) + (50 * 30) = 1500 + 1500 = 3000\n\n\n\nTherefore, OR_MH = 6000 / 3000 = 2.0\n\n\n\nSo, the adjusted OR is 2.0.\n\n\n\nBut wait, in the options, 2.0 is one of the choices, but the question says \"adjusted OR was\" and gives options A. 4.52, B. 2.0, C. 1.26, D. 3.45.\n\n\n\nGiven that the Mantel-Haenszel OR is 2.0, I would think B. 2.0 is the answer.\n\n\n\nBut maybe I should double-check if there's another way to interpret this.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want the crude OR, not adjusted.\n\n\n\nLet me calculate the crude OR, ignoring the place of residence.\n\n\n\nFirst, aggregate the data:\n\n- Total cases drinking surface water: 20 (rural) + 150 (urban) = 170\n\n- Total cases drinking deep water: 30 (rural) + 50 (urban) = 80\n\n- Total controls drinking surface water: 50 (rural) + 30 (urban) = 80\n\n- Total controls drinking deep water: 150 (rural) + 20 (urban) = 170\n\n\n\nNow, crude 2x2 table:\n\n|           | Surface Water | Deep Water |\n\n|-----------|---------------|------------|\n\n| Cases     | 170           | 80         |\n\n| Controls  | 80            | 170        |\n\n\n\nNow, crude OR = (170 * 170) / (80 * 80) = 28900 / 6400 = 4.515625 \u2248 4.52\n\n\n\nSo, the crude OR is approximately 4.52, which is option A.\n\n\n\nBut the question specifies that place of residence is a potential confounder and that they adjusted for it, so I think they want the adjusted OR, which is 2.0.\n\n\n\nHowever, perhaps I made a mistake in the Mantel-Haenszel calculation.\n\n\n\nLet me re-examine that.\n\n\n\nThe formula for Mantel-Haenszel OR is:\n\nOR_MH = [ \u03a3 (a_i * d_i) ] / [ \u03a3 (b_i * c_i) ]\n\n\n\nWait, I think I misremembered the formula.\n\n\n\nLet me look it up again.\n\n\n\nActually, the correct formula for Mantel-Haenszel OR is:\n\nOR_MH = [ \u03a3 (a_i * d_i) / n_i ] / [ \u03a3 (b_i * c_i) / n_i ]\n\n\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing it.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, some sources present it as:\n\nOR_MH = [ \u03a3 a_i * d_i ] / [ \u03a3 b_i * c_i ]\n\n\n\nBut I think I need to consider the stratum sizes.\n\n\n\nLet me calculate it again properly.\n\n\n\nFor rural:\n\na = 20, b = 150, c = 30, d = 50\n\nSo, a*d = 20*50 = 1000\n\nb*c = 150*30 = 4500\n\n\n\nFor urban:\n\na = 150, b = 20, c = 50, d = 30\n\na*d = 150*30 = 4500\n\nb*c = 20*50 = 1000\n\n\n\nNow, sum of a*d = 1000 + 4500 = 5500\n\nsum of b*c = 4500 + 1000 = 5500\n\n\n\nTherefore, OR_MH = 5500 / 5500 = 1.0\n\n\n\nWait, that can't be right. That would suggest no association, which seems off given the crude OR is 4.52.\n\n\n\nI think I'm missing something here.\n\n\n\nLet me check another source.\n\n\n\nActually, the correct formula for Mantel-Haenszel OR is:\n\nOR_MH = [ \u03a3 (a_i * d_i) ] / [ \u03a3 (b_i * c_i) ]\n\n\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, I got:\n\nNumerator: 1000 (rural) + 4500 (urban) = 5500\n\nDenominator: 4500 (rural) + 1000 (urban) = 5500\n\nSo, OR_MH = 5500 / 5500 = 1.0\n\n\n\nBut that seems too low, given the stratum-specific ORs are both 2.0.\n\n\n\nThere must be another way to calculate it.\n\n\n\nMaybe I need to weight by the stratum size.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula that includes the marginal totals.\n\n\n\nLet me look up the exact formula for Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio.\n\n\n\nThe standard formula is:\n\nOR_MH = [ \u03a3 (a_i * d_i) ] / [ \u03a3 (b_i * c_i) ]\n\n\n\nBut in this case, it's giving me OR=1, which doesn't make sense because both strata have OR=2.0.\n\n\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the stratum-specific ORs and their weights.\n\n\n\nThe proper Mantel-Haenszel estimate should take into account the precision in each stratum.\n\n\n\nPerhaps I need to use the variance formula as well.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use software or a different method to calculate it accurately.\n\n\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll go with the initial calculation of OR_MH=1.0, but that seems incorrect given the stratum-specific ORs are both 2.0.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the combined OR using fixed-effects meta-analysis.\n\n\n\nSince both strata have OR=2.0, the combined OR should also be 2.0.\n\n\n\nBut according to Mantel-Haenszel, it's coming out as 1.0, which doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\nI must have made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\n\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\n\n\nPerhaps I should calculate the crude OR and the adjusted OR separately and see.\n\n\n\nCrude OR is 4.52, as calculated earlier.\n\n\n\nAdjusted OR, using Mantel-Haenszel, is supposed to be 2.0, but my calculation gave 1.0.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, maybe the adjusted OR is 2.0, and the crude OR is 4.52, indicating confounding by place of residence.\n\n\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is B. 2.0.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to adjust for confounding in this scenario.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to calculate the OR for each stratum and then take a weighted average.\n\n\n\nFor rural, OR=2.0\n\nFor urban, OR=2.0\n\nSo, combined OR should be 2.0, regardless of weights.\n\n\n\nBut according to Mantel-Haenszel, it's coming out as 1.0, which is inconsistent.\n\n\n\nI must be misapplying the formula.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Mantel-Haenszel method is not appropriate here, or I have misremembered the formula.\n\n\n\nGiven time constraints, I'll go with the answer B. 2.0, since both strata have OR=2.0, and the adjusted OR should reflect that.\n\n\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
