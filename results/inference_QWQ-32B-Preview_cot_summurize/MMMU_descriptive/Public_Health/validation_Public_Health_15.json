The table is divided into two main categories: \"Age\" (Under 30 and Over 30) and \"Exceed Limit if Possible?\" (Always and Not Always). The table includes the following counts:\n\n- For people under 30:\n  - Always exceed the limit: 100\n  - Not always exceed the limit: 100\n  - Total: 200\n\n- For people over 30:\n  - Always exceed the limit: 40\n  - Not always exceed the limit: 160\n  - Total: 200\n\nThe total number of respondents is 400, with 140 indicating they always exceed the limit and 260 indicating they do not always exceed the limit.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA survey asked people how often they exceed speed limits. The data are then categorized into the following contingency table of counts showing the relationship between age group and response. <image 1> Among people with age under 30 what are the odds that they always exceed the speed limit?\n\nA. 1 to 2\nB. 2 to 1\nC. 1 to 1\nD. 50%\n"
