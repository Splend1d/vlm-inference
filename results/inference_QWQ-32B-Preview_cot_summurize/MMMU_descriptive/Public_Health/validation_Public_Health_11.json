                    "text": "Based on the data provided in the table, we can calculate several statistical measures that relate to the association between smoking and lung cancer. Let's look at each option to determine which ones can be calculated from the given data.\n\nFirst, let's understand the table:\n\n- **Smokers:**\n\n  - Lung cancer patients: 150\n\n  - Non-lung cancer patients: 50\n\n- **Non-smokers:**\n\n  - Lung cancer patients: 100\n\n  - Non-lung cancer patients: 200\n\n- **Totals:**\n\n  - Total lung cancer patients: 250\n\n  - Total non-lung cancer patients: 250\n\nFrom this, we can construct a 2x2 contingency table:\n\n|           | Lung Cancer | No Lung Cancer | Total |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------|\n| Smokers   | 150         | 50             | 200   |\n| Non-smokers | 100         | 200            | 300   |\n| Total     | 250         | 250            | 500   |\n\nNow, let's define each of the statistical measures mentioned in the options:\n\nA. **PAR (Population Attributable Risk):** This measures the proportion of cases in the population that is attributable to the exposure. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[PAR = \\frac{p_e \\times (RR - 1)}{p_e \\times (RR - 1) + 1}\\]\n\n   where \\(p_e\\) is the prevalence of exposure in the population and \\(RR\\) is the relative risk.\n\nB. **AR (Attributable Risk):** Also known as the risk difference, it is the difference in the incidence rate between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n\n   \\[AR = I_e - I_{non-e}\\]\n\n   where \\(I_e\\) is the incidence rate in the exposed group and \\(I_{non-e}\\) is the incidence rate in the non-exposed group.\n\nC. **RR (Relative Risk):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the exposed group to the incidence rate in the non-exposed group.\n\n   \\[RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_{non-e}}\\]\n\nD. **OR (Odds Ratio):** This is the ratio of the odds of exposure in the cases to the odds of exposure in the controls.\n\n   \\[OR = \\frac{(a/d)}{(b/c)}\\]\n\n   where:\n\n   - a = number of exposed cases (smokers with lung cancer)\n\n   - b = number of unexposed cases (non-smokers with lung cancer)\n\n   - c = number of unexposed controls (non-smokers without lung cancer)\n\n   - d = number of exposed controls (smokers without lung cancer)\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- a = 150\n\n- b = 100\n\n- c = 200\n\n- d = 50\n\nNow, let's see which of these can be calculated directly from the given data.\n\n1. **PAR (Population Attributable Risk):** To calculate PAR, we need to know the prevalence of exposure in the population (\\(p_e\\)) and the relative risk (RR). From the table, we can calculate RR, but the prevalence of exposure in the population is not directly provided. However, in this study, the total number of smokers and non-smokers is given, so we can calculate \\(p_e\\) as the proportion of smokers in the total population.\n\n   \\[p_e = \\frac{200}{500} = 0.4\\]\n\n   And we can calculate RR as:\n\n   \\[RR = \\frac{150/200}{100/300} = \\frac{0.75}{0.333} \\approx 2.25\\]\n\n   Then,\n\n   \\[PAR = \\frac{0.4 \\times (2.25 - 1)}{0.4 \\times (2.25 - 1) + 1} = \\frac{0.4 \\times 1.25}{0.4 \\times 1.25 + 1} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5 + 1} = \\frac{0.5}{1.5} \\approx 0.333\\]\n\n   So, PAR can be calculated.\n\n2. **AR (Attributable Risk):** AR is the difference in incidence rates between smokers and non-smokers.\n\n   \\[AR = \\frac{150}{200} - \\frac{100}{300} = 0.75 - 0.333 \\approx 0.417\\]\n\n   So, AR can be calculated.\n\n3. **RR (Relative Risk):** As shown above, RR can be calculated.\n\n4. **OR (Odds Ratio):** Using the formula:\n\n   \\[OR = \\frac{(150 \\times 200)}{(100 \\times 50)} = \\frac{30000}{5000} = 6\\]\n\n   So, OR can be calculated.\n\nTherefore, all of the options A, B, C, and D can be calculated from the given data.\n\nHowever, if the question is to choose which one can be calculated, and assuming only one answer is expected, we might need to consider the context or the specific requirements of each measure.\n\nBut based on the data provided, all four measures can be calculated.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
