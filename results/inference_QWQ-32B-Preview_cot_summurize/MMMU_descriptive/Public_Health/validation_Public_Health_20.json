                    "text": "I'm looking at this problem about a prospective cohort study on smoking and lung cancer. The table shows data for an exposed group and a non-exposed group, with cases and non-cases of lung cancer in each. The question is asking for the attributable risk (AR), and there are four options to choose from.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what attributable risk is. Attributable risk, also known as the risk difference, is the difference in the incidence rate of disease between the exposed group and the non-exposed group. It tells us how much of the disease can be attributed to the exposure.\n\nSo, AR = Incidence in exposed group - Incidence in non-exposed group.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Exposed group: 58 cases per 100,000\n\n- Non-exposed group: 5 cases per 100,000\n\nTherefore, AR = 58 - 5 = 53 per 100,000.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 11.6\n\nB. 53.0/100000\n\nC. 63.0/100000\n\nD. 0.91\n\nOption B seems to match our calculation: 53.0 per 100,000.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check if there's any other way to calculate AR or if I'm missing something.\n\nSometimes, attributable risk can be expressed as a percentage of the exposed group's risk, but in this case, it's presented in per 100,000, which matches our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the AR to be expressed differently, but according to the table, the incidence is given per 100,000, so subtracting them directly should give the correct AR in the same units.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to look at this. Maybe they want to consider the proportions or rates differently.\n\nThe incidence in the exposed group is 58 per 100,000, and in the non-exposed group, it's 5 per 100,000. So, the difference is indeed 53 per 100,000.\n\nOption C is 63.0 per 100,000, which doesn't match our calculation. Maybe there's a mistake in the subtraction?\n\nLet me recalculate: 58 - 5 = 53. That seems correct.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the total population or some other factor, but the AR is simply the difference in incidence rates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want the attributable fraction, which is different from attributable risk. Attributable fraction is the proportion of cases in the exposed group that is attributable to the exposure.\n\nBut the question specifically asks for attributable risk, not attributable fraction.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is option B: 53.0 per 100,000.\n\nBut let's look at the options again. Option A is 11.6, which doesn't match our calculation. Option C is 63.0 per 100,000, which is higher than our calculation. Option D is 0.91, which seems too low.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to express AR in a different way. Sometimes, AR is expressed as a percentage or in decimal form.\n\nLet me check the formula again. AR = Incidence in exposed - Incidence in non-exposed.\n\nGiven that the incidences are per 100,000, subtracting them gives per 100,000.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they want to express it as a rate per person per year or something, but the table doesn't provide time information, so that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to calculate the attributable risk percentage, which is AR divided by the incidence in the exposed group, multiplied by 100.\n\nBut again, the question asks for attributable risk, not the percentage.\n\nGiven that, I think option B is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they want to consider the population attributable risk, which is different, but the question specifies \"attributable risk,\" not \"population attributable risk.\"\n\nSo, I think 53 per 100,000 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. 53.0/100000.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
