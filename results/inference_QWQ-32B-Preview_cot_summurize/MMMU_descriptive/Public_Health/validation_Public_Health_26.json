                    "text": "Look at the following description corresponding the the relavant image(s), Then answer a question\n\n***Start of description***\n\nThe image is a table that presents data on the relationship between fruit intake and deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) among a population in China. The table has three columns:\n\n1. **Fruit Intake**: This column lists the frequency of fruit consumption, categorized into five groups:\n   - Never eat fruit\n   - Once a month\n   - 1-3 times a week\n   - 4-6 times a week\n   - Every day\n\n2. **Number of Observers**: This column shows the number of individuals in each fruit intake category. The numbers are as follows:\n   - Never eat fruit: 28,479\n   - Once a month: 156,098\n   - 1-3 times a week: 143,183\n   - 4-6 times a week: 42,519\n   - Every day: 81,386\n\n3. **Number of Deaths from CVD**: This column indicates the number of deaths from cardiovascular disease within each fruit intake category. The numbers are as follows:\n   - Never eat fruit: 735\n   - Once a month: 2,341\n   - 1-3 times a week: 1,375\n   - 4-6 times a week: 270\n   - Every day: 452\n\nThe table provides a clear comparison of how different frequencies of fruit intake correlate with the number of deaths from CVD among the observed population.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe cardiovascular protective effects of fruit intake have been widely demonstrated in Western populations, but little is known about the association in China, where fruit intake levels are low and the incidence of stroke is high. To investigate whether this association also exists in the Chinese population, the University of Oxford (UK), in collaboration with Professor Li Liming's group at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS), recruited 512,891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 different regions of China (including five cities and five villages) between June 2004 and July 2008, to investigate the association between the use of fresh fruits and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. The study investigated the relationship between fresh fruit use and major cardiovascular diseases in the Chinese population. Five frequency criteria were set for the main exposure factor \"fruit intake\": \"never eat fruit\", \"once a month\", \"1-3 times a week\", \"4-6 times a week\", \"every day \", which were filled in by the respondents themselves.The primary cardiovascular disease death was used as the outcome event in this study. Survival and health status of all subjects were regularly reported to the disease surveillance system of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their data were checked against the health insurance records of the investigated subjects' localities and confirmed by the street or village committees. Coding was based on the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases.After 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 451,665 subjects completed the follow-up after excluding lost and ineligible subjects. Those who consumed fresh fruit daily were found to have a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of about 4 mmHg, a reduction in blood glucose of about 0.5 mmol/L, a 40% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death, and a 34%, 25%, and 36% reduction in the risk of major coronary heart disease events, ischemic strokes, and cerebral hemorrhages, respectively, when compared with those who consumed very little fresh fruit. Their fruit intake and cardiovascular disease profiles were shown in the table below.<image 1>What indicators were appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population?\n\nA. point prevalence and period prevalence\nB. mortality rate and case fatality rate\nC. cumulative incidence and incidence density\nD.

                    "text": "To determine which indicators are appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population in this study, let's consider the options provided and understand what each one represents.\n\nFirst, it's important to note that morbidity refers to the incidence or prevalence of a disease, while mortality refers to death rates. Since the question is about describing the risk of morbidity, we should focus on indicators that measure disease occurrence rather than death.\n\nOption A: Point prevalence and period prevalence\n\n- Point prevalence is the proportion of a population that has a disease at a specific point in time.\n\n- Period prevalence is the proportion of a population that has a disease over a specific period of time.\n\nThese measures are useful for understanding how widespread a disease is at a particular time or over a period, but they don't directly measure the risk of developing the disease. Therefore, they might not be the best choice for describing the risk of morbidity.\n\nOption B: Mortality rate and case fatality rate\n\n- Mortality rate is the rate of death in a population over a specific period.\n\n- Case fatality rate is the proportion of people with a disease who die from that disease.\n\nThese measures are related to death rather than the occurrence of disease. Since the question is about morbidity, which is about disease occurrence, these indicators are not directly relevant.\n\nOption C: Cumulative incidence and incidence density\n\n- Cumulative incidence is the proportion of a population that develops a disease over a specified period.\n\n- Incidence density is the rate at which new cases occur in a population at risk during a specified time period.\n\nThese measures are directly related to the occurrence of new disease cases and are therefore appropriate for describing the risk of morbidity.\n\nOption D: PYLL and DALY\n\n- PYLL (Potential Years of Life Lost) is a measure of premature mortality.\n\n- DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years lived with disability.\n\nBoth PYLL and DALY are measures that combine mortality and morbidity, but since the question specifically asks about morbidity risk, these might not be the most appropriate choices.\n\nGiven this understanding, the most suitable indicators for describing the risk of morbidity in various groups of the population would be those that measure the occurrence of new disease cases, which are cumulative incidence and incidence density.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Cumulative incidence and incidence density.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
