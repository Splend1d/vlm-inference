The columns are labeled as follows:\n\n- Food\n- Number of people who ate that food\n- Number of people who ate the food and got sick\n\nThe rows list different foods along with the corresponding numbers of people who ate each food item and the number of people who got sick after eating it. Here are the details from the table:\n\n1. **Cold chicken**\n   - Number of people who ate it: 86\n   - Number of people who got sick: 34\n\n2. **Potato salad**\n   - Number of people who ate it: 54\n   - Number of people who got sick: 38\n\n3. **Egg sandwiches**\n   - Number of people who ate it: 76\n   - Number of people who got sick: 40\n\n4. **Fruit pie and cream**\n   - Number of people who ate it: 32\n   - Number of people who got sick: 12\n\n5. **Cheese**\n   - Number of people who ate it: 48\n   - Number of people who got sick: 12\n\nBased on this information, the food that is most likely the cause of the outbreak of food poisoning can be determined by comparing the number of people who got sick relative to the number of people who ate each food item.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nAccording to the table below, which food is the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning: <image 1> \n\nA.

This can be done by calculating the percentage of people who got sick for each food item.\n\nLet's go through each option step by step:\n\n**Option A: Cold chicken**\n\n- Number of people who ate it: 86\n\n- Number of people who got sick: 34\n\nTo find the percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage sick} = \\left( \\frac{34}{86} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 39.5\\%\n\\]\n\n**Option B: Potato salad**\n\n- Number of people who ate it: 54\n\n- Number of people who got sick: 38\n\nTo find the percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage sick} = \\left( \\frac{38}{54} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 70.4\\%\n\\]\n\n**Option C: Egg sandwiches**\n\n- Number of people who ate it: 76\n\n- Number of people who got sick: 40\n\nTo find the percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage sick} = \\left( \\frac{40}{76} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 52.6\\%\n\\]\n\n**Option D: Fruit pie and cream**\n\n- Number of people who ate it: 32\n\n- Number of people who got sick: 12\n\nTo find the percentage:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage sick} = \\left( \\frac{12}{32} \\right) \\times 100 = 37.5\\%\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compare these percentages:\n\n- Cold chicken: 39.5%\n\n- Potato salad: 70.4%\n\n- Egg sandwiches: 52.6%\n\n- Fruit pie and cream: 37.5%\n\nThe food with the highest percentage of people who got sick is potato salad at 70.4%. Therefore, based on this data, potato salad is the most likely cause of the outbreak of food poisoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
