The table has three columns: \"Outcomes,\" \"Vaccination group (4973.2 person years),\" and \"Placebo group (4873.0 person years).\" Each column lists the number of new cases for various EV71-related conditions.\n\nHere are the details from the table:\n\n1. **EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina:**\n   - Vaccination group: 5 new cases\n   - Placebo group: 94 new cases\n\n2. **Hand, foot and mouth disease:**\n   - Vaccination group: 5 new cases\n   - Placebo group: 90 new cases\n\n3. **Herpangina:**\n   - Vaccination group: 0 new cases\n   - Placebo group: 4 new cases\n\n4. **EV71-related hospitalisation events:**\n   - Vaccination group: 0 new cases\n   - Placebo group: 24 new cases\n\n5. **EV71-related Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease with Combined Neurological Complications:**\n   - Vaccination group: 0 new cases\n   - Placebo group: 8 new cases\n\n6. **All EV71 related diseases:**\n   - Vaccination group: 13 new cases\n   - Placebo group: 106 new cases\n\nThe table provides data on the incidence of EV71-related diseases in both groups over a specified period, measured in person-years.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn February 2014, the New England Journal of Medicine published in the same issue two epidemiological trials (field trials) of inactivated EV71 vaccine conducted by scholars in China respectively. One of the studies was from Jiangsu Province, China, and the study design was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (phase III trial), which included a total of 10,077 healthy children aged 6-35 months. The primary outcome indicator was the incidence of EV71-related hand, foot and mouth disease or herpangina, according to the 0- and 28-day immunisation schedule, using block (one group of 10 persons) randomisation, with a 1:1 allocation of study participants to EV71 vaccine or placebo, and follow-up monitoring for 12 months, and the results were shown in the table below.<image 1> The protective rate against all EV71 related diseases was\n\nA. 100%\nB. 94.8%\nC. 94.6%\nD. 88.1%\n"
