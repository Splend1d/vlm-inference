The table is organized into five columns:\n\n1. Age (years): This column lists the age groups, starting from \"20-\" and ending with \"55-59.\"\n2. Life expectancy: This column shows the life expectancy for each age group, ranging from 61.76 years for the \"20-\" age group to 27.85 years for the \"55-59\" age group.\n3. Deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases: This column lists the number of deaths due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases for each age group, with values ranging from 17 for the \"20-\" age group to 363 for the \"55-59\" age group.\n4. Deaths from malignant neoplasms: This column lists the number of deaths due to malignant neoplasms for each age group, with values ranging from 8 for the \"20-\" age group to 195 for the \"55-59\" age group.\n5. Total: This row at the bottom of the table provides the total number of deaths for both categories across all age groups, with 1250 deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and 597 deaths from malignant neoplasms.\n\nBased on this information, the number of deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is significantly higher than the number of deaths from malignant neoplasms across all age groups.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe life expectancy and the number of deaths due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms in 2010 for each age group of the working population aged 20-59 in a certain city were shown in the table below.<image 1> Which of these two diseases is the greater health threat to the city's occupational population?\n\nA. cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases\nB. malignant neoplasms\nC. The threat is just as great.\nD. The threat cannot be judged.\n"

                    "text": "Based on the information provided in the description, the table shows the life expectancy and the number of deaths due to two specific causes: cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and malignant neoplasms, across different age groups within the working population aged 20-59 in a certain city in 2010.\n\nFrom the description, we can see that the number of deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is significantly higher than the number of deaths from malignant neoplasms across all age groups. Specifically, the total number of deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is 1250, whereas the total number of deaths from malignant neoplasms is 597.\n\nGiven that the question is asking which of these two diseases is the greater health threat to the city's occupational population, we can infer that the greater number of deaths indicates a larger health threat.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\nA. cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases\n\nThis is because there are more deaths attributed to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases compared to malignant neoplasms in the given age group and year.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that life expectancy is also provided in the table, but the description does not specify any relationship between life expectancy and the two causes of death beyond listing them together. Since the question is specifically about which disease is the greater health threat based on the information provided, and given that the number of deaths is significantly higher for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, option A seems to be the most appropriate answer.\n\nOption B suggests that malignant neoplasms are the greater health threat, which contradicts the data provided. Option C claims that the threat is just as great for both, but again, the data shows a higher number of deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Option D suggests that the threat cannot be judged, but since the table provides specific numbers of deaths for each cause, it is possible to make a judgment based on those numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
