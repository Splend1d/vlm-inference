The table has two columns: \"Incidence of cardiovascular diseases (per 100,000 person-years)\" and three rows labeled \"Smokers,\" \"Non-smokers,\" and \"General population.\" The data in the table is as follows:\n\n- Smokers: 300\n- Non-smokers: 100\n- General population: 150\n\nThis table provides information about the incidence rates of cardiovascular diseases among smokers, non-smokers, and the general population.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nResearchers have done the following study on the relationship between smoking and cardiovascular diseases. The attributable risk of smoking and the disease is. <image 1>\n\nA. 200/100,000 person years\nB. 300/100,000 person years\nC. 100/100,000 person years\nD. 50/100,000 person years\n"
