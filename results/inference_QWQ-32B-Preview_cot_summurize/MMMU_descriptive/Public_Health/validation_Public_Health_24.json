The x-axis represents dates from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2011, while the y-axis represents case serial numbers ranging from 1 to 20. Each case is represented by a horizontal line that starts at the onset date (marked by a circle) and ends either at the recovery date (marked by a triangle) or the death date (marked by an 'X'). The duration of each case is indicated by the length of the line between the onset and recovery/death markers.\n\nTo determine the incidence of the disease in 2010, we need to count the number of cases that started in 2010. From the graph, we can see that there are 10 cases that began in 2010. \n\nGiven that the population of the area at the beginning of 2010 was 2,528, we can calculate the incidence rate as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases in 2010}}{\\text{Population at the beginning of 2010}} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{10}{2528} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{Incidence} = 0.3957\\% \\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the incidence in 2010 is approximately 0.40%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. 0.40%\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe population of an area at the beginning of 2010 was 2,528, and the incidence of a disease in 2010 was shown in the graph below, with no births, deaths, in-migrants or refusals to be examined during the period. <image 1> The incidence in 2010 was\n\nA. 0.24%\nB. 0.40%\nC. 0.32%\nD. 0.44%\n"

Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.40%\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the number of new cases in 2010:** According to the description, there are 10 cases that began in 2010.\n\n2. **Determine the population at the beginning of 2010:** The population is given as 2,528.\n\n3. **Calculate the incidence rate:** The formula for incidence is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases in 2010}}{\\text{Population at the beginning of 2010}} \\right) \\times 100\\%\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the numbers:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Incidence} = \\left( \\frac{10}{2528} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 0.3957\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Round to two decimal places:** 0.3957% rounds to approximately 0.40%.\n\nTherefore, the incidence in 2010 is 0.40%, which corresponds to option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
