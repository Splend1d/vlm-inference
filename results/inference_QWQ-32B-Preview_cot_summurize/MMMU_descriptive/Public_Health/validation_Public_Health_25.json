The table is divided into four quadrants:\n\n- The top left quadrant represents the \"Group with disease\" and has two categories: \"Positive\" (labeled as A) and \"Negative\" (labeled as C).\n- The top right quadrant represents the \"Group without disease\" and also has two categories: \"Positive\" (labeled as B) and \"Negative\" (labeled as D).\n- The bottom row sums up the totals for each group: \"Group with disease\" (A+C) and \"Group without disease\" (B+D).\n- The rightmost column sums up the totals for each test result: \"Positive\" (A+B) and \"Negative\" (C+D).\n- The bottom right cell represents the grand total (N), which is the sum of all cells (A+B+C+D).\n\nThe table is structured as follows:\n\n```\ntest result | Group with disease | Group without disease | total\n-------------|---------------------|------------------------|------\nPositive     | A                   | B                      | A+B\nNegative     | C                   | D                      | C+D\n-------------|---------------------|------------------------|------\ntotal        | A+C                 | B+D                    | N\n```\n\nBased on this table, the specificity of the screening test can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{\\text{True Negatives}}{\\text{True Negatives} + \\text{False Positives}} \\]\n\nIn the context of the table, True Negatives are represented by D (the number of individuals without the disease who tested negative), and False Positives are represented by B (the number of individuals without the disease who tested positive). Therefore, the specificity is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{D}{B+D} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. D/(B+D)\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe data for evaluating the validity of a screening test can be compiled into the following table format.<image 1>The specificity is\n\nA. A/(A+C)\nB. B/(B+D)\nC. C/(A+C)\nD. D/(B+D)\n"
