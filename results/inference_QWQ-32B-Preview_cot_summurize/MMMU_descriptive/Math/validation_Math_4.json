The x-axis ranges from -4 to 4, and the y-axis ranges from -5 to 5. The graph consists of a series of oscillations that repeat periodically. Each oscillation has a peak at y = 1 and a trough at y = -1. The graph crosses the x-axis at every integer value of x, indicating that the period of the function is 1 unit. The function starts at y = 0 when x = 0, which suggests it is a sine function rather than a cosine function. Therefore, the correct equation for the graph is:\n\n\\[ y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\]\n\nThis matches option B: \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\).\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich option is the equation of the graph. <image 1>\n\nA. $y=\\cos 2\\pix$\nB. $y=\\sin 2\\pix$\nC. $y=\\cos \\pix$\nD. $y=\\sin \\pix$\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the correct equation for the graph is \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\), which corresponds to option B.\n\nTo elaborate, the description mentions that the graph is a trigonometric function with oscillations that repeat periodically, peaking at y = 1 and troughing at y = -1. The function crosses the x-axis at every integer value of x, indicating a period of 1 unit. Additionally, it starts at y = 0 when x = 0, suggesting it's a sine function rather than a cosine function.\n\nThe general form of a sine function is \\( y = \\sin(bx) \\), where the period \\( p \\) is given by \\( p = \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\). Given that the period is 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{b} \\]\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 2\\pi \\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\]\n\nThis matches option B.\n\nOption A is \\( y = \\cos(2\\pi x) \\), which is a cosine function with the same period but shifted by a phase of \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), meaning it would start at y = 1 when x = 0, which doesn't match the description.\n\nOption C is \\( y = \\cos(\\pi x) \\), which has a period of 2, as \\( p = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2 \\), but the described graph has a period of 1.\n\nOption D is \\( y = \\sin(\\pi x) \\), with a period of 2, as \\( p = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi} = 2 \\), again not matching the period of 1 described.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B: \\( y = \\sin(2\\pi x) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
