The function appears to be the greatest integer function, denoted as \\([x]\\), which returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\nKey observations from the graph:\n- The function has horizontal segments at integer values of \\(y\\).\n- Each segment starts at an open circle (indicating the value is not included) and ends at a closed circle (indicating the value is included).\n- For example, the segment at \\(y = 1\\) starts just before \\(x = 1\\) and ends at \\(x = 2\\).\n- The segment at \\(y = 2\\) starts just before \\(x = 2\\) and ends at \\(x = 3\\).\n\nBased on these observations, the limit of the function as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the left is 1, because the function value is 1 for all \\(x\\) values slightly less than 2. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nA. 1\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nFind $\\lim_{x \\to 2}\\left [ x \\right ]$ [As usual, [x] is the greatest integersee $\\le $ x, See Fig. 6-1] <image 1>\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC.

This function returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \\(x\\).\n\nFrom the description, the function has horizontal segments at integer values of \\(y\\), with open circles at the start of each segment and closed circles at the end. Specifically:\n\n- For \\(1 < x < 2\\), \\([x] = 1\\)\n\n- At \\(x = 2\\), \\([x] = 2\\)\n\n- For \\(2 < x < 3\\), \\([x] = 2\\)\n\n- And so on.\n\nWhen considering the limit as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the left (\\(x \\to 2^-\\)), we look at the values of the function as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to 2 but remains less than 2. According to the description, in the interval \\(1 < x < 2\\), \\([x] = 1\\). Therefore, as \\(x\\) approaches 2 from the left, the function values approach 1.\n\nThus, the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to 2^-} [x] = 1\\).\n\nSince the question likely asks for the left-hand limit (as it's approaching from the left), the correct answer is:\n\nA. 1\n\nHowever, if the question is about the two-sided limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to 2} [x]\\), we need to consider both the left-hand and right-hand limits.\n\n- From the left (\\(x \\to 2^-\\)), \\([x] \\to 1\\)\n\n- From the right (\\(x \\to 2^+\\)), \\([x] \\to 2\\)\n\nSince the left-hand limit (1) does not equal the right-hand limit (2), the two-sided limit does not exist.\n\nBut based on the question phrasing, \"Find \\(\\lim_{x \\to 2} [x]\\)\", and considering the options provided:\n\nA. 1\n\nB. 2\n\nC. Not exist\n\nGiven that the two-sided limit does not exist due to the discrepancy between the left and right limits, the most accurate answer would be:\n\nC. Not exist\n\nHowever, the initial analysis based on the description focused on the left-hand limit, leading to option A. But strictly speaking, for the two-sided limit, the correct answer is that the limit does not exist.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
