The vertices are connected by edges in the following manner:\n\n- Vertex \\(a\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(b\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\).\n- Vertex \\(c\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\).\n- Vertex \\(d\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(e\\) is connected to vertices \\(a\\), \\(d\\), and \\(f\\).\n- Vertex \\(f\\) is connected to vertices \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(e\\).\n- Vertex \\(h\\) is connected to vertex \\(b\\).\n\nFrom this description, it is clear that the graph is not regular because not all vertices have the same degree. For example, vertex \\(a\\) has a degree of 3 (connected to \\(b\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\)), while vertex \\(b\\) has a degree of 4 (connected to \\(a\\), \\(c\\), \\(f\\), and \\(h\\)). Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nC. not all vertices have the same degree\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> is not a regular graph because\n\nA. not all edges are the same length\nB. it is a complete graph\nC. not all vertices have the same degree\nD. it has a vertex of degree 3\n"
