The function \\( y = f(x) \\) is plotted, and it appears to be a smooth curve that intersects the x-axis at two points: one at \\( x = -2 \\) and another at \\( x = 4 \\). \n\nThere are two shaded regions labeled A and B. Region A is below the x-axis and between \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 0 \\), while region B is above the x-axis and between \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = 4 \\). The areas of these regions are denoted as \\( a \\) for region A and \\( b \\) for region B.\n\nThe question asks about the average value of the function \\( g(x) = f(x) + 3 \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\).\n\nTo find the average value of \\( g(x) \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\), we need to integrate \\( g(x) \\) over this interval and then divide by the length of the interval, which is 6.\n\nThe integral of \\( g(x) \\) from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ \\int_{-2}^{4} (f(x) + 3) \\, dx \\]\n\nThis can be split into two parts:\n\\[ \\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx + \\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx \\]\n\nThe first part, \\( \\int_{-2}^{4} f(x) \\, dx \\), represents the net signed area under the curve \\( f(x) \\) from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\). Since region A is below the x-axis and region B is above the x-axis, the net signed area is \\( b - a \\).\n\nThe second part, \\( \\int_{-2}^{4} 3 \\, dx \\), is simply the area of a rectangle with height 3 and width 6, which is \\( 3 \\times 6 = 18 \\).\n\nTherefore, the integral of \\( g(x) \\) from \\(-2\\) to \\(4\\) is:\n\\[ (b - a) + 18 \\]\n\nThe average value of \\( g(x) \\) on the interval \\([-2, 4]\\) is then:\n\\[ \\frac{(b - a) + 18}{6} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\\[ \\frac{b - a}{6} + 3 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[ C. \\left( \\frac{-a + b}{6} \\right) + 3 \\]\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>The graph of y = f(x) is shown in the figure above.

                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a graph of y equals f of x, and there are two shaded regions: area A and area B. Area A is below the x-axis between x equals -2 and x equals 0, and area B is above the x-axis between x equals 0 and x equals 4. The areas are denoted as A equals a and B equals b. Then there's another function, g of x, which is f of x plus 3, and I need to find the average value of g on the interval from -2 to 4.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the average value of a function is. The average value of a function g(x) over an interval [a, b] is given by the integral of g(x) from a to b divided by the length of the interval, which is b minus a. So in this case, it's from -2 to 4, so the length is 6.\n\nSo, the average value is (1/6) times the integral from -2 to 4 of g(x) dx.\n\nNow, g(x) is f(x) plus 3, so that integral becomes the integral from -2 to 4 of f(x) plus 3 dx.\n\nI can split that integral into two parts: the integral from -2 to 4 of f(x) dx plus the integral from -2 to 4 of 3 dx.\n\nThe integral of f(x) from -2 to 4 is the net signed area under f(x) between -2 and 4. Since area A is below the x-axis, it's negative, and area B is above, so it's positive. So, integral of f(x) from -2 to 4 is B minus A, which is b minus a.\n\nThe integral of 3 from -2 to 4 is just 3 times the length of the interval, which is 3 times 6, so 18.\n\nSo, the integral of g(x) from -2 to 4 is (b - a) + 18.\n\nThen, the average value is (b - a + 18)/6.\n\nI can split this into (b - a)/6 + 18/6.\n\n18 divided by 6 is 3, so it's (b - a)/6 + 3.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is (-a + b)/6 + 3, which is the same as (b - a)/6 + 3.\n\nSo, the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. Is (b - a)/6 + 3 the same as (-a + b)/6 + 3? Yes, because subtraction is commutative in that way.\n\nJust to double-check, let's consider what the other options are.\n\nOption A is (a + b + 3)/6. That doesn't match what I have.\n\nOption B is (-a + b + 3)/6. That's similar to C, but it's all over 6, whereas in C, only the (-a + b) part is divided by 6, and then 3 is added separately.\n\nOption D is (a + b)/6 + 3. That would be similar to C, but it has a plus a instead of minus a.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, it's b - a, which is the same as -a + b.\n\nSo, C is (-a + b)/6 + 3, which is correct.\n\nOption B is (-a + b + 3)/6, which would be (-a + b)/6 + 3/6, which is (-a + b)/6 + 0.5, which is not the same as C.\n\nSo, C is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let's think about the areas again.\n\nArea A is below the x-axis, so it's negative in the integral. Area B is above, so it's positive. So, integral of f(x) from -2 to 4 is B - A, which is b - a.\n\nAdding the integral of 3, which is 18, and then dividing by 6, which gives (b - a + 18)/6, which is (b - a)/6 + 3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
