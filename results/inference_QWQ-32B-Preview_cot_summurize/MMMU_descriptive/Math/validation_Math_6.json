This theorem relates the lengths of tangent and secant segments drawn from a common external point to a circle.\n\nThe Power of a Point Theorem states that if a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point to a circle, then the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external part.\n\nIn this problem:\n- \\( PS \\) is the tangent segment from point \\( P \\) to the circle at point \\( S \\), with \\( PS = x \\).\n- \\( PQR \\) is the secant segment from point \\( P \\) intersecting the circle at points \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\), with \\( PQ = 3 \\) and \\( PR = x + 18 \\).\n\nFirst, we need to determine the length of the external part of the secant segment. The external part of the secant is \\( PQ \\), which is given as 3.\n\nThe entire secant segment is \\( PR \\), which is given as \\( x + 18 \\).\n\nAccording to the Power of a Point Theorem:\n\n\\[\n(PS)^2 = (PQ) \\times (PR)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 3 \\times (x + 18)\n\\]\n\nNow, we can solve this equation for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 3(x + 18)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 = 3x + 54\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 3x - 54 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the standard form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -3 \\), and \\( c = -54 \\).\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-54)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 216}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{225}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3 \\pm 15}{2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two potential solutions for \\( x \\):\n\n1. \\( x = \\frac{3 + 15}{2} = \\frac{18}{2} = 9 \\)\n2. \\( x = \\frac{3 - 15}{2} = \\frac{-12}{2} = -6 \\)\n\nSince lengths cannot be negative, we discard \\( x = -6 \\). Therefore, the length of \\( PS \\) is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{9} \\]\n\n**Option B. 9**"
