                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the shaded region is bounded by the curves \\( y = g(x) \\), \\( y = f(x) \\), and the horizontal line \\( y = b \\), from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\). The curves \\( y = g(x) \\) and \\( y = f(x) \\) intersect the y-axis at \\( y = b \\) and below \\( y = b \\), respectively, and both are bounded by the vertical lines at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = a \\).\n\nTo find the area of the shaded region, we need to determine the correct integral expression that represents the area between these curves.\n\nFirst, let's understand the positions of the curves:\n\n- \\( y = g(x) \\) is concave down and intersects the y-axis at \\( y = b \\).\n\n- \\( y = f(x) \\) is concave up and intersects the y-axis below \\( y = b \\).\n\n- The horizontal line \\( y = b \\) intersects both curves.\n\nGiven that \\( y = g(x) \\) is above \\( y = f(x) \\) in the shaded region, the area between these two curves from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\) would indeed be \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\). However, the presence of the horizontal line \\( y = b \\) suggests that the shaded area might be bounded above by \\( y = b \\) or influenced by it in some way.\n\nLet's visualize the scenario:\n\n1. At \\( x = 0 \\), \\( y = g(0) = b \\) and \\( y = f(0) \\) is some value less than \\( b \\).\n\n2. Both \\( y = g(x) \\) and \\( y = f(x) \\) are bounded by \\( x = a \\).\n\n3. The horizontal line \\( y = b \\) intersects both curves, possibly creating additional boundaries for the shaded region.\n\nThe description mentions that the shaded region is bounded by these three lines and the vertical axis at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = a \\). It seems that the shaded area is between \\( y = g(x) \\) and \\( y = f(x) \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = a \\), and also bounded by \\( y = b \\). This could mean that the shaded area is the region where \\( y = g(x) \\) is above \\( y = f(x) \\), and possibly limited by \\( y = b \\) above.\n\nHowever, since \\( y = g(x) \\) intersects \\( y = b \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) and is concave down, it may dip below \\( y = b \\) for \\( x > 0 \\), but the description doesn't specify. Assuming that \\( y = g(x) \\) remains above \\( y = f(x) \\) throughout the interval \\( [0, a] \\), the area between them would be \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\).\n\nBut, if the shaded region is bounded above by \\( y = b \\), then the upper limit of the shaded area might be the minimum between \\( g(x) \\) and \\( b \\). However, since \\( g(x) \\) intersects \\( y = b \\) at \\( x = 0 \\) and is concave down, it may be that \\( g(x) \\leq b \\) for \\( x \\) in \\( [0, a] \\), in which case, the upper boundary is \\( g(x) \\), and the area is indeed \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\).\n\nAlternatively, if \\( g(x) \\) exceeds \\( b \\) for some \\( x \\) in \\( [0, a] \\), and the shaded area is bounded above by \\( y = b \\), then the upper boundary would be \\( \\min(g(x), b) \\), but given that \\( g(x) \\) is concave down and intersects \\( y = b \\) at \\( x = 0 \\), it's likely that \\( g(x) \\leq b \\) for \\( x \\) in \\( [0, a] \\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\), which corresponds to option A.\n\nHowever, let's consider the other options to ensure that there isn't a miscalculation:\n\nOption B: \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [b + g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\)\n\nThis would add an extra \\( b \\) to the integrand, which doesn't make sense in the context of finding the area between \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\).\n\nOption C: \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [b - g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\)\n\nThis would subtract both \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\) from \\( b \\), which would calculate the area between \\( y = b \\) and the sum of \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\), which doesn't correspond to the shaded region described.\n\nOption D: \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [b - g(x) + f(x)] \\, dx \\)\n\nThis would subtract \\( g(x) \\) and add \\( f(x) \\) to \\( b \\), which also doesn't correspond to the area between \\( g(x) \\) and \\( f(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is indeed option A: \\( \\int_{0}^{a} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
