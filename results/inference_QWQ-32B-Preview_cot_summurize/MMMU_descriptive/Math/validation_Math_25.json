The angle \u03b8 can be determined using the tangent of the angle, which is the ratio of the vertical velocity component to the horizontal velocity component at the moment of impact.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Horizontal velocity: \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4\\) m/s (constant)\n\n- Vertical velocity: \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t\\) m/s\n\nFirst, we need to determine the time \\( t \\) when the object hits the ground. The object hits the ground when its vertical distance from the ground \\( y(t) \\) is zero.\n\nWe are given \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t\\). To find \\( y(t) \\), we need to integrate \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\) with respect to \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ y(t) = \\int (4.2 - 9.8t) \\, dt = 4.2t - 4.9t^2 + C \\]\n\nWe know that at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( y(0) = 10 \\) meters (initial height):\n\n\\[ 10 = 4.2(0) - 4.9(0)^2 + C \\implies C = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the equation for \\( y(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ y(t) = 4.2t - 4.9t^2 + 10 \\]\n\nTo find when the object hits the ground, set \\( y(t) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 4.2t - 4.9t^2 + 10 = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ -4.9t^2 + 4.2t + 10 = 0 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to simplify:\n\n\\[ 4.9t^2 - 4.2t - 10 = 0 \\]\n\nUse the quadratic formula to solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nHere, \\( a = 4.9 \\), \\( b = -4.2 \\), and \\( c = -10 \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4.2)^2 - 4(4.9)(-10)}}{2(4.9)} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{17.64 + 196}}{9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm \\sqrt{213.64}}{9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{4.2 \\pm 14.62}{9.8} \\]\n\nWe have two solutions:\n\n1. \\( t = \\frac{4.2 + 14.62}{9.8} = \\frac{18.82}{9.8} \\approx 1.92 \\) seconds\n\n2. \\( t = \\frac{4.2 - 14.62}{9.8} = \\frac{-10.42}{9.8} \\approx -1.06 \\) seconds\n\nSince time cannot be negative, the object hits the ground at approximately \\( t = 1.92 \\) seconds.\n\nNext, we need to find the velocities at this time:\n\nHorizontal velocity: \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = 1.4\\) m/s (constant)\n\nVertical velocity: \\(\\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8t\\)\n\nAt \\( t = 1.92 \\) seconds:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = 4.2 - 9.8(1.92) = 4.2 - 18.816 = -14.616 \\) m/s\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the object is moving downward.\n\nThe angle \u03b8 between the path and the ground is given by:\n\n\\[ \\tan \\theta = \\left| \\frac{\\frac{dy}{dt}}{\\frac{dx}{dt}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-14.616}{1.4} \\right| = \\frac{14.616}{1.4} \\approx 10.44 \\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ \\theta = \\arctan(10.44) \\]\n\nUsing a calculator:\n\n\\[ \\theta \\approx 1.475 \\) radians\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \u03b8 = 1.475\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
