Then, we will find the sum \\(m + n\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Trapezoid:**\n   - \\(AB \\parallel CD\\)\n   - \\(BC = CD = 43\\)\n   - \\(AD \\perp BD\\)\n   - \\(O\\) is the intersection of diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\)\n   - \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\)\n   - \\(OP = 11\\)\n\n2. **Setting Up Coordinates:**\n   - Let's place the trapezoid on a coordinate plane to make calculations easier.\n   - Assume \\(D\\) is at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n   - Since \\(AD \\perp BD\\), and \\(D\\) is at \\((0, 0)\\), let\u2019s denote \\(A\\) at \\((0, a)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b, 0)\\), and \\(C\\) at \\((c, 0)\\).\n\n3. **Using Given Lengths:**\n   - \\(BC = CD = 43\\)\n   - Since \\(C\\) is at \\((c, 0)\\) and \\(D\\) is at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(CD = c = 43\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(C\\) is at \\((43, 0)\\).\n   - \\(BC = 43\\), so the distance between \\(B(b, 0)\\) and \\(C(43, 0)\\) is \\(|b - 43| = 43\\).\n   - This gives \\(b = 43 + 43 = 86\\) or \\(b = 43 - 43 = 0\\). But \\(b = 0\\) would place \\(B\\) at \\(D\\), which is not possible. So, \\(b = 86\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(B\\) is at \\((86, 0)\\).\n\n4. **Finding Coordinates of \\(A\\):**\n   - \\(A\\) is at \\((0, a)\\).\n   - Since \\(AD \\perp BD\\), the slopes of \\(AD\\) and \\(BD\\) multiply to \\(-1\\).\n   - Slope of \\(AD\\): \\(\\frac{a - 0}{0 - 0}\\) is undefined (vertical line).\n   - Slope of \\(BD\\): \\(\\frac{0 - 0}{86 - 0} = 0\\) (horizontal line).\n   - Indeed, vertical and horizontal lines are perpendicular.\n\n5. **Finding Intersection \\(O\\) of Diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\):**\n   - Equation of \\(AC\\):\n     - Points \\(A(0, a)\\) and \\(C(43, 0)\\).\n     - Slope \\(m_{AC} = \\frac{0 - a}{43 - 0} = -\\frac{a}{43}\\).\n     - Equation: \\(y - a = -\\frac{a}{43}x\\), so \\(y = -\\frac{a}{43}x + a\\).\n   - Equation of \\(BD\\):\n     - Points \\(B(86, 0)\\) and \\(D(0, 0)\\).\n     - Slope \\(m_{BD} = 0\\) (horizontal line).\n     - Equation: \\(y = 0\\).\n   - Intersection \\(O\\):\n     - Set \\(y = 0\\) in \\(y = -\\frac{a}{43}x + a\\):\n       \\[\n       0 = -\\frac{a}{43}x + a \\implies \\frac{a}{43}x = a \\implies x = 43\n       \\]\n     - So, \\(O\\) is at \\((43, 0)\\).\n\n6. **Finding Midpoint \\(P\\) of \\(BD\\):**\n   - \\(B(86, 0)\\) and \\(D(0, 0)\\).\n   - Midpoint \\(P = \\left( \\frac{86 + 0}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (43, 0)\\).\n\n7. **Calculating \\(OP\\):**\n   - \\(O(43, 0)\\) and \\(P(43, 0)\\).\n   - Distance \\(OP = 0\\), but given \\(OP = 11\\), which contradicts.\n\n### Reevaluation:\n\nThere seems to be a mistake in the coordinate setup. Let's reconsider the placement.\n\n- Perhaps \\(D\\) is not at \\((0,0)\\), or another coordinate assignment is needed.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\n- Let\u2019s assume \\(D\\) is at \\((0,0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((c,0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b,h)\\), and \\(A\\) at \\((0,h)\\), maintaining \\(AB \\parallel CD\\).\n\nGiven \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), and \\(AD \\perp BD\\), let's try this setup.\n\n1. **New Coordinate Assignment:**\n   - \\(D(0,0)\\)\n   - \\(C(c,0)\\)\n   - \\(B(b,h)\\)\n   - \\(A(0,h)\\)\n\n2. **Given Conditions:**\n   - \\(BC = CD = 43\\)\n   - \\(AD \\perp BD\\)\n   - \\(O\\) is intersection of \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\)\n   - \\(P\\) is midpoint of \\(BD\\)\n   - \\(OP = 11\\)\n\n3. **Calculate \\(CD\\):**\n   - \\(CD = c = 43\\)\n\n4. **Calculate \\(BC\\):**\n   - \\(BC = \\sqrt{(b - c)^2 + h^2} = 43\\)\n   - So, \\(\\sqrt{(b - 43)^2 + h^2} = 43\\)\n   - Squaring both sides: \\((b - 43)^2 + h^2 = 1849\\)\n\n5. **Condition \\(AD \\perp BD\\):**\n   - \\(AD\\) is from \\(A(0,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\): direction vector \\((0, -h)\\)\n   - \\(BD\\) is from \\(B(b,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\): direction vector \\((-b, -h)\\)\n   - Dot product for perpendicularity: \\(0*(-b) + (-h)*(-h) = h^2 = 0\\), which implies \\(h = 0\\), but this can't be since it would collapse the trapezoid.\n   - This suggests a mistake in vector assignment.\n\nAlternative understanding: \\(AD \\perp BD\\) means the lines \\(AD\\) and \\(BD\\) are perpendicular.\n\n- Slope of \\(AD\\): since \\(A(0,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), it's a vertical line.\n- Slope of \\(BD\\): from \\(B(b,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\), slope \\(m_{BD} = \\frac{0 - h}{0 - b} = \\frac{-h}{-b} = \\frac{h}{b}\\)\n- A vertical line is perpendicular to any horizontal line, but \\(BD\\) is not horizontal unless \\(h = 0\\), which again is invalid.\n\nThis indicates a flaw in the coordinate system. Let's try placing \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((0,a)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b,0)\\), and \\(C\\) at \\((c,0)\\), with \\(AB \\parallel CD\\).\n\nGiven \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), and \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are both horizontal if \\(AB\\) is horizontal, but previous attempts suggest confusion.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\n\nUse properties of trapezoids and similar triangles.\n\n1. **Properties:**\n   - \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), so trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB \\parallel CD\\).\n   - \\(BC = CD = 43\\), so legs \\(BC\\) and \\(CD\\) are equal.\n   - \\(AD \\perp BD\\), so angle at \\(D\\) between \\(AD\\) and \\(BD\\) is 90 degrees.\n\n2. **Intersection \\(O\\) of diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\):**\n   - In a trapezoid, the diagonals intersect at a point that divides each diagonal proportionally based on the lengths of the parallel sides.\n\n3. **Midpoint \\(P\\) of \\(BD\\):**\n   - Given \\(OP = 11\\), where \\(O\\) is the intersection of the diagonals.\n\n4. **Finding \\(AD\\):**\n   - We need to find \\(AD\\) in terms of \\(m\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\nGiven the complexity, let's consider the ratio in which \\(O\\) divides the diagonals.\n\nIn trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), the ratio in which \\(O\\) divides each diagonal is the same and is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(AB = x\\)\n- \\(CD = 43\\)\n\nThen, the ratio \\( \\frac{AO}{OC} = \\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{x}{43} \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( \\frac{BO}{OD} = \\frac{x}{43} \\)\n\nHowever, since \\(BC = CD = 43\\), the trapezoid is isosceles, meaning non-parallel sides are equal.\n\nGiven \\(AD \\perp BD\\), we can use Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\(ADB\\).\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\(h = AD\\)\n- Let \\(BD = d\\)\n\nSince \\(AD \\perp BD\\), triangle \\(ADB\\) is right-angled at \\(D\\), so:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \\implies x^2 = h^2 + d^2\n\\]\n\nNow, considering triangle \\(BDC\\):\n\n- \\(BC = 43\\), \\(CD = 43\\), \\(BD = d\\)\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \\(BDC\\) (assuming it's a right triangle, but need to verify):\n\nWait, \\(BC = CD = 43\\), and \\(BD = d\\), but triangle \\(BDC\\) is not necessarily right-angled.\n\nAlternatively, consider coordinates again but more carefully.\n\n### Coordinate Geometry Approach:\n\nLet\u2019s place \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((c,0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b,h)\\), and \\(A\\) at \\((a,h)\\), maintaining \\(AB \\parallel CD\\).\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(AB \\parallel CD\\) \u21d2 \\(AB\\) is horizontal, so \\(A(a,h)\\), \\(B(b,h)\\), \\(C(c,0)\\), \\(D(0,0)\\)\n\nGiven \\(BC = CD = 43\\):\n\n- \\(BC = \\sqrt{(b - c)^2 + h^2} = 43\\)\n- \\(CD = c = 43\\)\n\nSo, \\(c = 43\\), and \\(BC = \\sqrt{(b - 43)^2 + h^2} = 43\\)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n\\[\n(b - 43)^2 + h^2 = 1849\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(AD \\perp BD\\):\n\n- \\(AD\\) is from \\(A(a,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\)\n- \\(BD\\) is from \\(B(b,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\)\n\nVectors:\n\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (-a, -h)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{BD} = (-b, -h)\\)\n\nDot product for perpendicularity:\n\n\\[\n(-a)(-b) + (-h)(-h) = ab + h^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nBut \\(ab + h^2 = 0\\) implies \\(ab = -h^2\\), which is not possible since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(h\\) are positive lengths.\n\nThis suggests an error in coordinate assignment.\n\n### Correct Coordinate Assignment:\n\nLet\u2019s place \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((c,0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b,h)\\), and \\(A\\) at \\((0,h)\\), maintaining \\(AB \\parallel CD\\).\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\(AB \\parallel CD\\)\n- \\(BC = CD = 43\\)\n- \\(AD \\perp BD\\)\n\nSo:\n\n- \\(A(0,h)\\), \\(B(b,h)\\), \\(C(c,0)\\), \\(D(0,0)\\)\n\nGiven \\(BC = CD = 43\\):\n\n- \\(CD = c = 43\\)\n- \\(BC = \\sqrt{(b - c)^2 + h^2} = 43\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n(b - 43)^2 + h^2 = 1849\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(AD \\perp BD\\):\n\n- \\(AD\\) is from \\(A(0,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\): direction vector \\((0, -h)\\)\n- \\(BD\\) is from \\(B(b,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\): direction vector \\((-b, -h)\\)\n- Dot product: \\(0*(-b) + (-h)*(-h) = h^2\\)\n\nFor \\(AD \\perp BD\\), dot product should be zero:\n\n\\[\nh^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis implies \\(h = 0\\), which is impossible. Hence, there is a mistake in coordinate assignment.\n\n### Correcting Coordinate System:\n\nLet\u2019s place \\(D\\) at \\((0,0)\\), \\(C\\) at \\((c,0)\\), \\(B\\) at \\((b,h)\\), and \\(A\\) at \\((a,k)\\), ensuring \\(AB \\parallel CD\\).\n\nGiven \\(AB \\parallel CD\\), slopes must be equal.\n\nSlope of \\(AB\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{k - h}{a - b}\n\\]\n\nSlope of \\(CD\\):\n\n\\[\n0\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{k - h}{a - b} = 0 \\implies k = h\\)\n\nThus, \\(A(a,h)\\), \\(B(b,h)\\), \\(C(c,0)\\), \\(D(0,0)\\)\n\nGiven \\(BC = CD = 43\\):\n\n- \\(CD = c = 43\\)\n- \\(BC = \\sqrt{(b - c)^2 + h^2} = 43\\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n(b - 43)^2 + h^2 = 1849\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(AD \\perp BD\\):\n\n- \\(AD\\) is from \\(A(a,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\): direction vector \\((-a, -h)\\)\n- \\(BD\\) is from \\(B(b,h)\\) to \\(D(0,0)\\): direction vector \\((-b, -h)\\)\n- Dot product: \\((-a)(-b) + (-h)(-h) = ab + h^2 = 0\\)\n\nAgain, \\(ab + h^2 = 0\\), which is impossible for positive \\(a, b, h\\).\n\nThis suggests a fundamental misunderstanding in the coordinate setup.\n\n### Alternative Approach Using Properties of Trapezoids:\n\nGiven the complexity in coordinate geometry, let's use properties of trapezoids and similar triangles.\n\n1. **Trapezoid Properties:**\n   - \\(AB \\parallel CD\\)\n   - \\(BC = CD = 43\\)\n   - \\(AD \\perp BD\\)\n\n2. **Intersection Point \\(O\\):**\n   - \\(O\\) is the intersection of diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\)\n\n3. **Midpoint \\(P\\):**\n   - \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\)\n   - Given \\(OP = 11\\)\n\n4. **Find \\(AD\\):**\n   - Express \\(AD\\) in the form \\(m\\sqrt{n}\\) and find \\(m + n\\)\n\nGiven that \\(AB \\parallel CD\\) and \\(BC = CD = 43\\), trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) is isosceles.\n\nIn an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are equal and the legs are equal.\n\nGiven \\(AD \\perp BD\\), we can consider the right triangle \\(ADB\\).\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\(h = AD\\)\n- Let \\(BD = d\\)\n\nSince \\(AD \\perp BD\\), by Pythagorean theorem in \\(\\triangle ADB\\):\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \\implies AB^2 = h^2 + d^2\n\\]\n\nNow, consider the properties of the diagonals in a trapezoid.\n\nThe diagonals of a trapezoid intersect in such a way that the ratio of the segments they divide each other into is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\(AB = a\\)\n- \\(CD = 43\\)\n\nThen, the ratio in which \\(O\\) divides each diagonal is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AO}{OC} = \\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{a}{43}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\frac{BO}{OD} = \\frac{a}{43}\\)\n\nGiven that \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), and \\(OP = 11\\), we can relate these segments.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\(BD = d\\)\n- Then, \\(P\\) is the midpoint, so \\(BP = PD = \\frac{d}{2}\\)\n\nNow, considering \\(O\\) divides \\(BD\\) in the ratio \\(\\frac{a}{43}\\), let\u2019s denote:\n\n- Let \\(\\frac{BO}{OD} = \\frac{a}{43}\\)\n- So, \\(BO = \\frac{a}{a + 43} \\cdot d\\)\n- \\(OD = \\frac{43}{a + 43} \\cdot d\\)\n\nGiven that \\(P\\) is the midpoint of \\(BD\\), its position can be expressed in terms of \\(BO\\) and \\(OD\\).\n\nThe distance \\(OP\\) can be found using the section formula or coordinate geometry, but this seems complicated.\n\n### Simplified Approach:\n\nLet\u2019s consider the areas or other properties to find a relationship.\n\nGiven that \\(AD \\perp BD\\), the area of \\(\\triangle ADB\\)"
