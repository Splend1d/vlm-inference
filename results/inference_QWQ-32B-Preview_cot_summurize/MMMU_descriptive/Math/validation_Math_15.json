The triangle represents a ladder leaning against a vertical wall. The horizontal leg of the triangle is labeled \\( x \\), representing the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the base of the wall. The vertical leg of the triangle is labeled \\( y \\), representing the height of the top of the ladder from the ground. The right angle is located at the bottom left corner of the triangle, indicating that the ladder forms a right angle with the ground and the wall.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe top of a 25-foot ladder, leaning against a vertical wall is slipping down the wall at the rate of 1 foot per second. How fast is the bottom of the ladder slipping along the ground when the bottom of the ladder is 7 feet away from the base of the wall? <image 1>\n\n"

There's a 25-foot ladder leaning against a vertical wall, and the top of the ladder is slipping down the wall at 1 foot per second. I need to find out how fast the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground when the bottom is 7 feet away from the base of the wall.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize this situation. There's a wall, and a ladder is leaning against it, forming a right triangle with the ground. The hypotenuse is the ladder, which is 25 feet long. The vertical leg is the height from the ground to where the ladder touches the wall, and the horizontal leg is the distance from the base of the wall to the bottom of the ladder.\n\nSince the ladder is slipping down the wall, the vertical leg is decreasing in length over time, and the horizontal leg is increasing in length as the bottom of the ladder slides away from the wall.\n\nI think I can use the Pythagorean theorem here because it relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. So, if I let \\( y \\) be the vertical leg (height), and \\( x \\) be the horizontal leg (distance from the wall), then:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25^2 \\]\n\nThat is:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 625 \\]\n\nNow, I need to find how fast the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground, which is the rate of change of \\( x \\) with respect to time, or \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\), when \\( x = 7 \\) feet.\n\nI'm given that the top of the ladder is slipping down the wall at 1 foot per second, which is the rate of change of \\( y \\) with respect to time, or \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = -1 \\) ft/s (negative because \\( y \\) is decreasing).\n\nSo, I have:\n\n\\[ x^2 + y^2 = 625 \\]\n\nAnd I need to find \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\) when \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = -1 \\).\n\nTo relate these rates, I can differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 2x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ x \\frac{dx}{dt} + y \\frac{dy}{dt} = 0 \\]\n\nNow, I can solve for \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dt} \\]\n\nI know \\( x = 7 \\) and \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} = -1 \\), but I don't know \\( y \\) yet. I need to find \\( y \\) when \\( x = 7 \\).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ 7^2 + y^2 = 625 \\]\n\n\\[ 49 + y^2 = 625 \\]\n\n\\[ y^2 = 625 - 49 \\]\n\n\\[ y^2 = 576 \\]\n\n\\[ y = 24 \\]\n\nSo, when \\( x = 7 \\), \\( y = 24 \\).\n\nNow, plug these values into the equation for \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\frac{24}{7} (-1) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{24}{7} \\] ft/s\n\nSo, the bottom of the ladder is slipping along the ground at a rate of \\( \\frac{24}{7} \\) feet per second.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward.
