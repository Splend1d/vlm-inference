Here is a detailed description of the connections and weights:\n\n- Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5 with weights 6, 5, 14, and 16 respectively.\n- Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 5 with weights 6, 2, and 8 respectively.\n- Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 4, and 5 with weights 5, 2, 11, and 7 respectively.\n- Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 with weights 14, 11, 7, 15, and 9 respectively.\n- Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 with weights 16, 8, 7, 7, 4, and 17 respectively.\n- Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 4, 5, 7, and 8 with weights 15, 4, 12, and 10 respectively.\n- Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 5, 6, and 8 with weights 17, 12, and 3 respectively.\n- Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 4, 6, and 7 with weights 9, 10, and 3 respectively.\n\nTo find the minimum spanning tree of this graph, we would typically use an algorithm like Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.

I think I'll go with Kruskal's because it's easier for me to sort the edges by weight.\n\nFirst, I need to list all the edges with their weights:\n\n- (1,2): 6\n\n- (1,3): 5\n\n- (1,4): 14\n\n- (1,5): 16\n\n- (2,3): 2\n\n- (2,5): 8\n\n- (3,4): 11\n\n- (3,5): 7\n\n- (4,5): 7\n\n- (4,6): 15\n\n- (4,8): 9\n\n- (5,6): 4\n\n- (5,7): 17\n\n- (6,7): 12\n\n- (6,8): 10\n\n- (7,8): 3\n\nNow, I'll sort these edges by their weights in ascending order:\n\n1. (2,3): 2\n\n2. (1,3): 5\n\n3. (5,6): 4\n\n4. (4,5): 7\n\n5. (3,5): 7\n\n6. (7,8): 3\n\n7. (4,8): 9\n\n8. (6,8): 10\n\n9. (1,2): 6\n\n10. (2,5): 8\n\n11. (3,4): 11\n\n12. (6,7): 12\n\n13. (1,4): 14\n\n14. (4,6): 15\n\n15. (5,7): 17\n\n16. (1,5): 16\n\nAlright, now I'll start adding the edges to the MST in this order, making sure not to form any cycles.\n\nStart with edge (2,3): 2. Add it.\n\nNext, (1,3): 5. Add it. Now, vertices 1,2,3 are connected.\n\nNext, (5,6): 4. Add it. Vertices 5 and 6 are connected.\n\nNext, (4,5): 7. Add it. Vertices 4 is connected.\n\nNext, (3,5): 7. But adding this would form a cycle between vertices 3,5, and 4, which are already connected through vertex 5. So, skip it.\n\nNext, (7,8): 3. Wait, this is lower than the previous edge, but since I sorted them, I should have considered it earlier. Let me check the sorted list again.\n\nActually, (7,8): 3 should have been before (5,6):4. Let me correct the sorted list:\n\n1. (2,3): 2\n\n2. (7,8): 3\n\n3. (1,3): 5\n\n4. (5,6): 4\n\n5. (4,5): 7\n\n6. (3,5): 7\n\n7. (4,8): 9\n\n8. (6,8): 10\n\n9. (1,2): 6\n\n10. (2,5): 8\n\n11. (3,4): 11\n\n12. (6,7): 12\n\n13. (1,4): 14\n\n14. (4,6): 15\n\n15. (5,7): 17\n\n16. (1,5): 16\n\nOkay, starting again:\n\n1. Add (2,3):2\n\n2. Add (7,8):3\n\n3. Add (1,3):5\n\n4. Add (5,6):4\n\n5. Add (4,5):7\n\n6. Skip (3,5):7 because it would form a cycle.\n\n7. Add (4,8):9\n\nAt this point, all vertices are connected:\n\n- Vertices 1,2,3 are connected.\n\n- Vertices 4,5,6 are connected through vertex 5.\n\n- Vertices 7 and 8 are connected.\n\n- Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5, which is connected to vertex 6, and vertex 6 is not directly connected to the first group, but vertex 8 is connected to vertex 7, which is not yet connected to the main tree.\n\nWait, actually, vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8, which is connected to vertex 4 via vertex 4-8. So, vertex 7 is connected to the main tree through vertex 8.\n\nSo, the MST should include:\n\n- (2,3):2\n\n- (7,8):3\n\n- (1,3):5\n\n- (5,6):4\n\n- (4,5):7\n\n- (4,8):9\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+5+4+7+9 = 30.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v1, v3), (v2, v3) and so on.\n\nB. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nC. Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nD. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and no arc connecting A1 and A3.\n\nHmm, the labels are a bit confusing. It mentions v1 to v8, but then A1 and A3, which might be a typo.\n\nIn my MST, I have (2,3), (7,8), (1,3), (5,6), (4,5), and (4,8).\n\nSo, (v2, v5) would be (2,5), which is not in my MST, unless there's a mistake.\n\nWait, in my MST, I have (4,5) and (5,6), but not (2,5).\n\nOption B includes (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nBut in my MST, I have (4,8), but not (2,5).\n\nSo, perhaps the correct MST includes (2,5) instead of (1,3) or something.\n\nLet me check if including (2,5) would be possible.\n\nIf I include (2,5) instead of (3,5), but (3,5) was skipped because it would form a cycle.\n\nWait, in my earlier steps:\n\n1. (2,3):2\n\n2. (7,8):3\n\n3. (1,3):5\n\n4. (5,6):4\n\n5. (4,5):7\n\n6. (4,8):9\n\nTotal weight: 30.\n\nIf I were to include (2,5) instead of something, let's see.\n\nSuppose I include (2,5):8 instead of (1,3):5. That would increase the total weight to 2+3+8+4+7+9=33, which is higher.\n\nAlternatively, if I include (2,5):8 and exclude (4,8):9, total weight would be 2+3+5+4+7+8=29, which is less than 30.\n\nBut is that a valid MST?\n\nLet's try constructing it:\n\n1. (2,3):2\n\n2. (7,8):3\n\n3. (1,3):5\n\n4. (5,6):4\n\n5. (2,5):8\n\n6. (4,5):7\n\nNow, all vertices are connected:\n\n- Vertices 2,3 connected.\n\n- Vertices 7,8 connected.\n\n- Vertex 1 connected through vertex 3.\n\n- Vertices 5,6 connected through vertex 5.\n\n- Vertex 4 connected through vertex 5.\n\n- Vertex 2 connected to vertex 5.\n\nSo, everything is connected, and no cycles are formed.\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+5+4+8+7=29.\n\nThis is better than the previous 30.\n\nSo, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nIs there a way to make it even less?\n\nLet me see.\n\nIs there any edge with weight less than 29?\n\nThe next edge is (4,8):9, but I already have (2,5):8 instead.\n\nWait, in this new MST, I have (2,5):8 instead of (4,8):9, which reduces the total weight.\n\nSo, perhaps Option B is correct, as it includes (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nBut in my second MST, I have (2,5):8 and not (4,8):9.\n\nWait, but in Option B, it includes both (v2, v5) and (v4, v8), but in my second MST, I have (2,5):8 and (4,5):7, which connects vertex 4 to the tree.\n\nSo, perhaps including both (2,5) and (4,8) would create a cycle.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf I include (2,5):8 and (4,5):7, then (4,8):9 would create a cycle, because vertex 4 is already connected to vertex 5, and vertex 8 is connected to vertex 7, which is connected to vertex 5 through vertex 6.\n\nWait, no, vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8, and vertex 8 is connected to vertex 4, which is connected to vertex 5, which is connected to vertex 6.\n\nSo, including (4,8) after (4,5) and (7,8) would create a cycle.\n\nTherefore, in the MST, we should not include (4,8) if we already have (4,5) and (7,8).\n\nWait, in my second MST, I have (2,5):8 and (4,5):7, and (7,8):3, and (1,3):5, and (5,6):4, and (2,3):2.\n\nSo, in this case, vertex 4 is connected through (4,5), and vertex 8 is connected through (7,8), so (4,8) is not needed and would create a cycle.\n\nTherefore, Option B, which includes both (v2, v5) and (v4, v8), might not be correct, because (v4, v8) is not needed if (v4, v5) and (v7, v8) are already included.\n\nWait, but the description says \"Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\"\n\nSo, perhaps in their MST, they included both (v2, v5) and (v4, v8), which might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another way to form the MST.\n\nLet me try including (v4, v8) and see.\n\nStart with:\n\n1. (2,3):2\n\n2. (7,8):3\n\n3. (1,3):5\n\n4. (5,6):4\n\n5. (4,8):9\n\n6. (4,5):7\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+5+4+9+7=30.\n\nAlternatively, include (2,5):8 instead of (4,5):7.\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+5+4+8+9=31.\n\nWait, that's higher.\n\nAlternatively, include (2,5):8 and (4,8):9, but then I need to make sure there are no cycles.\n\nBut vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5 through (4,5):7, which is not included, so maybe.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\n1. (2,3):2\n\n2. (7,8):3\n\n3. (1,3):5\n\n4. (5,6):4\n\n5. (2,5):8\n\n6. (4,8):9\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+5+4+8+9=31.\n\nBut this is higher than the previous 29.\n\nSo, still, 29 is better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another edge I can exclude.\n\nWait, maybe excluding (1,3):5 and including something else.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. (2,3):2\n\n2. (7,8):3\n\n3. (5,6):4\n\n4. (2,5):8\n\n5. (4,5):7\n\n6. (1,3):5\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+4+8+7+5=29.\n\nAlternatively, excluding (1,3):5 and including (1,2):6.\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+4+8+7+6=30.\n\nHigher than 29.\n\nSo, 29 is better.\n\nAlternatively, excluding (1,3):5 and including (3,5):7.\n\nBut (3,5):7 would form a cycle with (2,5):8 and (2,3):2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n- (2,3):2\n\n- (7,8):3\n\n- (5,6):4\n\n- (2,5):8\n\n- (3,5):7\n\n- (1,3):5\n\nThis would have a cycle between vertices 2,3,5.\n\nSo, it's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the best MST I can find has a total weight of 29, including edges (2,3):2, (7,8):3, (1,3):5, (5,6):4, (2,5):8, and (4,5):7.\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v1, v3), (v2, v3) and so on.\n\nB. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nC. Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nD. Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and no arc connecting A1 and A3.\n\nGiven that my MST includes (v2, v5) but not necessarily (v4, v8), Option B might not be correct.\n\nHowever, in my MST, I have (4,5):7, which connects vertex 4 to the tree, and (7,8):3 connects vertex 8, so (v4, v8) is not needed.\n\nTherefore, Option B, which includes both (v2, v5) and (v4, v8), might be incorrect because (v4, v8) is not necessary in the MST.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C: Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nBut wait, in my MST, I have (v2, v5), which is excluded in Option C.\n\nSo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option B, but with a higher total weight.\n\nBut in my calculation, excluding (v2, v5) leads to a higher total weight.\n\nTherefore, the minimum spanning tree should include (v2, v5) and exclude (v4, v8), which corresponds to Option C.\n\nWait, Option C says \"arcs excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8)\", but in my MST, I include (v2, v5) and exclude (v4, v8).\n\nTherefore, Option C would exclude (v2, v5), which is not desirable.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is Option B, even though it includes (v4, v8), which might not be necessary, but perhaps it's still a valid MST.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are multiple MSTs with the same weight, and Option B is also correct.\n\nWait, in my MST, total weight is 29, but if I include (v4, v8) instead of (v2, v5), what happens?\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. (2,3):2\n\n2. (7,8):3\n\n3. (1,3):5\n\n4. (5,6):4\n\n5. (4,5):7\n\n6. (4,8):9\n\nTotal weight: 2+3+5+4+7+9=30.\n\nWhich is higher than 29.\n\nTherefore, including (v4, v8) instead of (v2, v5) increases the total weight.\n\nTherefore, the minimum spanning tree should exclude (v4, v8) and include (v2, v5), which corresponds to Option C, excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nWait, but in my MST, I include (v2, v5) and exclude (v4, v8), but Option C excludes both, which is not desirable.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread Option C.\n\nOption C says: Graph G1 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs excluding (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\n\nBut in my MST, I include (v2, v5) and exclude (v4, v8).\n\nTherefore, Option C would exclude (v2, v5), which is not what we want.\n\nTherefore, Option C is not the minimum spanning tree.\n\nOption B includes both (v2, v5) and (v4, v8), which might not be optimal.\n\nOption D mentions no arc connecting A1 and A3, which seems unrelated.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, or there is a mistake in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum spanning tree includes (v2, v5) but not (v4, v8), and the correct option is B, even though it includes both, assuming that (v4, v8) is not actually included in the MST.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in Graph G2, (v4, v8) is not present, and only (v2, v5) is included.\n\nBut the description says \"Graph G2 with vertices v1 to v8 and arcs including (v2, v5) and (v4, v8).\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nGiven the options, I think the best choice is Option B, assuming that even if (v4, v8) is included, it still forms a valid MST, although not the minimum possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all"
