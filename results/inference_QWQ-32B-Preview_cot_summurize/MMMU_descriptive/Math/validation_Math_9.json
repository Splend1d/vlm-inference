The vertices are arranged in a specific pattern: \n\n- There are two vertices at the top, forming a horizontal line.\n- Below these two vertices, there are two more vertices, each connected to one of the top vertices and also connected to each other.\n- Below these two vertices, there are two more vertices, each connected to one of the middle vertices and also connected to each other.\n- Finally, there is one vertex at the bottom, which is connected to both of the bottom vertices.\n\nThis arrangement forms a structure that resembles a hexagon with an additional vertex in the center. The graph is fully connected, meaning there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n\nTo determine if this graph is Hamiltonian, we need to check if there exists a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. In this case, it is possible to find such a cycle:\n\n1. Start at any vertex.\n2. Move to an adjacent vertex.\n3. Continue moving to adjacent vertices, ensuring each vertex is visited exactly once.\n4. Return to the starting vertex.\n\nSince the graph is fully connected and has a structure that allows for a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once, it is indeed Hamiltonian.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\nA. Yes\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIs <image 1> Hamiltonian?\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\n"
