                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about using the Newton-Raphson method to solve the equation \\(f_1(x) = x e^{-x} = 0\\), and I need to figure out for which starting points \\(x_0\\) the method will converge. The function is \\(f_1(x) = x e^{-x}\\), and from the description, it's a curve that starts at the origin (0,0), peaks at \\(x = 1\\), and then decreases towards the x-axis as \\(x\\) increases. It's all in the first quadrant, so it's positive for positive \\(x\\).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the Newton-Raphson method is. It's an iterative method to find roots of a function, so in this case, we're trying to find where \\(f_1(x) = 0\\). The formula for the Newton-Raphson iteration is:\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\\]\n\nSo, to apply this, I need to compute the derivative of \\(f_1(x)\\).\n\nGiven \\(f_1(x) = x e^{-x}\\), let's find \\(f_1'(x)\\):\n\n\\[f_1'(x) = e^{-x} + x*(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x} - x e^{-x} = e^{-x}(1 - x)\\]\n\nSo, the iteration formula becomes:\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n e^{-x_n}}{e^{-x_n}(1 - x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n} = x_n - \\left(\\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n}\\right)\\]\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{x_n(1 - x_n) - x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{x_n - x_n^2 - x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\]\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to look at this.\n\nWait a minute, the function is \\(f_1(x) = x e^{-x}\\), and we're setting it equal to zero: \\(x e^{-x} = 0\\). Since \\(e^{-x}\\) is never zero, the only solution is \\(x = 0\\). So, the root we're trying to find is \\(x = 0\\).\n\nNow, I need to see for which starting points \\(x_0\\) the Newton-Raphson iteration converges to \\(x = 0\\).\n\nLet me consider the behavior of the iteration depending on the initial guess \\(x_0\\).\n\nFirst, if \\(x_0 = 0\\), then \\(f_1(0) = 0\\), so we've already hit the root, and no iteration is needed.\n\nIf \\(x_0 > 0\\), let's see what happens.\n\nFrom the iteration formula:\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n e^{-x_n}}{e^{-x_n}(1 - x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{x_n(1 - x_n) - x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{x_n - x_n^2 - x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\]\n\nHmm, this seems to suggest that \\(x_{n+1}\\) is \\(\\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\).\n\nNow, since \\(x_n\\) is positive (as per the function's domain described), and \\(1 - x_n\\) depends on whether \\(x_n\\) is less than or greater than 1.\n\nLet's consider two cases: \\(x_n < 1\\) and \\(x_n > 1\\).\n\n1. If \\(x_n < 1\\), then \\(1 - x_n > 0\\), so \\(x_{n+1} = \\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\). Since numerator is negative (because of the negative sign) and denominator is positive, \\(x_{n+1}\\) is negative.\n\nBut wait, the function is only defined for positive \\(x\\), and the iteration should stay within the domain where the function is positive. So, if \\(x_{n+1}\\) becomes negative, that might not make sense in this context.\n\n2. If \\(x_n > 1\\), then \\(1 - x_n < 0\\), so \\(x_{n+1} = \\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\), which is positive because negative divided by negative is positive.\n\nWait, but in the first iteration, if \\(x_0 < 1\\), \\(x_1\\) becomes negative, which is outside the domain where the function is positive, and perhaps not meaningful for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the iteration formula.\n\nLet me double-check the Newton-Raphson formula.\n\nGiven \\(f(x) = x e^{-x}\\), we have \\(f'(x) = e^{-x} - x e^{-x} = e^{-x}(1 - x)\\).\n\nSo, the iteration should be:\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{x_n e^{-x_n}}{e^{-x_n}(1 - x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n}\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, if \\(x_n < 1\\), \\(x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n}\\), which simplifies to:\n\n\\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{x_n(1 - x_n) - x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{x_n - x_n^2 - x_n}{1 - x_n} = \\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\]\n\nAs I had before.\n\nNow, if \\(x_n < 1\\), and \\(x_n > 0\\) (since we're in the domain where the function is positive), then \\(1 - x_n > 0\\), and \\(-x_n^2\\) is negative, so \\(x_{n+1}\\) is negative.\n\nBut the function isn't defined for negative \\(x\\) in this context, as per the description. So, perhaps the iteration goes outside the domain, which might not be acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, if \\(x_n > 1\\), then \\(1 - x_n < 0\\), so \\(\\frac{-x_n^2}{1 - x_n}\\) is positive, since negative over negative is positive.\n\nSo, starting with \\(x_0 > 1\\), the iteration stays positive.\n\nBut, does it converge to \\(x = 0\\)?\n\nLet me try a numerical example.\n\nSuppose \\(x_0 = 2\\):\n\n\\[x_1 = 2 - \\frac{2 e^{-2}}{e^{-2}(1 - 2)} = 2 - \\frac{2 e^{-2}}{e^{-2}(-1)} = 2 - \\frac{2}{-1} = 2 - (-2) = 4\\]\n\nSo, \\(x_1 = 4\\).\n\nThen,\n\n\\[x_2 = 4 - \\frac{4 e^{-4}}{e^{-4}(1 - 4)} = 4 - \\frac{4 e^{-4}}{e^{-4}(-3)} = 4 - \\frac{4}{-3} = 4 + \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{16}{3} \\approx 5.333\\]\n\nSo, it's increasing, moving further away from zero.\n\nHmm, not converging to zero.\n\nAnother try with \\(x_0 = 0.5\\):\n\n\\[x_1 = 0.5 - \\frac{0.5 e^{-0.5}}{e^{-0.5}(1 - 0.5)} = 0.5 - \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5\\]\n\nNow, \\(x_1 = -0.5\\), which is outside the domain where the function is positive. So, perhaps not meaningful.\n\nWait, but in the context of the Newton-Raphson method, if the iteration goes outside the domain where the function is defined or meaningful, perhaps it's not converging.\n\nLet me consider the behavior around the root.\n\nThe root is at \\(x = 0\\), and the function is \\(f(x) = x e^{-x}\\), which is zero at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe derivative at \\(x = 0\\) is \\(f'(0) = e^{0}(1 - 0) = 1\\), which is non-zero, so the root is simple, and Newton-Raphson should converge quadratically near the root.\n\nSo, for starting points close to zero, it should converge.\n\nBut, looking back at the iteration formula, if \\(x_0\\) is positive and less than 1, the next iterate is negative, which is outside the domain.\n\nIf \\(x_0\\) is greater than 1, the iterates seem to move away from zero.\n\nSo, perhaps only \\(x_0 = 0\\) converges, but that's trivial because it's already the root.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are no suitable starting points where Newton-Raphson converges to zero, given the behavior described.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nMaybe I should look at the fixed-point iteration perspective.\n\nSet \\(x_{n+1} = g(x_n)\\), where \\(g(x) = x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(g(x) = x - \\frac{x e^{-x}}{e^{-x}(1 - x)} = x - \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\).\n\nSimplify \\(g(x) = x - \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\).\n\nLet me find the fixed points of \\(g(x)\\), i.e., solve \\(g(x) = x\\):\n\n\\[x - \\frac{x}{1 - x} = x \\implies -\\frac{x}{1 - x} = 0 \\implies x = 0\\]\n\nSo, the only fixed point is \\(x = 0\\), which is the root.\n\nNow, to check for convergence, I can look at the derivative of \\(g(x)\\) at the root.\n\nCompute \\(g'(x)\\):\n\n\\[g(x) = x - \\frac{x}{1 - x} = x - \\left(\\frac{x}{1 - x}\\right)\\]\n\n\\[g'(x) = 1 - \\frac{(1 - x)(1) - x(-1)}{(1 - x)^2} = 1 - \\frac{1 - x + x}{(1 - x)^2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}\\]\n\nAt \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\[g'(0) = 1 - \\frac{1}{(1 - 0)^2} = 1 - 1 = 0\\]\n\nSince \\(|g'(0)| < 1\\), the fixed point iteration should converge locally to the root \\(x = 0\\).\n\nBut earlier, when I tried \\(x_0 = 0.5\\), it went to \\(x_1 = -0.5\\), which is outside the domain.\n\nSo, perhaps the convergence is only guaranteed for starting points in a certain interval around zero, but in practice, due to the function's behavior, it might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the method only converges if \\(x_0 = 0\\), which is trivial.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is D. When \\(x_0\\) is equal to 0.\n\nBut that seems too restrictive. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider the behavior of the iteration for starting points very close to zero, but not zero.\n\nSuppose \\(x_0 = \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small positive number.\n\nThen,\n\n\\[x_1 = \\epsilon - \\frac{\\epsilon e^{-\\epsilon}}{e^{-\\epsilon}(1 - \\epsilon)} = \\epsilon - \\frac{\\epsilon}{1 - \\epsilon}\\]\n\nFor small \\(\\epsilon\\), \\(1 - \\epsilon \\approx 1\\), so \\(x_1 \\approx \\epsilon - \\epsilon = 0\\).\n\nSo, it seems like starting very close to zero, the iteration quickly converges to zero.\n\nBut in practice, due to floating-point arithmetic, it might not be possible to start exactly at zero, but starting very close to zero should work.\n\nHowever, from the earlier trials, it seems that unless \\(x_0\\) is exactly zero or very close to it, the iteration either goes outside the domain or moves away from zero.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the only reliable starting point for convergence is \\(x_0 = 0\\).\n\nBut that seems too narrow. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the method converges for \\(x_0 < 1\\), but with the caveat that the next iterate is negative, which might not be acceptable.\n\nBut according to the options, it's multiple choice:\n\nA. When \\(x_0\\) is greater than 1\n\nB. When \\(x_0\\) is equal to 1\n\nC. When \\(x_0\\) is less than 1\n\nD. When \\(x_0\\) is equal to 0\n\nFrom my analysis, it seems that only when \\(x_0 = 0\\) does the method converge immediately to the root.\n\nFor \\(x_0 > 1\\), the iterates seem to move away from zero.\n\nFor \\(x_0 < 1\\), the iterates go negative, which might not be in the domain of interest.\n\nFor \\(x_0 = 1\\), let's check:\n\n\\[x_1 = 1 - \\frac{1 \\cdot e^{-1}}{e^{-1}(1 - 1)}\\]\n\nBut the denominator has \\(1 - 1 = 0\\), so it's undefined.\n\nTherefore, \\(x_0 = 1\\) is not a valid starting point.\n\nHence, the only valid starting point where the method converges is \\(x_0 = 0\\).\n\nSo, the answer is D. When \\(x_0\\) is equal to 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
