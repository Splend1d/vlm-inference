The x-axis is labeled as \"x\" and the y-axis is labeled as \"y.\" The origin is marked as \"O.\"\n\n1. **Function f(x):** This function is given by \\( f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 8x \\). The graph of this function is a cubic curve that starts at the origin (0,0), rises to a local maximum, then falls to a local minimum, and continues to rise again. The curve intersects the x-axis at points (2,0) and (4,0).\n\n2. **Function g(x):** This function is given by \\( g(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x \\). The graph of this function is a parabola that opens downward. It intersects the x-axis at points (0,0) and (4,0).\n\n3. **Regions R and S:** \n   - Region R is the shaded area between the graphs of f(x) and g(x) for x-values from 0 to 2.\n   - Region S is the shaded area between the graphs of f(x) and g(x) for x-values from 2 to 4.\n\nThe question asks for an integral expression that can be used to find the area of Region R. \n\nTo determine the correct integral expression:\n- We need to integrate the difference between the two functions over the interval where they intersect and bound Region R.\n- Since Region R is between x = 0 and x = 2, we integrate from 0 to 2.\n- We need to subtract the lower function from the upper function within this interval.\n\nGiven the shapes of the curves, it appears that f(x) is above g(x) in the interval [0, 2]. Therefore, the correct integral expression should be:\n\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nC. \\(\\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx\\)\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>The region bounded by the graph as shown above.Choose an integral expression that can be used to find the area of R\n\nA. $\\int_{0}^{1.5}[f(x)-g(x)]\\,d x$\nB. $\\int_{0}^{1.5}[g(x)-f(x)]\\,d x$\nC. $\\int_{0}^{2}[f(x)-g(x)]\\,d x$\nD. $\\int_{0}^{2}[g(x)-f(x)]\\,d x$\n"

This is crucial for setting up the correct integral.\n\n4. **Set up the integral:**\n   - To find the area between two curves where one function is above the other, we integrate the difference of the two functions over the interval.\n   - Therefore, the area \\(A\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     A = \\int_{a}^{b} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx\n     \\]\n     where \\(a = 0\\) and \\(b = 2\\).\n\n5. **Compare with the given options:**\n   - Option A: \\(\\int_{0}^{1.5} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx\\)\n     - Incorrect because the interval is [0, 1.5] instead of [0, 2].\n   - Option B: \\(\\int_{0}^{1.5} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx\\)\n     - Incorrect for the same reasons as option A, plus it subtracts in the wrong order.\n   - Option C: \\(\\int_{0}^{2} [f(x) - g(x)] \\, dx\\)\n     - Correct, matches the interval and the order of subtraction.\n   - Option D: \\(\\int_{0}^{2} [g(x) - f(x)] \\, dx\\)\n     - Incorrect because it subtracts in the wrong order, which would give a negative area.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
