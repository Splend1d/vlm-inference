Each example shows four dancers, represented by red and blue figures, indicating different roles or positions. The dancers are arranged in various configurations, and arrows indicate the movement or interaction between them. Here is a detailed description of each example:\n\n1. **Example (1)**: Four dancers are arranged in a square formation. The red figure on the top left moves clockwise to the blue figure on the bottom left, while the blue figure on the top right moves counterclockwise to the red figure on the bottom right.\n2. **Example (2)**: Two pairs of dancers are shown. The red figure on the left moves diagonally to the blue figure on the right, while the blue figure on the left moves diagonally to the red figure on the right.\n3. **Example (3)**: Two pairs of dancers are shown. The red figure on the left moves horizontally to the blue figure on the right, while the blue figure on the left moves horizontally to the red figure on the right.\n4. **Example (4)**: Two pairs of dancers are shown. The red figure on the left moves diagonally to the blue figure on the right, while the blue figure on the left moves diagonally to the red figure on the right.\n5. **Example (5)**: Two pairs of dancers are shown. The red figure on the left moves diagonally to the blue figure on the right, while the blue figure on the left moves diagonally to the red figure on the right.\n6. **Example (6)**: Two pairs of dancers are shown. The red figure on the left moves clockwise to the blue figure on the right, while the blue figure on the left moves counterclockwise to the red figure on the right.\n\nBased on this description, the correct sequence of the contra dance formations is:\n- Circle Right\n- Ladies' Chain\n- Swing on side\n- Gents Allemande\n- Right and Left Through\n- California Twirl\n\nThe correct answer is:\n**D. (1), (3), (5), (6), (2), (4)**\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nMatch the six example contra dance in sequence, Circle Right, Ladies' Chain, Swing on side, Gents Allemande, Right and Left Through, Caifornia Twirl, with the figures <image 1>\n\nA. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6)\nB. (1), (3), (4), (5), (2), (6)\nC. (1), (3), (5), (2), (4), (6)\nD. (1), (3), (5), (6), (2), (4)\n"
