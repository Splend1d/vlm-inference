                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the optimal solution for the excursion company to maximize profit is to purchase 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2. This conclusion is drawn from the linear programming model where the objective is to maximize profit given the constraints of budget and customer demand.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Objective Function:**\n   The company wants to maximize profit, which is given by:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = 4,000x_1 + 7,000x_2\n   \\]\n   where \\( x_1 \\) is the number of Type 1 boats and \\( x_2 \\) is the number of Type 2 boats.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - Budget constraint:\n     \\[\n     25,000x_1 + 80,000x_2 \\leq 200,000\n     \\]\n     This ensures that the total investment does not exceed $200,000.\n   - Demand constraint:\n     \\[\n     1,200x_1 + 2,000x_2 \\leq 6,000\n     \\]\n     This ensures that the total capacity does not exceed the estimated maximum demand of 6,000 customers per season.\n   - Non-negativity constraints:\n     \\[\n     x_1 \\geq 0, \\quad x_2 \\geq 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Feasible Region:**\n   The feasible region is determined by the intersection of the constraints. The vertices of this region are potential candidates for the optimal solution.\n\n4. **Optimal Solution:**\n   According to the description, the optimal solution occurs at vertex (15), which corresponds to 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   Let's verify that this solution satisfies both constraints:\n   - Budget:\n     \\[\n     25,000(4) + 80,000(1) = 100,000 + 80,000 = 180,000 \\leq 200,000\n     \\]\n   - Demand:\n     \\[\n     1,200(4) + 2,000(1) = 4,800 + 2,000 = 6,800 \\leq 6,000\n     \\]\n     Wait, this seems to exceed the demand constraint. There might be a mistake here.\n\n   Actually, upon closer inspection, 4,800 + 2,000 equals 6,800, which is greater than 6,000. This violates the demand constraint. Therefore, this solution is not feasible.\n\n   Given this discrepancy, let's re-evaluate the possible solutions provided in the options:\n\n   **Option A: 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2**\n   - Budget: \\( 25,000 \\times 4 + 80,000 \\times 1 = 100,000 + 80,000 = 180,000 \\leq 200,000 \\)\n   - Demand: \\( 1,200 \\times 4 + 2,000 \\times 1 = 4,800 + 2,000 = 6,800 > 6,000 \\)\n     - Infeasible due to demand constraint.\n\n   **Option B: 5 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2**\n   - Budget: \\( 25,000 \\times 5 + 80,000 \\times 0 = 125,000 + 0 = 125,000 \\leq 200,000 \\)\n   - Demand: \\( 1,200 \\times 5 + 2,000 \\times 0 = 6,000 + 0 = 6,000 \\leq 6,000 \\)\n     - Feasible.\n\n   **Option C: 3 boats of Type 1 and 2 boats of Type 2**\n   - Budget: \\( 25,000 \\times 3 + 80,000 \\times 2 = 75,000 + 160,000 = 235,000 > 200,000 \\)\n     - Infeasible due to budget constraint.\n\n   **Option D: 6 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2**\n   - Budget: \\( 25,000 \\times 6 + 80,000 \\times 0 = 150,000 + 0 = 150,000 \\leq 200,000 \\)\n   - Demand: \\( 1,200 \\times 6 + 2,000 \\times 0 = 7,200 + 0 = 7,200 > 6,000 \\)\n     - Infeasible due to demand constraint.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Option B (5 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2) satisfies both constraints. However, according to the initial description, the optimal solution is at vertex (15), which corresponds to 4 boats of Type 1 and 1 boat of Type 2, but this violates the demand constraint.\n\nThere might be an error in the initial description or in the interpretation of the constraints. Given the constraints provided, the only feasible option among the choices is Option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be:\n\nB. 5 boats of Type 1 and 0 boats of Type 2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
