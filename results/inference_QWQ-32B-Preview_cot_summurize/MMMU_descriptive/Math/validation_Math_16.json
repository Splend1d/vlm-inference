This represents the region above the parabola \\(x_2 = x_1^2 - 3\\).\n\n2. \\(x_2 - 1 \\leq 0\\) implies \\(x_2 \\leq 1\\). This is the region below the horizontal line \\(x_2 = 1\\).\n\n3. \\(-x_1 \\leq 0\\) implies \\(x_1 \\geq 0\\). This is the region to the right of the vertical line \\(x_1 = 0\\).\n\nThe feasible region is the intersection of these three areas: above the parabola, below the line \\(x_2 = 1\\), and to the right of \\(x_1 = 0\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the point in this feasible region that is closest to the point (3, 2), since the objective function \\((x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2\\) represents the squared Euclidean distance from \\((x_1, x_2)\\) to (3, 2). Minimizing this distance squared is equivalent to minimizing the distance itself.\n\nLet's consider the possible points where the minimum could occur. These points are either where the gradient of the objective function is zero (the unconstrained minimum), or where the constraints are active (i.e., equalities).\n\nFirst, find the unconstrained minimum:\n\nThe gradient of the objective function is:\n\n\\[\\nabla f = (2(x_1 - 3), 2(x_2 - 2))\\]\n\nSetting this to zero gives \\(x_1 = 3\\) and \\(x_2 = 2\\). However, we need to check if this point satisfies all constraints:\n\n1. \\(3^2 - 2 - 3 = 9 - 2 - 3 = 4 \\leq 0\\)? No, 4 > 0. So, (3, 2) is not in the feasible region.\n\nTherefore, the minimum must occur at the boundary of the feasible region.\n\nLet's consider the active constraints:\n\nThe feasible region is bounded by:\n\n- \\(x_2 = x_1^2 - 3\\) (from \\(x_1^2 - x_2 - 3 = 0\\))\n\n- \\(x_2 = 1\\)\n\n- \\(x_1 = 0\\)\n\nWe need to find the points where these boundaries intersect and check which one gives the smallest objective function value.\n\nFirst, find the intersection points:\n\n1. Intersection of \\(x_2 = x_1^2 - 3\\) and \\(x_2 = 1\\):\n\nSet \\(x_1^2 - 3 = 1\\) \u21d2 \\(x_1^2 = 4\\) \u21d2 \\(x_1 = 2\\) or \\(x_1 = -2\\). But from \\(x_1 \\geq 0\\), we have \\(x_1 = 2\\). So, point is (2, 1).\n\n2. Intersection of \\(x_2 = x_1^2 - 3\\) and \\(x_1 = 0\\):\n\nSet \\(x_1 = 0\\) in \\(x_2 = 0^2 - 3 = -3\\). But \\(x_2 = -3\\) violates \\(x_2 \\leq 1\\), but since \\(x_2 = -3 < 1\\), it is still within the feasible region. So, point is (0, -3).\n\nHowever, we also have the constraint \\(x_2 \\leq 1\\), but \\(x_2 = -3\\) is already less than 1, so it's feasible.\n\nNow, evaluate the objective function at these points:\n\n1. At (2, 1):\n\n\\((2 - 3)^2 + (1 - 2)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n\n2. At (0, -3):\n\n\\((0 - 3)^2 + (-3 - 2)^2 = 9 + 25 = 34\\)\n\nClearly, 2 is smaller than 34, so (2, 1) is a better candidate.\n\nAdditionally, we should check if there are any points on the boundary where the gradient is orthogonal to the constraint, but given the simplicity of the problem, and since the feasible region is convex, the minimum should occur at one of the vertices.\n\nTherefore, the solution is (2, 1), which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D. \\, (2,1)} \\]"
