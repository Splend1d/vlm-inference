                    "text": "I'm going to try to solve this problem about finding the smallest number of attendants needed to supervise all rooms in two different gallery plans using integer programming and the simplex method. The plans are given in Fig. 1, which I don't have, but based on the description, both diagrams (a) and (b) show four rooms arranged in a square grid with doorways connecting adjacent rooms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for an attendant to supervise all rooms. I think that an attendant placed in a doorway can supervise the two rooms connected by that doorway. So, to supervise all rooms, every room must be connected to at least one attendant.\n\nLet me visualize the layout. Since both (a) and (b) have four rooms in a square grid, I can think of them as a 2x2 grid of rooms. Let's label the rooms as follows:\n\n```\n\nRoom 1 --- Room 2\n\n|\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0|\n\nRoom 3 --- Room 4\n\n```\n\nThe doorways are between:\n\n- Room 1 and Room 2\n\n- Room 1 and Room 3\n\n- Room 2 and Room 4\n\n- Room 3 and Room 4\n\nSo, there are four doorways.\n\nNow, I need to decide which of these doorways should have attendants placed in them so that every room is supervised by at least one attendant.\n\nLet's define variables for each doorway:\n\n- Let x1 be 1 if there is an attendant in the doorway between Room 1 and Room 2, else 0.\n\n- Let x2 be 1 if there is an attendant in the doorway between Room 1 and Room 3, else 0.\n\n- Let x3 be 1 if there is an attendant in the doorway between Room 2 and Room 4, else 0.\n\n- Let x4 be 1 if there is an attendant in the doorway between Room 3 and Room 4, else 0.\n\nOur goal is to minimize the total number of attendants, which is x1 + x2 + x3 + x4.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that each room is supervised by at least one attendant.\n\nFor Room 1: it is connected to doorways 1 and 2, so x1 + x2 >= 1.\n\nFor Room 2: connected to doorways 1 and 3, so x1 + x3 >= 1.\n\nFor Room 3: connected to doorways 2 and 4, so x2 + x4 >= 1.\n\nFor Room 4: connected to doorways 3 and 4, so x3 + x4 >= 1.\n\nSo, the integer programming problem is:\n\nMinimize: x1 + x2 + x3 + x4\n\nSubject to:\n\nx1 + x2 >= 1\n\nx1 + x3 >= 1\n\nx2 + x4 >= 1\n\nx3 + x4 >= 1\n\nAnd x1, x2, x3, x4 are binary (0 or 1).\n\nSince it's a small problem, I can try to solve it by inspection or by trying different combinations.\n\nLet's try to minimize the number of attendants.\n\nSuppose we place attendants in doorways 1 and 4.\n\nSo, x1 = 1, x4 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 0.\n\nCheck the constraints:\n\nx1 + x2 = 1 + 0 = 1 >= 1 (Room 1)\n\nx1 + x3 = 1 + 0 = 1 >= 1 (Room 2)\n\nx2 + x4 = 0 + 1 = 1 >= 1 (Room 3)\n\nx3 + x4 = 0 + 1 = 1 >= 1 (Room 4)\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Total attendants: 2.\n\nIs it possible to do with only one attendant?\n\nSuppose x1 = 1, x2 = x3 = x4 = 0.\n\nThen:\n\nx1 + x2 = 1 + 0 = 1 >= 1 (Room 1)\n\nx1 + x3 = 1 + 0 = 1 >= 1 (Room 2)\n\nx2 + x4 = 0 + 0 = 0 < 1 (Room 3) -> violates\n\nSo, not feasible.\n\nAnother try: x2 = 1, x1 = x3 = x4 = 0.\n\nThen:\n\nx1 + x2 = 0 + 1 = 1 >= 1 (Room 1)\n\nx1 + x3 = 0 + 0 = 0 < 1 (Room 2) -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nNext: x3 = 1, x1 = x2 = x4 = 0.\n\nThen:\n\nx1 + x2 = 0 + 0 = 0 < 1 (Room 1) -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nNext: x4 = 1, x1 = x2 = x3 = 0.\n\nThen:\n\nx1 + x2 = 0 + 0 = 0 < 1 (Room 1) -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSo, it's not possible with one attendant. The minimal number is 2.\n\nWait, but the options include (a)1,(b)2 and (a)2,(b)3, etc. So, perhaps the two diagrams are different.\n\nLooking back at the description, both diagrams (a) and (b) are described identically, with four rooms in a square grid connected by doorways between adjacent rooms. So, I would expect the same number of attendants for both.\n\nBut the options suggest different numbers for (a) and (b). Maybe there is a difference in the plans that isn't captured in the description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in one of the plans, the doorways are arranged differently, but according to the description, they are the same.\n\nAssuming they are the same, then the answer should be the same for both, which points to option C: (a)2,(b)2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be a difference.\n\nPerhaps in one plan, the doorways are only between certain rooms, but the description says both have the same layout.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in one plan, diagonal connections exist, but the description only mentions vertical lines, so perhaps in one plan, there are only vertical doorways, and in the other, only horizontal.\n\nIf that's the case, let's consider that.\n\nSuppose in plan (a), there are only vertical doorways, i.e., between Room 1 and Room 3, and between Room 2 and Room 4.\n\nSo, doorways are only between Room 1 and Room 3, and between Room 2 and Room 4.\n\nThen, the variables would be x1 for Room 1-Room 3, and x2 for Room 2-Room 4.\n\nThe constraints would be:\n\nRoom 1: x1 >= 1\n\nRoom 2: x2 >= 1\n\nRoom 3: x1 >= 1\n\nRoom 4: x2 >= 1\n\nSo, x1 >=1 and x2 >=1, meaning we need attendants in both doorways, total of 2.\n\nIn plan (b), if there are both vertical and horizontal doorways, as I initially assumed, then as before, minimal of 2 attendants.\n\nBut according to this, both would require 2 attendants.\n\nAlternatively, if in plan (a), there are only vertical doorways, and in plan (b), there are both vertical and horizontal doorways, then:\n\nFor plan (a):\n\nOnly doorways between Room 1-Room 3 and Room 2-Room 4.\n\nThen, to supervise all rooms, need attendants in both doorways, total 2.\n\nFor plan (b):\n\nDoorways between Room 1-Room 2, Room 1-Room 3, Room 2-Room 4, Room 3-Room 4.\n\nThen, as I earlier found, minimal of 2 attendants.\n\nBut according to the options, it might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps in plan (b), there are additional doorways, making it possible to supervise with fewer attendants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in plan (b), there are more rooms or a different arrangement.\n\nBut according to the description, both have four rooms in a square grid with doorways between adjacent rooms.\n\nPerhaps in plan (b), there are diagonal doorways as well.\n\nIf that's the case, then in plan (b), there are more doorways, potentially allowing for fewer attendants.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSuppose in plan (b), there are doorways not only between adjacent rooms but also between diagonal rooms.\n\nSo, in addition to the four doorways mentioned earlier, there are doorways between Room 1 and Room 4, and between Room 2 and Room 3.\n\nThen, the variables would be:\n\nx1: Room 1-Room 2\n\nx2: Room 1-Room 3\n\nx3: Room 2-Room 4\n\nx4: Room 3-Room 4\n\nx5: Room 1-Room 4\n\nx6: Room 2-Room 3\n\nThe constraints would be:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x2 + x4 + x6 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x3 + x4 + x5 >=1\n\nObjective: minimize x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6\n\nNow, perhaps with these additional doorways, we can supervise all rooms with fewer attendants.\n\nLet's try placing attendants in doorways x5 (Room 1-Room 4) and x6 (Room 2-Room 3).\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 = 0 + 0 + 1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 = 0 + 0 + 1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x2 + x4 + x6 = 0 + 0 + 1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x3 + x4 + x5 = 0 + 0 + 1 =1 >=1\n\nSo, with attendants in x5 and x6, all rooms are supervised, total of 2 attendants.\n\nIs it possible with only one attendant?\n\nSuppose placing an attendant in x5 (Room 1-Room 4).\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =0 +0 +1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 =0 +0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nSo, not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, placing an attendant in x6 (Room 2-Room 3).\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =0 +0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSo, minimal number is 2 for plan (b) as well.\n\nBut according to the options, it might be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in plan (b), with diagonal doorways, it's possible to supervise with fewer attendants.\n\nWait, perhaps if we place attendants in x5 (Room 1-Room 4) and x2 (Room 1-Room 3).\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =0 +1 +1 =2 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 =0 +0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternatively, placing attendants in x5 and x3.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =0 +0 +1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 =0 +1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x2 + x4 + x6 =0 +0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nAlternatively, placing attendants in x5 and x4.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =0 +0 +1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 =0 +0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSeems like the only combination that works with two attendants is x5 and x6.\n\nWait, what if we place attendants in x1 and x4?\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =1 +0 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 =1 +0 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x2 + x4 + x6 =0 +1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x3 + x4 + x5 =0 +1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nSo, that also works with two attendants.\n\nAlternatively, placing attendants in x2 and x3.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x2 + x5 =0 +1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x1 + x3 + x6 =0 +1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x2 + x4 + x6 =1 +0 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x3 + x4 + x5 =1 +0 +0 =1 >=1\n\nAgain, works with two attendants.\n\nSo, in plan (b), with additional diagonal doorways, it's still requiring at least two attendants.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to do it with one attendant if the diagonal doorways connect in a certain way.\n\nSuppose we place an attendant in a doorway that connects Room 1 to Room 4 and Room 2 to Room 3 simultaneously.\n\nBut in the model, each doorway connects only two rooms, so even if it's a diagonal, it still only supervises two rooms.\n\nTherefore, to cover all four rooms, we still need at least two attendants.\n\nThus, for both plans, the minimal number of attendants is 2.\n\nBut according to the options, there are choices where one plan requires 1 attendant and the other requires 2 or 3.\n\nPerhaps in plan (a), there are only vertical doorways, and in plan (b), there are both vertical and horizontal doorways.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nPlan (a):\n\nOnly vertical doorways: between Room 1 and Room 3, and between Room 2 and Room 4.\n\nSo, variables x1 (Room 1-Room 3) and x2 (Room 2-Room 4).\n\nConstraints:\n\nRoom 1: x1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x2 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x1 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x2 >=1\n\nSo, need x1 >=1 and x2 >=1, meaning at least two attendants.\n\nPlan (b):\n\nBoth vertical and horizontal doorways: x1 (Room 1-Room 3), x2 (Room 2-Room 4), x3 (Room 1-Room 2), x4 (Room 3-Room 4).\n\nConstraints:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x3 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x2 + x3 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x1 + x4 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x2 + x4 >=1\n\nNow, can we cover all rooms with fewer attendants?\n\nSuppose place attendants in x1 and x2.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x3 =1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x2 + x3 =1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x1 + x4 =1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 4: x2 + x4 =1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nWorks with two attendants.\n\nCan we do with one?\n\nSuppose place attendant in x1.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x3 =1 +0 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x2 + x3 =0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSuppose place attendant in x2.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x3 =0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSuppose place attendant in x3.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x3 =0 +1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 2: x2 + x3 =0 +1 =1 >=1\n\nRoom 3: x1 + x4 =0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSuppose place attendant in x4.\n\nThen:\n\nRoom 1: x1 + x3 =0 +0 =0 <1 -> violates\n\nNot feasible.\n\nSo, in plan (b), still need at least two attendants.\n\nTherefore, for both plans, the minimal number is 2 attendants.\n\nBut according to the options, there's a possibility of 1 attendant for plan (a) or plan (b).\n\nPerhaps in plan (a), there are only vertical doorways, requiring 2 attendants, and in plan (b), there are vertical and horizontal doorways, still requiring 2 attendants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in plan (b), there is a different arrangement that allows for fewer attendants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plans are different in a way not described in the text.\n\nGiven the information provided, I would go with option C: (a)2,(b)2.\n\nBut since the description says both plans are the same, and option C is (a)2,(b)2, that should be the answer.\n\nHowever, to confirm, let's consider if there's any misinterpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps \"adjacent\" in plan (a) means only vertically adjacent, and in plan (b), both vertically and horizontally adjacent.\n\nIf that's the case, then plan (a) has only two doorways (vertical), requiring two attendants, and plan (b) has four doorways (vertical and horizontal), still requiring two attendants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in plan (b), with more doorways, there's a way to cover all rooms with fewer attendants, but as shown earlier, still needing two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the plans are different in the number of rooms or connections.\n\nGiven the description, both plans have four rooms in a square grid with doorways between adjacent rooms, and the difference might be in the connectivity.\n\nBut without the actual figures, it's hard to be certain.\n\nGiven that, and based on the options, I think the answer is C: (a)2,(b)2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
