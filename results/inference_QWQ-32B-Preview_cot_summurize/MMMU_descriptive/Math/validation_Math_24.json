                    "text": "To find the dimensions of the right circular cylinder of maximum volume that can be inscribed in a right circular cone of radius \\( R \\) and height \\( H \\), we need to express the volume of the cylinder in terms of its radius \\( r \\) and height \\( h \\), and then maximize this volume with respect to \\( r \\).\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the dimensions of the cylinder and the cone. Since the cylinder is inscribed in the cone, its top face is parallel to the base of the cone and touches the lateral surface of the cone. This means that the cylinder's height \\( h \\) and radius \\( r \\) are related to the dimensions of the cone.\n\nConsider a vertical cross-section of the cone and cylinder. This cross-section will show an isosceles triangle (the cone) with a rectangle (the cylinder) inscribed in it. The base of the triangle has length \\( 2R \\), and the height of the triangle is \\( H \\). The rectangle has width \\( 2r \\) and height \\( h \\).\n\nBy similar triangles, we can relate the dimensions of the cylinder to those of the cone. Specifically, the small triangle above the cylinder (from the apex of the cone to the top face of the cylinder) is similar to the entire cone. The height of this small triangle is \\( H - h \\), and its base is \\( 2(R - r) \\) because the cylinder's top face reduces the base by \\( 2r \\) on each side.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the height to the base of the small triangle is equal to the ratio of the height to the base of the entire cone:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{H - h}{2(R - r)} = \\frac{H}{2R}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{H - h}{R - r} = \\frac{H}{R}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\nR(H - h) = H(R - r)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\nRH - Rh = HR - Hr\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n- Rh = - Hr\n\\]\n\n\\[\nRh = Hr\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = H \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, the volume \\( V \\) of the cylinder is given by:\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 h\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expression for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 \\left(H \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi r^2 H \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi H r^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nV = \\pi H r^2 - \\pi H \\frac{r^3}{R}\n\\]\n\nTo find the maximum volume, we take the derivative of \\( V \\) with respect to \\( r \\) and set it to zero:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dV}{dr} = 2 \\pi H r - 3 \\pi H \\frac{r^2}{R} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2 \\pi H r - \\frac{3 \\pi H r^2}{R} = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\pi H r \\left(2 - \\frac{3 r}{R}\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n1. \\( r = 0 \\) (which is trivial and not useful)\n\n2. \\( 2 - \\frac{3 r}{R} = 0 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{3 r}{R}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{2 R}{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the radius of the cylinder that maximizes the volume is \\( r = \\frac{2 R}{3} \\).\n\nTo confirm that this is a maximum, we can check the second derivative of \\( V \\) with respect to \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 V}{dr^2} = 2 \\pi H - 6 \\pi H \\frac{r}{R}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = \\frac{2 R}{3} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d^2 V}{dr^2} = 2 \\pi H - 6 \\pi H \\frac{\\frac{2 R}{3}}{R} = 2 \\pi H - 6 \\pi H \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 2 \\pi H - 4 \\pi H = -2 \\pi H\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\frac{d^2 V}{dr^2} = -2 \\pi H < 0 \\) (assuming \\( H > 0 \\)), this confirms that \\( r = \\frac{2 R}{3} \\) gives a maximum volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. \\( r = \\frac{2R}{3} \\)\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
