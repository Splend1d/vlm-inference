The dimensions of the block are given as 400 mm in length and 200 mm in height. A horizontal force \\( P \\) of 2 kN is applied to the top plate, causing it to displace 2 mm horizontally. The width of the block is specified as 100 mm. The task is to determine the shear modulus of the polymer, assuming it is linearly elastic and using small angle analysis.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nAn acetal polymer block is fixed to the rigid plates at its top and bottom surfaces. If the top plate displaces 2 mm horizontally when it is subjected to a horizontal force P=2 kN, determine the shear modulus of the polymer. The width of the block is 100 mm.

The shear modulus \\( G \\) is defined as the ratio of shear stress \\( \\tau \\) to shear strain \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ G = \\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma} \\]\n\nFirst, we need to find the shear stress \\( \\tau \\) and the shear strain \\( \\gamma \\).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the shear stress \\( \\tau \\).**\n\nShear stress is defined as the force applied divided by the area over which the force is applied.
