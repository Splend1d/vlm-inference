                    "text": "To determine the average normal stresses acting over the shaded section oriented at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal in a bar subjected to an axial load \\(P\\), we need to consider the principles of stress transformation in mechanics of materials.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information:\n\n- The bar has a cross-sectional area \\(A\\).\n\n- It is subjected to an axial load \\(P\\) at both ends.\n\n- We need to find the average normal stress over a shaded section oriented at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal.\n\nIn the initial state, the bar is under pure axial loading, which means the stress in the horizontal direction (let's say the x-direction) is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_x = \\frac{P}{A}\\]\n\nSince the loading is axial and there are no other loads mentioned, the stress in the vertical direction (y-direction) is zero:\n\n\\[\\sigma_y = 0\\]\n\nAlso, because there are no shear loads mentioned, the shear stress is zero:\n\n\\[\\tau_{xy} = 0\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the normal stress \\(\\sigma_\\theta\\) on a plane inclined at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal axis.\n\nThe formula for normal stress on an inclined plane at an angle \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\sigma_x \\cos^2 \\theta + \\sigma_y \\sin^2 \\theta - 2 \\tau_{xy} \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\left( \\frac{P}{A} \\right) \\cos^2 \\theta + (0) \\sin^2 \\theta - 2 (0) \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\]\n\nHowever, this seems to be missing the contribution from the other terms. Let's double-check the stress transformation formula.\n\nActually, the general formula for normal stress on an inclined plane is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y}{2} + \\frac{\\sigma_x - \\sigma_y}{2} \\cos 2\\theta + \\tau_{xy} \\sin 2\\theta\\]\n\nGiven that \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{\\frac{P}{A} + 0}{2} + \\frac{\\frac{P}{A} - 0}{2} \\cos 2\\theta + 0 \\cdot \\sin 2\\theta\\]\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{2A} + \\frac{P}{2A} \\cos 2\\theta\\]\n\nWe can factor out \\(\\frac{P}{2A}\\):\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{2A} (1 + \\cos 2\\theta)\\]\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity:\n\n\\[1 + \\cos 2\\theta = 2 \\cos^2 \\theta\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{2A} \\cdot 2 \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\]\n\nWait a minute, this matches our earlier result. But let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the area of the inclined plane. The area of the inclined section is not \\(A\\), but \\(A / \\cos \\theta\\), because the inclined area is larger than the horizontal cross-section.\n\nThe force remains \\(P\\), so the stress on the inclined plane would be:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A / \\cos \\theta} = \\frac{P \\cos \\theta}{A}\\]\n\nBut this seems different from our previous result. There must be a mistake here.\n\nActually, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the component of stress perpendicular to the inclined plane. The correct method is to use stress transformation equations, which we did earlier.\n\nLet's consider another approach using equilibrium.\n\nImagine cutting the bar at the inclined plane and considering the equilibrium of one of the parts.\n\nThe forces acting on the inclined plane are:\n\n- The normal stress \\(\\sigma_\\theta\\) times the area \\(A / \\cos \\theta\\)\n\n- The shear stress \\(\\tau_\\theta\\) times the area \\(A / \\cos \\theta\\)\n\nHowever, since there is no shear stress in the original configuration, and we are only interested in normal stress, we can focus on the normal component.\n\nBut this seems to be getting complicated. Let's stick to the stress transformation formula.\n\nGiven that \\(\\sigma_x = P / A\\), \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\), and \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\), the normal stress on the inclined plane is:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\]\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them match this exactly. Let's see if we can express this differently.\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2} = \\frac{P}{2A} (1 + \\cos 2\\theta)\\]\n\nThis matches option B: \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\), because:\n\n\\[\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\]\n\nWait, that's not matching. Let's check:\n\nOption B is \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\), which is different from \\(\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\).\n\nSo there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in the stress transformation formula.\n\nLet me refer to a standard mechanics of materials textbook.\n\nAccording to standard stress transformation equations for plane stress:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\sigma_x \\cos^2 \\theta + \\sigma_y \\sin^2 \\theta + 2 \\tau_{xy} \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\) and \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\):\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\sigma_x \\cos^2 \\theta + 0 \\cdot \\sin^2 \\theta + 0 = \\sigma_x \\cos^2 \\theta\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\).\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options directly. Let's see if we can manipulate this expression to match one of the options.\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} (1 - \\sin^2 \\theta) = \\frac{P}{A} - \\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\]\n\nThis still doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the direction of the load and the orientation of the shaded section.\n\nThe load \\(P\\) is applied axially, in the horizontal direction. The shaded section is at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the component of the load normal to the inclined plane.\n\nThe normal component of the load on the inclined plane would be \\(P \\cos \\theta\\), and the area of the inclined plane is \\(A / \\cos \\theta\\).\n\nTherefore, the normal stress would be:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P \\cos \\theta}{A / \\cos \\theta} = \\frac{P \\cos^2 \\theta}{A}\\]\n\nThis matches our earlier result.\n\nBut again, this doesn't directly match any of the given options.\n\nLet's look at the options again:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin(2\\theta)\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{P}{2A} \\sin(2\\theta)\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{P}{2A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\)\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different way to express \\(\\cos^2 \\theta\\).\n\nWe know that:\n\n\\[\\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2} = \\frac{P}{2A} (1 + \\cos 2\\theta)\\]\n\nIs there a way to relate this to the given options?\n\nOption C is \\(\\frac{P}{2A} \\sin(2\\theta)\\), which is different.\n\nOption B is \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\), and \\(\\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\cos 2\\theta}{2} = \\frac{P}{2A} (1 - \\cos 2\\theta)\\), which is different from our expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the stress could be expressed in terms of \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\).\n\nLet's see:\n\nWe have \\(\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\).\n\nWe can write \\(\\cos^2 \\theta\\) as \\(\\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2}\\), which is \\(\\frac{1}{2} (1 + \\cos 2\\theta)\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\cos 2\\theta}{2} = \\frac{P}{2A} + \\frac{P}{2A} \\cos 2\\theta\\]\n\nIs there a way to express this in terms of \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\)?\n\nWell, \\(\\cos 2\\theta = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\theta\\), but that doesn't seem helpful immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nLet me consider the method of resolving the stress components.\n\nIn the x-direction, \\(\\sigma_x = \\frac{P}{A}\\).\n\nIn the y-direction, \\(\\sigma_y = 0\\).\n\nShear stress \\(\\tau_{xy} = 0\\).\n\nNow, for a section inclined at \\(\\theta\\), the normal stress \\(\\sigma_\\theta\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\sigma_x \\cos^2 \\theta + \\sigma_y \\sin^2 \\theta + 2 \\tau_{xy} \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta + 0 \\cdot \\sin^2 \\theta + 0 = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\]\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nNow, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nMaybe the question is asking for the normal stress in a different context or perhaps considering a different orientation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the options provided.\n\nGiven that, I would conclude that the correct expression is \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\), which doesn't directly match any of the options.\n\nHowever, since \\(\\cos^2 \\theta = 1 - \\sin^2 \\theta\\), we can write:\n\n\\[\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} (1 - \\sin^2 \\theta) = \\frac{P}{A} - \\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\]\n\nBut this still doesn't match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the load P is not purely axial or there are other loads involved.\n\nLooking back at the description:\n\n\"The bar has a cross-sectional area A and is subjected to the axial load P. Determine the average normal stresses acting over the shaded section, which is oriented at \u03b8 from the horizontal.\"\n\nIt seems straightforward: axial load P, cross-sectional area A, find normal stress on an inclined plane at angle \u03b8.\n\nGiven that, the correct expression should be \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\), but this doesn't match any of the provided options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled or there's a typo.\n\nGiven the standard stress transformation formula, I'm confident that \\(\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\) is correct.\n\nTherefore, based on the standard mechanics of materials principles, the correct answer should be \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\), which isn't listed among the options.\n\nHowever, since the question provides specific options, perhaps there's a different interpretation needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering both ends loaded, but in any case, the stress should still be \\(\\frac{P}{A}\\) in the axial direction.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options provided:\n\nA. \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin(2\\theta)\\)\n\nB. \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\)\n\nC. \\(\\frac{P}{2A} \\sin(2\\theta)\\)\n\nD. \\(\\frac{P}{2A} \\sin^2 \\theta\\)\n\nNone of these directly match the expected \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach considering equilibrium or considering the area change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nGiven that, and considering the standard stress transformation equations, I would conclude that the correct expression is \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\), which doesn't match any of the provided options.\n\nTherefore, based on standard mechanics of materials principles, the answer should be \\(\\frac{P}{A} \\cos^2 \\theta\\), but since this isn't among the options, there might be an error in the options provided or in the problem statement.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{P}{A} \\cos^{2} \\theta} \\]"
