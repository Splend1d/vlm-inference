One force is pulling to the left, and the other is pushing to the right. There is a section labeled \"a-a\" passing through point A, inclined at 30 degrees from the vertical.\n\nTo determine the resultant internal normal force (Na) and shear force (Va) at section a-a, we need to consider the equilibrium of forces acting on the block.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup:\n\n- The block has two horizontal forces: 500 lb to the left and 500 lb to the right, applied along the centroidal axis.\n\n- Section a-a is inclined at 30 degrees from the vertical, passing through point A.\n\nSince the forces are equal and opposite, the net external force is zero, indicating that the block is in equilibrium.\n\nNow, to find the internal forces at section a-a, we need to consider the forces acting on one part of the block when cut at section a-a.\n\nLet's consider the part of the block to the left of section a-a.\n\n Forces acting on this part:\n\n1. The 500 lb force pulling to the left.\n\n2. The internal forces at section a-a, which include the normal force (Na) and the shear force (Va).\n\nSince the block is in equilibrium, the sum of forces in any direction must be zero.\n\nGiven that section a-a is inclined at 30 degrees from the vertical, we need to resolve the internal forces into components parallel and perpendicular to the section.\n\nHowever, in the options provided, Na and Va are given directly, so perhaps we can consider the forces directly without resolving into components.\n\nLet's consider the sum of forces in the direction perpendicular to section a-a (normal force):\n\n- The external force is 500 lb to the left.\n\n- The internal normal force Na acts perpendicular to the section a-a.\n\nSimilarly, the sum of forces parallel to section a-a (shear force):\n\n- There might be a shear force Va acting parallel to the section.\n\nBut given that the forces are applied along the centroidal axis and are equal and opposite, and considering the symmetry, the shear force might be zero.\n\nLet's check the options:\n\nA. Na=500 lb, Va=250 lb\n\nB. Na=600 lb, Va=0\n\nC. Na=500 lb, Va=0\n\nD. Na=550 lb, Va=0\n\nGiven that the external force is 500 lb, and considering that the internal normal force should balance this force, option C seems plausible.\n\nHowever, let's verify:\n\nIf Na = 500 lb and Va = 0, then the internal forces would balance the external 500 lb force.\n\nAlternatively, if there were a shear force, it would need to be balanced by another force, but given the symmetry and the fact that the forces are applied along the centroidal axis, it's likely that the shear force is zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably C. Na=500 lb, Va=0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
