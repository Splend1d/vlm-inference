It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the area calculation.\n\nGiven:\n- Outer radius (\\(r_o\\)) = \\( \\frac{100}{2} = 50 \\) mm\n- Inner radius (\\(r_i\\)) = \\( \\frac{80}{2} = 40 \\) mm\n\nArea of the annulus:\n\\[\nA = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = \\pi (50^2 - 40^2) = \\pi (2500 - 1600) = \\pi \\times 900 \\approx 2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2\n\\]\n\nConverting to m\u00b2:\n\\[\nA = 2827.43 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.00282743 \\text{ m}^2\n\\]\n\nForce:\n\\[\nF = 300 \\text{ kN} = 300 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N} = 300,000 \\text{ N}\n\\]\n\nStress:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{300,000 \\text{ N}}{0.00282743 \\text{ m}^2} \\approx 106,103,295 \\text{ Pa} = 106.103 \\text{ MPa}\n\\]\n\nThis still doesn't match the options provided. Maybe I need to consider the units differently or check if there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stress is being calculated per unit length of the cylinder, assuming it's a long cylinder under axial load.\n\nLet's try calculating the stress in MPa using consistent units.\n\nFirst, keep everything in millimeters and calculate stress in MPa directly.\n\nGiven:\n- Force \\( F = 300 \\text{ kN} = 300,000 \\text{ N} \\)\n- Area \\( A = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = \\pi (50^2 - 40^2) = \\pi \\times 900 \\approx 2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2 \\)\n\nStress in MPa:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} = \\frac{300,000 \\text{ N}}{2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2} = \\frac{300,000}{2827.43} \\approx 106.1 \\text{ MPa}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this doesn't match the provided options. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the cylinder is under distributed loading, or maybe it's a different type of stress. Let's look back at the problem.\n\nThe problem says: \"Determine the average normal stress developed on the cross section. Sketch the normal stress distribution over the cross section.\"\n\nGiven that it's a cylindrical object with a hollow center, and a vertical downward force is applied at the top center, it seems like it's under axial loading.\n\nFor axial loading, the normal stress should be uniformly distributed over the cross-section, and the average normal stress is simply the force divided by the area, as calculated above.\n\nHowever, the options are around 26-29 MPa, while my calculation gives around 106 MPa. There must be something wrong here.\n\nLet me consider if the area needs to be calculated differently. Maybe the hollow part is not considered correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-sectional area is not the area of the ring but something else. But for a cylinder under axial load, it should be the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the load.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about hoop stress or something else, but the description says \"average normal stress developed on the cross section,\" which for axial loading is the axial stress.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the units. Let's try keeping everything in meters.\n\nOuter radius: \\( r_o = 50 \\text{ mm} = 0.05 \\text{ m} \\)\nInner radius: \\( r_i = 40 \\text{ mm} = 0.04 \\text{ m} \\)\n\nArea:\n\\[\nA = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = \\pi (0.05^2 - 0.04^2) = \\pi (0.0025 - 0.0016) = \\pi \\times 0.0009 \\approx 0.002827 \\text{ m}^2\n\\]\n\nForce: \\( F = 300 \\text{ kN} = 300,000 \\text{ N} \\)\n\nStress:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{300,000 \\text{ N}}{0.002827 \\text{ m}^2} \\approx 106,103,295 \\text{ Pa} = 106.103 \\text{ MPa}\n\\]\n\nStill the same result. It seems consistent, but not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided. Alternatively, maybe the sketch shows something different that I'm not considering.\n\nWait, maybe the force is distributed over the area, but the description says \"a force of 300 kN is applied vertically downward at the top center of the cylinder.\" This sounds like a point load at the center, which for a homogeneous material under axial loading should result in uniform stress over the cross-section.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cylinder is thin-walled, and we need to use a different formula for stress in that case. But with inner and outer diameters given, it doesn't seem thin-walled.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem is about compressive stress, and there's a misunderstanding in the sign convention, but the magnitude should be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the units of the force. Maybe it's 300 N, not 300 kN. Let's try that.\n\nForce: \\( F = 300 \\text{ N} \\)\n\nStress:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{300 \\text{ N}}{0.002827 \\text{ m}^2} \\approx 106,000 \\text{ Pa} = 0.106 \\text{ MPa}\n\\]\n\nThis is way below the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the diameter is in meters, not millimeters. Let's assume outer diameter is 100 m and inner diameter is 80 m, but that seems unrealistic for the force given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the area calculation. Let's recalculate the area.\n\nArea:\n\\[\nA = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = \\pi (50^2 - 40^2) = \\pi (2500 - 1600) = \\pi \\times 900 \\approx 2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the stress per unit length, assuming the cylinder is long.\n\nLet's assume the cylinder has a unit length of 1 meter, and calculate stress per unit length.\n\nBut stress is force per unit area, and area already includes the cross-sectional area.\n\nI'm confused. Maybe I need to consider the volume or something else, but that doesn't make sense for stress calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about bending stress, not axial stress. If the force is applied at the top center, maybe it's causing bending.\n\nLet me think about that. If the cylinder is fixed at the bottom and a force is applied at the top center, it could experience bending moment.\n\nIn that case, the normal stress due to bending is given by:\n\\[\n\\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I}\n\\]\nwhere \\( M \\) is the bending moment, \\( y \\) is the distance from the neutral axis, and \\( I \\) is the moment of inertia.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the average normal stress developed on the cross-section, which for axial loading is uniform, but for bending, it varies linearly across the section.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the axial stress, but maybe there's a mistake in the area calculation.\n\nLet me try calculating the area again.\n\nArea of the annulus:\n\\[\nA = \\pi (r_o^2 - r_i^2) = \\pi (50^2 - 40^2) = \\pi (2500 - 1600) = \\pi \\times 900 \\approx 2827.43 \\text{ mm}^2\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area should be calculated using the average radius or something, but that doesn't seem correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about hoop stress or something else, but the description suggests it's about normal stress due to axial loading.\n\nGiven that, and the consistent calculation resulting in approximately 106 MPa, which doesn't match any of the provided options, I'm concluding that there might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nHowever, to proceed with the answer based on the calculation, the average normal stress is approximately 106.1 MPa, which is not among the choices A. 26.53 MPa, B. 27.53 MPa, C. 28.53 MPa, D. 29.53 MPa.\n\nTherefore, none of the above options seem correct based on the given information and standard stress calculation for axial loading.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{106.1 \\text{ MPa}} \\]\n\n**Sketch of Normal Stress Distribution:**\n\nFor axial loading, the normal stress is uniformly distributed over the cross-section. Therefore, the sketch would show a constant stress value across the entire cross-sectional area, except for the hollow core where the stress is zero.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThe calculated stress does not match the provided options, suggesting a possible error in the problem statement or the options. The correct average normal stress is approximately 106.1 MPa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{106.1 \\text{ MPa}} \\]"
