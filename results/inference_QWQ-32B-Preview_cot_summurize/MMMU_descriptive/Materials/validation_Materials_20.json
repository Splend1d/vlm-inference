The original shape is shown with solid lines, while the deformed shape is indicated by dashed lines. The deformation causes the top right corner (point C) to move outward by 3 mm along the y-axis and the bottom right corner (point B) to move inward by 2 mm along the x-axis. The deformation results in a slight skewing of the rectangle, with the top edge (CD) becoming longer and the bottom edge (AB) becoming shorter. The goal is to determine the average normal strain along the side AD.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe piece of rubber is originally rectangular and subjected to the deformation shown by the dashed lines.

                    "text": "To determine the average normal strain along the side AD of the rubber piece, we need to calculate the change in length of AD divided by its original length. The original length of AD is given as 400 mm. From the description, the deformation causes point C to move outward by 3 mm along the y-axis and point B to move inward by 2 mm along the x-axis. However, since AD is a vertical side, we need to focus on the vertical displacement of points A and D to find the change in length of AD.\n\nGiven that the deformation is such that the top right corner (point C) moves outward by 3 mm along the y-axis, and the bottom right corner (point B) moves inward by 2 mm along the x-axis, we can infer that the vertical displacement of point D (the top left corner) might also be affected. However, the description does not specify the displacement of point D directly. For the purpose of calculating the average normal strain along AD, we can assume that point A remains fixed (as is common in such problems if not specified otherwise), and point D has a vertical displacement due to the deformation.\n\nSince point C moves outward by 3 mm along the y-axis, and assuming that the deformation is uniform along the height, the vertical displacement at point D would be proportional to its position. However, without specific information about the displacement of point D, we can consider that the entire side AD undergoes a uniform strain.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that only point C moves outward by 3 mm along the y-axis, and point B moves inward by 2 mm along the x-axis, but points A and D remain fixed, then there is no change in the length of AD, and the strain would be zero. But this seems unlikely given the options provided.\n\nGiven that the options suggest non-zero strain values, let's assume that there is a vertical displacement at point D due to the deformation.\n\nLet's denote the vertical displacement at point D as \u03b4. Then, the new position of point D would be at (0, 400 + \u03b4).\n\nThe original length of AD is 400 mm. The new length of AD, considering the displacement \u03b4, would be:\n\nAD' = sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (400 + \u03b4 - 0)^2) = 400 + \u03b4 mm\n\nThe change in length \u0394L = AD' - AD = (400 + \u03b4) - 400 = \u03b4 mm\n\nTherefore, the average normal strain \u03b5 along AD is:\n\n\u03b5 = \u0394L / L = \u03b4 / 400 mm/mm\n\nNow, we need to find the value of \u03b4 based on the given deformations.\n\nSince point C moves outward by 3 mm along the y-axis, and point B moves inward by 2 mm along the x-axis, we can consider the deformation gradient or use geometric relations to find \u03b4.\n\nAssuming small deformations, we can approximate the displacement field. Let's assume that the displacement in the y-direction varies linearly along the height of the rectangle.\n\nLet's denote the displacement at point C as u_C = 0 mm (since it's only moving outward along y), v_C = 3 mm\n\nDisplacement at point B: u_B = -2 mm, v_B = 0 mm\n\nDisplacement at point A: u_A = 0 mm, v_A = 0 mm (assuming fixed)\n\nDisplacement at point D: u_D = 0 mm, v_D = \u03b4 mm\n\nSince the displacement in the x-direction is zero at points A and D, and -2 mm at point B, we can assume that the x-displacement varies linearly along the bottom edge AB.\n\nSimilarly, the y-displacement varies from 0 mm at A to 3 mm at C along the top edge.\n\nHowever, to find \u03b4, we need to consider the deformation compatibility or use strain definitions.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about determining the average normal strain along AD, and AD is vertical, we can focus on the vertical strain.\n\nThe vertical strain \u03b5_y can be approximated as the change in vertical dimension divided by the original vertical dimension.\n\nGiven that point C moves upward by 3 mm, and assuming the deformation is uniform along the height, the average vertical strain would be:\n\n\u03b5_y = (\u0394h) / h = (3 mm) / 400 mm = 0.0075 mm/mm\n\nHowever, this seems too straightforward, and the options provided do not match this value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the strain is not uniform, and we need to consider the skewing of the rectangle.\n\nLet's consider the geometry after deformation.\n\nOriginal coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (300,0)\n\nC: (300,400)\n\nD: (0,400)\n\nAfter deformation:\n\nA: (0,0) (assuming fixed)\n\nB: (300 - 2, 0) = (298, 0)\n\nC: (300, 400 + 3) = (300, 403)\n\nD: (0, 400 + \u03b4) = (0, 400 + \u03b4)\n\nNow, to maintain compatibility, the deformation should satisfy certain conditions. Assuming small strains, we can use the strain-displacement relations.\n\nThe vertical strain along AD is given by the partial derivative of the vertical displacement with respect to the vertical coordinate.\n\nBut since we are dealing with average strain, we can use the change in length over the original length.\n\nFrom the coordinates, the new length of AD is:\n\nAD' = sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (400 + \u03b4 - 0)^2) = 400 + \u03b4 mm\n\nTherefore, average normal strain \u03b5 = (AD' - AD) / AD = \u03b4 / 400 mm/mm\n\nNow, to find \u03b4, we need to consider the deformation of the entire element.\n\nLet's consider the displacement field.\n\nAssuming a linear variation of displacement along the height, we can write the vertical displacement v as a function of y.\n\nGiven that at y=0, v=0 (point A)\n\nAt y=400 mm, v=\u03b4 (point D)\n\nAt y=400 mm, v=3 mm (point C)\n\nWait, point C is at (300,400), and its displacement is v=3 mm.\n\nPoint D is at (0,400), and its displacement is v=\u03b4 mm.\n\nSince the displacement in the y-direction may vary linearly along the x-direction as well, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the vertical displacement at D is proportional to the displacement at C.\n\nIf the deformation is such that only point C moves upward by 3 mm, and point B moves leftward by 2 mm, while points A and D remain fixed, then the vertical displacement at D is zero, and thus \u03b4=0.\n\nBut this would imply that the average normal strain along AD is zero, which contradicts the provided options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the displacement at D is not zero, and we need to consider the overall deformation.\n\nLet's consider the deformation gradient.\n\nThe deformation gradient tensor F can be related to the partial derivatives of the displacement components.\n\nHowever, this might be too involved for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the change in length of AD based on the movement of points B and C.\n\nGiven that point B moves inward by 2 mm along x, and point C moves outward by 3 mm along y, we can consider the resulting change in the position of point D.\n\nIf point B moves inward by 2 mm, the bottom edge AB becomes shorter by 2 mm.\n\nSimilarly, the top edge CD becomes longer due to the movement of point C.\n\nHowever, since AD is vertical, its length change would be directly related to the vertical displacement of point D.\n\nGiven that point C moves upward by 3 mm, and assuming that the vertical displacement varies linearly along the x-direction, we can estimate the displacement at point D.\n\nIf point C at x=300 mm has v=3 mm, and point A at x=0 mm has v=0 mm, then the vertical displacement at any point x along the top edge can be expressed as:\n\nv(x) = (3 mm / 300 mm) * x = 0.01 mm/mm * x\n\nTherefore, at point D, x=0, so v_D = 0 mm.\n\nThis suggests that point D does not move vertically, and thus \u03b4=0 mm.\n\nThis would imply that the average normal strain along AD is zero, which again contradicts the provided options.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in this assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the displacement at point D is not zero, and we need to consider the overall deformation of the rectangle.\n\nLet's consider the coordinates after deformation:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (298,0)\n\nC: (300,403)\n\nD: (0,400 + \u03b4)\n\nTo maintain the connectivity of the sides, the displacement at D must be such that the side CD connects C and D.\n\nGiven the coordinates, the length of CD after deformation is:\n\nCD' = sqrt((300 - 0)^2 + (403 - (400 + \u03b4))^2) = sqrt(300^2 + (3 - \u03b4)^2)\n\nSimilarly, the length of AB is now 298 mm, and the length of AD is 400 + \u03b4 mm.\n\nThe average normal strain along AD is \u03b5_AD = \u03b4 / 400 mm/mm\n\nNow, to find \u03b4, we need another equation or condition.\n\nOne possible condition is that the angle between AD and AB changes due to the deformation.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that the deformation is such that the side CD becomes longer, and relate that to the displacement \u03b4.\n\nHowever, without additional information, it's challenging to determine \u03b4 directly.\n\nGiven the options provided, let's consider the possible values for \u03b5_AD.\n\nOption A: 0.00680 mm/mm\n\nOption B: -0.00680 mm/mm\n\nOption C: -0.0281*10^(-3) mm/mm = -0.0000281 mm/mm\n\nOption D: 0.0281*10^(-3) mm/mm = 0.0000281 mm/mm\n\nGiven that the rubber is deformed with point C moving upward and point B moving inward, it's likely that the side AD is being stretched, resulting in positive strain.\n\nTherefore, options A and D are possible, while options B and C represent compressive strain, which may not be the case here.\n\nLet's attempt to calculate \u03b5_AD more accurately.\n\nAssuming that the deformation is such that the side AB shortens by 2 mm and the side BC deforms with point C moving upward by 3 mm, we can consider the resulting strain in AD.\n\nIf AB shortens by 2 mm, its new length is 298 mm.\n\nThe original area is 400 mm * 300 mm = 120,000 mm\u00b2\n\nThe new area would be approximately (400 + \u03b4) mm * 298 mm = (400 + \u03b4)*298 mm\u00b2\n\nHowever, without knowing the Poisson's ratio or the relationship between strains in different directions, it's difficult to relate the strains directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the strain in the x-direction and y-direction separately.\n\nThe strain in the x-direction along AB is:\n\n\u03b5_x = (\u0394L_x) / L_x = (-2 mm) / 300 mm = -0.00667 mm/mm\n\nSimilarly, the strain along CD would be:\n\n\u03b5_x' = (\u0394L_x') / L_x' = (0 mm) / 300 mm = 0 mm/mm (since no horizontal displacement is specified for C or D)\n\nHowever, this approach seems inconsistent because CD might experience some horizontal strain due to the vertical displacement of C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the vertical strain along AD.\n\nGiven that point C moves upward by 3 mm, and assuming that the vertical displacement at D is zero, the average vertical strain along AD would be:\n\n\u03b5_y = (\u03b4) / 400 mm/mm = 0 / 400 = 0 mm/mm\n\nBut this contradicts the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical strain is not zero, and we need to consider the deformation gradient or other factors.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the lack of specific information about the displacement at D, it's challenging to determine the exact value of \u03b4.\n\nHowever, given the options, the closest value to our earlier calculation of \u03b5_y = 0.0075 mm/mm is option A: 0.00680 mm/mm.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A. 0.00680 mm/mm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.00680\\ \\text{mm/mm}} \\]"
