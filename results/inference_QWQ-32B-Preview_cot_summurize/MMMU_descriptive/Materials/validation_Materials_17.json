The arm is extended with the elbow joint visible, showing various anatomical structures and forces acting on them. Key elements include:\n\n1. **Humerus (H)**: The upper arm bone.\n2. **Radius (C)** and **Ulna (A)**: The two bones of the forearm.\n3. **Ligament at B**: A connective tissue connecting the bones near the elbow.\n4. **Forces**:\n   - **F_A**: A normal force exerted by the humerus on the ulna, directed downward.\n   - **F_B**: A force exerted by the ligament at B, angled at 75 degrees from the horizontal.\n   - **F_C**: A normal force exerted by the humerus on the radius, directed horizontally.\n5. **Distances**:\n   - The distance from the elbow joint to the point where F_A acts is 0.8 inches.\n   - The distance from the elbow joint to the point where F_C acts is 2 inches.\n   - The distance from the elbow joint to the center of gravity (G) of the stone is 14 inches.\n6. **Stone**: A 5-lb stone held in the hand, with its center of gravity (G) marked.\n\nThe diagram also includes annotations indicating the direction and angles of the forces, specifically noting that F_B is at a 75-degree angle from the horizontal. The smallest cross-sectional area of the ligament at B is given as 0.30 square inches.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhen the hand is holding the 5-lb stone, the humerus H, assumed to be smooth, exerts normal forces F_C and F_A on the radius C and ulna A, respectively, as shown.

                    "text": "To determine the greatest average tensile stress in the ligament at B, we need to find the force \\( F_B \\) and then use the formula for stress:\n\n\\[\n\\text{stress} = \\frac{F_B}{A}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the ligament.\n\nGiven:\n\n- The smallest cross-sectional area of the ligament at B is \\( A = 0.30 \\) in\u00b2.\n\nFirst, we need to find \\( F_B \\). To do this, we'll consider the equilibrium of the arm, specifically the moments about the elbow joint.\n\nLet's list the forces acting on the arm:\n\n1. \\( F_A \\): Normal force exerted by the humerus on the ulna, directed downward.\n\n2. \\( F_B \\): Force exerted by the ligament at B, at an angle of 75\u00b0 from the horizontal.\n\n3. \\( F_C \\): Normal force exerted by the humerus on the radius, directed horizontally.\n\n4. Weight of the stone, \\( W = 5 \\) lb, acting downward at the center of gravity G of the stone.\n\nWe need to consider the moments about the elbow joint to find \\( F_B \\).\n\nFirst, let's identify the distances from the elbow joint to the points where these forces act:\n\n- Distance from elbow to point where \\( F_A \\) acts: 0.8 inches.\n\n- Distance from elbow to point where \\( F_C \\) acts: 2 inches.\n\n- Distance from elbow to center of gravity G of the stone: 14 inches.\n\nSince the arm is in equilibrium, the sum of the moments about the elbow joint must be zero:\n\n\\[\n\\sum M_{\\text{elbow}} = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's calculate the moments caused by each force:\n\n1. Moment due to \\( F_A \\):\n\n   - \\( F_A \\) acts downward at a distance of 0.8 inches from the elbow.\n\n   - Moment: \\( M_A = F_A \\times 0.8 \\) inches (clockwise, assuming positive clockwise).\n\n2. Moment due to \\( F_B \\):\n\n   - \\( F_B \\) acts at an angle of 75\u00b0 from the horizontal.\n\n   - The moment arm for \\( F_B \\) is the perpendicular distance from the elbow to the line of action of \\( F_B \\).\n\n   - However, since we don't know the exact direction of \\( F_B \\) relative to the elbow, we might need to consider its components.\n\n   - Assuming \\( F_B \\) is acting in a plane, we can resolve it into horizontal and vertical components:\n\n     - Horizontal component: \\( F_{Bx} = F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) \\)\n\n     - Vertical component: \\( F_{By} = F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) \\)\n\n   - The moment due to \\( F_B \\) would be the sum of the moments due to its components.\n\n   - However, without knowing the exact position where \\( F_B \\) acts, it's challenging to directly compute its moment.\n\n3. Moment due to \\( F_C \\):\n\n   - \\( F_C \\) acts horizontally at a distance of 2 inches from the elbow.\n\n   - Moment: \\( M_C = F_C \\times 2 \\) inches (counterclockwise, assuming positive clockwise is positive).\n\n4. Moment due to the weight of the stone:\n\n   - The stone's weight acts downward at a distance of 14 inches from the elbow.\n\n   - Moment: \\( M_W = 5 \\text{ lb} \\times 14 \\) inches (counterclockwise).\n\nNow, setting the sum of moments to zero:\n\n\\[\nM_A + M_B + M_C + M_W = 0\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions:\n\n\\[\nF_A \\times 0.8 + (F_{Bx} \\times r_{Bx} + F_{By} \\times r_{By}) + F_C \\times 2 + 5 \\times 14 = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact positions where \\( F_B \\) acts, this approach might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the forces in the x and y directions separately.\n\nLet's consider the equilibrium of forces in the x and y directions.\n\nSum of forces in the x-direction:\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_x = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF_{Cx} + F_{Bx} = 0\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( F_C \\) is purely horizontal, \\( F_{Cx} = F_C \\), and \\( F_{Bx} = F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) \\):\n\n\\[\nF_C + F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) = 0 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nSum of forces in the y-direction:\n\n\\[\n\\sum F_y = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF_{Ay} + F_{By} - W = 0\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( F_A \\) is purely vertical, \\( F_{Ay} = F_A \\), and \\( F_{By} = F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) \\):\n\n\\[\nF_A + F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) - 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( F_C + F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( F_A + F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) - 5 = 0 \\)\n\nWe need a third equation to solve for the three unknowns \\( F_A \\), \\( F_B \\), and \\( F_C \\).\n\nLet's return to the moment equation about the elbow.\n\nSum of moments about the elbow:\n\n\\[\n\\sum M_{\\text{elbow}} = 0\n\\]\n\nAssuming clockwise moments are positive:\n\n\\[\nF_A \\times 0.8 - F_C \\times 2 - 5 \\times 14 = 0 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have three equations:\n\n1. \\( F_C + F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( F_A + F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) - 5 = 0 \\)\n\n3. \\( F_A \\times 0.8 - F_C \\times 2 - 5 \\times 14 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, from equation (1):\n\n\\[\nF_C = -F_B \\cos(75^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nSince \\( F_C \\) is a normal force, it should be positive, so perhaps I need to reconsider the sign convention.\n\nAssuming \\( F_C \\) is to the right (positive x-direction), and \\( F_{Bx} \\) is to the left (negative x-direction):\n\n\\[\nF_C - F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) = 0 \\quad \\text{(1a)}\n\\]\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nF_C = F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) \\quad \\text{(1b)}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n\\[\nF_A + F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) = 5 \\quad \\text{(2a)}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\n\\[\nF_A \\times 0.8 - F_C \\times 2 - 5 \\times 14 = 0 \\quad \\text{(3a)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( F_C \\) from equation (1b) into equation (3a):\n\n\\[\nF_A \\times 0.8 - (F_B \\cos(75^\\circ)) \\times 2 - 5 \\times 14 = 0 \\quad \\text{(3b)}\n\\]\n\nNow, we have equations (2a) and (3b):\n\n1. \\( F_A + F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) = 5 \\)\n\n2. \\( F_A \\times 0.8 - F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) \\times 2 - 70 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve equation (2a) for \\( F_A \\):\n\n\\[\nF_A = 5 - F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) \\quad \\text{(2b)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( F_A \\) from equation (2b) into equation (3b):\n\n\\[\n(5 - F_B \\sin(75^\\circ)) \\times 0.8 - F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) \\times 2 - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical values:\n\nFirst, calculate \\( \\sin(75^\\circ) \\) and \\( \\cos(75^\\circ) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(75^\\circ) = \\sin(45^\\circ + 30^\\circ) = \\sin 45^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ + \\cos 45^\\circ \\sin 30^\\circ = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.9659\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\cos(75^\\circ) = \\cos(45^\\circ + 30^\\circ) = \\cos 45^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ - \\sin 45^\\circ \\sin 30^\\circ = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.2588\n\\]\n\nNow, substitute these values into the equation:\n\n\\[\n(5 - F_B \\times 0.9659) \\times 0.8 - F_B \\times 0.2588 \\times 2 - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n(5 - 0.9659 F_B) \\times 0.8 - 0.5176 F_B - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nMultiply through:\n\n\\[\n4 - 0.77272 F_B - 0.5176 F_B - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[\n4 - 70 - (0.77272 + 0.5176) F_B = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-66 - 1.29032 F_B = 0\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( F_B \\):\n\n\\[\n-1.29032 F_B = 66\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF_B = \\frac{66}{-1.29032} \\approx -51.15 \\text{ lb}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the assumed direction of \\( F_B \\) is opposite to the actual direction. However, for stress calculation, we are interested in the magnitude of \\( F_B \\).\n\nNow, calculate the stress in the ligament:\n\n\\[\n\\text{stress} = \\frac{F_B}{A} = \\frac{51.15 \\text{ lb}}{0.30 \\text{ in}^2} \\approx 170.5 \\text{ psi}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options (122 psi, 221 psi, 121 psi, 112 psi). It seems there might be an error in the calculations.\n\nLet me re-examine the steps.\n\nFirst, in equation (3a), I assumed clockwise moments are positive. Let's verify the signs.\n\nSum of moments about the elbow:\n\n- \\( F_A \\) acts at 0.8 inches, causing a clockwise moment: \\( + F_A \\times 0.8 \\)\n\n- \\( F_C \\) acts at 2 inches, causing a counterclockwise moment: \\( - F_C \\times 2 \\)\n\n- Weight of the stone acts at 14 inches, causing a counterclockwise moment: \\( - 5 \\times 14 \\)\n\nSo, equation (3a) is correct.\n\nHowever, perhaps there is a mistake in the trigonometric values or calculations.\n\nLet me re-calculate \\( \\sin(75^\\circ) \\) and \\( \\cos(75^\\circ) \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(75^\\circ) = \\sin(45^\\circ + 30^\\circ) = \\sin 45^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ + \\cos 45^\\circ \\sin 30^\\circ = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.9659\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\cos(75^\\circ) = \\cos(45^\\circ + 30^\\circ) = \\cos 45^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ - \\sin 45^\\circ \\sin 30^\\circ = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6} - \\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.2588\n\\]\n\nThese values seem correct.\n\nNow, substituting back into equation (3b):\n\n\\[\n(5 - F_B \\times 0.9659) \\times 0.8 - F_B \\times 0.2588 \\times 2 - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nLet's distribute 0.8:\n\n\\[\n4 - 0.77272 F_B - 0.5176 F_B - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nCombine \\( F_B \\) terms:\n\n\\[\n4 - 70 - (0.77272 + 0.5176) F_B = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-66 - 1.29032 F_B = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( F_B \\):\n\n\\[\n-1.29032 F_B = 66\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF_B = \\frac{66}{-1.29032} \\approx -51.15 \\text{ lb}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the magnitude is 51.15 lb.\n\nNow, stress calculation:\n\n\\[\n\\text{stress} = \\frac{51.15 \\text{ lb}}{0.30 \\text{ in}^2} = 170.5 \\text{ psi}\n\\]\n\nThis still does not match any of the options. Perhaps there is a mistake in the assumption of moments or force directions.\n\nLet me consider an alternative approach.\n\nPerhaps considering the forces and moments differently will yield a different result.\n\nLet's consider that the humerus exerts normal forces \\( F_A \\) and \\( F_C \\) on the ulna and radius, respectively.\n\nAssuming the arm is in static equilibrium, the sum of forces and moments must be zero.\n\nSum of forces in x-direction:\n\n\\[\nF_C - F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) = 0 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nSum of forces in y-direction:\n\n\\[\nF_A + F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) - 5 = 0 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nSum of moments about the elbow:\n\n\\[\nF_A \\times 0.8 - F_C \\times 2 - 5 \\times 14 = 0 \\quad \\text{(3)}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\\[\nF_C = F_B \\cos(75^\\circ) \\quad \\text{(1b)}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n\\[\nF_A = 5 - F_B \\sin(75^\\circ) \\quad \\text{(2b)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute (1b) and (2b) into (3):\n\n\\[\n(5 - F_B \\sin(75^\\circ)) \\times 0.8 - (F_B \\cos(75^\\circ)) \\times 2 - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\nCompute numerical values:\n\n\\[\n(5 - F_B \\times 0.9659) \\times 0.8 - F_B \\times 0.2588 \\times 2 - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(5 - 0.9659 F_B) \\times 0.8 - 0.5176 F_B - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 - 0.77272 F_B - 0.5176 F_B - 70 = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4 - 70 - (0.77272 + 0.5176) F_B = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-66 - 1.29032 F_B = 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF_B = \\frac{-66}{1.29032} \\approx -51.15 \\text{ lb}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the magnitude is 51.15 lb, leading to a stress of 170.5 psi, which isn't among the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the moment equation.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nAssuming the elbow is the pivot point:\n\n- \\( F_A \\) acts at 0.8 inches, causing a clockwise moment.\n\n- \\( F_C \\) acts at 2 inches, causing a counterclockwise moment.\n\n- The weight of the stone acts at 14 inches, causing a counterclockwise moment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance for \\( F_C \\) is not 2 inches, or there's a mistake in the distances.\n\nWait, perhaps the distances need to be in feet since the weight is in pounds, but inches are used for lengths. Ensure consistent units.\n\nHowever, in moment calculations, as long as the units are consistent (all in inches or all in feet), it's acceptable. Since the area is in square inches, keeping lengths in inches is fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weight should be considered in pounds-force (lbf),"
