                    "text": "To find the average shear stress developed along section a-a of the wooden specimen during the tension test, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the given information:**\n   - The specimen is wooden.\n   - It is subjected to a tension test with a tensile force \\( P \\).\n   - Dimensions:\n     - Width: 2 inches\n     - Thickness: 1 inch\n     - Length between grips: 4 inches\n   - Section a-a is where the shear stress needs to be determined.\n   - Average normal stress: 2 ksi (kilopounds per square inch)\n\n2. **Recall the relationship between normal stress and tensile force:**\n   The average normal stress (\\( \\sigma \\)) in a tension test is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\frac{P}{A}\n   \\]\n   where:\n   - \\( P \\) is the tensile force applied.\n   - \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the specimen.\n\n3. **Calculate the cross-sectional area \\( A \\):**\n   The cross-sectional area perpendicular to the applied force is:\n   \\[\n   A = \\text{width} \\times \\text{thickness} = 2 \\, \\text{in} \\times 1 \\, \\text{in} = 2 \\, \\text{in}^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the tensile force \\( P \\):**\n   Given the average normal stress \\( \\sigma = 2 \\) ksi, we can solve for \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   P = \\sigma \\times A = 2 \\, \\text{ksi} \\times 2 \\, \\text{in}^2 = 4 \\, \\text{kips}\n   \\]\n   (Note: 1 ksi = 1000 psi, so 2 ksi = 2000 psi)\n\n5. **Understand shear stress in a tension test:**\n   In a pure tension test, the primary stress is normal stress, and shear stress is typically zero on planes perpendicular to the applied force. However, shear stress can occur on other planes, especially if there are internal defects or if the material is anisotropic.\n\n6. **Consider the section a-a:**\n   Since the problem specifies determining the average shear stress along section a-a, we need to consider the orientation of this section. If section a-a is perpendicular to the applied force, then the shear stress should be zero under pure tension. However, if section a-a is at an angle, we need to use Mohr's circle or stress transformation equations to find the shear stress.\n\n7. **Assume section a-a is at 45 degrees:**\n   Often, in tension tests, shear stress is maximum on planes inclined at 45 degrees to the applied load. The maximum shear stress (\\( \\tau_{\\text{max}} \\)) in pure tension is:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\sigma \\) is the normal stress.\n\n8. **Calculate the maximum shear stress:**\n   Given \\( \\sigma = 2 \\) ksi:\n   \\[\n   \\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{ksi}}{2} = 1 \\, \\text{ksi} = 1000 \\, \\text{psi}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Compare with given options:**\n   The calculated maximum shear stress is 1000 psi, but the options provided are:\n   - A. 200 psi\n   - B. 150 psi\n   - C. 500 psi\n   - D. 250 psi\n\n   None of these match the calculated value of 1000 psi, which suggests that either the assumption about the orientation of section a-a is incorrect or there is a misunderstanding in the approach.\n\n10. **Re-evaluate the approach:**\n    - Perhaps the section a-a is not at 45 degrees, or there is a different factor affecting the shear stress.\n    - Alternatively, the problem might be considering shear stress in a different context, such as along the grain of the wood or due to Poisson's effect.\n\n11. **Consider the area for shear stress calculation:**\n    - Shear stress is calculated as force divided by the area over which the shear acts.\n    - If section a-a has a different area or if the force contributing to the shear is different, this could affect the result.\n\n12. **Assume section a-a has a different area:**\n    - Suppose section a-a has an area different from the cross-sectional area perpendicular to the applied force.\n    - However, without specific information about the geometry of section a-a, this is speculative.\n\n13. **Consider the possibility of misinterpretation:**\n    - It's possible that the problem is not about maximum shear stress due to tension but about shear stress in a different context, such as shear along the grips or due to bending.\n\n14. **Look for alternative approaches:**\n    - If the specimen is being pulled in tension, and section a-a is a plane within the material, the shear stress on that plane can be found using stress transformation equations.\n    - For a plane at an angle \\( \\theta \\) to the applied load, the shear stress \\( \\tau \\) is:\n      \\[\n      \\tau = \\sigma \\times \\sin(2\\theta)/2\n      \\]\n    - At \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\), \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\), so \\( \\tau = \\sigma / 2 \\), which matches the earlier calculation.\n\n15. **Conclusion based on standard mechanics of materials:**\n    - Given the standard mechanics of materials approach, the maximum shear stress in pure tension is \\( \\sigma / 2 \\), which is 1 ksi or 1000 psi.\n    - Since this does not match any of the provided options, it's possible there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup or the options might be incorrect.\n\n16. **Consider units and conversions:**\n    - Ensure that units are consistent. The normal stress is given in ksi, and the answer options are in psi. 1 ksi = 1000 psi, so 2 ksi = 2000 psi.\n    - However, using the formula \\( \\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\sigma / 2 \\), we get 1 ksi or 1000 psi, which still doesn't match the options.\n\n17. **Re-examine the problem statement:**\n    - The problem might be expecting the average shear stress, not the maximum shear stress.\n    - Alternatively, there might be a specific area over which the shear stress is to be calculated.\n\n18. **Assume the shear stress is due to the tensile force distributed over a different area:**\n    - If section a-a has a different area, say due to the way it's oriented or due to the presence of fasteners or grips, then the shear stress would be different.\n\n19. **Consider the specimen's geometry:**\n    - The specimen has a width of 2 inches and a thickness of 1 inch, with a grip length of 4 inches.\n    - Section a-a might be a plane within the material at a certain angle or location where the area subjected to shear is different.\n\n20. **Assume section a-a is a plane with a certain area:**\n    - Without specific information about section a-a, it's challenging to determine the exact area over which the shear stress is to be calculated.\n\n21. **Consider the possibility of shear stress due to bending:**\n    - If the specimen is not being pulled purely in tension but is also bending, there could be shear stresses due to bending moment.\n    - However, in a standard tension test, bending is minimized, and shear due to bending is typically negligible.\n\n22. **Given the uncertainty, select the closest option:**\n    - The calculated maximum shear stress is 1000 psi, but the closest option is C. 500 psi, which is half of 1000 psi.\n    - This might suggest that the average shear stress is being considered, or there is a factor of 2 involved that was missed.\n\n23. **Final decision:**\n    - Given the standard calculation and the options provided, the most reasonable answer is C. 500 psi.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
