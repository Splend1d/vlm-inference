FCC {110}\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Identify the lattice type:**\n   - The description mentions that the lattice is face-centered cubic (FCC), which is consistent with the hexagonal arrangement of spheres.\n\n2. **Understand the plane notation:**\n   - The {110} plane in an FCC lattice refers to a specific set of crystal planes within the lattice.\n\n3. **Match the lattice type and plane with the options:**\n   - Option F specifies FCC {110}, which directly matches the description provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is F. FCC {110}."
