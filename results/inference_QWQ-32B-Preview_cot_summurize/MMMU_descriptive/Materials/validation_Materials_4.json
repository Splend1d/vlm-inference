                    "text": "To determine the bending stress developed at point B of the cross-section at section a-a, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the geometry and loading:**\n   - The rod is bent in an L-shape with a horizontal section from A to E and a vertical section from A to B.\n   - The horizontal section is 600 mm long, and the vertical section is 300 mm long.\n   - A force P = 3 kN is applied vertically downward at point E through a chain.\n   - The cross-section at section a-a is rectangular with width 25 mm and height 50 mm, and thickness 20 mm.\n\n2. **Determine the moment at section a-a:**\n   - First, find the reactions at the fixed support D.\n   - Then, calculate the bending moment at section a-a due to the applied force P.\n\n3. **Calculate the moment of inertia of the cross-section:**\n   - For a rectangular cross-section, the moment of inertia about the neutral axis is given by \\( I = \\frac{1}{12} b h^3 \\), where b is the width and h is the height.\n\n4. **Determine the distance from the neutral axis to point B:**\n   - Identify the location of point B relative to the neutral axis of the cross-section.\n\n5. **Calculate the bending stress at point B:**\n   - Use the bending stress formula: \\( \\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I} \\), where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the neutral axis to the point of interest, and I is the moment of inertia.\n\nLet's go through these steps in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the geometry and loading\n\n- The rod is fixed at point D.\n- Horizontal section AE: 600 mm\n- Vertical section AB: 300 mm\n- Force P = 3 kN applied vertically downward at point E.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the moment at section a-a\n\nFirst, we need to find the reactions at the fixed support D.\n\n#### Free Body Diagram\n\n- The rod is fixed at D, so there are reactions in the x and y directions and a moment reaction at D.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( R_{Dx} \\): horizontal reaction at D\n- \\( R_{Dy} \\): vertical reaction at D\n- \\( M_D \\): moment reaction at D\n\n#### Equations of equilibrium\n\n1. Sum of forces in the x-direction:\n\n   \\( \\sum F_x = 0 \\)\n\n   \\( R_{Dx} = 0 \\) (assuming no horizontal external forces)\n\n2. Sum of forces in the y-direction:\n\n   \\( \\sum F_y = 0 \\)\n\n   \\( R_{Dy} - P = 0 \\)\n\n   \\( R_{Dy} = P = 3 \\) kN\n\n3. Sum of moments about D:\n\n   \\( \\sum M_D = 0 \\)\n\n   The moment due to P about D needs to be calculated.\n\n   - The position of point E relative to D needs to be determined.\n\nAssuming the coordinates:\n\n- Let\u2019s place point D at the origin (0,0).\n\n- The vertical section AB is along the y-axis, so point A is at (0, 300 mm).\n\n- The horizontal section AE is along the x-axis, so point E is at (600 mm, 300 mm).\n\n   - Therefore, the force P is applied at (600 mm, 300 mm).\n\n   - The moment due to P about D is \\( M = P \\times \\text{perpendicular distance} \\)\n\n   - Perpendicular distance from D to the line of action of P is 600 mm.\n\n   - So, \\( M_D - P \\times 600 \\) mm = 0\n\n   - \\( M_D = P \\times 600 \\) mm = 3 kN \u00d7 0.6 m = 1.8 kN\u00b7m\n\nTherefore, the reactions are:\n\n- \\( R_{Dx} = 0 \\) kN\n- \\( R_{Dy} = 3 \\) kN\n- \\( M_D = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m\n\nNow, we need to find the bending moment at section a-a.\n\n#### Location of section a-a\n\n- Section a-a is at point A, where the vertical and horizontal sections meet.\n\n- We need to find the bending moment at point A due to the applied force P.\n\n#### Bending moment at A\n\n- Consider the horizontal section AE.\n\n- The force P is applied at E, which is 600 mm from A.\n\n- The bending moment at A due to P is \\( M_A = P \\times 600 \\) mm = 3 kN \u00d7 0.6 m = 1.8 kN\u00b7m\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the moment of inertia of the cross-section\n\nThe cross-section at section a-a is rectangular with width b = 25 mm and height h = 50 mm.\n\nThe moment of inertia about the neutral axis (which is the horizontal axis through the centroid) is:\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{1}{12} b h^3 = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 25 \\times 50^3 \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 50^3 \\):\n\n\\[ 50^3 = 125,000 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 25 \\times 125,000 = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 3,125,000 = 260,416.67 \\, \\text{mm}^4 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the distance from the neutral axis to point B\n\nPoint B is located at the inner corner of the bend, which is at the bottom left corner of the cross-section at section a-a.\n\nAssuming the neutral axis is at the centroid of the cross-section:\n\n- For a rectangular cross-section, the centroid is at the midpoint of the height.\n\n- Height h = 50 mm, so the neutral axis is at 25 mm from the top and bottom.\n\n- Therefore, the distance from the neutral axis to point B (bottom corner) is 25 mm.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the bending stress at point B\n\nThe bending stress formula is:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- M = bending moment = 1.8 kN\u00b7m = 1,800 N\u00b7m\n- y = distance from neutral axis to point B = 25 mm = 0.025 m\n- I = moment of inertia = 260,416.67 mm^4 = 260,416.67 \u00d7 10^{-12} m^4 = 260,416.67 \u00d7 10^{-12} m^4 = 2.604167 \u00d7 10^{-7} m^4\n\nNow, plug in the values:\n\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{1,800 \\times 0.025}{2.604167 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{45}{2.604167 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 172,800,000 \\, \\text{Pa} = 172.8 \\, \\text{MPa} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options. It seems there might be a mistake in the assumptions or calculations.\n\n#### Re-evaluating the approach\n\n1. **Re-check the moment at section a-a:**\n\n   - The moment at A is due to the force P applied at E, which is 600 mm away.\n\n   - \\( M_A = P \\times 600 \\) mm = 3 kN \u00d7 0.6 m = 1.8 kN\u00b7m (seems correct).\n\n2. **Re-check the moment of inertia:**\n\n   - For a rectangular cross-section, \\( I = \\frac{1}{12} b h^3 \\)\n\n   - b = 25 mm, h = 50 mm\n\n   - \\( I = \\frac{1}{12} \\times 25 \\times 125,000 = 260,416.67 \\, \\text{mm}^4 \\) (correct).\n\n3. **Re-check the distance y:**\n\n   - y = 25 mm from neutral axis to bottom (correct).\n\n4. **Re-check units:**\n\n   - M = 1,800 N\u00b7m\n   - y = 0.025 m\n   - I = 260,416.67 \u00d7 10^{-12} m^4 = 2.604167 \u00d7 10^{-7} m^4\n\n   - \\( \\sigma = \\frac{1,800 \\times 0.025}{2.604167 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{45}{2.604167 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 172,800,000 \\, \\text{Pa} = 172.8 \\, \\text{MPa} \\)\n\nThis still does not match the options. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the location of point B or the moment calculation.\n\n#### Alternative approach\n\nConsider that point B is at the inner corner of the bend, which might be subjected to both bending and possibly other stresses due to the bend.\n\nHowever, based on the problem statement, it seems that only bending stress is to be considered at section a-a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section properties are different due to the thickness mentioned.\n\nWait, the cross-section is described as rectangular with width 25 mm, height 50 mm, and thickness 20 mm. This suggests it might be a rectangular tube or a solid rectangular cross-section.\n\nIf it's a rectangular tube, the moment of inertia would be different.\n\nLet\u2019s assume it's a rectangular tube with outer dimensions 50 mm (height) and 25 mm (width), and wall thickness 20 mm. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 20 mm thickness would make the inner dimensions smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is 25 mm wide and 50 mm high, with a thickness of 20 mm, which might indicate a flange width of 25 mm and overall height of 50 mm, with a web thickness of 20 mm, similar to an I-beam.\n\nHowever, the description says \"rectangular with width of 25 mm and height of 50 mm. The thickness of the rod at this section is 20 mm.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps it's a rectangular solid with width 25 mm, height 50 mm, and thickness 20 mm, making it a 3D volume.\n\nBut in a 2D cross-section, thickness might not be considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is 25 mm (width) by 50 mm (height), and the thickness is 20 mm, but perhaps the moment of inertia needs to account for the thickness.\n\nWait, in standard beam theory, the cross-section is considered, and the moment of inertia is calculated for that cross-section.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to consider the cross-section as having a width of 25 mm and height of 50 mm, and the thickness is irrelevant for the moment of inertia calculation in bending.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangular tube with outer dimensions 50 mm by 25 mm and wall thickness 20 mm, but that would mean the inner dimensions are 50 - 2*20 = 10 mm and 25 - 2*20 = -15 mm, which doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the cross-section is solid, with width 25 mm and height 50 mm, and the thickness is given for some other reason.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I need to consider the cross-section as having width 25 mm and height 50 mm, and calculate the moment of inertia accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the thickness is the depth in a 3D beam, but in 2D analysis, it's accounted for differently.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the initial approach and see if there's another way to match the given options.\n\n#### Considering superposition of stresses\n\nPerhaps there are multiple stresses acting at point B, and I need to consider more than just the bending stress due to the moment at A.\n\nFor example, there might be stresses due to the reaction at D or other moments in the structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bend in the rod affects the stress distribution.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I need to consider the entire structure and calculate the internal forces and moments more accurately.\n\n#### Detailed structural analysis\n\nLet's consider a more detailed approach by analyzing the forces and moments in the entire structure.\n\n1. **Support reactions at D:**\n\n   - As calculated earlier:\n\n     - \\( R_{Dy} = 3 \\) kN\n\n     - \\( M_D = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m\n\n   - \\( R_{Dx} = 0 \\) kN (no horizontal external forces)\n\n2. **Internal forces and moments:**\n\n   - At section a-a, which is at point A:\n\n     - The internal moment is the moment due to the applied load P.\n\n     - As calculated, \\( M_A = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m\n\n3. **Stress calculation:**\n\n   - Using \\( \\sigma = \\frac{M y}{I} \\)\n\n   - With M = 1.8 kN\u00b7m, y = 25 mm, I = 260,416.67 mm^4\n\n   - This gives \\( \\sigma = \\frac{1,800 \\times 0.025}{2.604167 \\times 10^{-7}} \\approx 172.8 \\) MPa\n\nThis still does not match any of the given options. Perhaps there is a mistake in the moment calculation or the location of point B.\n\n#### Re-examining the location of point B\n\nPoint B is described as being at the inner corner of the bend, where the horizontal and vertical sections meet.\n\n- In the L-shaped rod, point B is at the corner where the vertical section meets the horizontal section.\n\n- Section a-a is at point A, which is at the top of the vertical section.\n\n- Therefore, point B is at the bottom of the vertical section, where the bend occurs.\n\n- The distance from A to B along the vertical section is 300 mm.\n\n- However, in the cross-section at a-a, point B corresponds to the bottom of the cross-section.\n\n- Therefore, the distance y from the neutral axis to point B is indeed 25 mm.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the moment at section a-a is not simply M_A = 1.8 kN\u00b7m.\n\n#### Considering the bend in the rod\n\nThe rod is bent, which may introduce additional stresses or require a different approach to calculate the bending moment.\n\nPerhaps the moment needs to be calculated considering the bend as a curved beam, which would have a different stress distribution.\n\nHowever, the problem seems to suggest treating it as a straight beam with an L-shape, and analyzing the bending stress at a specific point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the moment at section a-a is not only due to the moment at D.\n\n#### Shear and moment diagrams\n\nTo accurately determine the internal moment at section a-a, we can construct shear and moment diagrams for the beam.\n\n1. **Shear force diagram:**\n\n   - Between D and A: vertical shear due to the reaction \\( R_{Dy} = 3 \\) kN\n\n   - Between A and E: shear decreases linearly to zero at E due to the applied load P = 3 kN\n\n2. **Bending moment diagram:**\n\n   - Between D and A: moment increases linearly from \\( M_D = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m to zero at A\n\n   - Between A and E: moment decreases linearly from zero at A to \\( M_E = -P \\times \\text{distance} \\)\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let's recast the shear and moment diagrams properly.\n\n#### Correct shear and moment diagrams\n\n- The rod is fixed at D, with a vertical reaction \\( R_{Dy} = 3 \\) kN and a moment \\( M_D = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m.\n\n- There is no horizontal reaction since there are no horizontal loads.\n\n- The force P = 3 kN is applied at E, which is 600 mm from A along the horizontal section.\n\n- The vertical section from D to A is 300 mm.\n\nLet's consider the entire structure:\n\n- From D to A: vertical section, 300 mm\n\n- From A to E: horizontal section, 600 mm\n\n#### Shear force diagram:\n\n- From D to A: shear force is \\( R_{Dy} = 3 \\) kN (since no other loads in this segment)\n\n- From A to E: shear force decreases linearly from 3 kN at A to zero at E due to the applied load P = 3 kN\n\n#### Bending moment diagram:\n\n- At D: moment is \\( M_D = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m\n\n- From D to A: moment decreases linearly from 1.8 kN\u00b7m at D to zero at A (since there are no other moments or loads in this segment)\n\n- From A to E: moment decreases linearly from zero at A to \\( M_E = -P \\times \\text{distance} \\)\n\n   - Distance from A to E is 600 mm, so \\( M_E = -3 \\) kN \u00d7 0.6 m = -1.8 kN\u00b7m\n\nTherefore, at section a-a (point A), the bending moment is zero, as it transitions from the vertical to the horizontal section.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier assumption that \\( M_A = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m.\n\nLet's verify this.\n\n#### Correct moment at A\n\n- At point A, the moment due to the reaction \\( M_D = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m is countered by the moment from the shear force between D and A.\n\n- Actually, since the vertical section is 300 mm and the moment at D is 1.8 kN\u00b7m, the moment at A would be \\( M_A = M_D - R_{Dy} \\times \\text{distance} \\)\n\n   - \\( M_A = 1.8 \\) kN\u00b7m - 3"
