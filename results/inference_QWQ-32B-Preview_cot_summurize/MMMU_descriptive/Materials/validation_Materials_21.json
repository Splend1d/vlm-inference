                    "text": "To determine the resultant internal loadings acting on the cross-section through point D of the simply supported beam, we need to calculate the normal force (N), shear force (V), and bending moment (M) at that point. Given that the beam is subjected to a uniformly distributed load (UDL) and has vertical reactions at supports A and B, we can proceed as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Reactions at Supports A and B\n\nFirst, we need to find the vertical reactions at supports A and B. Since the beam is simply supported and subjected to a uniformly distributed load over its entire length, the reactions can be calculated using the equations of equilibrium.\n\nGiven:\n- Length of the beam, \\( L = 12 \\) ft\n- Uniformly distributed load, \\( w = 6 \\) kips/ft\n\nThe total load on the beam is:\n\\[ W = w \\times L = 6 \\, \\text{kip/ft} \\times 12 \\, \\text{ft} = 72 \\, \\text{kip} \\]\n\nFor a simply supported beam with a uniformly distributed load, the reactions at both supports are equal and given by:\n\\[ R_A = R_B = \\frac{W}{2} = \\frac{72 \\, \\text{kip}}{2} = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Shear Force and Bending Moment at Point D\n\nPoint D is located 6 feet from support A (or 3 feet from support B).\n\n#### Shear Force (V_D)\n\nTo find the shear force at point D, we can consider the equilibrium of the beam section from support A to point D.\n\nThe shear force at any section is equal to the algebraic sum of all vertical forces acting on either side of that section.\n\nFrom support A to point D:\n- Reaction at A: \\( R_A = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\) (upward)\n- Uniformly distributed load over 6 ft: \\( w \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 6 \\, \\text{kip/ft} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\) (downward)\n\nTherefore, the shear force at point D is:\n\\[ V_D = R_A - (w \\times 6) = 36 \\, \\text{kip} - 36 \\, \\text{kip} = 0 \\, \\text{kip} \\]\n\n#### Bending Moment (M_D)\n\nThe bending moment at any section is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments of all forces acting on either side of that section.\n\nConsidering the left side from support A to point D:\n- Moment due to reaction at A: \\( R_A \\times 0 = 0 \\) (since it acts at the section)\n- Moment due to the uniformly distributed load over 6 ft:\n  The uniformly distributed load can be represented by a equivalent concentrated load of \\( 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\) acting at the midpoint of the 6 ft segment, which is 3 ft from A.\n\nTherefore, the bending moment at point D is:\n\\[ M_D = R_A \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} - \\left( w \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} \\right) \\times 3 \\, \\text{ft} \\]\n\\[ M_D = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} - 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 3 \\, \\text{ft} \\]\n\\[ M_D = 216 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} - 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} \\]\n\nAlternatively, considering the right side from point D to support B:\n- Reaction at B: \\( R_B = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\) (upward)\n- Uniformly distributed load over 6 ft: \\( w \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\) (downward)\n\nThe equivalent concentrated load acts at the midpoint of the 6 ft segment from D to B, which is 3 ft from D.\n\nTherefore, the bending moment at point D is:\n\\[ M_D = R_B \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} - \\left( w \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} \\right) \\times 3 \\, \\text{ft} \\]\n\\[ M_D = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} - 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 3 \\, \\text{ft} \\]\n\\[ M_D = 216 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} - 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Normal Force (N_D)\n\nIn a simply supported beam subjected only to vertical loads, the normal force (axial force) is zero because there are no axial loads applied.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ N_D = 0 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{N_D = 0, \\, V_D = 0 \\, \\text{kip}, \\, M_D = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft}} \\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options. It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup or the options provided. Let's double-check the calculations.\n\n### Re-evaluation\n\nUpon re-evaluation, it appears there might be a mistake in the interpretation of the beam's segments and the position of point D.\n\nGiven:\n- Beam length: 12 ft\n- Divided into three segments: A to C (3 ft), C to D (3 ft), D to B (6 ft)\n\nThis implies:\n- Point C is 3 ft from A\n- Point D is 3 ft from C, i.e., 6 ft from A\n- Point D is also 6 ft from A and 6 ft from B (since the total length is 12 ft)\n\nWait, if D is 6 ft from A and the beam is 12 ft long, then D is actually 6 ft from A and 6 ft from B. But according to the description, D is 6 ft from A and 3 ft from B, which seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's clarify:\n- A to C: 3 ft\n- C to D: 3 ft\n- D to B: 6 ft\n- Total length: 3 + 3 + 6 = 12 ft\n\nSo, point D is 6 ft from A and 6 ft from B.\n\nBut according to the description, D is 3 ft from B, which contradicts the earlier segmentation. There seems to be a confusion in the positioning of points C and D.\n\nLet's assume the correct positions:\n- A at x=0\n- C at x=3 ft\n- D at x=6 ft\n- B at x=12 ft\n\nGiven this, D is 6 ft from A and 6 ft from B.\n\nNow, recalculate the shear force and bending moment at D.\n\n#### Shear Force at D\n\nFrom A to D (6 ft):\n- Reaction at A: 36 kip upward\n- UDL over 6 ft: 6 kip/ft \u00d7 6 ft = 36 kip downward\n\nShear force at D:\n\\[ V_D = 36 \\, \\text{kip} - 36 \\, \\text{kip} = 0 \\, \\text{kip} \\]\n\n#### Bending Moment at D\n\nUsing the left side (A to D):\n\\[ M_D = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} - 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 3 \\, \\text{ft} = 216 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} - 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} \\]\n\nAlternatively, using the right side (D to B):\n- Reaction at B: 36 kip upward\n- UDL over 6 ft: 6 kip/ft \u00d7 6 ft = 36 kip downward\n\nBending moment at D:\n\\[ M_D = 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 6 \\, \\text{ft} - 36 \\, \\text{kip} \\times 3 \\, \\text{ft} = 216 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} - 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} \\]\n\nAgain, this result does not match any of the provided options. It seems there might be an error in the options or the problem statement.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the beam is overhanging or has different support conditions, but the description specifies it is simply supported with supports at A and B.\n\nAnother possibility is that the UDL is not uniformly distributed over the entire length, but the description clearly states it is.\n\nGiven the consistent calculation resulting in \\( M_D = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} \\), and none of the options match this, there might be a mistake in the problem setup or the options provided.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided information and standard beam analysis, the internal loadings at point D should be:\n\\[ N_D = 0, \\, V_D = 0 \\, \\text{kip}, \\, M_D = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft} \\]\n\nHowever, since this does not match any of the given options, it's recommended to double-check the problem statement and the options for any possible errors or misinterpretations.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{N_D = 0, \\, V_D = 0 \\, \\text{kip}, \\, M_D = 108 \\, \\text{kip\u00b7ft}} \\]"
