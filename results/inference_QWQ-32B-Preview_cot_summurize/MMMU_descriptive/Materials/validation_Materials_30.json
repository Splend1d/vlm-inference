The triangle has two legs of equal length, each measuring 800 mm, forming a 45-degree angle with the vertical axis (y-axis). The hypotenuse of the triangle is inclined at a 45-degree angle to both the x-axis and y-axis. The plate is fixed at its base along the y-axis. At the apex of the triangle, labeled as point A, there is a horizontal displacement of 5 mm, indicated by an arrow pointing to the right from point A to point A'. The displacement is perpendicular to the original position of point A, which lies on the line x'x. The overall orientation of the triangle suggests that it is subjected to a deformation in the horizontal direction, causing the apex to move horizontally while the base remains fixed.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe triangular plate is fixed at its base, and its apex A is given a horizontal displacement of 5 mm.

                    "text": "To determine the average normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) along the x-axis for the triangular plate, we need to analyze the deformation caused by the horizontal displacement at the apex.\n\nGiven:\n- The triangular plate is a right-angled isosceles triangle with legs of 800 mm each.\n- The apex A is displaced horizontally by 5 mm to point A'.\n- The base is fixed along the y-axis.\n\nFirst, let's understand the geometry of the triangle:\n\n1. **Original Position:**\n   - The triangle has legs of equal length: \\(a = b = 800\\) mm.\n   - The hypotenuse \\(c\\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\sqrt{800^2 + 800^2} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 800^2} = 800\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1131.37 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Deformed Position:**\n   - The base remains fixed, but the apex A moves horizontally by 5 mm to A'.\n   - This horizontal displacement causes a deformation in the horizontal direction.\n\nTo find the average normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) along the x-axis, we use the formula for normal strain:\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_x = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta L\\) is the change in length and \\(L\\) is the original length.\n\nIn this case, we need to determine the change in length along the x-axis due to the horizontal displacement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Determine the original coordinates:**\n   - Let's place the right angle at the origin (0,0).\n   - The base is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,800) mm.\n   - The other leg is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (800,0) mm.\n   - The apex A is at (800,800) mm.\n\n2. **Displacement at apex A:**\n   - The apex A is displaced horizontally by 5 mm to the right, so A' is at (800 + 5, 800) = (805,800) mm.\n\n3. **Deformation analysis:**\n   - The base is fixed, so points along the y-axis do not move.\n   - The horizontal displacement at the apex suggests a horizontal strain in the x-direction.\n\n4. **Calculate the change in length along the x-axis:**\n   - Consider a small element along the x-axis.\n   - The horizontal displacement at the apex is 5 mm, and the base has zero displacement.\n   - The displacement varies linearly along the y-axis from 0 at y=0 to 5 mm at y=800 mm.\n\n5. **Strain variation along the y-axis:**\n   - The horizontal displacement \\(u(x,y)\\) can be assumed to vary linearly with y:\n     \\[\n     u(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}}\\right) y = \\frac{5}{800} y = 0.00625 y \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n   - The strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) is the derivative of the displacement with respect to x:\n     \\[\n     \\varepsilon_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(u\\) does not depend on x, \\(\\varepsilon_x = 0\\). However, this seems counterintuitive, so let's consider another approach.\n\n6. **Alternative approach:**\n   - Consider the triangle as a rigid body undergoing a small rotation.\n   - The horizontal displacement at the apex causes a rotation about the base.\n\n7. **Calculate the rotation:**\n   - The rotation \\(\\theta\\) at the apex can be approximated by:\n     \\[\n     \\theta \\approx \\frac{\\text{displacement}}{\\text{height}} = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}} = 0.00625 \\text{ radians}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Strain due to rotation:**\n   - For small rotations, the normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) can be related to the rotation gradient.\n   - However, in pure rotation, there should be no strain, but in this case, there is deformation.\n\n9. **Considering deformation:**\n   - The horizontal displacement causes stretching in the x-direction.\n   - The change in length \\(\\Delta L\\) can be found by considering the new position of points along the x-axis.\n\n10. **Calculate the average strain:**\n    - The average normal strain can be approximated by the ratio of the displacement to the original height:\n      \\[\n      \\varepsilon_x \\approx \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}} = 0.00625 \\text{ mm/mm}\n      \\]\n    - However, this does not match any of the given options, suggesting a more detailed approach is needed.\n\n### More Detailed Approach:\n\n1. **Assume small deformations:**\n   - The displacement is small (5 mm compared to 800 mm), so we can use linear strain assumptions.\n\n2. **Strain definition:**\n   - Normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) is defined as the change in length per unit length in the x-direction.\n\n3. **Determine the change in length:**\n   - Consider a differential element along the x-axis.\n   - The displacement gradient in the x-direction gives the strain.\n\n4. **Displacement field:**\n   - Assuming the displacement varies linearly along the y-axis:\n     \\[\n     u(x,y) = \\left(\\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}}\\right) y = 0.00625 y \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n   - The strain in the x-direction is:\n     \\[\n     \\varepsilon_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0\n     \\]\n   - This suggests no strain, which contradicts the deformation observed.\n\n5. **Reconsider the displacement field:**\n   - Perhaps the displacement is not purely horizontal or the strain is not purely normal.\n\n6. **Consider both normal and shear strains:**\n   - In reality, there might be shear strains involved due to the displacement.\n\n7. **Use geometric relations:**\n   - The horizontal displacement at the apex causes a change in the length of the hypotenuse.\n   - The original hypotenuse length is \\(c = 800\\sqrt{2}\\) mm.\n   - The new position of the apex is (805,800), so the new hypotenuse length \\(c'\\) is:\n     \\[\n     c' = \\sqrt{(805)^2 + (800)^2} = \\sqrt{648025 + 640000} = \\sqrt{1288025} \\approx 1135.35 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n   - The change in length is:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta c = c' - c = 1135.35 - 1131.37 = 3.98 \\text{ mm}\n     \\]\n   - The average normal strain along the hypotenuse would be:\n     \\[\n     \\varepsilon_c = \\frac{\\Delta c}{c} = \\frac{3.98}{1131.37} \\approx 0.00351 \\text{ mm/mm}\n     \\]\n   - However, we need the strain along the x-axis, not the hypotenuse.\n\n8. **Relate strains in different directions:**\n   - Using strain transformation equations for small strains.\n   - Assuming plane strain conditions.\n\n9. **Assume uniform strain:**\n   - For simplicity, assume the strain is uniform across the plate.\n   - Then, the average normal strain in the x-direction can be approximated by the displacement divided by the height:\n     \\[\n     \\varepsilon_x \\approx \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{800 \\text{ mm}} = 0.00625 \\text{ mm/mm}\n     \\]\n   - This still does not match the given options.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the calculated strain and the provided options, it's possible that there is a misunderstanding in the approach. The problem might require considering the strain along the x-axis due to the horizontal displacement at the apex, taking into account the geometry and the fixed base.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 0.00443 mm/mm\n\nB. 0.00803 mm/mm\n\nC. 0.00543 mm/mm\n\nD. 0.00884 mm/mm\n\nAnd our calculation yielding approximately 0.00625 mm/mm, which doesn't directly match any option, we might need to consider a different method or accept the closest value.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifies \"the average normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_x\\) along the x axis,\" and our calculation gives 0.00625 mm/mm, which is closest to option C (0.00543 mm/mm), but not exactly matching, there might be an error in the assumptions made.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
