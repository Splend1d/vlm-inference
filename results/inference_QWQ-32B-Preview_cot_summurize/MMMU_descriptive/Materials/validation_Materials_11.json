                    "text": "To determine the magnitude of the reactive force at the pin A, we need to analyze the forces and moments acting on the mechanical device. The device is a lever system with a handle that is bent at various angles and connected to a base through a pin at point A. A force of 120 N is applied vertically downward at the hand grip.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup based on the description:\n\n- The handle has segments from the hand grip to point D (300 mm), from D to E (100 mm), and from E to B (50 mm).\n\n- The angles between these segments and the vertical are given: DE makes a 30-degree angle with the vertical, and EB makes a 60-degree angle with the vertical.\n\n- The pin A is located at the base, and the distance from pin A to the base of the device is 200 mm.\n\n- The force applied is 120 N vertically downward at the hand grip.\n\nOur goal is to find the reactive force at pin A.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the positions of points\n\nTo analyze the forces and moments, we need to determine the coordinates of points D, E, B, and A.\n\nLet's assume the base is along the x-axis, and the vertical direction is the y-axis.\n\nAssume point A is at the origin (0, 0).\n\nThe base of the device is 200 mm below point A, so the base is at (0, -200 mm).\n\nNow, we need to find the coordinates of points D, E, and B based on the given lengths and angles.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate coordinates of point D\n\nThe handle extends from the hand grip to point D, which is 300 mm away.\n\nAssuming the hand grip is at point H, and the handle is straight from H to D, but considering the angles, it might not be straight.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, let's assume the handle from H to D is straight.\n\nBut given the angles, it's likely that the handle is bent at D and E.\n\nLet's consider the handle has segments HD, DE, and EB with given lengths and angles.\n\n### Step 3: Define coordinate system\n\nLet's define the coordinate system with point A at (0, 0).\n\nAssume the base is along the negative y-axis.\n\n### Step 4: Determine coordinates of points D, E, B\n\nThis is a bit tricky without the exact angles and directions.\n\nLet's try to sketch this mentally:\n\n- From A, the base is 200 mm down, so base is at (0, -200).\n\n- The handle starts from the hand grip, goes to D (300 mm), then E (100 mm from D), then B (50 mm from E).\n\n- Angles are given for DE and EB with respect to vertical.\n\nAssuming vertical is the y-axis.\n\nLet's try to find coordinates step by step.\n\nFirst, need to find the direction of each segment based on the angles.\n\nGiven that DE makes a 30-degree angle with the vertical, and EB makes a 60-degree angle with the vertical.\n\n### Step 5: Assume directions\n\nLet's assume:\n\n- The vertical direction is positive y.\n\n- Angles are measured from the vertical.\n\nSo, if DE makes a 30-degree angle with the vertical, its direction is 30 degrees from the y-axis.\n\nSimilarly, EB makes a 60-degree angle with the vertical.\n\n### Step 6: Determine coordinates\n\nLet's start from point A at (0, 0).\n\nThe base is at (0, -200).\n\nNow, need to find point B, which is connected to the vertical component C, likely applying force to the stud.\n\nBut this is getting complicated without a clear diagram.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the moments about point A to find the reactive force.\n\n### Step 7: Consider moments about point A\n\nThe sum of moments about point A must be zero for equilibrium.\n\nThe applied force is 120 N vertically downward at the hand grip.\n\nWe need to find the moment arm from point A to the point where the force is applied.\n\nGiven the handle's geometry, we need to find the perpendicular distance from A to the line of action of the 120 N force.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the moment due to the force and equate it to the moment due to the reactive force at A.\n\n### Step 8: Simplify the problem\n\nGiven the complexity of the handle's geometry, perhaps we can model it as a single equivalent force at a certain distance from A.\n\nLet's calculate the total moment due to the 120 N force about point A.\n\nThen, the reactive force at A must counterbalance this moment to maintain equilibrium.\n\n### Step 9: Calculate moment due to applied force\n\nNeed to find the moment arm from A to the applied force.\n\nAssume the hand grip is at a certain position based on the handle's length and angles.\n\nGiven the handle's segments:\n\n- HD = 300 mm\n\n- DE = 100 mm\n\n- EB = 50 mm\n\nWith angles for DE and EB with respect to vertical.\n\nThis is getting too involved without a clear diagram.\n\n### Step 10: Consider the options\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 1.41 kN\n\nB. 4.49 kN\n\nC. 1.19 kN\n\nD. 1.49 kN\n\nGiven that the applied force is 120 N, and the distances are in millimeters, we need to ensure consistent units.\n\n likely need to convert millimeters to meters for consistency in units.\n\n### Step 11: Assume a simpler model\n\nPerhaps assume the handle is a straight lever with a certain length from A to the hand grip.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the distance from A to the hand grip is the sum of the handle segments, considering their angles.\n\nBut this is an approximation.\n\n### Step 12: Calculate the mechanical advantage\n\nIf we can find the distance from A to the point where the force is applied, we can find the mechanical advantage.\n\nThen, the reactive force at A would be the applied force multiplied by the mechanical advantage.\n\nBut this is too simplistic.\n\n### Step 13: Consider the device as a simple lever\n\nAssume the device is a simple lever with the applied force at one end and the reactive force at A at the other.\n\nThen, the moment due to the applied force equals the moment due to the reactive force.\n\nSo, Force_applied * distance_applied = Force_reactive * distance_reactive\n\nBut need to know the distances.\n\n### Step 14: Estimate distances\n\nAssume the distance from A to the hand grip is the sum of the handle segments: 300 + 100 + 50 = 450 mm.\n\nBut this is likely not accurate due to the angles.\n\nAlternatively, consider the vertical distances.\n\nGiven the angles, perhaps use trigonometry to find the horizontal and vertical components of each segment.\n\n### Step 15: Calculate coordinates using trigonometry\n\nLet's try to calculate the coordinates of each point.\n\nAssume point A is at (0, 0).\n\nPoint B is connected to the vertical component C, likely directly above or below.\n\nBut it's complex without the exact angles.\n\n### Step 16: Consider the sum of moments\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum of moments about point A must be zero.\n\nSo, the moment due to the applied force plus the moment due to the reactive force at A equals zero.\n\nThus, Moment_applied + Moment_reactive = 0\n\nTherefore, Moment_reactive = -Moment_applied\n\nThe reactive force at A must counterbalance the moment caused by the applied force.\n\n### Step 17: Calculate Moment_applied\n\nNeed to find the moment arm for the applied force.\n\nAssume the handle is positioned such that the force is applied perpendicular to the handle.\n\nThen, the moment arm is the distance from A to the hand grip, perpendicular to the force direction.\n\nGiven the force is vertical, the moment arm would be the horizontal distance from A to the hand grip.\n\n### Step 18: Find the horizontal distance from A to the hand grip\n\nNeed to find the horizontal distance based on the handle's segments and angles.\n\nThis requires knowing the angles between the handle segments and the horizontal or vertical.\n\nGiven that DE makes a 30-degree angle with the vertical, and EB makes a 60-degree angle with the vertical.\n\n### Step 19: Calculate coordinates step by step\n\nLet's start from point A at (0, 0).\n\nAssume point B is directly above or below A, but likely below, given it's connected to the base.\n\nBut it's confusing without a clear diagram.\n\n### Step 20: Consider the overall length and angles\n\nPerhaps consider the total length of the handle and the angles to find the position of the hand grip.\n\nBut this is time-consuming and may not lead to the correct answer without the exact geometry.\n\n### Step 21: Look for an alternative approach\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps consider that the reactive force at A is simply the applied force multiplied by a factor based on the lever arms.\n\nGiven the options are in kilonewtons, and the applied force is 120 N, the reactive force must be significantly higher due to a small lever arm.\n\n### Step 22: Estimate the reactive force\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 1.41 kN\n\nB. 4.49 kN\n\nC. 1.19 kN\n\nD. 1.49 kN\n\nThese are much larger than 120 N, suggesting a small lever arm at A.\n\n### Step 23: Consider the device's purpose\n\nThe device is for punching metal studs, which requires a large force. Therefore, the reactive force at A must be large to counteract the applied force and the resistance from the stud.\n\n### Step 24: Make an educated guess\n\nGiven the options, and considering that the reactive force must be larger than the applied force, likely by a factor of 10 or more (since 120 N corresponds to several kilonewtons), but the options are only up to 4.49 kN.\n\nGiven that, option B. 4.49 kN seems the highest, but need to see if it's reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, option D. 1.49 kN is also a possibility.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the geometry, it's challenging to determine the exact value.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{1.49 \\text{ kN}}"
