                    "text": "To determine the average shear stress developed in the 6-mm diameter pin \\( B \\) that is subjected to double shear, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Bell Crank Mechanism:**\n   - The bell crank is a type of lever mechanism that changes the direction of the applied force.\n   - It has a pin support at point \\( B \\), which is subjected to double shear.\n   - A vertical force \\( P = 1500 \\) N is applied at point \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Dimensions:**\n   - Distance from point \\( C \\) to point \\( D \\): 300 mm.\n   - Distance from point \\( B \\) to point \\( A \\): 450 mm.\n   - Angle between the two arms at point \\( B \\): 45 degrees.\n   - Diameter of the pin at point \\( B \\): 6 mm.\n\n3. **Determine the Forces in the Mechanism:**\n   - Since the pin at \\( B \\) is subjected to double shear, it means that the pin is connected in such a way that it experiences shear forces on two surfaces.\n   - We need to find the shear force acting on the pin due to the applied force \\( P \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Moment about Point B:**\n   - To find the reaction forces at point \\( B \\), we can take the moment about point \\( B \\).\n   - The moment due to the applied force \\( P \\) should be balanced by the moments due to the reaction forces at point \\( B \\).\n\n5. **Resolve the Forces:**\n   - Resolve the forces into components if necessary, considering the angle between the arms.\n\n6. **Calculate the Shear Stress:**\n   - Once the shear force on the pin is determined, calculate the average shear stress using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average shear stress} = \\frac{\\text{Shear force}}{\\text{Cross-sectional area}}\n     \\]\n   - For double shear, the effective cross-sectional area is twice the area of one shear plane.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Bell Crank Mechanism\n\nThe bell crank is a lever mechanism with a pin support at point \\( B \\). The force \\( P \\) is applied vertically at point \\( A \\), and we need to find the average shear stress in the pin at \\( B \\), which is subjected to double shear.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Dimensions\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P = 1500 \\) N\n- Distance \\( BA = 450 \\) mm\n- Angle at \\( B \\) is 45 degrees\n- Pin diameter \\( d = 6 \\) mm\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Forces in the Mechanism\n\nSince the pin at \\( B \\) is in double shear, it means that the pin is connected in such a way that it has two shear planes sharing the shear force.\n\nFirst, we need to find the shear force \\( V \\) in the pin.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Moment about Point B\n\nTo find the reaction forces at \\( B \\), we can take the moment about point \\( B \\).\n\nAssume the bell crank is in equilibrium, so the sum of moments about any point is zero.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- \\( R_{Bx} \\) and \\( R_{By} \\) as the reaction components at \\( B \\).\n\nGiven that the angle between the two arms at \\( B \\) is 45 degrees, we can assume that the forces are distributed accordingly.\n\nHowever, without a detailed free-body diagram, we can simplify the approach by considering the moment due to \\( P \\) and equating it to the moment due to the reaction forces at \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 5: Resolve the Forces\n\nGiven the complexity of the angle and the double shear, let's consider that the vertical force \\( P \\) creates a moment about \\( B \\), and the pin reactions counteract this moment.\n\nThe moment due to \\( P \\) about \\( B \\) is:\n\\[\nM_B = P \\times BA = 1500 \\, \\text{N} \\times 450 \\, \\text{mm} = 1500 \\times 0.45 \\, \\text{m} = 675 \\, \\text{N.m}\n\\]\n\nNow, the pin at \\( B \\) resists this moment through the shear forces in the pin.\n\nFor double shear, the total shear force \\( V \\) in the pin can be related to the moment by:\n\\[\nM_B = V \\times r\n\\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the pin to the point where the force is applied. However, in this case, since the pin is at point \\( B \\), and the moment is caused by the force \\( P \\), we need to relate the shear force directly to the moment.\n\nAlternatively, for a pin in double shear, the total shear force is shared between the two shear planes.\n\nGiven that, the total shear force \\( V \\) in the pin can be considered equal to the force causing the moment, but we need to consider the geometry.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Shear Stress\n\nFirst, calculate the cross-sectional area of the pin.\n\nThe diameter of the pin is \\( d = 6 \\) mm, so the area \\( A \\) is:\n\\[\nA = \\pi \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{6}{2} \\right)^2 = \\pi \\times 9 = 28.274 \\, \\text{mm}^2\n\\]\n\nFor double shear, the effective area is twice this value:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{effective}} = 2 \\times 28.274 = 56.548 \\, \\text{mm}^2\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the shear force \\( V \\).\n\nFrom the moment equation:\n\\[\nM_B = V \\times r\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( r \\) is the distance from the center of the pin to the point where the force is applied, which in this case is the distance \\( BA = 450 \\) mm.\n\nHowever, this might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, considering the pin is in double shear and supporting the moment, the total shear force can be related to the moment by:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{M_B}{r}\n\\]\n\nBut we need to determine \\( r \\), which is likely the radius of the pin or another geometric factor.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps a better approach is to consider the force transmission through the bell crank.\n\nAssuming the bell crank is in equilibrium, the sum of forces and moments is zero.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the sum of moments about \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\sum M_B = 0 \\implies P \\times BA - R_{\\text{arm}} \\times BC = 0\n\\]\n\nBut we don't have the length \\( BC \\), which is the distance from \\( B \\) to the point where the reaction force acts.\n\nAlternatively, considering the pin is in double shear, the total shear force is equal to the force \\( P \\), but this seems too simplistic.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the shear stress directly using the force and the effective area.\n\nAssuming the total shear force is \\( P = 1500 \\) N, and the effective area for double shear is \\( 56.548 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average shear stress} = \\frac{1500 \\, \\text{N}}{56.548 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^2} = \\frac{1500}{56.548 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 26.52 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa} = 26.52 \\, \\text{MPa}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options, which suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nLet\u2019s try another approach.\n\nConsidering the pin is in double shear, the total shear force is shared between the two shear planes. Therefore, each shear plane carries half of the total shear force.\n\nSo, if the total shear force is \\( V \\), then each shear plane carries \\( V/2 \\).\n\nThe average shear stress on each plane is:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{V/2}{A}\n\\]\n\nBut we need to find \\( V \\), the total shear force in the pin.\n\nGiven that the pin is supporting the moment \\( M_B = 675 \\, \\text{N.m} \\), and assuming the pin has a certain length or lever arm that resists this moment, we can relate \\( V \\) to \\( M_B \\).\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact geometry or the length of the pin in the direction of the shear, it's challenging to proceed.\n\nPerhaps considering the pin diameter and the moment, we can use the formula for torsional shear stress, but that might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shear force \\( V \\) can be related to the moment and the distance as:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{M_B}{r}\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the pin or another geometric factor.\n\nGiven the diameter of the pin is 6 mm, the radius \\( r = 3 \\) mm = 0.003 m.\n\nThen:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{675 \\, \\text{N.m}}{0.003 \\, \\text{m}} = 225,000 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nThis seems unreasonably high, indicating a mistake in this approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the bell crank as a lever.\n\nThe bell crank has two arms: one with length \\( BA = 450 \\) mm and the other with length \\( BC = 300 \\) mm.\n\nAssuming the angle between the two arms is 45 degrees, we can resolve the forces accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the reaction force at \\( B \\) as \\( R_B \\), which has components \\( R_{Bx} \\) and \\( R_{By} \\).\n\nTaking moments about \\( B \\):\n\\[\n\\sum M_B = 0 \\implies P \\times BA - R_{\\text{arm}} \\times BC = 0\n\\]\n\nBut this seems incomplete without knowing the direction of the reaction force.\n\nAlternatively, considering the bell crank is in equilibrium, the sum of forces in both x and y directions is zero.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the reaction at \\( B \\) has components \\( R_{Bx} \\) and \\( R_{By} \\), and there might be another force at point \\( C \\).\n\nHowever, without a clear free-body diagram, it's difficult to proceed accurately.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll attempt to select the closest answer based on the initial incorrect calculation.\n\nEarlier, I calculated a shear stress of approximately 26.52 MPa, which is closest to option C. 40.5 MPa, but there is a significant discrepancy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming the total shear force is equal to \\( P \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the moment arm is different, or there is a trigonometric factor due to the 45-degree angle.\n\nConsidering the angle, perhaps the effective moment arm is \\( BA \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) \\).\n\nThen, the moment would be:\n\\[\nM_B = P \\times BA \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) = 1500 \\times 0.45 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 1500 \\times 0.45 \\times 0.7071 \\approx 499.9 \\, \\text{N.m}\n\\]\n\nThen, the shear force \\( V \\) would be:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{M_B}{r} = \\frac{499.9}{0.003} \\approx 166,633 \\, \\text{N}\n\\]\n\nThis is still unreasonably high.\n\nIt seems there is a fundamental misunderstanding in the approach.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different method.\n\nFor a pin in double shear, the average shear stress is given by:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{F}{2A}\n\\]\nwhere \\( F \\) is the applied force and \\( A \\) is the cross-sectional area of the pin.\n\nGiven that, and knowing \\( P = 1500 \\) N, and \\( A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\pi (3)^2 = 28.274 \\, \\text{mm}^2 \\), then:\n\\[\n\\tau = \\frac{1500}{2 \\times 28.274 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{1500}{56.548 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 26.52 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa} = 26.52 \\, \\text{MPa}\n\\]\n\nAgain, this does not match any of the options, suggesting an error in assumptions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to select the closest option, which is C. 40.5 MPa, but I'm not confident in this choice.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
