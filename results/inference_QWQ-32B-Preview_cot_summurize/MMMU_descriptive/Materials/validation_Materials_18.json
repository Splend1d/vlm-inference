                    "text": "To determine the normal strain along edge BC of the rectangular rubber block, we need to analyze the given shear strain equation and understand how it affects the dimensions of the block.\n\nGiven:\n- The block has dimensions: width (along x-axis) = 300 mm, height (along y-axis) = 400 mm.\n- Shear strain: \\(\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6}x + 20 \\times 10^{-6}y\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are in millimeters.\n- All lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after deformation.\n\nFirst, let's recall that shear strain \\(\\gamma_{xy}\\) is related to the partial derivatives of the displacement components \\(u\\) (in x-direction) and \\(v\\) (in y-direction) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\nGiven that lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical after deformation, this implies that there is no displacement in the x-direction for points along these lines. Therefore, the displacement component \\(u\\) is zero for all points where \\(x\\) is constant.\n\nHowever, this interpretation might need clarification. Since the lines parallel to the y-axis remain vertical, it means that there is no horizontal displacement component \\(u\\) for points along these lines. Therefore, \\(u\\) is a function of \\(x\\) only, i.e., \\(u = u(x)\\), and \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0\\).\n\nGiven this, the shear strain equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(\\gamma_{xy} = 40 \\times 10^{-6}x + 20 \\times 10^{-6}y\\), we can integrate this with respect to \\(x\\) to find \\(v\\):\n\n\\[\nv = \\int \\gamma_{xy} \\, dx = \\int (40 \\times 10^{-6}x + 20 \\times 10^{-6}y) \\, dx = 20 \\times 10^{-6}x^2 + 20 \\times 10^{-6}yx + f(y)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(f(y)\\) is an arbitrary function of \\(y\\).\n\nSince lines parallel to the y-axis have no horizontal displacement (\\(u = 0\\)), and considering the boundary conditions, we can assume that \\(f(y) = 0\\). Therefore:\n\n\\[\nv = 20 \\times 10^{-6}x^2 + 20 \\times 10^{-6}yx\n\\]\n\nNow, to find the normal strain along edge BC, we need to determine the strain in the y-direction, \\(\\epsilon_y\\), along that edge.\n\nNormal strain in the y-direction is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}\n\\]\n\nTaking the partial derivative of \\(v\\) with respect to \\(y\\):\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( 20 \\times 10^{-6}x^2 + 20 \\times 10^{-6}yx \\right) = 20 \\times 10^{-6}x\n\\]\n\nNow, edge BC corresponds to the points where \\(x = 300\\) mm and \\(0 \\leq y \\leq 400\\) mm.\n\nTherefore, along edge BC:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon_y = 20 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 300 = 6000 \\times 10^{-6} = 6.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mm/mm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the normal strain along edge BC is \\(6.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\) mm/mm.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 4.00*10^(-3) mm/mm\nB. 6.00*10^(-3) mm/mm\nC. 6.00*10^(-6) mm/mm\nD. 4.00*10^(-6) mm/mm\n\nThe correct answer is B. 6.00*10^(-3) mm/mm.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{mm/mm}} \\]"
