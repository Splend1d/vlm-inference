                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. There's a table with densities and corresponding crystallinities for two poly(ethylene terephthalate) materials. The first one has a density of 1.408 g/cm\u00b3 and is 74.3% crystalline, and the second one has a density of 1.343 g/cm\u00b3 and is 31.2% crystalline. Now, I need to find the crystallinity of a specimen that has a density of 1.382 g/cm\u00b3. The options are A. 57.4%, B. 74.5%, C. 67.4%, and D. 54.7%.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between density and crystallinity. Generally, more crystalline materials are denser because the crystalline regions are more tightly packed than the amorphous regions. So, as crystallinity increases, density increases.\n\nGiven that, I have two data points:\n\n1. Density = 1.408 g/cm\u00b3, Crystallinity = 74.3%\n\n2. Density = 1.343 g/cm\u00b3, Crystallinity = 31.2%\n\nAnd I need to find the crystallinity for Density = 1.382 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nThis looks like a linear interpolation problem. If I assume that the relationship between density and crystallinity is linear between these two points, I can estimate the crystallinity at 1.382 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nLet me plot these points to visualize:\n\n- Point 1: (1.408, 74.3)\n\n- Point 2: (1.343, 31.2)\n\n- Unknown: (1.382, ?)\n\nSince 1.382 is between 1.408 and 1.343, the crystallinity should be between 74.3% and 31.2%.\n\nLet me calculate the slope of the line between the two known points.\n\nSlope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (31.2 - 74.3) / (1.343 - 1.408) = (-43.1) / (-0.065) = 663.08\n\nNow, using the point-slope form of the equation of a line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nLet me use point 1:\n\ny - 74.3 = 663.08(x - 1.408)\n\nNow, plug in x = 1.382:\n\ny - 74.3 = 663.08(1.382 - 1.408)\n\ny - 74.3 = 663.08(-0.026)\n\ny - 74.3 = -17.24\n\ny = 74.3 - 17.24 = 57.06%\n\nSo, according to this calculation, the crystallinity is approximately 57.06%, which rounds to 57.4%.\n\nWait a minute, that's option A. But let me check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the proportion method for linear interpolation.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ny = y1 + ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) * (x - x1)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\ny = 74.3 + ((31.2 - 74.3) / (1.343 - 1.408)) * (1.382 - 1.408)\n\ny = 74.3 + (-43.1 / -0.065) * (-0.026)\n\ny = 74.3 + (663.08) * (-0.026)\n\ny = 74.3 - 17.24 = 57.06%\n\nAgain, I get 57.06%, which is closest to option A, 57.4%.\n\nBut let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of specific volumes or something related to polymer physics.\n\nIn polymer science, the density of a semi-crystalline polymer can be related to its crystallinity by the formula:\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1c * Xc + \u03c1a * (1 - Xc)\n\nWhere:\n\n- \u03c1 is the density of the material\n\n- \u03c1c is the density of the crystalline phase\n\n- \u03c1a is the density of the amorphous phase\n\n- Xc is the fraction of crystallinity\n\nGiven two data points, I can set up two equations and solve for \u03c1c and \u03c1a, and then use those to find Xc for the third density.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFrom the first data point:\n\n1.408 = \u03c1c * 0.743 + \u03c1a * (1 - 0.743) = 0.743\u03c1c + 0.257\u03c1a\n\nFrom the second data point:\n\n1.343 = \u03c1c * 0.312 + \u03c1a * (1 - 0.312) = 0.312\u03c1c + 0.688\u03c1a\n\nNow, I have a system of two equations with two unknowns (\u03c1c and \u03c1a).\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: 0.743\u03c1c + 0.257\u03c1a = 1.408\n\nEquation 2: 0.312\u03c1c + 0.688\u03c1a = 1.343\n\nI can solve this system using substitution or elimination. I'll use elimination.\n\nFirst, let me multiply equation 1 by 0.688 and equation 2 by 0.257 to make the coefficients of \u03c1a the same.\n\nEquation 1 multiplied by 0.688:\n\n0.743\u03c1c * 0.688 + 0.257\u03c1a * 0.688 = 1.408 * 0.688\n\n0.511\u03c1c + 0.177\u03c1a = 0.967\n\nEquation 2 multiplied by 0.257:\n\n0.312\u03c1c * 0.257 + 0.688\u03c1a * 0.257 = 1.343 * 0.257\n\n0.080\u03c1c + 0.177\u03c1a = 0.345\n\nNow, subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(0.511\u03c1c + 0.177\u03c1a) - (0.080\u03c1c + 0.177\u03c1a) = 0.967 - 0.345\n\n0.431\u03c1c = 0.622\n\n\u03c1c = 0.622 / 0.431 = 1.443 g/cm\u00b3\n\nNow, plug \u03c1c back into one of the original equations to find \u03c1a. Let's use equation 1:\n\n0.743 * 1.443 + 0.257\u03c1a = 1.408\n\n1.072 + 0.257\u03c1a = 1.408\n\n0.257\u03c1a = 1.408 - 1.072 = 0.336\n\n\u03c1a = 0.336 / 0.257 = 1.307 g/cm\u00b3\n\nNow, for the unknown density of 1.382 g/cm\u00b3, I can use the same formula:\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1c * Xc + \u03c1a * (1 - Xc)\n\n1.382 = 1.443Xc + 1.307(1 - Xc)\n\n1.382 = 1.443Xc + 1.307 - 1.307Xc\n\n1.382 = (1.443 - 1.307)Xc + 1.307\n\n1.382 = 0.136Xc + 1.307\n\n0.136Xc = 1.382 - 1.307 = 0.075\n\nXc = 0.075 / 0.136 = 0.551 or 55.1%\n\nHmm, that's 55.1%, which is closer to option D, 54.7%.\n\nBut earlier, using linear interpolation, I got 57.06%, which is option A.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst method (linear interpolation):\n\ny = y1 + m(x - x1)\n\ny = 74.3 + ( (31.2 - 74.3) / (1.343 - 1.408) ) * (1.382 - 1.408)\n\ny = 74.3 + ( -43.1 / -0.065 ) * ( -0.026 )\n\ny = 74.3 + (663.08) * (-0.026) = 74.3 - 17.24 = 57.06%\n\nSecond method (using \u03c1c and \u03c1a):\n\n\u03c1 = \u03c1c * Xc + \u03c1a * (1 - Xc)\n\n1.382 = 1.443Xc + 1.307(1 - Xc)\n\n1.382 = 1.443Xc + 1.307 - 1.307Xc\n\n1.382 = (1.443 - 1.307)Xc + 1.307\n\n1.382 = 0.136Xc + 1.307\n\n0.136Xc = 1.382 - 1.307 = 0.075\n\nXc = 0.075 / 0.136 = 0.551 or 55.1%\n\nSo, there's a discrepancy between the two methods. Why is that?\n\nMaybe the assumption of linearity in the first method isn't valid. Perhaps the relationship between density and crystallinity isn't strictly linear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in one of the calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the first method.\n\nGiven two points (1.408, 74.3) and (1.343, 31.2), and trying to find y at x = 1.382.\n\nUsing the interpolation formula:\n\ny = y1 + ( (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) ) * (x - x1)\n\nPlugging in:\n\ny = 74.3 + ( (31.2 - 74.3) / (1.343 - 1.408) ) * (1.382 - 1.408)\n\ny = 74.3 + ( -43.1 / -0.065 ) * ( -0.026 )\n\ny = 74.3 + (663.08) * (-0.026) = 74.3 - 17.24 = 57.06%\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIn the second method, I calculated \u03c1c = 1.443 g/cm\u00b3 and \u03c1a = 1.307 g/cm\u00b3.\n\nThen, for \u03c1 = 1.382:\n\n1.382 = 1.443Xc + 1.307(1 - Xc)\n\n1.382 = 1.443Xc + 1.307 - 1.307Xc\n\n1.382 = (1.443 - 1.307)Xc + 1.307\n\n1.382 = 0.136Xc + 1.307\n\n0.136Xc = 1.382 - 1.307 = 0.075\n\nXc = 0.075 / 0.136 = 0.551 or 55.1%\n\nThat also seems correct.\n\nSo, which one should I trust?\n\nThe first method gives 57.06%, and the second gives 55.1%.\n\nGiven that the first method assumes linearity between the two points, and the second method uses the polymer physics approach, I think the second method is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, the crystallinity is approximately 55.1%, which is closest to option D, 54.7%.\n\nI think the answer is D. 54.7%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
