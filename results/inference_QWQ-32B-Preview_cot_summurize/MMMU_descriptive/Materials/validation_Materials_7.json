                    "text": "To determine the displacement \u03b4 of plate A when a vertical load P is applied, we need to analyze the shear spring setup described. The setup consists of two rubber blocks bonded to three rigid plates, with the middle plate A subjected to a vertical load P.\n\nGiven:\n- Each rubber block has height h, width b, and thickness a.\n- Shear modulus of the rubber is G.\n- Displacement \u03b4 is related to the shear angle \u03b3 by \u03b4 \u2248 a\u03b3 (for small angles).\n\nFirst, we need to understand the shear deformation in the rubber blocks under the applied load P.\n\n### Step 1: Shear Stress and Shear Strain\n\nIn shear deformation, the shear stress \u03c4 is related to the shear strain \u03b3 by Hooke's law for shear:\n\n\u03c4 = G\u03b3\n\nwhere:\n- \u03c4 is the shear stress,\n- G is the shear modulus,\n- \u03b3 is the shear strain.\n\n### Step 2: Shear Stress Calculation\n\nThe shear stress \u03c4 in each rubber block can be found by dividing the applied load P by the shear area of the block. Since there are two blocks, the total shear area is 2 times the area of one block.\n\nThe shear area of one block is its height h multiplied by its thickness a:\n\nShear area of one block = h * a\n\nTherefore, the total shear area for both blocks is:\n\nTotal shear area = 2 * h * a\n\nThe shear stress \u03c4 in each block is:\n\n\u03c4 = P / (2 * h * a)\n\n### Step 3: Shear Strain Calculation\n\nUsing the relationship \u03c4 = G\u03b3, we can solve for the shear strain \u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = \u03c4 / G = (P / (2 * h * a)) / G = P / (2 * h * a * G)\n\n### Step 4: Displacement Calculation\n\nThe displacement \u03b4 is related to the shear strain \u03b3 by:\n\n\u03b4 \u2248 a\u03b3\n\nSubstituting the expression for \u03b3:\n\n\u03b4 \u2248 a * (P / (2 * h * a * G)) = P / (2 * h * G)\n\nHowever, this seems to be missing the width b in the denominator. Let's re-examine the shear area.\n\n### Step 5: Re-examining Shear Area\n\nUpon closer inspection, the shear area should consider the width b of the blocks as well. The shear plane in each block is the area over which shear stress acts, which is the area perpendicular to the direction of the shear force.\n\nGiven that the load P is applied vertically, and the blocks are bonded to the plates, the shear plane would be the area with dimensions height h and width b.\n\nTherefore, the shear area of one block is:\n\nShear area of one block = h * b\n\nThus, the total shear area for both blocks is:\n\nTotal shear area = 2 * h * b\n\n### Step 6: Correct Shear Stress Calculation\n\nNow, the shear stress \u03c4 in each block is:\n\n\u03c4 = P / (2 * h * b)\n\n### Step 7: Correct Shear Strain Calculation\n\nUsing \u03c4 = G\u03b3:\n\n\u03b3 = \u03c4 / G = (P / (2 * h * b)) / G = P / (2 * h * b * G)\n\n### Step 8: Correct Displacement Calculation\n\nUsing \u03b4 \u2248 a\u03b3:\n\n\u03b4 \u2248 a * (P / (2 * h * b * G)) = (a * P) / (2 * h * b * G)\n\n### Step 9: Comparing with Options\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\n\nA. Pa/(2bhG)\n\nB. Pa/(bhG)\n\nC. Pab/(2hG)\n\nD. 2Pa/(bhG)\n\nOur calculated displacement is:\n\n\u03b4 = (a * P) / (2 * h * b * G) = Pa/(2bhG)\n\nThis matches option A.\n\nHowever, let's double-check the shear area to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Step 10: Verification of Shear Area\n\nIn shear deformation, the shear area is the area over which the shear stress is applied. In this setup, the load P is applied to plate A, which is bonded to two rubber blocks.\n\nEach rubber block has a bonding area with plate A that is of dimensions height h and width b. Therefore, the shear area for each block is indeed h * b.\n\nThus, the total shear area for both blocks is 2 * h * b.\n\n### Step 11: Alternative Consideration\n\nAlternatively, if the shear deformation occurs over the thickness a, then the shear strain \u03b3 might be related to the displacement \u03b4 through \u03b4 = a * \u03b3.\n\nBut in standard shear deformation, the shear strain \u03b3 is defined as the displacement per unit length in the direction of the shear force, over the dimension in the direction perpendicular to the force.\n\nIn this case, the shear strain \u03b3 would be \u03b4 / a, assuming that the shear deformation occurs over the thickness a.\n\nWait, this seems contradictory to the initial assumption \u03b4 \u2248 a\u03b3.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\nShear strain \u03b3 is defined as:\n\n\u03b3 = tan(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 (for small angles)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle of shear.\n\nIn the context of the rubber blocks, when plate A is displaced downward by \u03b4, the top surface of the rubber blocks shears by an angle \u03b3, where:\n\n\u03b3 \u2248 \u03b4 / a\n\nThis is because the shear deformation occurs over the thickness a of the blocks.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u03b4 \u2248 a\u03b3\n\nThis aligns with the initial assumption.\n\n### Step 12: Revisiting Shear Stress and Strain Relationship\n\nGiven that \u03b3 = \u03b4 / a, and \u03c4 = G\u03b3, then:\n\n\u03c4 = G * (\u03b4 / a)\n\nHowever, from the force equilibrium, the shear stress \u03c4 must also equal the applied force per unit area:\n\n\u03c4 = P / (shear area)\n\nThe shear area is the area over which the shear stress acts, which is the bonding area between the plates and the rubber blocks.\n\nAs previously determined, this area is 2 * h * b.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u03c4 = P / (2 * h * b) = G * (\u03b4 / a)\n\nSolving for \u03b4:\n\n\u03b4 = (P * a) / (2 * h * b * G)\n\nThis confirms the earlier calculation.\n\n### Step 13: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the displacement \u03b4 of plate A when a vertical load P is applied is:\n\n\u03b4 = Pa/(2bhG)\n\nwhich corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
