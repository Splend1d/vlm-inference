                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about determining the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature from some Charpy impact test data on ductile cast iron. The data is presented in a table with temperatures ranging from -25\u00b0C to -175\u00b0C and corresponding impact energies from 124 Joules down to 6 Joules. The task is to find the transition temperature, which is defined as the temperature corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the maximum and minimum impact energies from the data provided. From the description, the impact energy at -25\u00b0C is 124 J, which seems like the highest value, and at -175\u00b0C it's 6 J, which is the lowest. So, maximum impact energy is 124 J and minimum is 6 J.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the average of these two values. That should be (124 J + 6 J) / 2 = 130 J / 2 = 65 J. So, the average impact energy is 65 J.\n\nNow, I need to find the temperature at which the impact energy is closest to 65 J. Looking at the data points:\n\n- At -25\u00b0C: 124 J\n\n- At -50\u00b0C: 123 J\n\n- At -75\u00b0C: 115 J\n\n- At -85\u00b0C: 100 J\n\n- At -100\u00b0C: 73 J\n\n- At -110\u00b0C: 52 J\n\n- At -125\u00b0C: 26 J\n\n- At -150\u00b0C: 9 J\n\n- At -175\u00b0C: 6 J\n\nLooking at these values, 65 J is between 73 J at -100\u00b0C and 52 J at -110\u00b0C. So, the transition temperature should be between -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C.\n\nTo determine the exact temperature, I could assume a linear interpolation between these two points. Let's see.\n\nFirst, find the temperature difference and the impact energy difference between -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C.\n\nTemperature difference: -110\u00b0C - (-100\u00b0C) = -10\u00b0C\n\nImpact energy difference: 52 J - 73 J = -21 J\n\nSo, for every 10\u00b0C decrease, the impact energy decreases by 21 J.\n\nNow, I need to find the temperature at which the impact energy is 65 J, which is 8 J below 73 J (73 J - 65 J = 8 J).\n\nSo, the ratio of the energy difference to the total energy difference is 8 J / 21 J.\n\nTherefore, the temperature difference from -100\u00b0C would be (-10\u00b0C) * (8 J / 21 J) = -3.81\u00b0C.\n\nSo, the transition temperature would be -100\u00b0C - 3.81\u00b0C = -103.81\u00b0C.\n\nBut the options are in whole numbers, so I need to round this off. -103.81\u00b0C is closer to -104\u00b0C, but looking at the options, none of them match exactly. The options are -100\u00b0C, -110\u00b0C, -105\u00b0C, and -125\u00b0C.\n\nHmm, maybe I should check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects me to take the average of the temperatures corresponding to the maximum and minimum impact energies.\n\nWait, no. The question says to determine the transition temperature as the temperature corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies.\n\nI think I interpreted it correctly the first time. But maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nLet me see. The maximum impact energy is 124 J at -25\u00b0C, and the minimum is 6 J at -175\u00b0C. The average is 65 J, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, looking at the data, 65 J is between -100\u00b0C (73 J) and -110\u00b0C (52 J), as I saw before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the midpoint between the temperatures where the impact energy is at its maximum and minimum.\n\nWait, no. It's asking for the temperature corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies, which I interpret as finding the temperature where the impact energy equals the average value of the max and min impact energies.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the temperature where the impact energy drops to half of its maximum value. But no, it's asking for the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies.\n\nGiven that the maximum is 124 J and the minimum is 6 J, the average is indeed 65 J.\n\nNow, looking at the data, 65 J is not directly listed, but it falls between -100\u00b0C (73 J) and -110\u00b0C (52 J).\n\nSo, I need to estimate the temperature at which the impact energy is 65 J.\n\nUsing linear interpolation between -100\u00b0C and -110\u00b0C:\n\nLet \u0394T = -110\u00b0C - (-100\u00b0C) = -10\u00b0C\n\n\u0394E = 52 J - 73 J = -21 J\n\nSo, the slope is \u0394E / \u0394T = (-21 J) / (-10\u00b0C) = 2.1 J/\u00b0C\n\nNow, the difference between 73 J and 65 J is 8 J.\n\nSo, the temperature difference is \u0394T = \u0394E / slope = 8 J / 2.1 J/\u00b0C \u2248 3.81\u00b0C\n\nTherefore, the temperature is -100\u00b0C - 3.81\u00b0C \u2248 -103.81\u00b0C\n\nRounding to the nearest 5\u00b0C, that would be -105\u00b0C.\n\nLooking at the options, -105\u00b0C is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.\n\nMaybe it's expecting to take the average of the temperatures at maximum and minimum impact energies.\n\nMaximum at -25\u00b0C and minimum at -175\u00b0C.\n\nAverage temperature would be (-25\u00b0C + (-175\u00b0C)) / 2 = (-200\u00b0C) / 2 = -100\u00b0C\n\nBut that seems too straightforward and doesn't match the earlier calculation.\n\nMoreover, the question specifically says \"the temperature corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies,\" which I interpret as finding the temperature where impact energy equals the average of the max and min impact energies, not the average of the temperatures.\n\nBut perhaps the question is worded ambiguously, and different interpretations are possible.\n\nGiven that, both -100\u00b0C and -105\u00b0C are options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transition temperature is considered to be where the impact energy drops to half its maximum value, but that would be 62 J (124 J / 2), which is close to 65 J, but the question specifies the average of maximum and minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transition is considered at the temperature where impact energy is 20 J, or some other criterion, but based on the question, it's clearly the average of max and min impact energies.\n\nGiven that, and my earlier calculation leading to -103.81\u00b0C, which rounds to -105\u00b0C, I think the answer should be -105\u00b0C, which is option C.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps the transition temperature is defined as the temperature where the impact energy is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies, and perhaps the data is supposed to be fitted with a curve, but given the linear decrease in impact energy with decreasing temperature, linear interpolation seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transition temperature is considered to be the temperature where the impact energy drops below a certain threshold, but again, the question specifies the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies.\n\nTherefore, I stick with my initial approach and conclusion that the answer is -105\u00b0C, option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. } -105^\\circ\\text{C}} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nTo determine the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, we first identify the maximum and minimum impact energies from the provided data: 124 J at -25\u00b0C and 6 J at -175\u00b0C, respectively. The average of these energies is calculated as (124 J + 6 J)/2 = 65 J. We then look for the temperature at which the impact energy is closest to 65 J, which lies between -100\u00b0C (73 J) and -110\u00b0C (52 J). Using linear interpolation, we estimate the temperature corresponding to 65 J as approximately -103.81\u00b0C, which rounds to -105\u00b0C. Therefore, the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature is \\boxed{\\text{C. } -105^\\circ\\text{C}}."
