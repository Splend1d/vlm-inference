                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight must be added inside the hollow steel sphere to make it neutrally buoyant in water. Neutral buoyancy means that the weight of the sphere plus the added weight equals the buoyant force exerted by the water.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understand the given data:**\n   - Diameter of the sphere, \\( d = 14 \\) inches\n   - Wall thickness, \\( t = 0.16 \\) inches\n   - Specific gravity of steel, \\( SG = 7.85 \\)\n   - We need to find the added weight in pounds force (lbf) for neutral buoyancy.\n\n2. **Convert units to consistent system:**\n   - Since specific gravity is dimensionless, and we're dealing with weights in lbf, we'll use English units.\n   - Note: The specific weight of water in English units is approximately \\( 62.4 \\) lbf/ft\u00b3.\n\n3. **Calculate the outer and inner radii:**\n   - Outer radius, \\( R = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{14}{2} = 7 \\) inches\n   - Inner radius, \\( r = R - t = 7 - 0.16 = 6.84 \\) inches\n\n4. **Calculate the volume of the steel shell:**\n   - Volume of the outer sphere: \\( V_{\\text{outer}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 \\)\n   - Volume of the inner sphere: \\( V_{\\text{inner}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\)\n   - Volume of the steel shell: \\( V_{\\text{shell}} = V_{\\text{outer}} - V_{\\text{inner}} \\)\n\n5. **Calculate the weight of the steel shell:**\n   - Specific weight of steel, \\( \\gamma_{\\text{steel}} = SG \\times \\gamma_{\\text{water}} = 7.85 \\times 62.4 \\) lbf/ft\u00b3\n   - Convert volumes from cubic inches to cubic feet (since 1 ft\u00b3 = 1728 in\u00b3):\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{shell}} = \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (7^3 - 6.84^3) \\right) \\text{ in}^3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{shell}} = \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (343 - 320.34624) \\right) \\text{ in}^3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{shell}} = \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (22.65376) \\right) \\text{ in}^3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{shell}} \\approx \\left( \\frac{4}{3} \\times 3.1416 \\times 22.65376 \\right) \\text{ in}^3 \\approx 95.81 \\text{ in}^3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{shell}} \\approx \\frac{95.81}{1728} \\text{ ft}^3 \\approx 0.0554 \\text{ ft}^3\n     \\]\n   - Weight of the steel shell:\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{steel}} = \\gamma_{\\text{steel}} \\times V_{\\text{shell}} = 7.85 \\times 62.4 \\times 0.0554 \\approx 27.94 \\text{ lbf}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the buoyant force:**\n   - The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the sphere.\n   - Since the sphere is partially submerged, we need to find the volume of the sphere that is underwater.\n   - However, the problem does not specify the exact submersion depth, but it mentions that the sphere is partially submerged with a water level indicated near the bottom.\n   - For simplicity, assuming the sphere is half-submerged (as a common scenario for neutral buoyancy problems unless specified otherwise).\n   - Volume of the sphere:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (7)^3 \\approx 1436.76 \\text{ in}^3\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} \\approx \\frac{1436.76}{1728} \\text{ ft}^3 \\approx 0.831 \\text{ ft}^3\n     \\]\n   - If half-submerged:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{displaced}} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\text{sphere}} \\approx 0.4155 \\text{ ft}^3\n     \\]\n   - Buoyant force:\n     \\[\n     F_b = \\gamma_{\\text{water}} \\times V_{\\text{displaced}} = 62.4 \\times 0.4155 \\approx 25.92 \\text{ lbf}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Determine the added weight for neutral buoyancy:**\n   - For neutral buoyancy:\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{total}} = F_b\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{steel}} + W_{\\text{added}} = F_b\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{added}} = F_b - W_{\\text{steel}} = 25.92 - 27.94 = -2.02 \\text{ lbf}\n     \\]\n   - A negative added weight suggests that the steel sphere is already heavier than the buoyant force when half-submerged, which implies it would sink further or need negative weight (i.e., buoyant assistance), which doesn't make practical sense.\n\n8. **Reevaluate the assumption:**\n   - The assumption that the sphere is half-submerged might be incorrect.\n   - Perhaps the sphere is not half-submerged; maybe it's partially submerged to a different level.\n   - Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is fully submerged for neutral buoyancy.\n\n9. **Consider the sphere fully submerged:**\n   - Volume of the sphere:\n     \\[\n     V_{\\text{sphere}} \\approx 0.831 \\text{ ft}^3\n     \\]\n   - Buoyant force:\n     \\[\n     F_b = 62.4 \\times 0.831 \\approx 51.84 \\text{ lbf}\n     \\]\n   - Weight of the steel shell:\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{steel}} \\approx 27.94 \\text{ lbf}\n     \\]\n   - Added weight for neutral buoyancy:\n     \\[\n     W_{\\text{added}} = F_b - W_{\\text{steel}} = 51.84 - 27.94 = 23.9 \\text{ lbf}\n     \\]\n\n10. **Compare with options:**\n    - The closest option to 23.9 lbf is 25 lbf.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{25\\ \\text{lbf}} \\]"
