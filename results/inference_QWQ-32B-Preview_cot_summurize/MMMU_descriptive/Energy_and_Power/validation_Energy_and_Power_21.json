Assuming the velocity at the side is approximately equal to the blimp's cruising speed, and the velocity at the nose is slightly different due to the blimp's shape, we can approximate the pressure difference using the dynamic pressure formula:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\Delta p = 950 \\) Pa\n- \\( v = 33.53 \\) m/s\n\nWe need to find the density of air at sea-level standard conditions. Standard sea-level air density is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\rho \\approx 1.225 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\]\n\nHowever, we need to verify this value to ensure accuracy. According to standard atmospheric conditions:\n\n- Pressure, \\( p_0 = 101,325 \\) Pa\n- Temperature, \\( T_0 = 288.15 \\) K\n- Gas constant for air, \\( R = 287 \\, \\text{J/(kg\u00b7K)} \\)\n\nUsing the ideal gas law:\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{p}{R T} \\]\n\n\\[ \\rho = \\frac{101,325}{287 \\times 288.15} \\]\n\n\\[ \\rho \\approx 1.225 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\]\n\nSo, our initial assumption is correct.\n\nNow, plugging the values into the dynamic pressure formula:\n\n\\[ 950 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.225 \\times (33.53)^2 \\]\n\nLet's calculate the right-hand side:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.225 \\times (33.53)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ = 0.6125 \\times 1.225 \\times 1124.0609 \\]\n\n\\[ = 0.6125 \\times 1.225 \\times 1124.0609 \\]\n\n\\[ \\approx 0.6125 \\times 1374.77 \\]\n\n\\[ \\approx 841.73 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nWait a minute, this calculated dynamic pressure (841.73 Pa) does not match the measured pressure difference (950 Pa). This suggests that there might be additional factors at play, such as pressure recovery or losses due to the blimp's shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the velocity at the side is not exactly equal to the blimp's cruising speed, or there are pressure gradients along the blimp's surface.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, perhaps we need to approach the problem differently. Let's consider the pressure at the nose and the side in terms of Bernoulli's equation.\n\nAssuming the blimp is moving at a constant speed, and considering the flow over the blimp's surface, we can think of the nose and the side as two different points on the blimp's surface.\n\nLet's denote:\n- Point 1: Nose of the blimp\n- Point 2: Side of the blimp\n\nAccording to Bernoulli's equation:\n\n\\[ p_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = p_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 \\]\n\nThe pressure difference measured by the transducer is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = p_1 - p_2 = 950 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ p_1 = p_2 + 950 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nTo find the absolute pressure at the nose, \\( p_1 \\), we need to determine \\( p_2 \\), the pressure at the side.\n\nAt sea level, the ambient pressure is \\( p_0 = 101,325 \\) Pa. Assuming that the pressure at the side of the blimp is equal to the ambient pressure (since it's exposed to the free stream), we can set:\n\n\\[ p_2 = p_0 = 101,325 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ p_1 = 101,325 + 950 = 102,275 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nHowever, this seems too straightforward, and it doesn't account for the dynamic pressure component. Earlier, when we calculated the dynamic pressure using the blimp's speed, we got 841.73 Pa, which is less than the measured pressure difference of 950 Pa. This suggests that there might be additional pressure contributions due to the blimp's shape or flow characteristics.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pressure at the side is not exactly equal to the ambient pressure due to boundary layer effects or other flow phenomena.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, let's consider another approach. Maybe the pressure difference is due to the pressure coefficient at those points.\n\nThe pressure coefficient, \\( c_p \\), is defined as:\n\n\\[ c_p = \\frac{p - p_\\infty}{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_\\infty^2} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p \\) is the local pressure\n- \\( p_\\infty \\) is the freestream pressure\n- \\( v_\\infty \\) is the freestream velocity\n\nGiven the pressure difference between two points, we can relate them through their pressure coefficients.\n\nHowever, without specific information about the pressure coefficients at the nose and the side of the blimp, this approach might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the pressure at the nose in terms of the stagnation pressure.\n\nThe stagnation pressure, \\( p_0 \\), is given by:\n\n\\[ p_0 = p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_\\infty^2 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( p_\\infty \\) is the freestream static pressure\n- \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_\\infty^2 \\) is the dynamic pressure\n\nIn this case, the nose of the blimp would experience the stagnation pressure, assuming it's a stagnation point.\n\nGiven that, the pressure at the nose, \\( p_1 \\), would be:\n\n\\[ p_1 = p_\\infty + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_\\infty^2 \\]\n\nMeanwhile, the pressure at the side, \\( p_2 \\), is equal to the freestream static pressure, \\( p_\\infty \\).\n\nTherefore, the pressure difference would be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = p_1 - p_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_\\infty^2 \\]\n\nEarlier, we calculated \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_\\infty^2 \\) as approximately 841.73 Pa, but the measured \\( \\Delta p \\) is 950 Pa. This discrepancy suggests that the nose is not a perfect stagnation point, or there are other flow effects influencing the pressure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blimp's movement is creating a pressure gradient, or there are compressibility effects, although at 75 mi/h (33.53 m/s), the Mach number is low (Mach number \\( M = \\frac{v}{a} \\), where \\( a \\) is the speed of sound, approximately 343 m/s at sea level), so compressibility effects are negligible.\n\nGiven this, perhaps there is an error in the assumption that \\( p_2 = p_\\infty \\). In reality, the pressure at the side may not be exactly equal to the freestream static pressure due to boundary layer development or other flow features.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blimp's shape is such that the pressure at the side is not equal to the freestream pressure, and there is a pressure recovery or loss.\n\nGiven these uncertainties, let's consider an alternative approach. Suppose that the pressure at the nose is the stagnation pressure, and the pressure at the side is lower due to the flow velocity.\n\nGiven that, we can express the pressure at the nose as:\n\n\\[ p_1 = p_2 + \\Delta p \\]\n\nAnd we know that \\( \\Delta p = 950 \\) Pa.\n\nIf we can find \\( p_2 \\), the pressure at the side, we can find \\( p_1 \\).\n\nHowever, without more information about the flow over the blimp's surface, it's challenging to determine \\( p_2 \\) directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the freestream static pressure and relate it to the pressure at the side.\n\nAt sea level, the static pressure is \\( p_\\infty = 101,325 \\) Pa.\n\nIf we assume that the pressure at the side is equal to the freestream static pressure, then:\n\n\\[ p_2 = p_\\infty = 101,325 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ p_1 = p_2 + \\Delta p = 101,325 + 950 = 102,275 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nThis is close to option B, 102,000 Pa, but not exact.\n\nHowever, considering the earlier discrepancy in the dynamic pressure calculation, perhaps there is a mistake in assuming \\( p_2 = p_\\infty \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the freestream static pressure is not exactly 101,325 Pa, or there are other factors affecting the pressure at the side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blimp is at a slight angle of attack, causing a pressure difference.\n\nGiven the limited information, this seems to be the most straightforward approach.\n\nTherefore, the estimated absolute pressure at the nose is approximately 102,275 Pa, which rounds closest to option B, 102,000 Pa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{102000 \\, \\text{Pa}} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nBy assuming that the pressure at the side of the blimp is equal to the ambient sea-level pressure and adding the measured pressure difference, we estimate the absolute pressure at the nose. This approach provides an approximate value that aligns with one of the given options."
