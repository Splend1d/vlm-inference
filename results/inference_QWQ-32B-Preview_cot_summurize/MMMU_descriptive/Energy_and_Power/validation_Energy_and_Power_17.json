                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length \\( L \\) of the porous bed that will completely absorb the storm water flowing from the outfall. Let's break down the information given and approach the problem step by step.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Initial depth of water: \\( h = 40 \\) cm = 0.4 m\n- Velocity of water flow: \\( v = 2 \\) m/s\n- Absorption velocity of the porous bed: \\( v_a = 8 \\) mm/s = 0.008 m/s\n- Depth of the system into the paper: \\( d = 5 \\) m\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Determine the volume flow rate of the water from the storm drain:**\n   The volume flow rate \\( Q \\) can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\text{cross-sectional area} \\times \\text{velocity}\n   \\]\n   The cross-sectional area of the water flow is the depth into the paper \\( d \\) times the height \\( h \\):\n   \\[\n   A = d \\times h = 5 \\, \\text{m} \\times 0.4 \\, \\text{m} = 2 \\, \\text{m}^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the volume flow rate is:\n   \\[\n   Q = 2 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\times 2 \\, \\text{m/s} = 4 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the absorption rate of the porous bed:**\n   The porous bed absorbs water at a uniform vertical velocity \\( v_a = 0.008 \\) m/s. The absorption rate per unit area of the bed is:\n   \\[\n   q = v_a \\times d = 0.008 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 5 \\, \\text{m} = 0.04 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}/\\text{m}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( q \\) is the absorption rate per meter of the bed length.\n\n3. **Set up the equation to find the length \\( L \\):**\n   The total absorption rate of the bed must equal the volume flow rate of the water to completely absorb it. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   q \\times L = Q\n   \\]\n   Substituting the known values:\n   \\[\n   0.04 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}/\\text{m} \\times L = 4 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( L \\):**\n   \\[\n   L = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}}{0.04 \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}/\\text{m}} = 100 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the calculations, the length \\( L \\) of the bed required to completely absorb the storm water is 100 meters. However, this does not match any of the provided options (50 m, 70 m, 90 m). It's possible there is a mistake in the approach or the interpretation of the problem.\n\nLet's re-examine the absorption velocity. The absorption velocity is given as 8 mm/s, which is a vertical velocity. However, since the bed is porous and absorbs water vertically, the absorption rate per unit area should be \\( v_a \\times \\text{area} \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the absorption occurs over the entire depth of the bed, and the velocity needs to be considered differently.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\n1. **Consider the absorption as a reduction in water depth over the length \\( L \\):**\n   The water flows over the bed with a certain velocity and is being absorbed at a certain rate.\n\n2. **Set up a mass balance:**\n   The rate at which water is entering the system minus the rate at which it is absorbed should equal the rate at which water is leaving the system.\n\n   Let\u2019s denote:\n   - \\( h(x) \\): depth of water at position \\( x \\) along the bed.\n   - \\( v(x) \\): velocity of water at position \\( x \\).\n\n   Assuming uniform flow and that the velocity remains constant (which may not be accurate, but simplifying for now), the absorption rate per unit length is \\( v_a \\times d \\).\n\n   The change in water depth over the length \\( L \\) due to absorption is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dh}{dx} = -v_a\n   \\]\n   Integrating from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = L \\):\n   \\[\n   h(L) - h(0) = -v_a L\n   \\]\n   Given that the bed completely absorbs the water, \\( h(L) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   -h(0) = -v_a L \\implies L = \\frac{h(0)}{v_a} = \\frac{0.4 \\, \\text{m}}{0.008 \\, \\text{m/s}} = 50 \\, \\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n   However, this gives the time, not the length.\n\n3. **Relate time to length using flow velocity:**\n   The time \\( t \\) it takes for the water to travel the length \\( L \\) is:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{L}{v}\n   \\]\n   From the previous step, \\( t = 50 \\) s, so:\n   \\[\n   L = v \\times t = 2 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times 50 \\, \\text{s} = 100 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\nAgain, this matches the earlier calculation of 100 meters, which is not among the options.\n\n### Possible Misinterpretation:\nPerhaps the absorption velocity is not to be multiplied by the depth into the paper. Let's consider absorption only in the direction perpendicular to the flow.\n\n1. **Absorption rate per unit area:**\n   If the absorption velocity \\( v_a \\) is purely vertical, then the absorption rate per unit area of the bed is \\( v_a \\).\n\n   Therefore, the total absorption rate for the entire bed is:\n   \\[\n   q_{\\text{total}} = v_a \\times L \\times d = 0.008 \\, \\text{m/s} \\times L \\times 5 \\, \\text{m} = 0.04 L \\, \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set equal to the inflow rate:**\n   \\[\n   0.04 L = 4 \\implies L = \\frac{4}{0.04} = 100 \\, \\text{m}\n   \\]\n\nThis again gives 100 meters, which is not among the options.\n\n### Considering Units and Dimensions:\n- Check units:\n  - \\( v_a = 8 \\) mm/s = 0.008 m/s\n  - \\( d = 5 \\) m\n  - \\( h = 0.4 \\) m\n  - \\( v = 2 \\) m/s\n\n- Volume flow rate \\( Q = 4 \\) m\u00b3/s\n- Absorption rate per meter of bed: \\( q = v_a \\times d = 0.008 \\times 5 = 0.04 \\) m\u00b3/s/m\n\n- Therefore, \\( L = \\frac{Q}{q} = \\frac{4}{0.04} = 100 \\) m\n\n### Possible Error in Problem Statement or Options:\nGiven the calculations consistently point to 100 meters, it's possible there is an error in the problem statement or the provided options. Alternatively, perhaps there is an assumption in the problem that needs to be reconsidered.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{100 \\, \\text{m}} \\]"
