The system consists of two reservoirs at different elevations. The upper reservoir is labeled with a water temperature of 20\u00b0C and an elevation of Z\u2081 = 150 ft. The lower reservoir has an elevation of Z\u2082 = 25 ft. Water flows from the upper reservoir through a pipe to the pump-turbine, which then discharges the water into the lower reservoir.\n\nThe pump-turbine is shown in the middle of the diagram, indicating its dual functionality: it acts as a turbine during the day to generate power and as a pump at night to move water back to the upper reservoir. The friction head loss in the system is specified as 17 ft.\n\nThe question asks for the power extracted by the turbine when operating at a design flow rate of 15,000 gallons per minute (gal/min) in either direction. The options provided are:\nA. 540 hp\nB. 334 hp\nC. 410 hp\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe pump-turbine system in Fig. P3.135 draws water from the upper reservoir in the daytime to produce power for a city. At night, it pumps water from lower to upper reservoirs to restore the situation. For a design flow rate of 15,000 gal/min in either direction, the friction head loss is 17 ft. Estimate the power in kW extracted by the turbine. <image 1>\n\nA. 540 hp\nB. 334 hp\nC. 410 hp\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the power extracted by the turbine when operating at a design flow rate of 15,000 gallons per minute (gal/min), given the elevations of the reservoirs and the friction head loss in the system.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given data:\n\n- Upper reservoir elevation, \\( z_1 = 150 \\) ft\n\n- Lower reservoir elevation, \\( z_2 = 25 \\) ft\n\n- Friction head loss, \\( h_f = 17 \\) ft\n\n- Design flow rate, \\( Q = 15,000 \\) gal/min\n\nWe need to find the power extracted by the turbine in horsepower (hp), and the options are:\n\nA. 540 hp\n\nB. 334 hp\n\nC. 410 hp\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Determine the net head available for the turbine:**\n\n   The net head (\\( h \\)) available for the turbine is the difference in elevation between the upper and lower reservoirs minus the friction head loss.\n\n   \\[\n   h = z_1 - z_2 - h_f\n   \\]\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n\n   \\[\n   h = 150 \\, \\text{ft} - 25 \\, \\text{ft} - 17 \\, \\text{ft} = 108 \\, \\text{ft}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the flow rate from gallons per minute to cubic feet per second:**\n\n   - 1 gallon = 0.133681 cubic feet\n\n   - 1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n   So,\n\n   \\[\n   Q = 15,000 \\, \\text{gal/min} \\times \\frac{0.133681 \\, \\text{ft}^3}{1 \\, \\text{gal}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = 15,000 \\times 0.133681 \\div 60 \\approx 33.42 \\, \\text{ft}^3/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the power extracted by the turbine:**\n\n   The power (\\( P \\)) extracted by the turbine can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   P = \\rho \\cdot g \\cdot Q \\cdot h\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n\n   - \\( \\rho \\) is the density of water (1.94 slug/ft\u00b3 or 62.4 lb/ft\u00b3)\n\n   - \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (32.2 ft/s\u00b2)\n\n   However, in engineering practice, a simplified formula is often used:\n\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot Q \\cdot h \\cdot g}{550}\n   \\]\n\n   But since power in horsepower (hp) can also be expressed as:\n\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{\\rho \\cdot Q \\cdot h}{550}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( \\rho \\) is in lb/ft\u00b3, \\( Q \\) is in ft\u00b3/s, and \\( h \\) is in ft.\n\n   Given that \\( \\rho = 62.4 \\) lb/ft\u00b3, \\( Q = 33.42 \\) ft\u00b3/s, and \\( h = 108 \\) ft:\n\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{62.4 \\times 33.42 \\times 108}{550}\n   \\]\n\n   Let's calculate the numerator first:\n\n   \\[\n   62.4 \\times 33.42 = 2084.128 \\, \\text{lb*ft}^3/\\text{s*ft}^3 = 2084.128 \\, \\text{lb*ft/s}\n   \\]\n\n   Then,\n\n   \\[\n   2084.128 \\times 108 = 225,151.824 \\, \\text{lb*ft}^2/\\text{s}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, divide by 550 to get horsepower:\n\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{225,151.824}{550} \\approx 409.37 \\, \\text{hp}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compare with the given options:**\n\n   The calculated power is approximately 409.37 hp, which is closest to option C. 410 hp.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C. \\, 410 \\, \\text{hp}} \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
