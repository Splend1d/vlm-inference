                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to estimate the mass flow rate of water exiting the nozzle into sea-level air, given the centerline pressure at section (1) and assuming no losses in the system. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System\n\nWe have a water jet exiting from a nozzle with a diameter of 4 cm into sea-level air. The water flows through a larger pipe with a diameter of 12 cm before entering the nozzle. The centerline pressure at section (1), which is upstream of the nozzle, is 110 kPa. We need to find the mass flow rate in kg/s.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant Equations\n\nSince we are dealing with fluid dynamics and mass flow rate, the following equations will be useful:\n\n1. **Continuity Equation**: This relates the flow velocities at different cross-sections.\n2. **Bernoulli's Equation**: This relates pressure, velocity, and elevation in an incompressible fluid flow.\n\nGiven that losses are neglected, Bernoulli's equation can be applied between two points in the flow.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Bernoulli's Equation\n\nLet's apply Bernoulli's equation between section (1) and the nozzle exit (section 2).\n\nBernoulli's equation is:\n\n\\[\nP_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2\n\\]\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The flow is incompressible (water is incompressible).\n- The pipe is horizontal, so elevation changes can be neglected (\\(h_1 = h_2\\)).\n- Pressure at the nozzle exit (\\(P_2\\)) is atmospheric pressure since it's open to the air.\n\nGiven that, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nP_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_1^2 = P_{atm} + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine Known Values\n\n- Diameter of the larger pipe (\\(d_1\\)) = 12 cm = 0.12 m\n- Diameter of the nozzle (\\(d_2\\)) = 4 cm = 0.04 m\n- Centerline pressure at section (1), \\(P_1\\) = 110 kPa\n- Atmospheric pressure, \\(P_{atm}\\) = 101.325 kPa (assuming standard sea-level pressure)\n- Density of water, \\(\\rho\\) \u2248 1000 kg/m\u00b3\n\n### Step 5: Continuity Equation\n\nThe continuity equation for incompressible flow is:\n\n\\[\nA_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area and \\(v\\) is the velocity.\n\nFirst, calculate the areas:\n\n\\[\nA_1 = \\frac{\\pi d_1^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.12)^2}{4} \u2248 0.01131 m\u00b2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA_2 = \\frac{\\pi d_2^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.04)^2}{4} \u2248 0.001257 m\u00b2\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Relate Velocities\n\nFrom continuity:\n\n\\[\nv_1 = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} v_2 = \\frac{0.001257}{0.01131} v_2 \u2248 0.111 v_2\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Substitute into Bernoulli's Equation\n\nSubstitute \\(v_1\\) from continuity into Bernoulli's equation:\n\n\\[\nP_1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho (0.111 v_2)^2 = P_{atm} + \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v_2^2\n\\]\n\nPlug in the known values:\n\n\\[\n110,000 + \\frac{1}{2} (1000) (0.111 v_2)^2 = 101,325 + \\frac{1}{2} (1000) v_2^2\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n110,000 + 500 (0.111 v_2)^2 = 101,325 + 500 v_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n110,000 + 500 (0.012321 v_2^2) = 101,325 + 500 v_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n110,000 + 6.1605 v_2^2 = 101,325 + 500 v_2^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Solve for \\(v_2\\)\n\nRearrange the equation:\n\n\\[\n110,000 - 101,325 = 500 v_2^2 - 6.1605 v_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\n8,675 = 493.8395 v_2^2\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_2^2 = \\frac{8,675}{493.8395} \u2248 17.56\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv_2 \u2248 \\sqrt{17.56} \u2248 4.19 m/s\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Calculate Mass Flow Rate\n\nMass flow rate (\\(\\dot{m}\\)) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = \\rho A_2 v_2\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m} = 1000 \\times 0.001257 \\times 4.19 \u2248 5.25 kg/s\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[ \\boxed{5.25\\ \\text{kg/s}} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe mass flow rate of the water is approximately 5.25 kg/s, which corresponds to option C. This result was obtained by applying Bernoulli's equation and the continuity equation to relate the pressures and velocities at different points in the system, and then calculating the mass flow rate based on the velocity at the nozzle exit."
