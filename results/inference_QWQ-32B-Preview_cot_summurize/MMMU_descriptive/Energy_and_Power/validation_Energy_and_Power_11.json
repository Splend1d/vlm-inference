The axes are labeled with \"P\" for pressure on the vertical axis and \"V\" for volume on the horizontal axis. There are three points labeled 1, 2, and 3 on the graph. \n\n- Point 1 is located at the top left corner of the graph.\n- Point 2 is located towards the bottom right, indicating a decrease in pressure and an increase in volume compared to point 1.\n- Point 3 is located between points 1 and 2, indicating a decrease in pressure but a smaller increase in volume compared to point 1.\n\nThe process from point 1 to point 2 is described as adiabatic, meaning there is no heat transfer (Q = 0) during this process. The process from point 2 to point 3 is described as isothermal, meaning the temperature remains constant (\u0394T = 0) during this process.\n\nBased on the adiabatic process from point 1 to point 2, we can conclude that:\n- Since the process is adiabatic (Q = 0), option B or C could be correct regarding heat transfer.\n- Since the volume increases from point 1 to point 2, the temperature must decrease (\u0394T < 0) because for an ideal gas, an adiabatic expansion results in a decrease in temperature.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement about the change in temperature and heat transferred during 1-2 is:\n\nB. \u0394T < 0, Q = 0\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n An ideal gas is taken from state 1 to state 2 and then to state 3.  <image 1>If the process 1-2 is adiabatic and 2-3 is isothermal, what is a true statement about the change in temperature and heat transferred during 1-2?\n\nA.  $\\Delta $T > 0, Q > 0\nB.  $\\Delta $T < 0, Q = 0 \nC.  $\\Delta $T = 0, Q = 0 \nD.  $\\Delta $T > 0, Q < 0 \nE.  $\\Delta $T = 0, Q < 0\n"

Therefore, Q = 0.\n     - For an ideal gas undergoing adiabatic expansion, as volume increases, pressure decreases, and temperature decreases. So, \u0394T < 0.\n   - **Process 2-3:** Isothermal expansion.\n     - Isothermal processes occur at constant temperature, so \u0394T = 0.\n     - During isothermal expansion, heat is absorbed by the gas to compensate for the work done by the gas.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options for Process 1-2:**\n   - **Option A:** \u0394T > 0, Q > 0\n     - This suggests that temperature increases and heat is added. However, in adiabatic expansion, temperature decreases and no heat is transferred (Q = 0). So, this is incorrect.\n   - **Option B:** \u0394T < 0, Q = 0\n     - This matches our understanding of adiabatic expansion: temperature decreases and no heat is transferred. This seems correct.\n   - **Option C:** \u0394T = 0, Q = 0\n     - This would imply an isothermal process with no heat transfer, which contradicts the properties of both adiabatic and isothermal processes.\n   - **Option D:** \u0394T > 0, Q < 0\n     - This suggests that temperature increases while heat is released, which is not consistent with adiabatic expansion.\n   - **Option E:** \u0394T = 0, Q < 0\n     - This would imply an isothermal process with heat release, which is not accurate for adiabatic expansion.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that process 1-2 is adiabatic, we have Q = 0 and \u0394T < 0.\n   - Therefore, the correct choice is B. \u0394T < 0, Q = 0.\n\nThis reasoning is based on the fundamental principles of thermodynamics applied to ideal gases, specifically focusing on adiabatic and isothermal processes."
