                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the surface temperature of a hemispherical heat source embedded in a large silicon substrate, given the heat dissipation rate and the thermal properties of the substrate.\n\n### Given Data:\n- Radius of the hemisphere, \\( r_o = 0.1 \\) mm = \\( 0.1 \\times 10^{-3} \\) m\n- Thermal conductivity of silicon, \\( k = 125 \\) W/m\u00b7K\n- Ambient temperature, \\( T_\\infty = 27^\\circ C = 300.15 \\) K\n- Heat dissipation rate, \\( q = 4 \\) W\n\n### Approach:\n1. **Understand the Geometry and Boundary Conditions:**\n   - The heat source is a hemisphere embedded in a large silicon substrate.\n   - The substrate is maintained at ambient temperature \\( T_\\infty \\) on all boundaries except the top surface, which is well insulated.\n\n2. **Heat Transfer Analysis:**\n   - Since the top surface is insulated, heat can only dissipate through the base of the hemisphere into the substrate.\n   - We can model this as steady-state heat conduction from a hemisphere into an infinite medium.\n\n3. **Heat Dissipation Equation:**\n   - For a hemisphere embedded in a medium, the heat dissipation \\( q \\) can be related to the temperature difference between the surface of the hemisphere and the ambient temperature through the thermal resistance.\n\n4. **Thermal Resistance:**\n   - The thermal resistance \\( R \\) for heat conduction through the hemisphere can be derived from the heat equation.\n   - For a hemisphere, the thermal resistance can be approximated using the formula for a sphere and adjusting for the hemisphere.\n\n5. **Temperature Calculation:**\n   - The surface temperature \\( T_s \\) can be found using the relation \\( q = k \\cdot A \\cdot \\frac{T_s - T_\\infty}{L} \\), where \\( A \\) is the area and \\( L \\) is the characteristic length.\n   - However, for a hemisphere, a more accurate approach is needed.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo find the surface temperature \\( T_s \\) of the hemisphere, we need to solve the heat conduction equation in spherical coordinates considering the boundary conditions.\n\n#### Step 1: Governing Equation\nIn spherical coordinates, the steady-state heat conduction equation is:\n\\[\n\\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) = 0\n\\]\nAssuming radial symmetry, this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 k \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2: Solving the Differential Equation\nIntegrate the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = 0\n\\]\nIntegrate once:\n\\[\nr^2 \\frac{dT}{dr} = C_1\n\\]\nIntegrate again:\n\\[\nT(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2\n\\]\n\n#### Step 3: Applying Boundary Conditions\n1. At \\( r \\to \\infty \\), \\( T(r) \\to T_\\infty \\):\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{C_1}{\\infty} + C_2 = T_\\infty \\implies C_2 = T_\\infty\n   \\]\n2. At the surface of the hemisphere \\( r = r_o \\), the heat flux is equal to the dissipation rate per unit area:\n   \\[\n   -k \\left. \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right|_{r=r_o} = q_{\\text{surf}}\n   \\]\n   where \\( q_{\\text{surf}} = \\frac{q}{2 \\pi r_o^2} \\) (since the hemisphere has surface area \\( 2 \\pi r_o^2 \\)).\n\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   -k \\left( \\frac{C_1}{r_o^2} \\right) = \\frac{q}{2 \\pi r_o^2}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( C_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   C_1 = -\\frac{q}{2 \\pi k}\n   \\]\n\n#### Step 4: Surface Temperature\nThe surface temperature \\( T_s \\) at \\( r = r_o \\) is:\n\\[\nT_s = T(r_o) = -\\frac{C_1}{r_o} + T_\\infty = \\frac{q}{2 \\pi k r_o} + T_\\infty\n\\]\n\n#### Step 5: Plugging in the Values\n\\[\nT_s = \\frac{4 \\text{ W}}{2 \\pi \\times 125 \\text{ W/m\u00b7K} \\times 0.1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}} + 300.15 \\text{ K}\n\\]\n\\[\nT_s = \\frac{4}{2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 125 \\times 0.1 \\times 10^{-3}} + 300.15\n\\]\n\\[\nT_s = \\frac{4}{0.07854} + 300.15\n\\]\n\\[\nT_s \\approx 50.93 + 300.15 = 351.08 \\text{ K}\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[ \\boxed{350.93 \\text{ K}} \\]\n\n### Explanation\nThe surface temperature of the heat source is approximately 350.93 K when dissipating 4 W of power. This result is obtained by solving the steady-state heat conduction equation in spherical coordinates, applying the boundary conditions, and calculating the temperature at the surface of the hemisphere."
