                    "text": "I'm going to tackle this fluid mechanics problem step by step. Let's see what's being asked here.\n\nSo, we have a tank filled with water at 20\u00b0C, and there's a plug with a diameter of 4 cm that's positioned at an angle of 50\u00b0 from the horizontal. This plug will pop out when the hydrostatic force acting on it reaches 25 Newtons. There's also a manometer attached to the tank, showing a height h above the mercury level, and we need to find this height h when the plug pops out.\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the forces involved here. The hydrostatic force on the plug is due to the pressure of the water in the tank. Since the plug is submerged, the pressure increases with depth, and the force will depend on the depth and the area of the plug.\n\nLet me recall the basic formula for hydrostatic pressure:\n\n\\[ p = \\rho g d \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( p \\) is the pressure,\n\n- \\( \\rho \\) is the density of the fluid,\n\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity,\n\n- \\( d \\) is the depth below the surface.\n\nThe hydrostatic force on a surface is given by:\n\n\\[ F = p \\cdot A \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( F \\) is the force,\n\n- \\( A \\) is the area of the surface.\n\nBut wait, this seems too simplistic because the plug is at an angle. I think I need to consider the component of the pressure force that's perpendicular to the plug's surface.\n\nActually, in fluid statics, the pressure acts perpendicular to the surface, so maybe I don't need to worry about the angle. Hmm.\n\nLet me think again. The plug is at an angle of 50\u00b0 from the horizontal, which might mean that the depth d needs to be considered carefully.\n\nMaybe I should draw a diagram to visualize this better.\n\n[Imagining a diagram: a tank with water, a plug inserted at an angle of 50\u00b0, and a manometer attached to the tank showing height h.]\n\nOkay, so the manometer is measuring the pressure difference in the tank. Manometers work based on the difference in liquid levels, which corresponds to a pressure difference.\n\nThe manometer has mercury in it, so I need to consider the density of mercury as well.\n\nFirst, I should find the pressure required to exert a force of 25 N on the plug.\n\nGiven that force \\( F = p \\cdot A \\), I can solve for pressure \\( p \\):\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{F}{A} \\]\n\nI know F is 25 N, and I need to find the area A of the plug.\n\nThe plug has a diameter of 4 cm, so radius r is 2 cm or 0.02 m.\n\nThe area A is:\n\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (0.02)^2 = 0.0012566 m^2 \\]\n\nSo, the pressure p is:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{25}{0.0012566} \\approx 19894.37 \\, \\text{Pa} \\]\n\nNow, this pressure p is the gauge pressure acting on the plug due to the water in the tank.\n\nBut there's also the manometer showing a height h, which is related to the pressure in the tank.\n\nI need to relate the pressure p to the manometer reading h.\n\nFirst, I need to know the densities of the fluids involved.\n\nGiven that the fluids are at 20\u00b0C, I can look up their densities.\n\nFor water at 20\u00b0C, the density \\( \\rho_{water} \\) is approximately 998.2 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nFor mercury, the density \\( \\rho_{Hg} \\) is approximately 13546 kg/m\u00b3.\n\nNow, in a manometer, the pressure difference is given by the difference in heights of the columns of different densities.\n\nThe manometer probably has one side open to the atmosphere, so it measures the gauge pressure in the tank.\n\nThe pressure difference \\( \\Delta p \\) is related to h by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = \\rho_{Hg} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\]\n\nBut wait, in a manometer, the pressure difference is due to the difference in heights of the fluids. However, without knowing the exact configuration of the manometer (e.g., U-tube, single-column, etc.), it's a bit tricky.\n\nAssuming it's a simple U-tube manometer with one side open to atmosphere, then:\n\n\\[ p_{tank} - p_{atm} = \\rho_{Hg} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\]\n\nBut in this problem, it's possible that the manometer is filled with both water and mercury, or perhaps just mercury.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"the manometer shows a height h above the mercury level,\" which suggests that there is mercury in the manometer, and h is the height of some other fluid above the mercury.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider the specific gravities or densities of the fluids in the manometer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the manometer is filled with mercury, and h is the difference in mercury levels between the two sides.\n\nIn that case, the pressure difference would be:\n\n\\[ \\Delta p = \\rho_{Hg} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\]\n\nGiven that the plug pops out when the hydrostatic force reaches 25 N, which corresponds to a pressure p = 19894.37 Pa, and assuming that this pressure is equal to the pressure measured by the manometer, then:\n\n\\[ 19894.37 = \\rho_{Hg} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ 19894.37 = 13546 \\cdot 9.81 \\cdot h \\]\n\nSolving for h:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{19894.37}{13546 \\cdot 9.81} \\approx \\frac{19894.37}{132879.66} \\approx 0.15 \\, \\text{m} \\]\n\nSo, h is approximately 0.15 m, which corresponds to option A. 0.152 m.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions \"20\u00b0C fluids,\" which might imply that both water and mercury are at 20\u00b0C, but mercury's density doesn't change much with temperature, so using 13546 kg/m\u00b3 should be fine.\n\nAlso, I assumed that the manometer is a simple U-tube manometer with mercury, and h is the difference in mercury levels. Is that a correct assumption based on the problem description?\n\nThe problem says, \"a manometer attached to the tank, showing a height h above the mercury level.\" This might mean that the manometer has mercury, and h is the height of another fluid above the mercury level, but without the figure, it's hard to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the manometer is measuring the pressure in the tank relative to atmospheric pressure, and h is the height of mercury column that corresponds to that pressure difference.\n\nIn that case, my earlier approach should be correct.\n\nGiven that, the calculation suggests h \u2248 0.15 m, which matches option A. 0.152 m.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's any angle effect that I missed.\n\nThe plug is at an angle of 50\u00b0 from the horizontal. Does this affect the pressure calculation?\n\nIn fluid statics, pressure acts perpendicular to the surface, so the angle might affect the effective area exposed to the pressure.\n\nWait, actually, in the force calculation, since pressure acts perpendicular to the surface, and the area is also considered perpendicular to the pressure, perhaps the angle doesn't affect the force calculation.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe hydrostatic force on a plane surface is given by:\n\n\\[ F = p_{avg} \\cdot A \\]\n\nwhere \\( p_{avg} \\) is the average pressure on the surface.\n\nFor a vertical surface, \\( p_{avg} = \\rho g h \\), where h is the depth to the centroid of the area.\n\nBut in this case, the plug is at an angle, so maybe I need to consider the vertical projection of the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since pressure acts perpendicular to the surface, and the area is inclined, I need to consider the effective area.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe for the purpose of this problem, the angle doesn't significantly affect the calculation, and the earlier approach is sufficient.\n\nGiven that, the answer should be h \u2248 0.15 m, which corresponds to option A. 0.152 m.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.152 \\, \\text{m}} \\]\n\n**Explanation**\n\nTo solve this problem, we first calculated the pressure required to exert a force of 25 N on a 4-cm-diameter plug using the formula \\( p = \\frac{F}{A} \\). Given the area of the plug, we found the pressure to be approximately 19894.37 Pa. Assuming this pressure is equal to the gauge pressure measured by the manometer, we used the manometer's relationship \\( \\Delta p = \\rho_{Hg} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\) to find the height \\( h \\). Solving for \\( h \\), we obtained approximately 0.15 m, which matches option A. The angle of the plug was considered but determined not to significantly affect the calculation in this context."
