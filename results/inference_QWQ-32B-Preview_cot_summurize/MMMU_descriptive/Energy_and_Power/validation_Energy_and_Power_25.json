                    "text": "I've got this problem about a gas-turbine power plant operating on the Brayton cycle. Let me try to work through it step by step. I need to find the net power output and the back work ratio. The plant has a compressor and a turbine, and there's a combustion chamber in between where heat is added.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the cycle. The Brayton cycle has four processes:\n\n1. Isentropic compression in the compressor.\n\n2. Constant pressure heat addition in the combustion chamber.\n\n3. Isentropic expansion in the turbine.\n\n4. Constant pressure heat rejection, which in this case isn't explicitly mentioned, but it's implied as the cycle closes.\n\nGiven data:\n\n- Pressure limits: 100 kPa to 1600 kPa.\n\n- Air enters the compressor at 40\u00b0C (313 K) and 100 kPa.\n\n- Air leaves the turbine at 650\u00b0C (923 K).\n\n- Compressor isentropic efficiency: 85%.\n\n- Turbine isentropic efficiency: 88%.\n\n- Air flow rate: 850 m\u00b3/min.\n\nSince the flow rate is given in volume per time, I need to find the mass flow rate. For that, I can use the ideal gas law:\n\nPV = mRT\n\nSo, m = PV / (RT)\n\nAt the inlet of the compressor:\n\nP1 = 100 kPa\n\nT1 = 313 K\n\nV1 = 850 m\u00b3/min = 850/60 = 14.1667 m\u00b3/s\n\nR for air is approximately 287 J/kg\u00b7K.\n\nSo, mass flow rate, m_dot = P1*V1 / (R*T1) = (100,000 Pa * 14.1667 m\u00b3/s) / (287 J/kg\u00b7K * 313 K)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nNumerator: 100,000 * 14.1667 = 1,416,670,000 Pa\u00b7m\u00b3/s = 1,416,670 N\u00b7m/s = 1,416,670 W\n\nDenominator: 287 * 313 = 90,031 J/kg\u00b7K\n\nSo, m_dot = 1,416,670 / 90,031 \u2248 15.735 kg/s\n\nWait, that seems too high. Let's check the units.\n\nActually, 100,000 Pa * 14.1667 m\u00b3/s = 1,416,670 N\u00b7m/s = 1,416,670 W\n\nBut m_dot = P*V/(R*T), which is mass flow rate.\n\nWait, no. The ideal gas law is P*V = m*R*T for a given mass m.\n\nSo, m = P*V/(R*T)\n\nSo, m_dot = P*V_dot/(R*T), where V_dot is the volumetric flow rate.\n\nBut in this case, P and T are at the inlet conditions.\n\nSo, m_dot = (100,000 Pa * 14.1667 m\u00b3/s) / (287 J/kg\u00b7K * 313 K)\n\nCalculate numerator: 100,000 * 14.1667 = 1,416,670,000 Pa\u00b7m\u00b3/s = 1,416,670 N\u00b7m/s = 1,416,670 W\n\nDenominator: 287 * 313 = 90,031 J/kg\u00b7K\n\nSo, m_dot = 1,416,670 / 90,031 \u2248 15.735 kg/s\n\nHmm, that seems too high. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, 850 m\u00b3/min is 850/60 = 14.1667 m\u00b3/s\n\nBut perhaps the air density at 100 kPa and 313 K is not giving such a low mass flow rate.\n\nLet me calculate the specific volume at state 1.\n\nFrom the ideal gas law, v = RT/P\n\nv = (287 J/kg\u00b7K * 313 K) / 100,000 Pa = (287 * 313) / 100,000 = 90,031 / 100,000 = 0.90031 m\u00b3/kg\n\nSo, mass flow rate m_dot = V_dot / v = 14.1667 m\u00b3/s / 0.90031 m\u00b3/kg \u2248 15.735 kg/s\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the compressor and the turbine.\n\nFirst, the compressor:\n\nGiven:\n\n- Inlet: P1 = 100 kPa, T1 = 313 K\n\n- Outlet: P2 = 1600 kPa\n\n- Isentropic efficiency: 85%\n\nI need to find the actual work input to the compressor, W_c.\n\nFor an isentropic process in the compressor:\n\nP2s / P1 = (T2s / T1)^((k-1)/k)\n\nWhere k is the specific heat ratio.\n\nBut since I'm supposed to use variable specific heats, I shouldn't use this relation directly.\n\nInstead, I should look up enthalpies from air tables at the given temperatures and pressures.\n\nWait, but I don't have temperature T2s. Maybe I need to find it using isentropic relations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the isentropic efficiency formula:\n\n\u03b7_c = (h1 - h2s) / (h1 - h2)\n\nWhere h is enthalpy.\n\nBut to use this, I need to know h1, h2s, and h2.\n\nI think I need to find T2s first, then get h2s, and then find h2 using the efficiency.\n\nBut to find T2s, perhaps I can use the isentropic relation with variable specific heats.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the relation:\n\ns2s - s1 = R * ln(P2/P1)\n\nSince the process is isentropic, s2s = s1.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. In an isentropic process, s2s = s1.\n\nSo, s2s - s1 = 0.\n\nBut I think I need to use the entropy change in terms of temperature and pressure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up s1 and s2s from air tables.\n\nBut I need to find T2s corresponding to P2 and s1.\n\nThis seems complicated without specific air tables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume constant specific heats for this part, and then correct using the efficiency.\n\nLet me look up the specific heats for air at average temperature.\n\nBut the problem says to use variable specific heats, so I need to find a way to account for that.\n\nMaybe I should look up enthalpy and entropy values at different temperatures and pressures.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for air tables or use thermodynamic properties from a software or chart.\n\nAssuming I have access to air tables, I can find the enthalpy and entropy at different temperatures.\n\nLet me assume I have access to such tables.\n\nFirst, find s1 and h1 at P1 = 100 kPa and T1 = 313 K.\n\nFrom air tables:\n\nAt 313 K, P = 100 kPa:\n\nAssuming I have h1 and s1.\n\nSimilarly, at P2 = 1600 kPa, find T2s such that s2s = s1.\n\nThen, find h2s at T2s and P2.\n\nThen, using the compressor efficiency:\n\n\u03b7_c = (h1 - h2s) / (h1 - h2)\n\nSo, h2 = h1 - (h1 - h2s)/\u03b7_c\n\nThen, the actual work input to the compressor is:\n\nW_c = h2 - h1\n\nSimilarly, for the turbine:\n\nGiven:\n\n- Inlet: P3 = 1600 kPa, T3 = 923 K\n\n- Outlet: P4 = 100 kPa\n\n- Isentropic efficiency: 88%\n\nI need to find the actual work output from the turbine, W_t.\n\nFor the turbine, the isentropic process would be from P3 to P4 with s4s = s3.\n\nFind T4s corresponding to P4 and s4s = s3.\n\nThen, find h4s at T4s and P4.\n\nThen, using turbine efficiency:\n\n\u03b7_t = (h3 - h4) / (h3 - h4s)\n\nSo, h4 = h3 - \u03b7_t * (h3 - h4s)\n\nThen, the actual work output from the turbine is:\n\nW_t = h3 - h4\n\nFinally, the net work output is:\n\nW_net = W_t - W_c\n\nAnd the back work ratio is:\n\nBWR = W_c / W_t\n\nSo, I need to find h1, h2s, h2, h3, h4s, h4.\n\nBut to find these, I need to look up the enthalpy and entropy values from air tables at the respective temperatures and pressures.\n\nSince I don't have actual tables, I'll have to assume some values or find a way to approximate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the properties of air at different temperatures from standard tables.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps again:\n\n1. Find h1 and s1 at P1 = 100 kPa and T1 = 313 K.\n\n2. For the compressor isentropic process:\n\n   - P2s = P2 = 1600 kPa\n\n   - s2s = s1\n\n   - Find T2s corresponding to P2 and s2s = s1.\n\n   - Then, find h2s at T2s and P2.\n\n3. Using compressor efficiency:\n\n   \u03b7_c = (h1 - h2s) / (h1 - h2)\n\n   So, h2 = h1 - (h1 - h2s)/\u03b7_c\n\n4. Work input to compressor:\n\n   W_c = h2 - h1\n\n5. For the turbine:\n\n   - Inlet: P3 = P2 = 1600 kPa, T3 = 923 K\n\n   - Find h3 and s3 at P3 and T3.\n\n6. For the turbine isentropic process:\n\n   - P4s = P1 = 100 kPa\n\n   - s4s = s3\n\n   - Find T4s corresponding to P4 and s4s = s3.\n\n   - Then, find h4s at T4s and P4.\n\n7. Using turbine efficiency:\n\n   \u03b7_t = (h3 - h4) / (h3 - h4s)\n\n   So, h4 = h3 - \u03b7_t * (h3 - h4s)\n\n8. Work output from turbine:\n\n   W_t = h3 - h4\n\n9. Net work output:\n\n   W_net = W_t - W_c\n\n10. Back work ratio:\n\n    BWR = W_c / W_t\n\nNow, to proceed, I need to find the enthalpy and entropy values at the specified states.\n\nSince I don't have actual air tables, I'll have to make approximations or use standard values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the properties of air at different temperatures from standard sources.\n\nLet me try to find some approximate values.\n\nFrom standard air tables, at various temperatures:\n\nAt 313 K:\n\nAssume h1 \u2248 300 kJ/kg\n\ns1 \u2248 1.702 kJ/kg\u00b7K\n\nAt P2 = 1600 kPa, s2s = s1, need to find T2s.\n\nFrom air tables, find T2s corresponding to P2 and s2s = s1.\n\nThis requires interpolation, which is complicated without actual tables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume constant specific heats for this part.\n\nBut the problem specifies to use variable specific heats.\n\nThis is getting too complicated without actual thermodynamic tables for air.\n\nMaybe I should look for a way to simplify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that for the Brayton cycle, the net work is equal to the heat added minus the heat rejected.\n\nBut I still need to account for the inefficiencies in the compressor and turbine.\n\nThis is quite involved without access to thermodynamic property tables for air.\n\nPerhaps I should consider using an approximation or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the Brayton cycle with irreversibilities.\n\nBut again, without property values, it's difficult to proceed.\n\nGiven the complexity and the requirement to use variable specific heats, it's clear that access to thermodynamic property tables for air is necessary to solve this problem accurately.\n\nSince I don't have those tables, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options provided.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. (1) 6001 kW, (2) 0.436\n\nB. (1) 6181 kW, (2) 0.536\n\nC. (1) 6081 kW, (2) 0.536\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B.\n\nBut without actual calculations, it's impossible to determine with certainty.\n\nTherefore, I'll have to conclude that the answer is C: (1) 6081 kW, (2) 0.536\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{c} \\]"
