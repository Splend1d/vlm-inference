                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the height \\( h \\) of the unknown liquid in the bottom section of the container. The container is divided into three sections: the top section contains water, the middle section contains gasoline, and the bottom section contains an unknown liquid with a specific gravity (SG) of 1.60. The water and gasoline are open to the atmosphere and are at the same elevation. The water layer is 1.5 meters thick, and the gasoline layer is also 1.5 meters thick.\n\nFirst, let's recall that specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance, which is usually water at 4\u00b0C. Therefore, the density of the unknown liquid can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{unknown}} = \\text{SG} \\times \\rho_{\\text{water}} = 1.60 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 = 1600 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the hydrostatic pressure equilibrium in the container. Since the water and gasoline are open to the atmosphere and at the same elevation, the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline must be equal to the pressure at the interface between gasoline and the unknown liquid.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- \\( P_{\\text{atm}} \\) as the atmospheric pressure.\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\) as the density of water.\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\) as the density of gasoline.\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\) as the density of the unknown liquid.\n\n- \\( h_{\\text{water}} \\) as the height of the water layer.\n\n- \\( h_{\\text{gasoline}} \\) as the height of the gasoline layer.\n\n- \\( h \\) as the height of the unknown liquid.\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( h_{\\text{water}} = 1.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\n- \\( h_{\\text{gasoline}} = 1.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{water}} = 1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} = 700 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\) (assuming standard density for gasoline at 20\u00b0C)\n\n- \\( \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} = 1600 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\)\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the water layer is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{water}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}}\n\\]\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the gasoline layer is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{gasoline}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nSince the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline must equal the pressure at the interface between gasoline and the unknown liquid, we have:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{water}} = P_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( P_{\\text{water}} \\) and \\( P_{\\text{gasoline}} \\):\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nThe atmospheric pressure \\( P_{\\text{atm}} \\) cancels out:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} = \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel out \\( g \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} = \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nNow, plug in the known values:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{m} = 700 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{m} + 1600 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\times h\n\\]\n\nCalculate the left side:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\times 1.5 = 1500 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 \\cdot s^2\n\\]\n\nCalculate the first term on the right side:\n\n\\[\n700 \\times 1.5 = 1050 \\, \\text{kg/m}^2 \\cdot s^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n1500 = 1050 + 1600 \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1050 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n1500 - 1050 = 1600 \\cdot h\n\\]\n\n\\[\n450 = 1600 \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{450}{1600} = 0.28125 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result seems inconsistent with the provided options, which are much larger values. It's possible that there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let's reconsider the hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire column of fluids is in equilibrium with the atmosphere, and we need to consider the total pressure at the bottom of the unknown liquid.\n\nLet's try a different approach. The pressure at the bottom of the unknown liquid should be equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure contributions from each layer above it.\n\nSo, the pressure at the bottom is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nThe pressure at the top of the water layer is atmospheric pressure:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{top}} = P_{\\text{atm}}\n\\]\n\nThe pressure difference between the top and bottom should also be equal to the sum of the pressure contributions from each layer:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} - P_{\\text{top}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nBut since \\( P_{\\text{top}} = P_{\\text{atm}} \\), and \\( P_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h \\), substituting:\n\n\\[\n(P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h) - P_{\\text{atm}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nThis leads to:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nWhich doesn't make sense, indicating an error in this approach. Perhaps the misunderstanding lies in the arrangement of the liquids.\n\nLet's consider that the container has three layers stacked vertically: water on top, then gasoline, then the unknown liquid at the bottom. The pressure at the bottom of the container is due to the weight of all three layers.\n\nTherefore, the pressure at the bottom is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the bottom liquid is closed and not open to the atmosphere, this might not be the case. Perhaps the bottom liquid is open to the atmosphere as well, but the problem states that only the water and gasoline are open to the atmosphere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the container is open at both the top and the bottom, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's try to use the fact that the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline is equal to the pressure at the interface between gasoline and the unknown liquid.\n\nSo, pressure at the water-gasoline interface:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{water-gasoline}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}}\n\\]\n\nPressure at the gasoline-unknown liquid interface:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{gasoline-unknown}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nBut these two pressures should be equal:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{water-gasoline}} = P_{\\text{gasoline-unknown}}\n\\]\n\nWhich implies:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nWhich is not possible unless \\( h_{\\text{gasoline}} = 0 \\), which it's not. This suggests a misunderstanding in the problem setup.\n\nPerhaps the container is open at the top but closed at the bottom, with the unknown liquid sealed inside. In that case, the pressure at the bottom due to the unknown liquid would be:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nBut without additional information about the pressure at the bottom, it's difficult to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to equate the pressure at the bottom of the water layer to the pressure at the top of the unknown liquid, assuming the gasoline layer is in between.\n\nLet's try that:\n\nPressure at the bottom of the water layer:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom water}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}}\n\\]\n\nPressure at the top of the unknown liquid (bottom of the gasoline layer):\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{top unknown}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nFor equilibrium, the pressure at the top of the unknown liquid should be equal to the pressure at the bottom of the unknown liquid minus the pressure due to the unknown liquid's height:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{top unknown}} = P_{\\text{bottom unknown}} - \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nBut \\( P_{\\text{bottom unknown}} \\) is the pressure at the bottom of the container, which might be equal to atmospheric pressure if the container is open at the bottom, or some other value if it's closed.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, and I might be overthinking it. Let's try a simpler approach.\n\nAssuming the container is open at the top and closed at the bottom, and that the pressures at the top of the water and the top of the gasoline are both equal to atmospheric pressure, then the pressure at the bottom of the container is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nHowever, without knowing \\( P_{\\text{bottom}} \\), we can't solve for \\( h \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem implies that the pressure at the bottom of the unknown liquid is equal to atmospheric pressure, meaning the container is open at the bottom as well. In that case:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = P_{\\text{atm}}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{atm}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nThis would imply:\n\n\\[\n0 = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}} + \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nWhich is only possible if all heights are zero, which is not the case. Therefore, this assumption is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the container is open at the top, and the bottom is sealed, with the unknown liquid pressing up against the seal.\n\nIn that case, the pressure at the bottom due to the unknown liquid is:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = \\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h\n\\]\n\nThis pressure must balance the combined pressure from the water and gasoline columns:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{bottom}} = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot g \\cdot h = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nAgain, the \\( g \\) terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_{\\text{unknown}} \\cdot h = \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n1600 \\cdot h = 1000 \\cdot 1.5 + 700 \\cdot 1.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1600 \\cdot h = 1500 + 1050\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1600 \\cdot h = 2550\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{2550}{1600} = 1.59375 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThis is approximately 1.594 meters, which is closest to option C. 1.52 m, but not exactly matching. Perhaps there's a rounding difference or an error in the assumed density of gasoline.\n\nLet's verify the density of gasoline at 20\u00b0C. The standard density for gasoline is approximately 740 kg/m\u00b3, not 700 kg/m\u00b3. Let's use 740 kg/m\u00b3 for more accuracy.\n\nUsing \\( \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} = 740 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3 \\):\n\n\\[\n1600 \\cdot h = 1000 \\cdot 1.5 + 740 \\cdot 1.5\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1600 \\cdot h = 1500 + 1110\n\\]\n\n\\[\n1600 \\cdot h = 2610\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{2610}{1600} = 1.63125 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThis is still closer to 1.594 m than to 1.52 m, but not matching exactly. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the pressure at the interface between water and gasoline equal to the pressure at the interface between gasoline and the unknown liquid, with the bottom open to atmosphere.\n\nIn that case:\n\nPressure at water-gasoline interface:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{water-gasoline}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}}\n\\]\n\nPressure at gasoline-unknown liquid interface:\n\n\\[\nP_{\\text{gasoline-unknown}} = P_{\\text{atm}} + \\rho_{\\text{water}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{water}} + \\rho_{\\text{gasoline}} \\cdot g \\cdot h_{\\text{gasoline}}\n\\]\n\nBut if the bottom is"
