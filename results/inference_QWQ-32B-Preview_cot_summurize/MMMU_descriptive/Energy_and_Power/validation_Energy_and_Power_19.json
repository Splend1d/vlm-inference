                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to apply the principles of conservation of mass and momentum to the combustion chamber of the jet engine. The test stand support reaction \\( R_x \\) is essentially the force required to counterbalance the thrust produced by the engine.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the mass flow rate of air entering the combustion chamber\n\nGiven:\n- Air inlet conditions: \\( T_1 = 20^\\circ C = 293 \\, K \\), \\( P_1 = 1 \\, atm = 101325 \\, Pa \\), \\( A_1 = 0.5 \\, m^2 \\), \\( V_1 = 250 \\, m/s \\)\n\nFirst, find the density of air at inlet conditions using the ideal gas law:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{P_1}{R T_1}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( R \\) is the specific gas constant for air, approximately \\( 287 \\, J/(kg \\cdot K) \\).\n\n\\[\n\\rho_1 = \\frac{101325}{287 \\times 293} \\approx 1.204 \\, kg/m^3\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the mass flow rate of air (\\( \\dot{m}_{air} \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{air} = \\rho_1 \\times A_1 \\times V_1 = 1.204 \\times 0.5 \\times 250 \\approx 150.5 \\, kg/s\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the mass flow rate of fuel\n\nGiven the fuel-air ratio is 1:30, meaning 1 unit of fuel mass per 30 units of air mass.\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{fuel} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{air}}{30} = \\frac{150.5}{30} \\approx 5.017 \\, kg/s\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the total mass flow rate at the outlet\n\nAssuming complete combustion, the total mass flow rate at the outlet (\\( \\dot{m}_{total} \\)) is the sum of the air and fuel mass flow rates.\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_{air} + \\dot{m}_{fuel} = 150.5 + 5.017 \\approx 155.517 \\, kg/s\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the velocity and area at the outlet\n\nGiven:\n- Outlet conditions: \\( P_2 = 1 \\, atm \\), \\( V_2 = 900 \\, m/s \\), \\( A_2 = 0.4 \\, m^2 \\)\n\nWe can verify the mass flow rate at the outlet using the density at outlet conditions. However, since pressure and temperature are the same as inlet for simplicity (though temperature might change due to combustion), we can use the same density. But for accuracy, let's assume the density changes due to temperature rise from combustion.\n\nHowever, for this problem, we'll assume the density at the outlet is similar to the inlet for simplicity, unless specific temperature data is provided.\n\nThus, using the same density as inlet:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_2 \\approx 1.204 \\, kg/m^3\n\\]\n\nThen, the mass flow rate at the outlet should be:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{outlet} = \\rho_2 \\times A_2 \\times V_2 = 1.204 \\times 0.4 \\times 900 \\approx 433.44 \\, kg/s\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Reconcile mass flow rates\n\nThere is a discrepancy here because the mass flow rate at the outlet (433.44 kg/s) does not match the total mass flow rate from air and fuel (155.517 kg/s). This suggests that either the density at the outlet is different due to temperature changes or there is a mistake in assumptions.\n\nGiven this discrepancy, let's consider that the density changes due to temperature increase from combustion. We need to find the actual density at the outlet based on the given pressure and velocity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area or velocity at the outlet is such that the mass flow rate is higher, which might indicate a different temperature or density. However, this seems inconsistent with the mass conservation principle unless there's a mistake in the approach.\n\n### Step 6: Apply the principle of conservation of momentum\n\nThe thrust (\\( F \\)) produced by the engine can be found using the momentum equation:\n\n\\[\nF = \\dot{m} \\times (V_2 - V_1) + (P_2 - P_1) \\times A_2\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( P_1 = P_2 = 1 \\, atm \\), the pressure terms cancel out:\n\n\\[\nF = \\dot{m} \\times (V_2 - V_1)\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to determine the correct \\( \\dot{m} \\). From earlier, there's inconsistency in mass flow rates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mass flow rate at the outlet should be based on the given area and velocity, assuming density changes due to temperature.\n\nLet's assume that the mass flow rate at the outlet is indeed 433.44 kg/s, and the difference from the inlet mass flow rate is due to the fuel added.\n\nThen, the net thrust would be based on the change in momentum:\n\n\\[\nF = \\dot{m}_{outlet} \\times V_2 - \\dot{m}_{inlet} \\times V_1\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF = 433.44 \\times 900 - 150.5 \\times 250\n\\]\n\n\\[\nF = 390,096 - 37,625 = 352,471 \\, N\n\\]\n\nThis result seems too high and doesn't match any of the provided options, indicating a mistake in the approach.\n\n### Step 7: Reevaluate the approach\n\nGiven the discrepancy in mass flow rates, perhaps the density at the outlet is different due to temperature changes. Let's attempt to find the temperature at the outlet.\n\nAssuming complete combustion and using the stoichiometric relations, we can find the temperature of the products.\n\nHowever, this involves thermodynamic properties and combustion chemistry, which might be beyond the scope of this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the given data directly without delving into temperature calculations.\n\n### Step 8: Simplified approach using given data\n\nLet's consider that the mass flow rate at the outlet is given by the product of density, area, and velocity, but since temperature affects density, and temperature changes due to combustion, we need a better estimate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that the mass flow rate remains constant, which would only be true in steady flow without mass addition, but fuel is added, so mass increases.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's try to use the given options to backtrack.\n\n### Step 9: Consider the test stand support reaction\n\nThe test stand support reaction \\( R_x \\) is equal to the thrust produced by the engine, as it must counterbalance it.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 99,000 N\n\nB. 102,000 N\n\nC. 121,000 N\n\nOur earlier calculation gave 352,471 N, which is not among the options, indicating an error.\n\n### Step 10: Reconsider mass flow rate calculations\n\nPerhaps the mass flow rate at the outlet should be based on the continuity equation, considering the fuel addition.\n\nTotal mass flow rate at outlet:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{total} = \\dot{m}_{air} + \\dot{m}_{fuel} = 150.5 + 5.017 = 155.517 \\, kg/s\n\\]\n\nThen, using the outlet velocity and area to find the actual mass flow rate:\n\n\\[\n\\dot{m}_{outlet} = \\rho_2 \\times A_2 \\times V_2\n\\]\n\nBut we need to find \\( \\rho_2 \\). Assuming the outlet temperature is different due to combustion, we need to estimate it.\n\n### Step 11: Estimate outlet temperature\n\nFor hydrocarbon fuels, the combustion temperature can be quite high, around 2000-2500 K. However, without specific fuel data, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can assume that the outlet density is such that the mass flow rate matches the total mass flow rate.\n\nSet \\( \\dot{m}_{outlet} = \\dot{m}_{total} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\rho_2 = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{total}}{A_2 \\times V_2} = \\frac{155.517}{0.4 \\times 900} \\approx 0.432 \\, kg/m^3\n\\]\n\nNow, using the ideal gas law to find the outlet temperature \\( T_2 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\rho_2 = \\frac{P_2}{R T_2} \\implies T_2 = \\frac{P_2}{\\rho_2 R} = \\frac{101325}{0.432 \\times 287} \\approx 875 \\, K\n\\]\n\nThis seems low for a combustion temperature, suggesting a possible error in assumptions.\n\n### Step 12: Apply the steady flow energy equation\n\nTo find the outlet temperature more accurately, we can use the steady flow energy equation for the combustion process.\n\nAssuming complete combustion and no heat loss, the energy equation is:\n\n\\[\nh_{inlet} + h_{fuel} = h_{outlet}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( h \\) is the specific enthalpy.\n\nHowever, without specific enthalpy values or fuel type, this approach is not feasible here.\n\n### Step 13: Consider an alternative approach\n\nGiven the complexity introduced by combustion temperatures and thermodynamics, perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach, considering only momentum changes.\n\nAssume that the mass flow rate at the outlet is given by the product of density, area, and velocity, with density adjusted for temperature changes.\n\nHowever, without specific temperature data, this remains speculative.\n\n### Step 14: Look for another way to relate the given parameters\n\nGiven the inlet and outlet velocities and areas, perhaps we can find the force using the momentum change across the combustion chamber.\n\nFirst, find the mass flow rate at inlet and outlet, assuming density changes due to temperature.\n\nBut without temperature data, this is challenging.\n\n### Step 15: Consider the force due to pressure difference\n\nGiven that both inlet and outlet pressures are 1 atm, the pressure force terms cancel out.\n\nThus, the only force is due to the momentum change.\n\n### Step 16: Use the given options to infer the correct approach\n\nGiven the options are around 100,000 N, let's see if we can arrive at a similar value.\n\nAssume that the thrust \\( F \\) is equal to the mass flow rate times the velocity change.\n\n\\[\nF = \\dot{m} \\times (V_2 - V_1)\n\\]\n\nUsing the total mass flow rate:\n\n\\[\nF = 155.517 \\times (900 - 250) = 155.517 \\times 650 \\approx 101,086 \\, N\n\\]\n\nThis is close to option B (102,000 N), but let's check if this is valid.\n\n### Step 17: Verify the assumption\n\nThe assumption here is that the total mass flow rate at the outlet is equal to the sum of air and fuel mass flow rates, which seems correct.\n\nHowever, in reality, the combustion process can affect the effective mass flow rate due to temperature and pressure changes.\n\n### Step 18: Consider the energy balance\n\nThe kinetic energy at the outlet is higher than at the inlet, which makes sense due to the combustion process adding energy to the flow.\n\nGiven the mass flow rate and velocity changes, the calculated thrust seems reasonable.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{102000 \\, N}\n\\]\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe test stand support reaction \\( R_x \\) is equal to the thrust produced by the engine, which was calculated to be approximately 101,086 N. Given the options, the closest value is 102,000 N, which is likely due to rounding differences in the calculations. This force is necessary to counterbalance the engine's thrust during testing."
