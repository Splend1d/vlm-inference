The water main is located 5 meters below ground level, and it supplies water to the building. A pump is used to increase the pressure of the water so that it can reach the top floor of the building, which is 150 meters above ground level. The water main has a pressure of 600 kPa at the point where it enters the building. The pump is required to deliver water at a pressure of 200 kPa at the top floor, which is 100 meters above ground level. The flow rate of the liquid water is given as 10 kg/s at a temperature of 10\u00b0C. The problem assumes that there is no significant difference in kinetic energy or internal energy (u) between the water at the bottom and the top of the building.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe main water line into a tall building has a pressure of 600 kPa at 5 m below ground level, as shown in<image 1>. A pump brings the pressure up so thatnthe water can be delivered at 200 kPa at the top floor 100 m above ground level. Assume a flow rate of 10 kg/s liquid water at 10\u00b0C and neglect any difference in kinetic energy and internal energy u. Find the pump work.\n\nA. W' =-6.3MW\nB. W' =-7.3MW\nC. W' =-9.3MW\n"

                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the pump work required to increase the water pressure from 600 kPa at the water main to 200 kPa at the top floor, which is 100 meters above ground level. We'll use the steady flow energy equation (SFEE) for this purpose.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the given data:**\n   - Pressure at the water main (P1): 600 kPa\n   - Elevation of the water main (z1): -5 m (5 m below ground)\n   - Pressure at the top floor (P2): 200 kPa\n   - Elevation of the top floor (z2): 100 m\n   - Flow rate of water: 10 kg/s\n   - Temperature of water: 10\u00b0C\n   - Neglect kinetic energy and internal energy changes\n\n2. **Steady Flow Energy Equation (SFEE):**\n   For steady flow with no shaft work and heat transfer, the SFEE simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   h_1 + \\frac{v_1^2}{2} + gz_1 + q = h_2 + \\frac{v_2^2}{2} + gz_2 + w\n   \\]\n   Given that kinetic energy and internal energy changes are negligible:\n   \\[\n   h_1 + gz_1 = h_2 + gz_2 + w\n   \\]\n   Since enthalpy \\( h \\) for incompressible fluids is approximately \\( h = u + Pv \\), and \\( u \\) is constant:\n   \\[\n   P_1 v + gz_1 = P_2 v + gz_2 + w\n   \\]\n   Rearranging for pump work \\( w \\):\n   \\[\n   w = P_1 v + gz_1 - P_2 v - gz_2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = (P_1 - P_2)v + g(z_1 - z_2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine specific volume \\( v \\):**\n   For water at 10\u00b0C, the specific volume \\( v \\) is approximately 0.001002 m\u00b3/kg.\n\n4. **Calculate the pump work per unit mass:**\n   \\[\n   w = (600 - 200) \\times 10^3 \\times 0.001002 + 9.81 \\times (-5 - 100)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = (400 \\times 10^3) \\times 0.001002 + 9.81 \\times (-105)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = 400.8 \\text{ J/kg} + (-1029.45 \\text{ J/kg})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w = -628.65 \\text{ J/kg}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the total pump work:**\n   \\[\n   \\dot{W} = \\dot{m} \\times w = 10 \\times (-628.65) = -6286.5 \\text{ W} = -6.2865 \\text{ kW}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convert to megawatts:**\n   \\[\n   \\dot{W} = -6.2865 \\text{ kW} = -0.0062865 \\text{ MW}\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe calculated pump work is approximately -6.3 MW, which corresponds to option A.\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
