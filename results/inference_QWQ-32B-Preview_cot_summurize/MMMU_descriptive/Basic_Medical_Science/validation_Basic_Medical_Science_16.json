The tissue shows a mix of different cell types and structures. There are elongated cells with prominent nuclei, which could be indicative of nerve cells or fibroblasts. Additionally, there are areas with a more dense, fibrous appearance, suggesting connective tissue. The overall staining pattern and cellular morphology suggest that this could be a section of neural tissue, possibly including lower motor neurons.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThese cells, whose axons terminate directly on skeletal muscle fibers are also known as 'lower motor neurons.' <image 1> \n\nA. true\nB. false\n"
