Here is a detailed description of the steps shown in the image:\n\n1. **Bacterial Cell with Plasmid**: The image starts with a bacterial cell containing a circular piece of DNA known as a plasmid.\n2. **Human Cell with Gene**: A human cell is depicted with a linear piece of DNA representing the gene for human growth hormone.\n3. **Isolation of Human Growth Hormone Gene**: The gene for human growth hormone is isolated from the human cell.\n4. **Opening the Plasmid**: The plasmid is opened, likely through restriction enzymes, to allow insertion of foreign DNA.\n5. **Insertion of Human Growth Hormone Gene into Plasmid**: The isolated gene for human growth hormone is inserted into the opened plasmid.\n6. **Closing the Plasmid**: The plasmid is closed again, incorporating the human growth hormone gene.\n7. **Transformation of Bacterial Cell**: The modified plasmid is introduced into the bacterial cell, resulting in the bacterial cell now containing the gene for human growth hormone.\n\nThis process is used to create genetically modified bacteria that can produce human growth hormone.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat process is being illustrated in Figure <image 1> ?\n\n"

This technique is used to produce proteins, such as human growth hormone, in bacteria like E. coli.\n\nThe steps shown in the image can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Bacterial Cell with Plasmid**: A bacterial cell containing a natural plasmid is depicted. Plasmids are small, circular pieces of DNA that can replicate independently within the cell.\n\n2. **Human Cell with Gene**: A human cell is shown containing the gene of interest, in this case, the gene for human growth hormone.\n\n3. **Isolation of Human Growth Hormone Gene**: The gene for human growth hormone is isolated from the human cell's DNA. This is typically achieved through molecular biology techniques such as PCR or gene cloning.\n\n4. **Opening the Plasmid**: The plasmid in the bacterial cell is opened, likely using restriction enzymes. These enzymes cut the DNA at specific sequences, creating \"sticky ends\" that can bind to complementary sequences.\n\n5. **Insertion of Human Growth Hormone Gene into Plasmid**: The isolated human growth hormone gene is inserted into the opened plasmid. The sticky ends of the plasmid and the gene anneal together.\n\n6. **Closing the Plasmid**: The plasmid is closed again, often using an enzyme called DNA ligase, which seals the nicks in the DNA backbone, thus incorporating the human gene into the plasmid.\n\n7. **Transformation of Bacterial Cell**: The modified plasmid, now containing the human gene, is introduced back into the bacterial cell.
