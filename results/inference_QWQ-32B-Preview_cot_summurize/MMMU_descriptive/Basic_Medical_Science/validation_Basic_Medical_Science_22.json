The chart includes symbols representing different individuals and their relationships:\n\n- Circles represent females.\n- Squares represent males.\n- Solid black symbols indicate individuals who are afflicted with the trait.\n- Open symbols (white circles or squares) indicate individuals who are normal (not afflicted).\n- Symbols with diagonal lines indicate carriers of the trait.\n\nThe chart shows three generations of individuals, numbered from 1 to 9. The relationships are indicated by horizontal lines connecting spouses and vertical lines connecting parents to their offspring.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the individuals:\n- Individual 1 (female) is a carrier.\n- Individual 2 (male) is afflicted.\n- Individual 3 (male) is afflicted.\n- Individual 4 (female) is a carrier.\n- Individual 5 (female) is normal.\n- Individual 6 (male) is afflicted.\n- Individual 7 (male) is normal.\n- Individual 8 (female) is a carrier.\n- Individual 9 (male) is normal.\n\nBased on this information, the pedigree chart shows a pattern where the trait is passed from an affected male to his daughters, who become carriers, and from a carrier female to her sons, who may become afflicted. This pattern is consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance, which is the mode of inheritance for colorblindness.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nCould the pedigree in Figure <image 1> show the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness?\n\nA. True\nB. False\n"

                    "text": "A. True\n\nExplanation:\n\nColorblindness is a classic example of an X-linked recessive genetic disorder. To understand why the pedigree chart described could represent the transmission of colorblindness, let's break down the key aspects of X-linked recessive inheritance and compare them to the information provided in the description.\n\n### X-Linked Recessive Inheritance\n\n1. **Gene Location**: The gene responsible for the trait is located on the X chromosome.\n2. **Affected Individuals**:\n   - Males (XY): Only one copy of the X chromosome, so a single recessive allele will express the trait.\n   - Females (XX): Need two recessive alleles to express the trait; one recessive allele makes them carriers.\n3. **Transmission Patterns**:\n   - An affected male will pass the recessive allele to all his daughters (who become carriers) but none of his sons.\n   - A carrier female has a 50% chance of passing the recessive allele to both sons and daughters.\n   - A non-carrier female will not pass the recessive allele to her children.\n\n### Analysis of the Pedigree Chart\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- **Individuals and Their Status**:\n  - Individual 1 (female): Carrier\n  - Individual 2 (male): Afflicted\n  - Individual 3 (male): Afflicted\n  - Individual 4 (female): Carrier\n  - Individual 5 (female): Normal\n  - Individual 6 (male): Afflicted\n  - Individual 7 (male): Normal\n  - Individual 8 (female): Carrier\n  - Individual 9 (male): Normal\n\n- **Pattern Observed**:\n  - Affected males pass the trait to their daughters, who become carriers.\n  - Carrier females can pass the trait to their sons, who may become afflicted.\n\nThis matches the expected pattern for X-linked recessive inheritance.\n\n### Comparison with Colorblindness\n\nColorblindness is known to be an X-linked recessive trait. Therefore, the pattern observed in the pedigree chart aligns with the inheritance pattern of colorblindness.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven that the pedigree chart shows a pattern consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance and that colorblindness is an X-linked recessive trait, it is plausible that the pedigree in Figure <image 1> shows the pattern for the transmission of colorblindness.\n\nThus, the answer is **True**.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{True}} \\]"
