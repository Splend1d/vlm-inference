The x-axis represents time in milliseconds, ranging from 0 to 7 milliseconds, while the y-axis represents membrane potential in millivolts (mV), ranging from -100 mV to 50 mV.\n\nThe graph has several labeled points:\n- Point A is at the resting membrane potential, which is around -70 mV.\n- Point B marks the beginning of depolarization, where the membrane potential starts to increase.\n- Point C indicates the threshold potential, where the neuron becomes excitable and an action potential is initiated.\n- Point D is the peak of the action potential, where the membrane potential reaches its maximum value, around +40 mV.\n- Point E is the repolarization phase, where the membrane potential returns towards the resting potential.\n- Point F marks the end of the action potential, where the membrane potential stabilizes back to the resting level.\n\nBased on this description, point E corresponds to the repolarization phase of the action potential. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nD. Repolarization\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>E is .. ?\n\nA. Threshold\nB. Depolarization\nC.
