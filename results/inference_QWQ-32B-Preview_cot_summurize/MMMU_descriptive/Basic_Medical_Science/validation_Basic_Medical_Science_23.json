The central cell has a large, round nucleus with a dense, dark purple staining. Surrounding this central cell are several smaller cells with greenish-stained cytoplasm and small, round nuclei. The central cell's nucleus appears to be segmented, which is characteristic of certain types of white blood cells. The surrounding cells are likely red blood cells, which typically appear smaller and have no visible nucleus in a stained blood smear.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>Which cell type is pictured?\n\nA. Eosinophil\nB. Thrombocyte\nC. Lymphocyte\nD. Monocyte\nE. Neutrophil\n"

The surrounding cells are smaller with greenish-stained cytoplasm and small, round nuclei, likely representing red blood cells.\n\nGiven these characteristics, the central cell is most likely a neutrophil. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell characterized by their segmented nucleus, which often has multiple lobes connected by thin strands of nuclear material. The dark purple staining of the nucleus is consistent with the typical appearance of neutrophils in a stained blood smear.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nE. Neutrophil"
