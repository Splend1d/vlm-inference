Each water molecule consists of one oxygen atom (O) bonded to two hydrogen atoms (H). The hydrogen bonds are represented by dashed lines between the hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the oxygen atoms of another water molecule.\n\n- Arrow \"a\" points to a hydrogen atom in a water molecule.\n- Arrow \"b\" points to an oxygen atom in a water molecule.\n- Arrow \"c\" points to a hydrogen atom involved in a hydrogen bond with another water molecule.\n- Arrow \"d\" points to a hydrogen atom involved in a hydrogen bond with another water molecule.\n\nBased on this description, the arrow that points to a hydrogen bond is arrow \"d.\"\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich arrow points to a hydrogen bond? <image 1>\n\n"
