The Q, R, and S waves are parts of this complex:\n   - **Q Wave**: The initial downward deflection (if present).\n   - **R Wave**: The large upward deflection.\n   - **S Wave**: The downward deflection after the R wave.\n\n3. **T Wave**: This represents ventricular repolarization, which is the electrical recovery phase of the ventricles after contraction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, ventricular repolarization"
