This description is characteristic of skeletal muscle tissue.\n\nSkeletal muscle is composed of muscle fibers that are long, cylindrical, and multinucleated. These fibers are arranged in parallel arrays, which contribute to the linear appearance described. The alternating light and dark bands are known as sarcomeres, which are the functional units of muscle fibers. These bands are a result of the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments within the muscle fibers.\n\nCardiac muscle, while also striated like skeletal muscle, has distinct differences. Cardiac muscle cells are branched and interconnected, forming a network, which is not described in the provided image. Additionally, cardiac muscle cells have a single nucleus, unlike the multinucleated skeletal muscle fibers.\n\nBone tissue, on the other hand, has a very different structure. It is composed of osteocytes embedded in a calcified matrix, forming either compact or spongy bone. Bone does not have the parallel, elongated structures with alternating bands as described.\n\nTherefore, the tissue depicted in the image is most likely skeletal muscle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
