The heart is shown in a frontal view with various parts labeled using letters from A to E. \n\n- Label A points to the upper right part of the heart, near the atria.\n- Label B points to the upper left part of the heart, also near the atria.\n- Label C points to the middle section of the heart, between the atria and ventricles.\n- Label D points to the lower right part of the heart, near the ventricle.\n- Label E points to the lower left part of the heart, near the ventricle.\n\nThe sinoatrial (SA) node is located in the upper right part of the heart, specifically in the right atrium. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. A\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1>The sinoatrial (SA) node is indicated by ________.\n\nA. A\nB. B\nC. C\nD. D\nE. E\n"
