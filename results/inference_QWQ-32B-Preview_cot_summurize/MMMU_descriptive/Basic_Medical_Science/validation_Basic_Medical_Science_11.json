The cells have a striated appearance, indicating the presence of myofibrils. This characteristic is typical of skeletal muscle tissue. The cells are aligned in a regular pattern, and there are visible nuclei within the cells. The overall structure and organization suggest that this is a cross-sectional view of skeletal muscle fibers.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat kind of tissue does this image depict?  <image 1> \n\nA. Cardiac muscle\nB. Skeletal muscle\nC. Cartliage\n"

The key features mentioned include elongated cells arranged in parallel rows with a striated appearance due to the presence of myofibrils. Additionally, the regular pattern of alignment and the visibility of nuclei within the cells are consistent with skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Skeletal muscle."
