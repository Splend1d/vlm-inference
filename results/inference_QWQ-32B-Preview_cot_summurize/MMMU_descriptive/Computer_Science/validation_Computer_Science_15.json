The relationships between these entities are illustrated using lines connecting points within each entity set.\n\n- The EMPLOYEE entity is represented by a set of points labeled \\( e_1, e_2, e_3, \\ldots \\).\n- The WORKS_FOR entity is represented by a set of points labeled \\( r_1, r_2, r_3, \\ldots \\).\n- The DEPARTMENT entity is represented by a set of points labeled \\( d_1, d_2, d_3, \\ldots \\).\n\nLines connect points from the EMPLOYEE set to points in the WORKS_FOR set, and lines also connect points from the WORKS_FOR set to points in the DEPARTMENT set. This indicates a many-to-many (N:M) relationship between EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT through the WORKS_FOR entity.\n\nTherefore, the relationship WORKS_ON in this context is of type D. N:M.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat type of relationship is WORKS_ON in <image 1>?\n\nA. 1:1\nB. 1:N\nC. N:1\nD. N:M\nE. None of the other answers.\n"
