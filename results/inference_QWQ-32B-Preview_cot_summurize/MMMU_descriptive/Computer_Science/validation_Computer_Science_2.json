The nodes in the tree contain numerical values, and the structure follows specific rules to maintain its properties.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the tree:\n\n- The root node contains the value 6.\n- The left child of the root (6) is 13, and the right child is 8.\n- The left child of 13 is 18, and the right child is 24.\n- The left child of 24 is 35, and the right child is 26.\n- The left child of 8 is 12, and the right child is 37.\n- The left child of 12 is 17, and the right child is 19.\n\nTo answer the question about deleting the minimum number from the leftist heap:\n\n1. The minimum number in the heap is 6, which is the root.\n2. After deleting the root (6), the next smallest element becomes the new root.

                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a leftist heap, and we need to delete the minimum number from it. The image shows the structure of the heap, but since I can't see the image, I'll rely on the description provided.\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- The root node is 6.\n\n- Its left child is 13, and the right child is 8.\n\n- 13 has a left child of 18 and a right child of 24.\n\n- 24 has a left child of 35 and a right child of 26.\n\n- 8 has a left child of 12 and a right child of 37.\n\n- 12 has a left child of 17 and a right child of 19.\n\nOkay, so in a leftist heap, the minimum element is always at the root, which makes sense because it's a min-heap. When we delete the minimum, we need to remove the root and then restructure the heap to maintain its properties.\n\nIn a binary heap, deleting the root typically involves replacing it with the last element in the tree and then performing a heapify operation down the tree. However, in a leftist heap, the deletion process is a bit different because it's designed to keep the tree as left-leaning as possible, which helps in achieving better balancing.\n\nBut for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that after deleting the root (6), the next smallest element becomes the new root. According to the description, that would be 8.\n\nSo, after deleting 6, 8 becomes the new root.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. 8 is NOT the root.\n\nBut according to our assumption, 8 is the root. So this would be false.\n\nB. 12 is the right child of 8.\n\nBefore deletion, 8 had a left child of 12 and a right child of 37. After making 8 the root, unless there are merges or adjustments, 12 should still be its left child, and 37 its right child. But in leftist heaps, after deletion, there might be a merge of the two subtrees that were originally the root's left and right children.\n\nWait, in a leftist heap, deleting the root involves merging the two subtrees (left and right) into one heap. So, after deleting 6, we need to merge the left subtree (rooted at 13) with the right subtree (rooted at 8).\n\nSo, the merge operation in a leftist heap involves taking the smaller root as the new root and recursively merging its right subtree with the other tree.\n\nGiven that 8 is smaller than 13, 8 becomes the new root. Then, we need to merge the right subtree of 8 (which is 37) with the left subtree (13).\n\nSo, we merge 37 and 13. Since 13 is smaller than 37, 13 becomes the right child of 8, and 37 becomes the right child of 13.\n\nWait, no. In merging two heaps in a leftist heap, you always take the smaller root as the new root, and then recursively merge the other tree with the right subtree of the new root.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Take 8 as the new root.\n\n- Merge the right subtree of 8 (which is 37) with 13.\n\n- Since 13 is smaller than 37, 13 becomes the right child of 8.\n\n- Then, merge the right subtree of 13 (which is 24) with 37.\n\n- 24 is smaller than 37, so 24 becomes the right child of 13.\n\n- Then, merge the right subtree of 24 (which is 26) with 37.\n\n- 26 is smaller than 37, so 26 becomes the right child of 24.\n\n- Finally, 37 is merged with nothing, so it becomes the right child of 26.\n\nSo, the new tree would look like:\n\n- Root: 8\n\n- Left: 12 (unchanged)\n\n- Right: 13\n\n- 13's left: 18\n\n- 13's right: 24\n\n- 24's left: 35\n\n- 24's right: 26\n\n- 26's right: 37\n\nWait, but in leftist heaps, the merge operation ensures that the tree remains leftist, meaning that the null path on the right is always shorter or equal in length to the null path on the left.\n\nBut for the purpose of this question, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the merge is simply making 13 the right child of 8, and 37 remains as the right child of 13.\n\nBut according to the detailed merge process I just went through, it seems more involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this specific case, after deleting 6, 8 becomes the root, and 13 becomes its right child, and 37 becomes the right child of 13.\n\nIf that's the case, then 12 remains as the left child of 8.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Root: 8\n\n- Left: 12 (with its own children: 17 and 19)\n\n- Right: 13\n\n- 13's left: 18\n\n- 13's right: 24\n\n- 24's left: 35\n\n- 24's right: 26\n\n- 26 has no children (assuming)\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 8 is NOT the root.\n\nBut in this case, 8 is the root, so this is false.\n\nB. 12 is the right child of 8.\n\nNo, according to this structure, 12 is the left child of 8, and 13 is the right child.\n\nSo, this statement is false.\n\nC. 24 is the left child of 13.\n\nYes, according to the structure, 24 is the left child of 13.\n\nWait, but in the original description, 13 has a left child of 18 and a right child of 24.\n\nAfter the merge, does 13's left child remain 18, and right child 24?\n\nIf so, then 24 is still the left child of 13.\n\nWait, no. In the merge process I described earlier, 13 becomes the right child of 8, and its own left and right children remain the same.\n\nSo, 13's left is still 18, and right is 24.\n\nTherefore, 24 is the right child of 13, not the left.\n\nSo, statement C is false.\n\nD. 35 is the right child of 24.\n\nNo, according to the original structure, 24 has a left child of 35 and a right child of 26.\n\nSo, 35 is the left child of 24, not the right child.\n\nTherefore, statement D is false.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier merge process, after deleting 6 and merging the left and right subtrees, the structure might change.\n\nBut based on the standard merge operation in leftist heaps, the right subtree of the new root (8) would be merged with the right subtree of the previous root's right child.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nMaybe I should consider that in a leftist heap, after deleting the root, the two subtrees are merged, and the tree is restructured to maintain the leftist property.\n\nBut for the purpose of this multiple-choice question, perhaps I need to look for the statement that remains true after the deletion.\n\nGiven that all options seem to be false based on my analysis, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the heap structure doesn't change that much after deletion, and only the root is updated.\n\nBut according to the properties of leftist heaps, merging subtrees can rearrange the children.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is C. 24 is the left child of 13, assuming that after merging, 13's left child remains 24.\n\nBut in the original description, 13's left child is 18, and right child is 24.\n\nAfter merging, if 13 becomes the right child of 8, its own left and right children remain the same.\n\nTherefore, 24 is still the right child of 13.\n\nBut option C says \"24 is the left child of 13,\" which would be false.\n\nWait, but in the original description, 13 has a left child of 18 and a right child of 24.\n\nSo, unless the merge operation swaps the children, 24 should remain the right child of 13.\n\nTherefore, option C is false.\n\nOption B says \"12 is the right child of 8.\"\n\nBut in my earlier analysis, 12 is the left child of 8, and 13 is the right child.\n\nTherefore, option B is false.\n\nOption D says \"35 is the right child of 24.\"\n\nBut in the original structure, 24 has a left child of 35 and a right child of 26.\n\nSo, 35 is the left child of 24, making option D false.\n\nOption A says \"8 is NOT the root.\"\n\nBut according to the deletion process, 8 should be the new root.\n\nTherefore, option A is false.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, all options seem to be false, which can't be the case since one of them must be true.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in understanding the structure or the deletion process.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nIn a leftist heap, deletion involves removing the root and merging the two subtrees.\n\nThe merge operation involves comparing the roots of the two subtrees and making the smaller one the new root, then recursively merging its right subtree with the other tree.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- Delete 6, leaving subtrees rooted at 13 and 8.\n\n- Since 8 < 13, 8 becomes the new root.\n\n- Merge the right subtree of 8 (which is 37) with 13.\n\n- Since 13 < 37, 13 becomes the right child of 8.\n\n- Now, merge the right subtree of 13 (which is 24) with 37.\n\n- Since 24 < 37, 24 becomes the right child of 13.\n\n- Merge the right subtree of 24 (which is 26) with 37.\n\n- Since 26 < 37, 26 becomes the right child of 24.\n\n- Finally, 37 has no right child, so it becomes the right child of 26.\n\nSo, the final structure is:\n\n- Root: 8\n\n- Left: 12 (with left:17, right:19)\n\n- Right: 13\n\n- 13's left: 18\n\n- 13's right: 24\n\n- 24's left: 35\n\n- 24's right: 26\n\n- 26's right: 37\n\nNow, looking back at the options:\n\nA. 8 is NOT the root.\n\nBut 8 is the root, so false.\n\nB. 12 is the right child of 8.\n\nNo, 12 is the left child of 8.\n\nSo, false.\n\nC. 24 is the left child of 13.\n\nNo, 24 is the right child of 13.\n\nSo, false.\n\nD. 35 is the right child of 24.\n\nNo, 35 is the left child of 24.\n\nSo, false.\n\nWait, but according to the question, one of these statements must be true.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the merge process.\n\nLet me try to recall the exact steps for merging two leftist heaps.\n\nThe standard merge procedure is:\n\n- If one of the heaps is empty, return the other heap.\n\n- Otherwise, compare the roots.\n\n- Make the smaller root the new root.\n\n- Recursively merge the right subtree of the new root with the other heap.\n\n- Finally, update the null path length (npl) of the new root.\n\nBut in this case, I might not need to worry about npl for this specific question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the heap remains unchanged except for the root.\n\nWait, perhaps in some implementations, the merge is simpler.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing a different aspect.\n\nGiven that all options seem false based on my analysis, perhaps the correct answer is B, assuming that after deletion and merging, 12 becomes the right child of 8.\n\nBut according to my earlier merge process, 12 remains the left child of 8.\n\nMaybe in the merging process, 12 becomes the right child.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense, because in the merge, we're merging the right subtree of the new root (8) with the other subtree (13).\n\nSo, perhaps 12 remains the left child of 8, and 13 becomes the right child.\n\nTherefore, option B is false.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question has a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the heap is represented differently.\n\nWait, perhaps in the original heap, 8 had 12 as its right child, not its left child.\n\nBut according to the description:\n\n- The left child of 8 is 12, and the right child is 37.\n\nSo, unless the merge process swaps the children, 12 should remain the left child of 8.\n\nTherefore, option B is false.\n\nGiven that, and considering that all other options are also false based on my analysis, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the heap is structured or merged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that after deletion, the heap is restructured in a different way.\n\nGiven that, and since all options seem false, perhaps the correct answer is C, assuming that 24 is the left child of 13 after merging.\n\nBut according to my earlier merge process, 24 is the right child of 13.\n\nTherefore, option C is false.\n\nWait, maybe the merge process is different, and 24 becomes the left child of 13.\n\nBut that would contradict the standard merge procedure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this specific case, due to the values, the merge results in 24 being the left child of 13.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is B, assuming that after merging, 12 becomes the right child of 8.\n\nBut according to my understanding, it remains the left child.\n\nTherefore, I'm inclined to say that all options are false, but since that can't be the case, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that after deleting the minimum, the new root is 8, and 12 is its right child, which would make option B true.\n\nBut according to my analysis, 12 is the left child.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is B, assuming that in the merging process, 12 becomes the right child.\n\nGiven that, I'll choose B as the correct option.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
