                    "text": "I've got this network setup to look at. There are four servers and four clients all connected through a central hub. Each server connects to the hub with a link that can handle 80 Mbps, and each client connects to the hub with a link that can handle 60 Mbps. The hub itself can handle a total of 300 Mbps.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each client-to-server pair, assuming that the hub fairly shares its capacity among the paths.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the data flows in this network. Each server sends data to the hub, which then forwards it to the client through one of the four possible paths. Since there are four servers and four clients, and each has a direct link to the hub, there are multiple paths from each server to each client, but I think the key here is that they all share the hub as a common middle point.\n\nThe hub has a total capacity of 300 Mbps, and it's supposed to share this capacity fairly among the four paths. So, if it's dividing its capacity equally, each path would get 300 Mbps divided by 4, which is 75 Mbps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is indeed the bottleneck. Let's check the other links involved in the path from server to client.\n\nEach server has a link to the hub at 80 Mbps, and each client has a link to the hub at 60 Mbps. So, for a path from a server to a client, the data has to go from the server to the hub (80 Mbps), then from the hub to the client (60 Mbps).\n\nIn a single path, the throughput is limited by the smallest link capacity, which would be 60 Mbps. However, since the hub is sharing its capacity among multiple paths, it might affect the overall throughput.\n\nBut in this case, the hub is sharing its total capacity of 300 Mbps equally among the four paths, giving each path 75 Mbps. Now, compared to the server's link of 80 Mbps and the client's link of 60 Mbps, the limiting factor would be the client's link at 60 Mbps, because even if the hub allocates 75 Mbps to a path, the client can only receive at 60 Mbps.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to the initial conclusion that the throughput is 75 Mbps. Maybe I need to consider how the capacities interact.\n\nLet me think step by step:\n\n1. Each server can send up to 80 Mbps to the hub.\n\n2. The hub allocates 75 Mbps to each path.\n\n3. From the hub to each client, there's a link of 60 Mbps.\n\nSo, for data going from a server to a client:\n\n- The server can send up to 80 Mbps to the hub.\n\n- The hub can forward up to 75 Mbps for that path.\n\n- The client can receive up to 60 Mbps.\n\nThe actual throughput will be limited by the smallest of these capacities in the path. So, the bottleneck is the client's link at 60 Mbps.\n\nWait, but the hub is allocating 75 Mbps to the path. Does that mean that even though the hub is allocating 75 Mbps, the client can only receive 60 Mbps, so the effective throughput is 60 Mbps?\n\nBut the description says that the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each client-server pair is 75 Mbps. That seems inconsistent with what I'm thinking.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something about how the hub shares its capacity.\n\nLet me look back at the description:\n\n\"The central hub itself has a total transmission capacity of R = 300 Mbps.\n\nThe network is arranged in such a way that there are four distinct paths from each server to each client, all passing through the central hub. This setup implies that the central hub acts as a bottleneck for the data flow between servers and clients.\n\nGiven this configuration, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each of the four client-to-server pairs can be determined by considering the capacities of the links involved and the fair sharing of the central hub's capacity.\n\nSince the central hub has a total capacity of R = 300 Mbps and it is shared equally among the four paths, each path gets an equal share of the hub's capacity. Therefore, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each client-to-server pair is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{R}{4} = \\frac{300}{4} = 75 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each of the four client-to-server pairs is 75 Mbps.\"\n\nHmm, it seems that according to this, the hub's capacity is the determining factor, and it's allocating 75 Mbps to each path. But I'm still thinking that the client's link is only 60 Mbps, which should limit the throughput to 60 Mbps.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the hub is allocating 75 Mbps to the path, but the client can only receive 60 Mbps, so the actual throughput would be limited by the client's link.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hub can only allocate up to what the client's link can handle. In that case, allocating more than 60 Mbps to the path wouldn't help because the client can't receive more than 60 Mbps.\n\nSo, perhaps the fair sharing should take into account the client's link capacity.\n\nWait, but the hub doesn't know about the client's link capacity when it's allocating its own capacity. It's possible that the hub allocates 75 Mbps to a path, but the client can only receive 60 Mbps, meaning that 15 Mbps is effectively wasted.\n\nBut in practice, network systems are designed to avoid such waste by adjusting the allocation based on the actual capacity of the downstream link.\n\nSo, perhaps the hub should allocate no more than what the client's link can handle.\n\nIn that case, for each path, the hub should allocate up to 60 Mbps, considering the client's link capacity.\n\nBut then, why does the hub have a total capacity of 300 Mbps? If each path is limited to 60 Mbps, and there are four paths, that would require up to 240 Mbps from the hub, which is less than its total capacity.\n\nSo, in this scenario, the hub's total capacity is more than sufficient to handle the four paths at their maximum of 60 Mbps each.\n\nTherefore, the limiting factor for each path is the client's link at 60 Mbps.\n\nBut according to the description, it's 75 Mbps.\n\nI'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nPerhaps the 75 Mbps is the capacity allocated by the hub per path, but the actual throughput is limited by the client's link at 60 Mbps.\n\nSo, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput would be 60 Mbps per client-server pair.\n\nBut the description says it's 75 Mbps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the network topology.\n\nThe description mentions that there are four distinct paths from each server to each client, all passing through the central hub.\n\nDoes that mean that each server-to-client communication can utilize multiple paths simultaneously?\n\nIf that's the case, then each server-to-client pair could potentially aggregate the capacities of multiple paths.\n\nBut the description seems to suggest that each path is a three-hop path, which makes me think that each path is independent.\n\nWait, perhaps there are multiple paths from a server to a client via different routes through the hub, but in this specific setup, since all paths go through the same hub, maybe the multiple paths are redundant or used for load balancing.\n\nBut in the given setup, it seems like each server connects directly to the hub, and each client connects directly to the hub, with the hub connecting them.\n\nSo, perhaps the four paths mentioned are the four possible routes from a server to a client via the hub, considering that there are multiple servers and clients.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that there are four servers (S1, S2, S3, S4) and four clients (C1, C2, C3, C4), all connected to a central hub.\n\nEach server has a link to the hub at 80 Mbps, and each client has a link to the hub at 60 Mbps.\n\nThe hub has a total capacity of 300 Mbps, which is fairly shared among the active paths.\n\nNow, if we consider a single client-server pair, say S1 to C1, the path would be S1 -> hub -> C1.\n\nThe capacity of this path would be limited by the smallest link, which is the client's link at 60 Mbps.\n\nHowever, since the hub is allocating its capacity fairly among the paths, we need to see how much capacity the hub allocates to this particular path.\n\nIf the hub allocates 75 Mbps to this path, but the client can only receive 60 Mbps, then the actual throughput would be 60 Mbps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hub adjusts its allocation based on the client's capacity, allocating only up to 60 Mbps for that path.\n\nIn either case, the maximum achievable throughput for that client-server pair would be 60 Mbps.\n\nBut according to the description, it's 75 Mbps.\n\nI must be missing something.\n\nLet me consider the capacities again.\n\nEach server has a link to the hub at 80 Mbps, and each client has a link to the hub at 60 Mbps.\n\nThe hub has a total capacity of 300 Mbps, shared equally among the four paths, so 75 Mbps per path.\n\nBut, for a single client-server pair, the path involves the server's link (80 Mbps), the hub's allocation (75 Mbps), and the client's link (60 Mbps).\n\nThe throughput is determined by the minimum capacity in the path, which would be 60 Mbps.\n\nHowever, perhaps the hub's allocation of 75 Mbps is meant to be combined with other paths or something.\n\nI'm getting more confused.\n\nMaybe I should look at it differently.\n\nSuppose that the hub allocates 75 Mbps to each of the four paths.\n\nEach path has a server sending to the hub at up to 80 Mbps, but the hub only allocates 75 Mbps to that path.\n\nSo, the server can only effectively send up to 75 Mbps to the hub for that path.\n\nThen, from the hub to the client, there's a link of 60 Mbps.\n\nTherefore, the throughput from the server to the client is limited by the client's link at 60 Mbps.\n\nSo, even though the hub allocates 75 Mbps to the path, the client can only receive 60 Mbps, making the effective throughput 60 Mbps.\n\nTherefore, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput for each client-server pair should be 60 Mbps.\n\nBut according to the description, it's 75 Mbps.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the hub allocates its capacity.\n\nMaybe the hub allocates 75 Mbps to each server for its incoming links, and then allocates capacity to the clients based on their links.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hub allocates 75 Mbps to each client for its outgoing links.\n\nBut again, that doesn't align with the client's link capacity of 60 Mbps.\n\nI think there's some confusion in the description or in my understanding.\n\nLet me consider that the hub's total capacity is 300 Mbps, and it needs to serve four paths.\n\nIf it allocates 75 Mbps to each path, that adds up to 300 Mbps, which matches its total capacity.\n\nBut each path has a client link of 60 Mbps, which is less than the allocated 75 Mbps.\n\nIn practice, the hub would need to throttle its output to each client to not exceed the client's link capacity, otherwise, it would lead to congestion and packet loss.\n\nTherefore, even though the hub allocates 75 Mbps to a path, it should not send more than 60 Mbps to the client to avoid exceeding the client's link capacity.\n\nHence, the maximum achievable throughput is 60 Mbps per client-server pair.\n\nBut according to the description, it's 75 Mbps.\n\nMaybe the description is considering the hub's allocation without taking into account the client's link capacity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hub can allocate more than the client's link capacity, and the client will just discard the excess data, but that would be inefficient and typically not how networks operate.\n\nIn real networks, mechanisms like congestion control and flow control are used to ensure that data is sent at a rate that the receiver can handle.\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that the hub would allocate more capacity to a path than the client's link can handle.\n\nGiven that, the maximum achievable throughput should be 60 Mbps per client-server pair.\n\nBut since the description says it's 75 Mbps, perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 75 Mbps is the throughput from the server to the hub, and then from the hub to the client is limited to 60 Mbps, making the overall throughput 60 Mbps.\n\nBut again, that doesn't match the description's conclusion.\n\nI think there might be an error in the description's conclusion.\n\nGiven the link capacities, the maximum achievable end-to-end throughput should be limited by the client's link at 60 Mbps.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 60 Mbps.\n\nBut since the question asks to omit the unit of Mbps, the numerical answer would be 60.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{60} \\]"
