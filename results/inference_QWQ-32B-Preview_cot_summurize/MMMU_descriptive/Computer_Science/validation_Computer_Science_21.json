The numbers are connected by arrows indicating the direction of traversal. The traversal starts from the top left corner (1) and moves rightward to the end of the row (4), then down one row and leftward (8), then up one column and rightward (12), and so on, forming a spiral pattern. The output sequence of the numbers is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10. This indicates that the traversal is done in a spiral manner, starting from the outermost layer and moving inward.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat kind of matrix traversal is <image 1>?\n\nA. Normal traversal of the matrix.\nB. Row-wise traversal of the matrix.\nC. Column-wise traversal of the matrix.\nD. spiral traversal of the matrix.\n"

The traversal starts from the top-left corner and moves rightward, then down, leftward, up, and continues in this spiral pattern until all elements are traversed. The sequence of numbers traversed is 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10, which matches the pattern of a spiral traversal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. spiral traversal of the matrix."
