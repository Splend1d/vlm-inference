Each node has two numbers associated with it, representing the discovery time stamp and the finishing time stamp in a Depth First Search (DFS). The numbers are formatted as \\( x/y \\), where \\( x \\) is the discovery time stamp and \\( y \\) is the finishing time stamp. Here are the details for each node:\n\n- Node \\( a \\): 13/14\n- Node \\( b \\): 11/16\n- Node \\( c \\): 1/10\n- Node \\( d \\): 8/9\n- Node \\( e \\): 12/15\n- Node \\( f \\): 3/4\n- Node \\( g \\): 5/7\n- Node \\( h \\): 2/6\n\nThe edges between the nodes are as follows:\n- \\( a \\) points to \\( b \\)\n- \\( b \\) points to \\( c \\)\n- \\( c \\) points to \\( d \\)\n- \\( d \\) points to \\( h \\)\n- \\( e \\) points to \\( a \\)\n- \\( e \\) points to \\( f \\)\n- \\( f \\) points to \\( g \\)\n- \\( g \\) points to \\( h \\)\n\nBased on these connections and the time stamps, the depth-first forest consists of the following sets of nodes:\n- \\( \\{a, b, e\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{f, g\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{c, d\\} \\)\n- \\( \\{h\\} \\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nB. {a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nIn the following graph, discovery time stamps and finishing time stamps of Depth First Search (DFS) are shown as x/y, where x is discovery time stamp and y is finishing time stamp. <image 1> shows which of the following depth first forests?\n\nA. {a, b, e} {c, d, h} {f, g}\nB. {a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}\nC. {a, b, e} {f, g} {c, d} {h}\nD. {a, b, e} {c, d, f, g, h}\n"

                    "text": "I'm a bit confused because options B and C are the same. Maybe there's a typo in the question. Anyway, based on the description, the depth-first forest consists of four sets: {a, b, e}, {f, g}, {c, d}, and {h}. So, the correct answer should be option B (or C, since they're identical). But let's make sure.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a depth-first forest is. In DFS, the graph is explored as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. The forest consists of trees, each starting from a root node that was not reached from any other node.\n\nLooking at the nodes and their time stamps:\n\n- Node a: 13/14\n\n- Node b: 11/16\n\n- Node c: 1/10\n\n- Node d: 8/9\n\n- Node e: 12/15\n\n- Node f: 3/4\n\n- Node g: 5/7\n\n- Node h: 2/6\n\nAnd the edges:\n\n- a -> b\n\n- b -> c\n\n- c -> d\n\n- d -> h\n\n- e -> a\n\n- e -> f\n\n- f -> g\n\n- g -> h\n\nLet's try to reconstruct the DFS traversal based on these time stamps.\n\nThe discovery times are:\n\n1. c: 1\n\n2. f: 3\n\n3. g: 5\n\n4. h: 2\n\n5. d: 8\n\n6. e: 12\n\n7. a: 13\n\n8. b: 11\n\nWait, that seems off because discovery times should be in increasing order as the traversal proceeds. Maybe I need to look at the finishing times as well.\n\nFinishing times:\n\n6. h: 6\n\n7. g: 7\n\n4. d: 9\n\n10. c: 10\n\n14. a: 14\n\n15. e: 15\n\n16. b: 16\n\nSo, let's try to piece this together.\n\nStarting from the earliest discovery time:\n\n- c is discovered at 1.\n\n- From c, it points to d.\n\n- d is discovered at 8, finished at 9.\n\n- d points to h.\n\n- h is discovered at 2, finished at 6.\n\n- Wait, h has a discovery time of 2, which is before d's discovery time of 8. That doesn't make sense unless h was discovered from somewhere else.\n\nThis seems confusing. Maybe I need to consider that multiple DFS traversals are happening because not all nodes are connected in a single tree.\n\nLet's consider the nodes in order of their discovery times:\n\n1. c (1)\n\n- explores d (8)\n\n- d explores h (2)\n\nBut h has a discovery time of 2, which is before d's discovery time of 8. That suggests that h was discovered before d.\n\nWait, maybe the traversal went like this:\n\n- Start at c (discovery time 1)\n\n- From c, go to d (discovery time 8)\n\n- From d, go to h (discovery time 2)\n\nBut h's discovery time is 2, which is before d's discovery time of 8. That doesn't make sense in a DFS traversal unless there's a back edge.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the traversal started at h.\n\nWait, h has a discovery time of 2, which is after c's discovery time of 1, but before d's discovery time of 8.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the finishing times to understand better.\n\nNodes finished in order:\n\n- h finished at 6\n\n- g finished at 7\n\n- d finished at 9\n\n- c finished at 10\n\n- a finished at 14\n\n- e finished at 15\n\n- b finished at 16\n\nSo, the last node finished is b at 16, which suggests that b was the root of the last tree in the DFS forest.\n\nBut according to the description, the DFS forest consists of four trees: {a,b,e}, {f,g}, {c,d}, and {h}.\n\nLooking back at the edges:\n\n- a -> b\n\n- b -> c\n\n- c -> d\n\n- d -> h\n\n- e -> a\n\n- e -> f\n\n- f -> g\n\n- g -> h\n\nIf we start DFS from e, we can visit a, then b, then c, then d, then h. But h is also reachable from g, which is reached from f, which is reached from e.\n\nWait, e points to a and f.\n\nIf we start from e:\n\n- discover e (12)\n\n- discover a (13)\n\n- discover b (11)\n\n- discover c (1)\n\n- discover d (8)\n\n- discover h (2)\n\n- finish h (6)\n\n- finish d (9)\n\n- finish c (10)\n\n- finish b (16)\n\n- finish a (14)\n\n- finish e (15)\n\nThen, we have f:\n\n- discover f (3)\n\n- discover g (5)\n\n- discover h (2)\n\n- but h is already visited, so finish g (7)\n\n- finish f (4)\n\nWait, this is confusing because h has a discovery time of 2, which is before f's discovery time of 3.\n\nThis suggests that h was discovered before f.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the traversal started from c:\n\n- discover c (1)\n\n- discover d (8)\n\n- discover h (2)\n\n- finish h (6)\n\n- finish d (9)\n\n- finish c (10)\n\nThen, start from f:\n\n- discover f (3)\n\n- discover g (5)\n\n- discover h (2)\n\n- h already visited, so finish g (7)\n\n- finish f (4)\n\nThen, start from e:\n\n- discover e (12)\n\n- discover a (13)\n\n- discover b (11)\n\n- b already visited, so finish a (14)\n\n- finish e (15)\n\nFinally, since h was already visited, it's in its own tree.\n\nWait, but according to this, the forest would be:\n\n- {c, d, h}\n\n- {f, g}\n\n- {e, a, b}\n\nBut the description says:\n\n- {a, b, e}\n\n- {f, g}\n\n- {c, d}\n\n- {h}\n\nWhich matches option B (and C).\n\nBut in my reconstruction, h is in the same tree as c and d.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps h is in its own tree because it was discovered before d, which doesn't make sense in a standard DFS traversal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a cycle or some other complexity.\n\nWait, looking back at the edges:\n\n- a -> b\n\n- b -> c\n\n- c -> d\n\n- d -> h\n\n- e -> a\n\n- e -> f\n\n- f -> g\n\n- g -> h\n\nThis graph has cycles. For example, e -> a -> b -> c -> d -> h -> g -> f -> e.\n\nIn DFS on a graph with cycles, the traversal can go in loops.\n\nPerhaps the discovery and finishing times indicate that h was discovered multiple times, but its discovery time is the earliest among all nodes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the time stamps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DFS forest is constructed based on the order of discovery and the lack of connections.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the forest is indeed {a,b,e}, {f,g}, {c,d}, and {h}, as stated in the description.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B (and C, but since they're the same, it's option B).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
