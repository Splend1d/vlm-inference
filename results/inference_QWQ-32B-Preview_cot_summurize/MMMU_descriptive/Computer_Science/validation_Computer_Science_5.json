Each node contains two parts: one labeled \"data\" and another part that points to the next node. The last node points to \"null,\" indicating the end of the sequence. The arrows between the nodes show the direction from one node to the next, forming a linear sequence where each node has a single pointer to the next node in the sequence. This structure is characteristic of a singly linked list.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhat data structure is pictured in <image 1>?\n\nA. Singly linked list\nB.
