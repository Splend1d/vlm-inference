Here is a detailed description of each table and their connections:\n\n1. **EMPLOYEE**\n   - Attributes: Fname (First Name), Minit (Middle Initial), Lname (Last Name), Ssn (Social Security Number), Bdate (Birth Date), Address, Sex, Salary, Super_ssn (Supervisor's Social Security Number), Dno (Department Number)\n\n2. **DEPARTMENT**\n   - Attributes: Dname (Department Name), Dnumber (Department Number), Mgr_ssn (Manager's Social Security Number), Mgr_start_date (Manager Start Date)\n\n3. **DEPT_LOCATIONS**\n   - Attributes: Dnumber (Department Number), Dlocation (Department Location)\n\n4. **PROJECT**\n   - Attributes: Pname (Project Name), Pnumber (Project Number), Plocation (Project Location), Dnum (Department Number)\n\n5. **WORKS_ON**\n   - Attributes: Essn (Employee Social Security Number), Pno (Project Number), Hours\n\n6. **DEPENDENT**\n   - Attributes: Essn (Employee Social Security Number), Dependent_name, Sex, Bdate (Dependent Birth Date), Relationship\n\nThe relationships between the tables are indicated by arrows pointing from one attribute to another. For example:\n- The \"Dno\" attribute in the \"EMPLOYEE\" table points to the \"Dnumber\" attribute in the \"DEPARTMENT\" table.\n- The \"Ssn\" attribute in the \"EMPLOYEE\" table points to the \"Mgr_ssn\" attribute in the \"DEPARTMENT\" table.\n- The \"Essn\" attribute in the \"DEPENDENT\" table points to the \"Ssn\" attribute in the \"EMPLOYEE\" table.\n\nBased on this schema, it is possible to add a new department even if there are no employees in the database. The \"DEPARTMENT\" table does not have a direct dependency on the \"EMPLOYEE\" table for adding a new record. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**A. Yes**\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nCan you add an DEPARTMENT if there are no EMPLOYEEs in the database in <image 1>?\n\nA. Yes\nB. No\nC. Can't tell\n"
