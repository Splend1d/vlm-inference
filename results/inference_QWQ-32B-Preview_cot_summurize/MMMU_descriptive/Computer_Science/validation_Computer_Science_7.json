The hash function used is \\( h(k) = k \\mod 10 \\). The table is filled with the following values:\n\n- Index 1: 42\n- Index 2: 42\n- Index 3: 23\n- Index 4: 34\n- Index 5: 52\n- Index 6: 46\n- Index 7: 33\n\nThe remaining indices (0, 8, and 9) are empty.\n\nTo determine the possible order in which the key values were inserted, we need to consider the hash function and the linear probing mechanism. Here's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Hash Function**: \\( h(k) = k \\mod 10 \\)\n   - For example, \\( h(42) = 42 \\mod 10 = 2 \\), so 42 should be placed at index 2.\n   - If index 2 is occupied, it moves to the next available slot (linear probing).\n\n2. **Linear Probing**: If a slot is occupied, the value is placed in the next available slot.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: 46, 42, 34, 52, 23, 33**\n- \\( h(46) = 6 \\) -> Index 6 is empty, so 46 goes there.\n- \\( h(42) = 2 \\) -> Index 2 is empty, so 42 goes there.\n- \\( h(34) = 4 \\) -> Index 4 is empty, so 34 goes there.\n- \\( h(52) = 2 \\) -> Index 2 is occupied, so it moves to the next available slot (index 3).\n- \\( h(23) = 3 \\) -> Index 3 is occupied, so it moves to the next available slot (index 4).\n- \\( h(33) = 3 \\) -> Index 3 is occupied, so it moves to the next available slot (index 5).\n\nThis sequence results in the correct placement of values in the hash table.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n**A. 46, 42, 34, 52, 23, 33**\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nA hash table of length 10 uses open addressing with hash function h(k)=k mod 10, and linear probing. After inserting 6 values into an empty hash table, the table is as shown below. Which one of the following choices gives a possible order in which the key values could have been inserted in the table?<image 1>\n\nA. 46, 42, 34, 52, 23, 33\nB. 34, 42, 23, 52, 33, 46\nC. 46, 34, 42, 23, 52, 33\nD. 42, 46, 33, 23, 34, 52\n"
