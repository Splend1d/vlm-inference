The vertices are labeled V1 through V7, and the arrows indicate the direction of the edges between the vertices. Here is a detailed description of the adjacency list:\n\n- **V1**: Points to V5.\n- **V2**: Points to V3.\n- **V3**: Points to V5.\n- **V4**: Points to V7.\n- **V5**: Points to V3 and V4.\n- **V6**: Points to V4.\n- **V7**: Points to V6.\n\nStarting from vertex V1 and traversing according to the depth-first search (DFS) method, the obtained vertex sequence is:\n\n1. Start at V1.\n2. Move to V5 (since V1 points to V5).\n3. From V5, move to V3 (since V5 points to V3).\n4. From V3, move to V5 (since V3 points back to V5).\n5. From V5, move to V4 (since V5 also points to V4).\n6. From V4, move to V7 (since V4 points to V7).\n7. From V7, move to V6 (since V7 points to V6).\n8. Finally, move to V2 (since V6 does not point to any other vertex, and V2 has not been visited yet).\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence is: V1, V5, V3, V5, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe adjacency list of a directed graph is given as follows.

V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V2,V3\n\nB. V1,V2,V3,V4,V7,V6,V5\n\nC. V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V3,V2\n\nD. V1,V5,V6,V4,V7,V2,V3\n\nNone of these options exactly match the sequence described, as the described sequence includes V5 twice and ends with V2. But in typical DFS sequences, vertices are not repeated unless there are cycles, and even then, usually, once a vertex is visited, it's marked to avoid revisiting.\n\nGiven that V5 is visited twice in the described sequence, it might be a mistake in the description or in understanding the traversal. In DFS, once a vertex is visited, it's typically marked to prevent revisiting, unless the traversal allows for cycles or multiple visits.\n\nAssuming that vertices are not revisited, let's consider the possible traversal:\n\n1. Start at V1.\n\n2. Move to V5 (V1 points to V5).\n\n3. From V5, move to V3 (V5 points to V3).\n\n4. From V3, move to V5 (but V5 is already visited, so move to next neighbor).\n\n5. Since V3 points to V5 only, and V5 is already visited, backtrack to V5.\n\n6. From V5, move to V4 (V5 points to V4).\n\n7. From V4, move to V7 (V4 points to V7).\n\n8. From V7, move to V6 (V7 points to V6).\n\n9. From V6, there are no outgoing edges, so backtrack.\n\n10. All neighbors of V7 are visited, backtrack to V4.\n\n11. All neighbors of V4 are visited, backtrack to V5.\n\n12. All neighbors of V5 are visited, backtrack to V1.\n\n13. From V1, all neighbors are visited, so move to next unvisited vertex, which is V2.\n\n14. From V2, move to V3 (but V3 is already visited), so no further movement.\n\nThus, the sequence would be: V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V2,V3\n\nB. V1,V2,V3,V4,V7,V6,V5\n\nC. V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V3,V2\n\nD. V1,V5,V6,V4,V7,V2,V3\n\nOption A is closest to the sequence I've described, except that V3 is placed after V2 in option A, whereas in my sequence, V3 is visited before V2. However, since V3 is already visited when we reach V2, it might not be included again in the sequence.\n\nBut according to the description provided in the beginning, the sequence includes V3 after V6 and before V2.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option A: V1,V5,V4,V7,V6,V2,V3.\n\nBut based on my reasoning, the sequence should be V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2.\n\nIt seems there might be a discrepancy in the interpretation of the DFS traversal.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that from V5, we first visit V3, then from V3, we visit V5 again (even though it's already visited), but typically DFS avoids visiting already visited nodes to prevent cycles.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate sequence without revisiting nodes would be V1, V5, V3, V4, V7, V6, V2, which doesn't match any of the options exactly.\n\nHowever, option A is closest, so perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
