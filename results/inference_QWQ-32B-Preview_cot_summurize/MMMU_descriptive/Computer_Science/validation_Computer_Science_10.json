The matrix is represented in a tabular format with rows and columns labeled from 0 to 9. Each cell in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between two nodes. Here is the adjacency matrix:\n\n```\n   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n0 [\u221e  3  1  15 1  \u221e  1  9  \u221e  \u221e]\n1 [3  \u221e  3  13 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  8  \u221e  \u221e]\n2 [1  3  \u221e  \u221e  1  1  2  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n3 [15 13 \u221e  \u221e  1  1  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n4 [1  \u221e  1  1  \u221e  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n5 [\u221e  \u221e  1  1  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e]\n6 [1  \u221e  2  18 \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e  \u221e]\n7 [9  8  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e  2  \u221e]\n8 [\u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e  2]\n9 [\u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  \u221e  2  \u221e]\n```\n\nTo find the total weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph, we need to select edges with the smallest weights such that all nodes are connected and there are no cycles. We can use Kruskal's algorithm or Prim's algorithm to find the MST. However, since we are only interested in the total weight, we can manually inspect the matrix to find the smallest weights and ensure they form a connected graph without cycles.\n\nBy examining the matrix, we can identify the following edges with their weights:\n- Edge between nodes 0 and 1: weight 3\n- Edge between nodes 0 and 2: weight 1\n- Edge between nodes 1 and 2: weight 3\n- Edge between nodes 2 and 4: weight 1\n- Edge between nodes 4 and 5: weight 1\n- Edge between nodes 5 and 6: weight 2\n- Edge between nodes 6 and 7: weight 2\n- Edge between nodes 7 and 8: weight 2\n- Edge between nodes 8 and 9: weight 2\n\nAdding these weights together gives us the total weight of the minimum spanning tree:\n3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 17\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 17.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nGiven the adjacency matrix of a weighted undirected graph as follows, the total weight of its minimum spanning tree is:<image 1>\n\nA. 22\nB. 20\nC. 15\nD. 8\n"

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree (MST) for the given weighted undirected graph is calculated to be 17. However, the question presents multiple-choice options, and 17 is not among them. Let's re-examine the adjacency matrix and the selection of edges to ensure the correctness of the calculation.\n\nFirst, let's list the edges with their weights in ascending order, excluding self-loops (edges from a node to itself, which have weight \u221e):\n\n1. Edge between nodes 0 and 2: weight 1\n2. Edge between nodes 0 and 4: weight 1\n3. Edge between nodes 4 and 5: weight 1\n4. Edge between nodes 5 and 6: weight 2\n5. Edge between nodes 6 and 7: weight 2\n6. Edge between nodes 7 and 8: weight 2\n7. Edge between nodes 8 and 9: weight 2\n8. Edge between nodes 0 and 1: weight 3\n9. Edge between nodes 1 and 2: weight 3\n10. Edge between nodes 0 and 6: weight 1\n11. Edge between nodes 1 and 7: weight 8\n12. Edge between nodes 0 and 3: weight 15\n13. Edge between nodes 2 and 3: weight 13\n14. Edge between nodes 2 and 5: weight 1\n15. Edge between nodes 3 and 4: weight 1\n16. Edge between nodes 3 and 5: weight 1\n17. Edge between nodes 3 and 6: weight 18\n18. Edge between nodes 4 and 6: weight 18\n19. Edge between nodes 7 and 9: weight \u221e (not considered)\n\nNow, applying Kruskal's algorithm, we sort all the edges in increasing order of their weight and add them to the MST if they do not form a cycle.\n\nStart with the smallest edges:\n\n1. Add edge (0,2) with weight 1.\n2. Add edge (0,4) with weight 1.\n3. Add edge (4,5) with weight 1.\n4. Add edge (5,6) with weight 2.\n5. Add edge (6,7) with weight 2.\n6. Add edge (7,8) with weight 2.\n7. Add edge (8,9) with weight 2.\n\nAt this point, all nodes are included in the MST, and adding any more edges would create a cycle. Let's calculate the total weight:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11\n\nWait, this total is different from the initial calculation of 17. It seems there was an error in the initial selection of edges.\n\nLet's verify if the graph is fully connected with these edges:\n\n- Nodes 0,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 are connected.\n- Nodes 1 and 3 are not yet included.\n\nWe need to include nodes 1 and 3 in the MST without forming cycles.\n\nNext smallest edges involving nodes 1 and 3:\n\n8. Edge (0,1) with weight 3\n9. Edge (1,2) with weight 3\n10. Edge (2,5) with weight 1 (already included)\n11. Edge (3,4) with weight 1 (not yet considered)\n12. Edge (3,5) with weight 1 (not yet considered)\n13. Edge (1,7) with weight 8\n14. Edge (0,3) with weight 15\n15. Edge (2,3) with weight 13\n16. Edge (3,6) with weight 18\n17. Edge (4,6) with weight 18\n\nFirst, consider edge (3,4) with weight 1. Adding this edge includes node 3 in the MST.\n\nNow, the edges in the MST are:\n\n- (0,2):1\n- (0,4):1\n- (4,5):1\n- (5,6):2\n- (6,7):2\n- (7,8):2\n- (8,9):2\n- (3,4):1\n\nTotal weight: 1+1+1+2+2+2+2+1 = 12\n\nNow, all nodes are included: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nWait, node 1 is still not included. We need to add an edge connecting node 1 to the MST.\n\nNext smallest edge involving node 1 is (0,1) with weight 3.\n\nAdd edge (0,1) with weight 3.\n\nNow, all nodes are included, and the MST edges are:\n\n- (0,2):1\n- (0,4):1\n- (4,5):1\n- (5,6):2\n- (6,7):2\n- (7,8):2\n- (8,9):2\n- (3,4):1\n- (0,1):3\n\nTotal weight: 1+1+1+2+2+2+2+1+3 = 15\n\nTherefore, the total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 15.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 15.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{15} \\]"
