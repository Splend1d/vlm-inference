So, I have this data with two features, x1 and x2, and two classes labeled with circles and plus signs. The task is to see what happens to the coefficients w1 and w2 of these features as I increase the regularization parameter C from zero to a very large value.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what L1 regularization does. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the coefficients to the loss function. This has the effect of shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n\nThe expression given is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log P(y_i | x_i, w_0, w_1, w_2) - C(|w_1| + |w_2|)\n\\]\n\nSo, the model tries to maximize the log-likelihood of the data minus the regularization term. Here, C is the regularization strength. A larger C means a stronger regularization effect, which can drive more coefficients to zero.\n\nNow, the question is about the order in which the coefficients w1 and w2 become zero as C increases.\n\nTo answer this, I need to think about which coefficient is less important or has a smaller magnitude. In L1 regularization, the coefficient with the smaller contribution to the model is more likely to be shrunk to zero first as C increases.\n\nLooking back at the scatter plots, I see two clusters: one with circles and one with plus signs. Assuming that x1 and x2 are the features, I need to gauge which feature is more important for separating these two classes.\n\nIf one feature is much more informative for classification than the other, its coefficient will be larger in magnitude, and it will be less likely to be shrunk to zero compared to the less important feature.\n\nHowever, since I don't have the actual data points or any specific information about the relationship between x1, x2, and the classes, I have to make some assumptions.\n\nLet's consider that both features are somewhat important, but one is slightly more informative than the other. In that case, as C increases, the coefficient of the less important feature would be shrunk to zero first, followed by the more important one if C is increased further.\n\nSo, if w2 is less important than w1, then increasing C would first make w2 zero, and then if C is increased further, w1 would become zero. This corresponds to option A.\n\nOn the other hand, if w1 is less important, then option B would be correct.\n\nOption C suggests that both become zero at the same time, which is unlikely because L1 regularization typically zeros out coefficients one at a time, starting with the least important.\n\nOption D says that both cannot be zero even with a very large C, but that's not true because with sufficiently large C, both coefficients can be driven to zero.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is either A or B, depending on which feature is less important.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify which feature is less important, and assuming that x2 might be less important than x1, option A seems plausible: first w2 becomes zero, then w1.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if there's a way to determine which coefficient becomes zero first based on the given information.\n\nLooking back at the expression, the term being maximized is the log-likelihood minus C times the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.\n\nAs C increases, the penalty for having large coefficients increases, so the coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\n\nThe order in which coefficients become zero depends on their initial values and their contributions to the log-likelihood.\n\nIn general, the coefficient with the smaller initial value or less contribution to the log-likelihood will be shrunk to zero first.\n\nHowever, without specific values or more information about the data, it's impossible to definitively say which one becomes zero first.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, I have to choose one option.\n\nGiven that, and assuming that x2 is less important than x1, option A makes sense: first w2 becomes zero, then w1.\n\nAlternatively, if x1 is less important, then option B would be correct.\n\nBut since the question doesn't specify, I'll go with option A as a reasonable assumption.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
