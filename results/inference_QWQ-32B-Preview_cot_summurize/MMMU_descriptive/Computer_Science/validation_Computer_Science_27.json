The data points are represented by two different symbols: yellow circles and black plus signs. There is a clear separation between the two clusters of data points, with the yellow circles primarily located in the lower left quadrant and the black plus signs primarily located in the upper right quadrant. A blue line, representing the decision boundary of an SVM classifier with a Gaussian kernel, is drawn across the plot, separating the two clusters of data points. The decision boundary appears to be linear and does not perfectly separate the two classes, suggesting that the SVM might be underfitting the data.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nSuppose you have trained an SVM classifier with a Gaussian kernel, and it learned the following decision boundary on the training set:<image 1>You suspect that the SVM is underfitting your dataset.

                    "text": "Let's see. So, I've got this scatter plot with yellow circles and black plus signs, and there's a blue decision boundary from an SVM with a Gaussian kernel. The description says that the boundary is linear and doesn't perfectly separate the two classes, which makes me think that the model might be too simple for the data, hence underfitting.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the parameters C and \u03c3\u00b2 do in an SVM with a Gaussian kernel.\n\nC is the regularization parameter. A small C makes the decision boundary wider, allowing more misclassifications, which can lead to underfitting. A large C makes the decision boundary narrower, trying to classify more points correctly, which can lead to overfitting.\n\n\u03c3\u00b2 is related to the Gaussian kernel, which measures similarity between points. A large \u03c3\u00b2 means that points far apart can still be considered similar, leading to a smoother decision boundary. A small \u03c3\u00b2 means that only very close points are considered similar, which can lead to a more complex decision boundary.\n\nNow, since the model is underfitting, meaning it's too simple and not capturing the underlying structure of the data well, I should try to make the model more complex.\n\nTo make the SVM more complex, I should:\n\n1. Increase C: This will make the SVM try harder to classify all points correctly, potentially leading to a more complex decision boundary.\n\n2. Decrease \u03c3\u00b2: This will make the Gaussian kernel more localized, considering only very close points as similar, which can lead to a more complex, possibly non-linear decision boundary.\n\nSo, increasing C and decreasing \u03c3\u00b2 should help in making the model more complex and possibly reduce underfitting.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Decrease C, increase \u03c3\u00b2\n\nB. Decrease C, decrease \u03c3\u00b2\n\nC. Increase C, decrease \u03c3\u00b2\n\nD. Increase C, increase \u03c3\u00b2\n\nOption C matches what I've thought: increase C and decrease \u03c3\u00b2.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should double-check. Decreasing \u03c3\u00b2 makes the kernel more localized, which could lead to a more complex decision boundary, but increasing C also makes the model try to fit the data more closely, which could also lead to a more complex boundary.\n\nYes, so both actions aim at making the model more complex to capture the data better, which is what we need to do when underfitting.\n\nOption A suggests decreasing C and increasing \u03c3\u00b2. Decreasing C would make the model simpler, which is opposite to what we want, and increasing \u03c3\u00b2 would make the kernel more global, possibly simplifying the decision boundary further. So, that doesn't sound right.\n\nOption B suggests decreasing C and decreasing \u03c3\u00b2. Decreasing C simplifies the model, but decreasing \u03c3\u00b2 complicates it. These two actions sort of contradict each other.\n\nOption D suggests increasing C and increasing \u03c3\u00b2. Increasing C tries to make the model fit the data better, but increasing \u03c3\u00b2 makes the kernel more global, which might simplify the decision boundary. Again, these two actions somewhat contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, Option C seems to be the most appropriate: increase C to make the model fit the data better and decrease \u03c3\u00b2 to make the decision boundary more complex and capture local patterns in the data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
