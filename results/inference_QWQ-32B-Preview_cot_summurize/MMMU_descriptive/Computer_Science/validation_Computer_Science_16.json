The graph shows the following relationships:\n\n- Starting from the left, there is a node labeled \\( x \\).\n- There are two operations connected to \\( x \\): addition (+) and subtraction (-).\n- The addition operation is connected to another node labeled \\( y \\).\n- The subtraction operation is also connected to \\( y \\).\n- There are two more operations connected to the results of the addition and subtraction: multiplication (*) and subtraction (-).\n- The multiplication operation takes the result of \\( x + y \\) and multiplies it by \\( x - y \\).\n- The subtraction operation subtracts the result of the multiplication from \\( x + y \\).\n\nBased on this description, the correct expression represented by the DAG is:\n\n\\[ ((x + y) - ((x + y) * (x - y))) + ((x + y) * (x - y)) \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. ((x + y) - ((x + y) * (x - y))) + ((x + y) * (x - y))\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n<image 1> What is the DAG shown above for?\n\nA.
