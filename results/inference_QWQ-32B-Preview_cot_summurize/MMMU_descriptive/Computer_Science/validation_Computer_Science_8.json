The edges between these vertices have associated weights, which represent capacities for flow. Here is a detailed description of the graph:\n\n- Vertex V1 has two outgoing edges:\n  - An edge to V2 with a capacity of 6.\n  - An edge to V4 with a capacity of 7.\n\n- Vertex V2 has one outgoing edge:\n  - An edge to V5 with a capacity of 2.\n\n- Vertex V3 has three incoming edges and two outgoing edges:\n  - An incoming edge from V2 with a capacity of 2.\n  - An incoming edge from V4 with a capacity of 3.\n  - An outgoing edge to V5 with a capacity of 4.\n  - An outgoing edge to V6 with a capacity of 5.\n\n- Vertex V4 has one outgoing edge:\n  - An edge to V3 with a capacity of 3.\n\n- Vertex V5 has one outgoing edge:\n  - An edge to V6 with a capacity of 4.\n\n- Vertex V6 has no outgoing edges.\n\nTo find the maximum flow from V1 to V6, we need to consider the capacities of the paths from V1 to V6. The maximum flow is determined by the bottleneck capacity along any path from V1 to V6.\n\nHere are the possible paths and their capacities:\n\n1. V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6:\n   - Capacity: min(6, 2, 4) = 2\n\n2. V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6:\n   - Capacity: min(7, 3, 4, 4) = 3\n\n3. V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V6:\n   - Capacity: min(7, 3, 5) = 3\n\nThe maximum flow is the sum of the capacities of these paths, which is 2 + 3 + 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed among the options provided (A. 11, B. 0, C. 12, D. 13).\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe maximum flow from v1 to v6 is ____: <image 1>\n\nA. 11\nB. 0\nC. 12\nD. 13\n"

Since 8 is not among the options, it seems there might be an error in the calculation or the options provided.\n\nLet's re-examine the paths and their capacities:\n\n1. Path V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6:\n\n- Capacity is the minimum of the edges: min(6, 2, 4) = 2\n\n2. Path V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6:\n\n- Capacity is min(7, 3, 4, 4) = 3\n\n3. Path V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V6:\n\n- Capacity is min(7, 3, 5) = 3\n\nAdding these up: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8\n\nBut perhaps there are other paths or some edges can carry more flow.\n\nLet's consider if there is any residual capacity after sending flow along these paths.\n\nAfter sending 2 units along V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6:\n\n- The capacities become:\n\n- V1 to V2: 6 - 2 = 4\n\n- V2 to V5: 2 - 2 = 0\n\n- V5 to V6: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nNow, V2 to V5 has no residual capacity, so no more flow can go through this path.\n\nNext, sending 3 units along V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6:\n\n- V1 to V4: 7 - 3 = 4\n\n- V4 to V3: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- V3 to V5: 4 - 3 = 1\n\n- V5 to V6: 2 - 3 = -1 (wait, this can't be negative)\n\nWait, there's an issue here. When sending flow along V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6, the capacity of V5 to V6 is already reduced by the previous flow.\n\nInitially, V5 to V6 had a capacity of 4. After sending 2 units through V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6, the remaining capacity is 2. Now, if we send 3 units through V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6, but V5 to V6 only has 2 units left, so the actual flow that can be sent is limited by the\u6700\u5c0f\u5bb9\u91cf, which is 2 units.\n\nSo, the flow along this path is 2 units, not 3.\n\n- V1 to V4: 7 - 2 = 5\n\n- V4 to V3: 3 - 2 = 1\n\n- V3 to V5: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n- V5 to V6: 2 - 2 = 0\n\nNow, the capacity from V5 to V6 is 0, so no more flow can go through V5 to V6.\n\nNext, consider the path V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V6:\n\n- Capacities:\n\n- V1 to V4: 5 (from previous step)\n\n- V4 to V3: 1 (from previous step)\n\n- V3 to V6: 5 - 0 = 5 (no previous flow through this edge)\n\n- So, the flow along this path is min(5,1,5) = 1\n\n- After sending 1 unit:\n\n- V1 to V4: 5 - 1 = 4\n\n- V4 to V3: 1 - 1 = 0\n\n- V3 to V6: 5 - 1 = 4\n\nNow, let's see if there are any more paths from V1 to V6.\n\nPossible path: V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6\n\n- Check capacities:\n\n- V1 to V2: 4 (from earlier)\n\n- V2 to V3: but there is no direct edge from V2 to V3 in the original graph, so this path doesn't exist.\n\nAnother possible path: V1 -> V4 -> V5 -> V6\n\n- V1 to V4: 4\n\n- V4 to V5: but there is no direct edge from V4 to V5, only V4 to V3 and V3 to V5.\n\nSo, perhaps V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6, but V5 to V6 has 0 capacity now.\n\nAlternatively, V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V6: already sent 1 unit, remaining capacity:\n\n- V1 to V4: 4\n\n- V4 to V3: 0\n\n- V3 to V6: 4\n\nSince V4 to V3 has 0 capacity, no more flow can go through this path.\n\nIs there any other path?\n\nWhat about V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6?\n\n- V1 to V2: 4\n\n- V2 to V3: no direct edge\n\nWait, V2 has an edge to V5 and to V3? Wait, according to the original description:\n\n- V2 has one outgoing edge to V5 with capacity 2.\n\n- But in the description of V3, it has an incoming edge from V2 with capacity 2.\n\nWait, there might be a confusion here.\n\nLet me re-examine the original description:\n\n- V2 has one outgoing edge to V5 with capacity 2.\n\n- V3 has three incoming edges:\n\n- From V2 with capacity 2.\n\n- From V4 with capacity 3.\n\n- And two outgoing edges:\n\n- To V5 with capacity 4.\n\n- To V6 with capacity 5.\n\nSo, there is an edge from V2 to V3 with capacity 2.\n\nI must have missed that earlier.\n\nSo, the edge from V2 to V3 with capacity 2.\n\nTherefore, there is a path V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6.\n\nLet's calculate the capacity along this path:\n\n- V1 to V2: 4 (remaining capacity after previous flows)\n\n- V2 to V3: 2 (original capacity, no previous flow through this edge)\n\n- V3 to V6: 4 (remaining capacity after previous flows)\n\nSo, the flow along this path is min(4,2,4) = 2\n\n- After sending 2 units:\n\n- V1 to V2: 4 - 2 = 2\n\n- V2 to V3: 2 - 2 = 0\n\n- V3 to V6: 4 - 2 = 2\n\nNow, let's see if there are any more paths.\n\nPossible path: V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6\n\n- V1 to V2: 2\n\n- V2 to V5: 0 (no residual capacity)\n\n- So, no flow through this path.\n\nAnother path: V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6\n\n- V1 to V4: 4\n\n- V4 to V3: 0\n\n- No flow through this path.\n\nAnother path: V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V6\n\n- V1 to V4: 4\n\n- V4 to V3: 0\n\n- No flow through this path.\n\nAnother path: V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6\n\n- V1 to V2: 2\n\n- V2 to V3: 0\n\n- No flow through this path.\n\nSo, no more flow can be sent from V1 to V6.\n\nTotal flow sent:\n\n- First path: 2 units\n\n- Second path: 2 units\n\n- Third path: 1 unit\n\n- Fourth path: 2 units\n\nTotal: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7 units\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but now it's 7.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nWait, in the initial steps:\n\n- First path: V1 -> V2 -> V5 -> V6: 2 units\n\n- Second path: V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V5 -> V6: 2 units (since V5 to V6 had only 2 units left after the first path)\n\n- Third path: V1 -> V4 -> V3 -> V6: 1 unit\n\n- Fourth path: V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V6: 2 units\n\nTotal: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7 units\n\nSo, the maximum flow is 7 units.\n\nBut according to the initial calculation, it was 8, but that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different set of paths that can carry more flow.\n\nLet's try a different approach using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.\n\nInitialize flow to 0.\n\nFind an augmenting path from V1 to V6 in the residual graph.\n\n1.
