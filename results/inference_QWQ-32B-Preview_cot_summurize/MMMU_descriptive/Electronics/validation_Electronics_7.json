                    "text": "To calculate the steady-state voltage \\( v_c(t) \\) across the capacitor in the given circuit, we need to analyze the circuit in the frequency domain. The circuit consists of a current source \\( i(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) A, a 2\u03a9 resistor, and a combination of a 1\u03a9 resistor in series with a capacitor \\( C \\), all connected in parallel.\n\nFirst, let's identify the angular frequency of the current source:\n\n\\[ \\omega = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ rad/s} \\]\n\nIn the frequency domain, the current source can be represented as:\n\n\\[ I(\\omega) = \\cos\\left(\\omega t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\nHowever, for easier calculations, it's often useful to express this in terms of phasors. The phasor representation of the current source is:\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = \\angle \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\n\nBut since the magnitude is 1 A (as per the cosine function), we have:\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = 1 \\angle \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\n\nNow, let's find the impedance of each branch in the circuit.\n\n1. **2\u03a9 Resistor:**\n\n   The impedance of a resistor is simply its resistance:\n\n   \\[ Z_R = 2 \\Omega \\]\n\n2. **1\u03a9 Resistor in series with Capacitor:**\n\n   The impedance of a capacitor is:\n\n   \\[ Z_C = \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} = -j \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\]\n\n   Therefore, the total impedance of the series combination is:\n\n   \\[ Z_{RC} = 1 + Z_C = 1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\]\n\nSince these two branches are in parallel, the total admittance \\( Y \\) of the circuit is the sum of the admittances of each branch.\n\nFirst, find the admittance of each branch:\n\n1. **Admittance of the 2\u03a9 resistor:**\n\n   \\[ Y_R = \\frac{1}{Z_R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ S} \\]\n\n2. **Admittance of the series RC branch:**\n\n   The admittance of a series combination is not straightforward, but since we have impedances in parallel, we can find the total admittance directly.\n\nHowever, it might be easier to find the total impedance first and then find the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nLet's denote the total impedance of the parallel combination as \\( Z_{total} \\).\n\nThe total impedance \\( Z_{total} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{Z_{total}} = \\frac{1}{Z_R} + \\frac{1}{Z_{RC}} = Y_R + Y_{RC} \\]\n\nBut to find \\( Z_{RC} \\), we need to consider the series combination:\n\n\\[ Z_{RC} = 1 + \\left( -j \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\right) = 1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ Y_{RC} = \\frac{1}{Z_{RC}} = \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nTo simplify \\( Y_{RC} \\), multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate:\n\n\\[ Y_{RC} = \\frac{1 + j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}}{1 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total admittance is:\n\n\\[ Y = Y_R + Y_{RC} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1 + j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}}{1 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe it's better to find the voltage across the capacitor directly using mesh analysis or superposition.\n\nAlternatively, since we are dealing with a parallel circuit and looking for the voltage across the capacitor, which is the same as the voltage across the resistor branches, we can use the concept that in parallel circuits, the voltage is the same across all branches.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across the capacitor \\( V_C \\) is the same as the voltage across the 2\u03a9 resistor and the voltage across the series RC branch.\n\nBut to find \\( V_C \\), we can use the fact that the total current is the sum of the currents through each branch.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the voltage across the capacitor as \\( V_C \\).\n\nThen, the current through the 2\u03a9 resistor is:\n\n\\[ I_R = \\frac{V_C}{2} \\]\n\nThe current through the series RC branch is:\n\n\\[ I_{RC} = \\frac{V_C}{Z_{RC}} = \\frac{V_C}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nThe total current is:\n\n\\[ I(t) = I_R + I_{RC} = \\frac{V_C}{2} + \\frac{V_C}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nGiven that \\( I(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we can write in phasor form:\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = 1 \\angle \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\n\nSimilarly, \\( V_C \\) in phasor form is \\( \\tilde{V_C} \\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = \\frac{\\tilde{V_C}}{2} + \\frac{\\tilde{V_C}}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nFactor out \\( \\tilde{V_C} \\):\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = \\tilde{V_C} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\right) \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ \\tilde{V_C} = \\frac{\\tilde{I}}{ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} } \\]\n\nThis still seems messy. Maybe we need to find the value of capacitance \\( C \\) to proceed further. However, since it's not provided in the problem, perhaps there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since all elements are in parallel, and the voltage across all parallel elements is the same, we can find the equivalent impedance and then find the voltage.\n\nBut without the value of \\( C \\), it's challenging to proceed numerically. Maybe the problem expects a symbolic expression or perhaps there's a specific method to find the steady-state voltage without knowing \\( C \\).\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I misread the circuit description. Let's look back at the description:\n\n\"The circuit consists of a current source \\( i(t) \\), a resistor, and a capacitor connected in parallel.\"\n\nBut then it says:\n\n\"From node \\( n_1 \\), there is a branch with a 2\u03a9 resistor.\"\n\n\"Another branch from node \\( n_1 \\) has a 1\u03a9 resistor in series with a capacitor labeled \\( C \\).\"\n\nSo, actually, there are two branches in parallel connected to the current source:\n\n1. A single 2\u03a9 resistor.\n\n2. A series combination of a 1\u03a9 resistor and a capacitor.\n\nTherefore, the voltage across both branches is the same, which is \\( V_C(t) \\), the voltage across the capacitor.\n\nGiven that, we can write the total current as the sum of the currents through each branch.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the voltage across the capacitor as \\( V_C(t) \\), and its phasor as \\( \\tilde{V_C} \\).\n\nThe current through the 2\u03a9 resistor is:\n\n\\[ I_R = \\frac{V_C}{2} \\]\n\nThe current through the series RC branch is:\n\n\\[ I_{RC} = \\frac{V_C}{R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C}} = \\frac{V_C}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nThe total current is:\n\n\\[ I(t) = I_R + I_{RC} = \\frac{V_C}{2} + \\frac{V_C}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nIn phasor form:\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = \\tilde{V_C} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\right) \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ \\tilde{V_C} = \\frac{\\tilde{I}}{ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} } \\]\n\nThis still seems complicated without knowing \\( C \\). Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of parallel impedances.\n\nThe total admittance \\( Y \\) is:\n\n\\[ Y = Y_R + Y_{RC} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[ Y_R = \\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ Y_{RC} = \\frac{1}{R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C}} = \\frac{j\\omega C}{1 + j\\omega C R} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( R = 1 \\Omega \\):\n\n\\[ Y_{RC} = \\frac{j\\omega C}{1 + j\\omega C} \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ Y = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{j\\omega C}{1 + j\\omega C} \\]\n\nThis still depends on \\( C \\), which is unknown.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume that the capacitor is purely reactive, and find the voltage in terms of the current and impedances.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that in steady state, the circuit reaches a sinusoidal steady state, and I can use phasors to solve for the voltage.\n\nGiven that the current source is \\( i(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), its phasor is:\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = 1 \\angle \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\]\n\nThe voltage across the capacitor is related to the current through the circuit and the impedances.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the current division formula to find the current through the capacitor branch and then find the voltage across it.\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( C \\), it's tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the capacitor impedance is \\( Z_C = \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} \\), and the total impedance of the series RC branch is \\( Z_{RC} = 1 + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} = 1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\).\n\nThen, the admittance of the series RC branch is:\n\n\\[ Y_{RC} = \\frac{1}{Z_{RC}} = \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nMultiplying numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate:\n\n\\[ Y_{RC} = \\frac{1 + j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}}{1 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the total admittance is:\n\n\\[ Y = Y_R + Y_{RC} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1 + j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}}{1 + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\right)^2} \\]\n\nThis seems too complicated without knowing \\( C \\).\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the voltage across the capacitor is related to the current through the capacitor, which is the same as the total current minus the current through the 2\u03a9 resistor.\n\nBut this seems to lead back to the same issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can assume that the capacitor is in parallel with the series combination of the 1\u03a9 resistor and the current source, but that doesn't seem right based on the description.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the circuit in a different way.\n\nLet me try to draw the circuit based on the description:\n\n- Current source \\( i(t) \\) connected to node \\( n_1 \\).\n\n- From \\( n_1 \\), one branch is a 2\u03a9 resistor to ground.\n\n- Another branch from \\( n_1 \\) is a series combination of a 1\u03a9 resistor and a capacitor to ground.\n\nSo, it's a parallel circuit with two paths from \\( n_1 \\) to ground: one path is just a 2\u03a9 resistor, and the other path is a 1\u03a9 resistor in series with a capacitor.\n\nIn this case, the voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the 2\u03a9 resistor, which is the node voltage \\( v(t) \\).\n\nSo, \\( v(t) = v_C(t) \\).\n\nNow, applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node \\( n_1 \\):\n\n\\[ i(t) = i_R + i_{RC} \\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\[ i_R = \\frac{v(t)}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ i_{RC} = \\frac{v(t)}{1 + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C}} = \\frac{v(t)}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ i(t) = \\frac{v(t)}{2} + \\frac{v(t)}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\n\\[ i(t) = v(t) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\right) \\]\n\nIn phasor domain:\n\n\\[ \\tilde{I} = \\tilde{V} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ \\tilde{V} = \\frac{\\tilde{I}}{ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} } \\]\n\nThis still doesn't help without knowing \\( C \\).\n\nPerhaps there's a different approach. Maybe I can consider the impedance seen by the current source and find the voltage division.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept that in parallel circuits, the voltage is the same across all branches, and find the equivalent impedance.\n\nBut without the value of \\( C \\), it's challenging to find a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe the problem expects a symbolic expression in terms of \\( C \\), but looking at the options, they are all in terms of time and angular frequency, without \\( C \\), so perhaps \\( C \\) cancels out somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the circuit description.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nAssuming that the capacitor is in parallel with the 1\u03a9 resistor, but the description says \"a 1\u03a9 resistor in series with a capacitor labeled \\( C \\)\", which is in parallel with the 2\u03a9 resistor.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the impedance of the capacitor and combine it with the resistor.\n\nLet me try to find the impedance of the series RC branch:\n\n\\[ Z_{RC} = R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} = 1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\]\n\nThen, the total impedance of the circuit is:\n\n\\[ Z_{total} = \\frac{Z_R \\times Z_{RC}}{Z_R + Z_{RC}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\left(1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)}{2 + 1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} = \\frac{2\\left(1 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)}{3 - j \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\nThis seems even more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the 2\u03a9 resistor, and use that to find the relationship.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the concept of parallel impedances.\n\nThe total impedance \\( Z_{total} \\) is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{Z_{total}} = \\frac{1}{Z_R} + \\frac{1}{Z_{RC}} \\]\n\n\\[ Z_{total} = \\frac{Z_R \\times Z_{RC}}{Z_R + Z_{RC}} \\]\n\nBut this leads back to the earlier expression.\n\nThis is getting too messy without knowing \\( C \\). Maybe there's a different method to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider writing the differential equation for the circuit and solving for \\( v_C(t) \\).\n\nGiven that the current source is \\( i(t) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), and the circuit consists of parallel branches of a resistor and a series RC, I can write the governing differential equation.\n\nBut this seems time-consuming, and I still don't have the value of \\( C \\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume a specific value for \\( C \\), but that's unlikely without being specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options provide a clue.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. \\( \\sqrt{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{1}{3}t\\right) \\)\n\nB. \\( \\sqrt{3} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t\\right) \\)\n\nC. \\( \\sqrt{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t\\right) \\)\n\nD. \\( \\sqrt{3} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4}{3}t\\right) \\)\n\nNotice that options B and C have the same angular frequency as the current source, which is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) rad/s, while options A and D have different angular frequencies.\n\nSince in steady state, the voltage across the capacitor should oscillate at the same frequency as the current source, options B and C are more plausible.\n\nBetween B and C, the amplitude differs: one has \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) and the other has \\( \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is C, \\( \\sqrt{2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t\\right) \\), as \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is a common amplitude factor for sinusoidal steady-state responses.\n\nHowever, this is just an educated guess, and without performing the actual calculations, it's not certain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the voltage across the capacitor is related to the current through it, and use the impedance of the capacitor to find the relationship.\n\nBut again, without knowing \\( C \\), it's not possible to find a numerical answer.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to select option C as the most plausible answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\sqrt{2} \\cos\\left( \\dfrac{2"
