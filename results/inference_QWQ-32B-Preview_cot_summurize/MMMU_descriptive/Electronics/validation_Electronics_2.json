The waveform starts at zero current at 0 ms, reaches its maximum positive value of 4 A at approximately 1 ms, then decreases to zero at 2 ms, reaches its minimum negative value of -4 A at approximately 3 ms, and returns to zero at 4 ms. This indicates a complete cycle of the sinusoidal waveform within 4 ms.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nFind the effective (rms) value (in terms of A) of the three periodic current waveforms shown in <image 1>.\n\n"
