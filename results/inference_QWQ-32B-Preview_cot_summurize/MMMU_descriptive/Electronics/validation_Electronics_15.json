The current source is represented by a circle with an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the direction of the current flow. The current through the current source is given by \\( i(t) = \\sin t \\).\n\nThe inductor is shown as a rectangular symbol with two diagonal lines inside it, representing its inductive property. The voltage across the inductor is denoted by \\( v(t) \\), with a plus sign on the top right corner and a minus sign on the bottom left corner, indicating the polarity of the voltage.\n\nThe circuit is a closed loop, meaning the current flows from the current source through the inductor and back to the current source. The goal is to find the voltage across the inductor given the current \\( i(t) = \\sin t \\) and the relationship between the flux linkage (\\( \\phi \\)) and the current (\\( i \\)) for the nonlinear inductor, which is defined by \\( \\phi = i + \\tanh(i) \\).\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nConsider a nonlinear inductor which is defined by $\\phi = i + tanh (i)$. Let the current through this inductor be i(t) = sin t.
