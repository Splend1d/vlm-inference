                    "text": "To solve for the current \\( i(t) \\) in the circuit described, we need to analyze the given electrical circuit, which consists of a voltage source \\( v_s(t) = 3t \\cdot u(t) \\), a resistor of 2 ohms, and an inductor of 1 henry connected in series. The goal is to find the expression for \\( i(t) \\).\n\nFirst, let's recall the fundamental relationships in a series RLC circuit. However, in this case, there is no capacitor present, so it's actually a series RL circuit.\n\nIn a series RL circuit, the voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm's law:\n\n\\[ v_R(t) = R \\cdot i(t) \\]\n\nAnd the voltage across the inductor is given by:\n\n\\[ v_L(t) = L \\cdot \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\]\n\nThe total voltage \\( v_s(t) \\) is the sum of the voltages across the resistor and the inductor:\n\n\\[ v_s(t) = v_R(t) + v_L(t) \\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( v_R(t) \\) and \\( v_L(t) \\):\n\n\\[ v_s(t) = R \\cdot i(t) + L \\cdot \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\]\n\nGiven:\n\n- \\( v_s(t) = 3t \\cdot u(t) \\)\n\n- \\( R = 2 \\) \u03a9\n\n- \\( L = 1 \\) H\n\nPlugging in these values:\n\n\\[ 3t \\cdot u(t) = 2 \\cdot i(t) + 1 \\cdot \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. To solve for \\( i(t) \\), we can use the method of integrating factors.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation in standard form:\n\n\\[ \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2 \\cdot i(t) = 3t \\cdot u(t) \\]\n\nThe integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\mu(t) = e^{\\int 2 \\, dt} = e^{2t} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\n\\[ e^{2t} \\cdot \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2 e^{2t} \\cdot i(t) = 3t e^{2t} \\cdot u(t) \\]\n\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product \\( e^{2t} \\cdot i(t) \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( e^{2t} \\cdot i(t) \\right) = 3t e^{2t} \\cdot u(t) \\]\n\nNow, integrate both sides with respect to \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ e^{2t} \\cdot i(t) = \\int 3t e^{2t} \\cdot u(t) \\, dt \\]\n\nSince \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function, it is equal to 1 for \\( t \\geq 0 \\) and 0 otherwise. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n\n\\[ e^{2t} \\cdot i(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} 3\\tau e^{2\\tau} \\, d\\tau \\]\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let:\n\n\\[ I = \\int 3t e^{2t} \\, dt \\]\n\nLet \\( u = 3t \\), \\( dv = e^{2t} dt \\)\n\nThen \\( du = 3 dt \\), \\( v = \\frac{1}{2} e^{2t} \\)\n\nUsing integration by parts formula \\( \\int u \\, dv = u v - \\int v \\, du \\):\n\n\\[ I = 3t \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} e^{2t} - \\int \\frac{1}{2} e^{2t} \\cdot 3 \\, dt \\]\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{3}{2} t e^{2t} - \\frac{3}{2} \\int e^{2t} \\, dt \\]\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{3}{2} t e^{2t} - \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} e^{2t} \\]\n\n\\[ I = \\frac{3}{2} t e^{2t} - \\frac{3}{4} e^{2t} + C \\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[ e^{2t} \\cdot i(t) = \\frac{3}{2} t e^{2t} - \\frac{3}{4} e^{2t} + C \\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( e^{2t} \\):\n\n\\[ i(t) = \\frac{3}{2} t - \\frac{3}{4} + C e^{-2t} \\]\n\nNow, we need to determine the constant \\( C \\) using initial conditions. At \\( t = 0 \\), the current \\( i(0) \\) is typically zero if there is no initial energy stored in the inductor.\n\n\\[ i(0) = 0 = \\frac{3}{2}(0) - \\frac{3}{4} + C e^{0} \\]\n\n\\[ 0 = -\\frac{3}{4} + C \\]\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThus, the expression for \\( i(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ i(t) = \\frac{3}{2} t - \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} e^{-2t} \\]\n\nHowever, this seems to be different from the options provided. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWait a minute, the options are all in the form of exponential functions multiplied by a constant and the unit step function. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the initial condition or in solving the differential equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the Laplace transform method, which is often more straightforward for circuits with sources involving step functions.\n\nLet's try using Laplace transforms.\n\nFirst, take the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{ v_s(t) \\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{ R i(t) + L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\} \\]\n\nGiven \\( v_s(t) = 3t \\cdot u(t) \\), its Laplace transform is:\n\n\\[ V_s(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ 3t \\cdot u(t) \\} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s^2} \\]\n\nThe Laplace transform of \\( R i(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ R I(s) \\]\n\nThe Laplace transform of \\( L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\) is:\n\n\\[ L [ s I(s) - i(0) ] \\]\n\nAssuming zero initial current, \\( i(0) = 0 \\), so:\n\n\\[ L s I(s) \\]\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n\\[ 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s^2} = 2 I(s) + 1 \\cdot (s I(s) - 0) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{s^2} = (2 + s) I(s) \\]\n\n\\[ I(s) = \\frac{3}{s^2 (2 + s)} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the inverse Laplace transform of \\( I(s) \\) to get \\( i(t) \\).\n\nTo do this, we can perform partial fraction decomposition on \\( I(s) \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{s^2 (2 + s)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s^2} + \\frac{C}{2 + s} \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( s^2 (2 + s) \\):\n\n\\[ 3 = A s (2 + s) + B (2 + s) + C s^2 \\]\n\nExpand and collect like terms:\n\n\\[ 3 = A s^2 + 2 A s + B s + 2 B + C s^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 3 = (A + C) s^2 + (2 A + B) s + 2 B \\]\n\nNow, set up the system of equations by equating coefficients:\n\n1. \\( A + C = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2 A + B = 0 \\)\n\n3. \\( 2 B = 3 \\)\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\n\\[ 2 A + \\frac{3}{2} = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2 A = -\\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ A = -\\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\n\\[ -\\frac{3}{4} + C = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nSo, the partial fractions are:\n\n\\[ I(s) = \\frac{-\\frac{3}{4}}{s} + \\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{s^2} + \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}}{2 + s} \\]\n\n\\[ I(s) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s^2} + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 + s} \\]\n\nNow, take the inverse Laplace transform of each term:\n\n\\[ i(t) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot t + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot e^{-2t} \\]\n\n\\[ i(t) = -\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} t + \\frac{3}{4} e^{-2t} \\]\n\nThis matches the earlier result obtained using the time-domain method.\n\nHowever, none of the provided options match this expression directly. Perhaps there's a mistake in the assumption or the approach.\n\nLet me double-check the Laplace transform approach.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\[ I(s) = \\frac{3}{s^2 (2 + s)} \\]\n\nPartial fractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{3}{s^2 (2 + s)} = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s^2} + \\frac{C}{2 + s} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( s^2 (2 + s) \\):\n\n\\[ 3 = A s (2 + s) + B (2 + s) + C s^2 \\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[ 3 = 2 A s + A s^2 + 2 B + B s + C s^2 \\]\n\n\\[ 3 = (A + C) s^2 + (2 A + B) s + 2 B \\]\n\nSetting up the system:\n\n1. \\( A + C = 0 \\)\n\n2. \\( 2 A + B = 0 \\)\n\n3. \\( 2 B = 3 \\)\n\nSolving:\n\nFrom equation 3: \\( B = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( 2 A + \\frac{3}{2} = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( A = -\\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( -\\frac{3}{4} + C = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( C = \\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\nSo, \\( I(s) = -\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s^2} + \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2 + s} \\)\n\nInverse Laplace:\n\n\\[ i(t) = -\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} t + \\frac{3}{4} e^{-2t} \\]\n\nThis seems correct, but it doesn't match any of the provided options. Maybe the question is expecting the answer in terms of the unit step function \\( u(t) \\), or perhaps there's a simplification I'm missing.\n\nLet's see if we can express \\( i(t) \\) in a different form.\n\nFactor out \\( e^{-2t} \\):\n\n\\[ i(t) = \\left( -\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{3}{2} t \\right) + \\frac{3}{4} e^{-2t} \\]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the steady-state response or something else, but it seems to ask for \\( i(t) \\) directly.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the unit step function \\( u(t) \\) is implicit in the solutions, as the responses are zero before \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. \\( 2 e^{-2t} u(t) \\)\n\nB. \\( 3 e^{-2t} u(t) \\)\n\nC. \\( 2.2 e^{-2t} u(t) \\)\n\nD. \\( 3 e^{-3t} u(t) \\)\n\nNone of these match the expression I derived. Perhaps there's a mistake in the initial assumption or in the application of the Laplace transform.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inductor current for \\( t \\geq 0 \\) can be expressed in terms of the natural response and the particular solution.\n\nLet's try to solve it again using the time-domain approach, considering the homogeneous and particular solutions.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2 i(t) = 3t \\cdot u(t) \\]\n\nFirst, solve the homogeneous equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{di_h(t)}{dt} + 2 i_h(t) = 0 \\]\n\nThe solution is:\n\n\\[ i_h(t) = C e^{-2t} \\]\n\nNext, find a particular solution \\( i_p(t) \\) for the non-homogeneous equation. Since the right-hand side is \\( 3t \\), assume a particular solution of the form:\n\n\\[ i_p(t) = A t + B \\]\n\nTake the derivative:\n\n\\[ \\frac{di_p(t)}{dt} = A \\]\n\nSubstitute into the differential equation:\n\n\\[ A + 2 (A t + B) = 3t \\]\n\n\\[ A + 2 A t + 2 B = 3t \\]\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\n- For \\( t \\): \\( 2 A = 3 \\) \u2192 \\( A = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\n- Constant term: \\( A + 2 B = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( \\frac{3}{2} + 2 B = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( B = -\\frac{3}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\n\\[ i_p(t) = \\frac{3}{2} t - \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nTherefore, the general solution is:\n\n\\[ i(t) = i_h(t) + i_p(t) = C e^{-2t} + \\frac{3}{2} t - \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nApply the initial condition \\( i(0) = 0 \\):\n\n\\[ 0 = C e^{0} + \\frac{3}{2}(0) - \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ 0 = C - \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[ i(t) = \\frac{3}{4} e^{-2t} + \\frac{3}{2} t - \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n\nThis matches the earlier result.\n\nHowever, this doesn't align with any of the provided options, which are all of the form \\( k e^{-2t} u(t) \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the circuit configuration or the governing equations.\n\nWait, the description mentions \"a voltage source \\( v_s(t) \\), a resistor with a resistance of 2 ohms (\u03a9), and an inductor with an inductance of 1 henry (H). The voltage across the resistor is denoted as \\( v(t) \\), and the current flowing through the circuit is denoted as \\( i(t) \\).\"\n\nBut in the question, it's asking for \\( i(t) \\), and the options suggest an exponential decay, which would correspond to the natural response of an RL circuit without considering the particular solution due to the input \\( v_s(t) = 3t u(t) \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circuit is being driven by a step function, but here it's a ramp function due to \\( 3t u(t) \\).\n\nGiven that my calculations consistently lead to the same expression involving both exponential and linear terms, and none of the options include such terms, I might have misinterpreted the circuit or the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about a different circuit or a different scenario. Let's look back at the original description.\n\n\"the relevant image(s)\" is mentioned, but since I can't see the image, I have to rely on the description provided.\n\nThe description says it's a series RLC circuit with no capacitors involved, meaning it's a series RL circuit.\n\nGiven that, my analysis seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the options provided, or perhaps the question is from a different context.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between my calculations and the provided options, I'm unable to select any of the options A, B, C, or D as correct based on my analysis.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that none of the provided options correctly represent the current \\( i(t) \\) in the circuit under the given conditions.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{None of the above}} \\]"
