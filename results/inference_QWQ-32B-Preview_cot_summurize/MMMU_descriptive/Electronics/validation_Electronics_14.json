The graph shows three distinct segments:\n\n1. From \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\), the function starts at \\( f(0) = 0 \\) and increases according to the equation \\( f(t) = 5t^2 \\). At \\( t = 2 \\), the value of the function reaches \\( f(2) = 20 \\).\n\n2. From \\( t = 2 \\) to \\( t = 5 \\), the function remains constant at \\( f(t) = 20 \\).\n\n3. From \\( t = 5 \\) to \\( t = 7 \\), the function decreases linearly from \\( f(5) = 20 \\) to \\( f(7) = -30 \\).\n\nUsing this information, we can write the signal \\( f(t) \\) using step functions as follows:\n\n- For the first segment (from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = 2 \\)), the function is \\( 5t^2 \\).\n- For the second segment (from \\( t = 2 \\) to \\( t = 5 \\)), the function is constant at \\( 20 \\).\n- For the third segment (from \\( t = 5 \\) to \\( t = 7 \\)), the function decreases linearly from \\( 20 \\) to \\( -30 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct expression for \\( f(t) \\) is:\n\n\\[ f(t) = 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)] \\]\n\nThis matches option C.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWrite the signal f(t) shown in <image 1> using the step functions.\n\nA. 4t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 5)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\nB. 4t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\nC. 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\nD. 5t^2 [u(t) - u(t - 2)] + 20[u(t - 2) - u(t - 3)] + 15(t - 7)[u(t - 5) - u(t - 7)]\n"
