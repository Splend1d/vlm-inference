Here is a detailed description:\n\n1. **Nodes and Voltage Sources:**\n   - There are three nodes labeled \\( n_1 \\), \\( n_2 \\), and \\( n_3 \\).\n   - The lower node is not explicitly labeled but is considered the reference node (ground).\n\n2. **Voltage Sources:**\n   - A voltage source of \\( 0.2V \\) is connected between nodes \\( n_3 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n   - Another voltage source of \\( 0.5V \\) is connected between nodes \\( n_1 \\) and the reference node.\n   - A controlled voltage source \\( 2v_x \\) is connected between nodes \\( n_3 \\) and the reference node.\n\n3. **Current Sources:**\n   - A current source of \\( 4A \\) is connected between nodes \\( n_3 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n   - Another current source of \\( 14A \\) is connected between nodes \\( n_1 \\) and the reference node.\n\n4. **Resistors:**\n   - A 10\u03a9 resistor is connected between nodes \\( n_3 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n   - Another 10\u03a9 resistor is connected between nodes \\( n_1 \\) and \\( n_2 \\).\n   - A 2\u03a9 resistor is connected between nodes \\( n_1 \\) and the reference node.\n\n5. **Additional Components:**\n   - There is a 5\u03a9 resistor connected between nodes \\( n_3 \\) and the reference node.\n\nTo find \\( v_x \\), we need to write the nodal equation at node \\( n_1 \\). The nodal equation for node \\( n_1 \\) can be written as follows:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_{n1} - 0}{2\\Omega} + \\frac{v_{n1} - v_{n2}}{10\\Omega} = 14A \\]\n\nGiven that \\( v_{n2} = 0.2V \\) (since it is connected to the reference node through a voltage source), we can substitute \\( v_{n2} \\) into the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_{n1}}{2\\Omega} + \\frac{v_{n1} - 0.2V}{10\\Omega} = 14A \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{v_{n1}}{2} + \\frac{v_{n1} - 0.2}{10} = 14 \\]\n\nMultiplying through by 10 to clear the denominators:\n\n\\[ 5v_{n1} + v_{n1} - 0.2 = 140 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n\\[ 6v_{n1} = 140.2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( v_{n1} \\):\n\n\\[ v_{n1} = \\frac{140.2}{6} \\]\n\\[ v_{n1} = 23.367V \\]\n\nTherefore, the numerical value of \\( v_x \\) in terms of V is approximately 23.367V.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\n With reference to <image 1>, let the lower node be the reference, and write the single nodal equation required to find $v_x$. What's the numerical value of $v_x$ in terms of V?\n\n"
