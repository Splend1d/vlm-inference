                    "text": "To find the Fourier series for the sawtooth waveform described, we need to recall the general form of a Fourier series for a periodic function. The Fourier series of a function f(t) with period 2L is given by:\n\nf(t) = a0 / 2 + \u03a3 [an cos(n\u03c9t) + bn sin(n\u03c9t)]\n\nwhere \u03c9 = \u03c0 / L, and the coefficients are:\n\na0 = (1 / L) \u222b[f(t) dt] from -L to L\n\nan = (1 / L) \u222b[f(t) cos(n\u03c9t) dt] from -L to L\n\nbn = (1 / L) \u222b[f(t) sin(n\u03c9t) dt] from -L to L\n\nHowever, since the sawtooth waveform is an odd function (symmetric about the origin), all the cosine terms will be zero, meaning an = 0 for all n. Therefore, the Fourier series simplifies to:\n\nf(t) = \u03a3 bn sin(n\u03c9t)\n\nNow, from the description, the waveform has a period of 2\u03c0, so L = \u03c0, and \u03c9 = \u03c0 / \u03c0 = 1.\n\nThus, the Fourier series becomes:\n\nf(t) = \u03a3 bn sin(nt)\n\nwhere bn = (1 / \u03c0) \u222b[f(t) sin(nt) dt] from -\u03c0 to \u03c0\n\nGiven that the waveform is a sawtooth wave that increases linearly from -\u03c0 to \u03c0 and then drops instantaneously, we can define f(t) as:\n\nf(t) = t, for -\u03c0 < t < \u03c0\n\nwith periodic extension.\n\nNow, let's compute bn:\n\nbn = (1 / \u03c0) \u222b[t sin(nt) dt] from -\u03c0 to \u03c0\n\nSince f(t) = t is an odd function and sin(nt) is also odd, their product is even. Therefore, we can simplify the integral:\n\nbn = (2 / \u03c0) \u222b[t sin(nt) dt] from 0 to \u03c0\n\nNow, we need to compute this integral. Integration by parts is suitable here. Let:\n\nu = t, dv = sin(nt) dt\n\nThen:\n\ndu = dt, v = (-1 / n) cos(nt)\n\nUsing integration by parts:\n\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\n\nSo:\n\n\u222b[t sin(nt) dt] = (-t / n) cos(nt) - \u222b[(-1 / n) cos(nt) dt]\n\n= (-t / n) cos(nt) + (1 / n) \u222b cos(nt) dt\n\n= (-t / n) cos(nt) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(nt)\n\nNow, evaluating this from 0 to \u03c0:\n\n[(-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0)] - [(-0 / n) cos(0) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(0)]\n\n= (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0) - 0 - 0\n\n= (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0) + 0\n\n= (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0)\n\nTherefore:\n\nbn = (2 / \u03c0) * [(-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0)]\n\n= (2 / \u03c0) * (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0)\n\n= -2/n cos(n\u03c0)\n\nNow, cos(n\u03c0) = (-1)^n\n\nTherefore:\n\nbn = -2/n * (-1)^n = 2(-1)^{n+1}/n\n\nWait, let's verify that:\n\ncos(n\u03c0) = (-1)^n\n\nSo:\n\nbn = -2/n * (-1)^n = 2(-1)^{n+1}/n\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = \u03a3 [2(-1)^{n+1}/n] sin(nt)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nf(t) = 2 \u03a3 [(-1)^{n+1} sin(nt)/n]\n\nNow, let's compare this with the given options:\n\nA. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 4) sin 3t + ...]\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 30 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nC. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nD. -2[sin t + (1 / 3) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nFirst, note that the general form should be:\n\nf(t) = 2 [sin t - (1/2) sin 2t + (1/3) sin 3t - (1/4) sin 4t + ...]\n\nWhich can also be written as:\n\nf(t) = 2 \u03a3 [(-1)^{n+1} sin(nt)/n] for n from 1 to infinity\n\nNow, looking at the options, none of them directly match this form. However, option B seems closest, but it has sin 30 instead of sin 2t.\n\nWait, perhaps there are typos in the options. Let's assume that \"sin 25\" and \"sin 30\" are typos and should be \"sin 2t\" and \"sin 3t\", respectively.\n\nIf that's the case, then option B would be:\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 2t + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nBut our derived series has alternating signs:\n\nf(t) = 2 [sin t - (1/2) sin 2t + (1/3) sin 3t - (1/4) sin 4t + ...]\n\nSo, it doesn't match option B, which has all positive terms.\n\nOption A has sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 4) sin 3t + ..., which doesn't match.\n\nOption C has sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ..., again with potential typos.\n\nOption D has sin t + (1 / 3) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ..., which doesn't match.\n\nGiven that, it seems there might be a mistake in the options provided. The correct Fourier series should have alternating signs and coefficients decreasing as 1/n.\n\nHowever, if we consider that the options might have a negative sign outside, let's factor that in.\n\nFor example, option B is -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 2t + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nWhich would be -2 sin t - sin 2t - (2/3) sin 3t - ...\n\nBut our series is 2 sin t - sin 2t + (2/3) sin 3t - ...\n\nSo still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's consider the general formula for a sawtooth wave.\n\nThe standard Fourier series for a sawtooth wave with period 2\u03c0 and amplitude ranging from -\u03c0 to \u03c0 is:\n\nf(t) = 2 \u03a3 [(-1)^{n+1} sin(nt)/n], for n = 1 to infinity\n\nWhich matches what we derived earlier.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, if we consider option B with corrected typos:\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 2t + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nWhich is -2 sin t - (2/2) sin 2t - (2/3) sin 3t - ... = -2 sin t - sin 2t - (2/3) sin 3t - ...\n\nBut our series is 2 sin t - sin 2t + (2/3) sin 3t - ...\n\nSo still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a phase shift or different definition.\n\nWait, maybe the sawtooth wave is defined differently in the image. Let's refer back to the description:\n\n\"The waveform starts at -\u03c0 at t = 0 and increases linearly to \u03c0 at t = \u03c0. At t = \u03c0, it drops instantaneously back to -\u03c0. This pattern repeats every \u03c0 units of time.\"\n\nWait a minute, it says the waveform repeats every \u03c0 units of time, not every 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, the period is \u03c0, not 2\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, L = \u03c0 / 2, since 2L = \u03c0.\n\nThus, \u03c9 = \u03c0 / L = \u03c0 / (\u03c0 / 2) = 2.\n\nSo, the Fourier series should be:\n\nf(t) = a0 / 2 + \u03a3 [an cos(2nt) + bn sin(2nt)]\n\nAgain, since f(t) is odd, an = 0.\n\nSo, f(t) = \u03a3 bn sin(2nt)\n\nwith bn = (2 / \u03c0) \u222b[f(t) sin(2nt) dt] from 0 to \u03c0\n\nNow, f(t) = t, for 0 < t < \u03c0\n\nSo, bn = (2 / \u03c0) \u222b[t sin(2nt) dt] from 0 to \u03c0\n\nAgain, integrate by parts:\n\nu = t, dv = sin(2nt) dt\n\ndu = dt, v = (-1 / (2n)) cos(2nt)\n\nSo,\n\n\u222b t sin(2nt) dt = (-t / (2n)) cos(2nt) - \u222b (-1 / (2n)) cos(2nt) dt\n\n= (-t / (2n)) cos(2nt) + (1 / (2n)) \u222b cos(2nt) dt\n\n= (-t / (2n)) cos(2nt) + (1 / (2n)) * (1 / (2n)) sin(2nt)\n\n= (-t / (2n)) cos(2nt) + (1 / (4n\u00b2)) sin(2nt)\n\nNow, evaluate from 0 to \u03c0:\n\n[(-\u03c0 / (2n)) cos(2n\u03c0) + (1 / (4n\u00b2)) sin(2n\u03c0)] - [(-0 / (2n)) cos(0) + (1 / (4n\u00b2)) sin(0)]\n\n= (-\u03c0 / (2n)) cos(2n\u03c0) + 0 - 0 - 0\n\n= (-\u03c0 / (2n)) cos(2n\u03c0)\n\nSince cos(2n\u03c0) = 1 for all integer n.\n\nTherefore, bn = (2 / \u03c0) * [(-\u03c0 / (2n)) * 1] = (2 / \u03c0) * (-\u03c0 / (2n)) = -1 / n\n\nThus, the Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = \u03a3 [(-1 / n) sin(2nt)]\n\nfor n from 1 to infinity.\n\nSo, f(t) = - \u03a3 [sin(2nt)/n]\n\nNow, comparing this with the given options:\n\nA. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 4) sin 3t + ...]\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 30 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nC. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nD. -2[sin t + (1 / 3) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nAgain, assuming typos in the options, particularly \"sin 25\" and \"sin 30\" should be \"sin 2t\" and \"sin 3t\", respectively.\n\nThen, option B would be:\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 2t + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nWhich is -2 sin t - sin 2t - (2/3) sin 3t - ...\n\nBut our derived series is - \u03a3 [sin(2nt)/n], which is -sin(2t) - (1/2) sin(4t) - (1/3) sin(6t) - ...\n\nSo, our series has terms like sin(2t), sin(4t), sin(6t), etc., with coefficients -1/n.\n\nComparing with option B, which has sin t, sin 2t, sin 3t, etc., with coefficients -2/n.\n\nThey don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are for a different period or definition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sawtooth wave is being represented differently.\n\nWait, in the initial description, it says the waveform repeats every \u03c0 units of time, but in my calculation, I assumed L = \u03c0 / 2, leading to \u03c9 = 2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to set the fundamental period as 2\u03c0 for consistency with standard Fourier series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps redefining the function over 0 to \u03c0 and extending it periodically.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's consider the sawtooth wave over one period from 0 to \u03c0, defined as f(t) = t for 0 < t < \u03c0, and then extended periodically with period \u03c0.\n\nIn this case, the function is already periodic with period \u03c0, so L = \u03c0 / 2, \u03c9 = 2.\n\nBut earlier calculations didn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the function over -\u03c0 to \u03c0.\n\nWait, the original description says:\n\n\"the waveform starts at -\u03c0 at t=0 and increases linearly to \u03c0 at t=\u03c0. At t=\u03c0, it drops instantaneously back to -\u03c0. This pattern repeats every \u03c0 units of time.\"\n\nThis seems like a sawtooth wave with period \u03c0, ranging from -\u03c0 to \u03c0.\n\nSo, over one period from 0 to \u03c0, f(t) = t, and then repeats.\n\nIn this case, the Fourier series with period \u03c0 would have \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 / \u03c0 = 2.\n\nSo, f(t) = \u03a3 [(-1 / n) sin(2nt)], as calculated earlier.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Fourier series is being represented in terms of the fundamental frequency with period 2\u03c0.\n\nIn that case, we can consider the function over 0 to \u03c0 and define it over -\u03c0 to \u03c0 as an odd function.\n\nThen, the Fourier series would have only sine terms with period 2\u03c0.\n\nSo, L = \u03c0, \u03c9 = 1.\n\nThen, bn = (1 / \u03c0) \u222b[f(t) sin(nt) dt] from 0 to \u03c0\n\nSince f(t) = t for 0 < t < \u03c0.\n\nSo, bn = (1 / \u03c0) \u222b[t sin(nt) dt] from 0 to \u03c0\n\nUsing integration by parts as before:\n\nu = t, dv = sin(nt) dt\n\ndu = dt, v = (-1 / n) cos(nt)\n\nSo,\n\n\u222b t sin(nt) dt = (-t / n) cos(nt) - \u222b (-1 / n) cos(nt) dt\n\n= (-t / n) cos(nt) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(nt)\n\nEvaluate from 0 to \u03c0:\n\n[(-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(n\u03c0)] - [(-0 / n) cos(0) + (1 / n\u00b2) sin(0)]\n\n= (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0) + 0 - 0 - 0\n\n= (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0)\n\nTherefore, bn = (1 / \u03c0) * (-\u03c0 / n) cos(n\u03c0) = - (1 / n) cos(n\u03c0) = - (1 / n) (-1)^n = ( -1)^{n+1} / n\n\nThus, the Fourier series is:\n\nf(t) = \u03a3 [( -1)^{n+1} / n] sin(nt)\n\nWhich is:\n\nf(t) = sin t - (1/2) sin 2t + (1/3) sin 3t - (1/4) sin 4t + ...\n\nNow, comparing this with the options:\n\nA. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 4) sin 3t + ...]\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 30 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nC. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nD. -2[sin t + (1 / 3) sin 25 + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nAgain, assuming typos in the options, particularly \"sin 25\" and \"sin 30\" should be \"sin 2t\" and \"sin 3t\".\n\nThen, option B would be:\n\nB. -2[sin t + (1 / 2) sin 2t + (1 / 3) sin 3t + ...]\n\nWhich is -2 sin t - sin 2t - (2/3) sin 3t - ...\n\nBut our series is sin t - (1/2) sin 2t + (1/3) sin 3t - (1/4) sin 4t + ...\n\nSo still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scaling factor.\n\nWait, the original function f(t) = t for 0 < t < \u03c0, with period \u03c0.\n\nBut in Fourier series, the function is represented over its fundamental period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is defined differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sawtooth wave is defined from -\u03c0 to \u03c0.\n\nWait, the original description says:\n\n\"the waveform starts at -\u03c0 at t=0 and increases linearly to \u03c0 at t=\u03c0.
