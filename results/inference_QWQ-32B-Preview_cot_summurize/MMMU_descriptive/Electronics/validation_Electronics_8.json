                    "text": "I'm going to answer the question about the Fourier series for the voltage waveforms described in the image. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the image shows three voltage waveforms labeled (a), (b), and (c). From the description:\n\n- Waveforms (a) and (b) are square waves that alternate between +1 V and -1 V with a period of 2 seconds. They start at +1 V at t=0 and switch to -1 V at t=1 second, then back to +1 V at t=2 seconds, and so on.\n\n- Waveform (c) is a triangular wave that varies linearly between +1 V and -1 V with the same period of 2 seconds. It starts at -1 V at t=0, increases linearly to +1 V at t=1 second, and then decreases back to -1 V at t=2 seconds.\n\nThe question is asking for the Fourier series of the square waves in (a) and (b), and it seems there might be a misunderstanding because waveform (a) is a square wave, not a triangular wave. However, based on the description provided, waveforms (a) and (b) are identical square waves, and waveform (c) is a triangular wave.\n\nGiven that, I'll focus on the Fourier series for the square waves (a) and (b).\n\nThe general form of the Fourier series for a square wave that alternates between +A and -A with period T is:\n\nv(t) = (4A / \u03c0) \u2211 [ (1 / (2n - 1)) sin( (2n - 1) \u03c9 t ) ] for n = 1 to infinity\n\nwhere \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 / T\n\nIn this case, A = 1 V and T = 2 seconds, so \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 / 2 = \u03c0 rad/s\n\nTherefore, the Fourier series for the square wave is:\n\nv(t) = (4 / \u03c0) [ sin(\u03c0 t) + (1/3) sin(3\u03c0 t) + (1/5) sin(5\u03c0 t) + ... ]\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. (4 / \u03c0) (sin \u03c0t + (1 / 2) sin 3\u03c0t + (1 / 4) sin 5\u03c0t + ....).\n\nB. (4 / \u03c0) (sin \u03c0t + (1 / 3) sin 3\u03c0t + (1 / 5) sin 5\u03c0t + ....).\n\nC. (4 / \u03c0) (sin \u03c0t + (1 / 2) sin 2\u03c0t + (1 / 4) sin 4\u03c0t + ....).\n\nD. (4 / \u03c0) (sin \u03c0t + (1 / 3) sin 2\u03c0t + (1 / 5) sin 4\u03c0t + ....).\n\nThe correct series should have coefficients of 1/(2n - 1) for each sine term with odd harmonics (i.e., sin(\u03c0t), sin(3\u03c0t), sin(5\u03c0t), etc.).\n\nOption B matches this description:\n\nB. (4 / \u03c0) (sin \u03c0t + (1 / 3) sin 3\u03c0t + (1 / 5) sin 5\u03c0t + ....).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nIt's worth noting that the other options have different coefficients or include even harmonics, which are not present in the Fourier series of an ideal square wave.\n\n- Option A has coefficients of 1/2, 1/4, etc., for the higher sine terms, which is incorrect.\n\n- Option C includes sin(2\u03c0t), sin(4\u03c0t), etc., which are even harmonics not present in a square wave.\n\n- Option D also includes even harmonics and incorrect coefficients.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
