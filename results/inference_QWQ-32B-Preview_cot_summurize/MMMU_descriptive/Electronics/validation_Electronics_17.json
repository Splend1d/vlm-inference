                    "text": "To solve for the voltage \\( v \\) in Fig. 1(b) for \\( t > 0 \\) after the circuit becomes source-free, we need to analyze the behavior of the circuit once the switch is closed and the voltage source is removed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Circuit Components:**\n   - Voltage source: 100V\n   - Resistors: 30\u03a9, 20\u03a9, and 4\u03a9\n   - Inductor: 5H\n\n2. **Circuit Configuration:**\n   - Assume the switch is closed at \\( t = 0 \\), and the circuit becomes source-free\u4e4b\u540e, meaning the voltage source is removed or shorted.\n\n3. **Determine the Initial Conditions:**\n   - At \\( t = 0^- \\), the inductor current is zero because the switch is open.\n   - At \\( t = 0^+ \\), the inductor current remains zero due to the sudden closure of the switch.\n\n4. **Find the Time Constant:**\n   - For an RL circuit, the time constant \\( \\tau \\) is given by \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{\\text{eq}}} \\), where \\( R_{\\text{eq}} \\) is the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor.\n\n5. **Calculate Equivalent Resistance:**\n   - Assuming the resistors are connected in series with the inductor, the equivalent resistance \\( R_{\\text{eq}} \\) is the sum of the resistors.\n   - \\( R_{\\text{eq}} = 30\\Omega + 20\\Omega + 4\\Omega = 54\\Omega \\)\n\n6. **Time Constant Calculation:**\n   - \\( \\tau = \\frac{5H}{54\\Omega} \\approx 0.0926 \\) seconds\n\n7. **Differential Equation for the Circuit:**\n   - For a source-free RL circuit, the differential equation is \\( L \\frac{di}{dt} + R_{\\text{eq}} i = 0 \\)\n   - Substituting values: \\( 5 \\frac{di}{dt} + 54 i = 0 \\)\n\n8. **Solve the Differential Equation:**\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n   - The solution is \\( i(t) = i(0) e^{-\\frac{R_{\\text{eq}}}{L} t} \\)\n   - Given \\( i(0) = 0 \\), the current \\( i(t) = 0 \\) for all \\( t > 0 \\)\n\n9. **Re-evaluate the Circuit:**\n   - If the initial current is zero and there is no external source, the current remains zero.\n   - However, this seems contradictory to the presence of a voltage source initially. Let's consider the circuit more carefully.\n\n10. **Correct Approach:**\n    - At \\( t = 0 \\), the switch is closed, and the voltage source is present.\n    - The inductor initially resists changes in current, so the initial current is determined by the voltage source and the resistances.\n\n11. **Initial Current Calculation:**\n    - Before the switch is closed, the inductor acts as an open circuit.\n    - At \\( t = 0 \\), the switch is closed, and the current starts to build up.\n    - The initial current through the inductor is zero.\n\n12. **Source-Free Condition:**\n    - After some time, the voltage source is removed, making the circuit source-free.\n    - The energy stored in the inductor will discharge through the resistors.\n\n13. **Revised Time Constant:**\n    - With the voltage source removed, the circuit is purely RL.\n    - The time constant is \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{\\text{eq}}} \\)\n\n14. **Voltage Expression:**\n    - The voltage across the inductor is \\( v(t) = L \\frac{di}{dt} \\)\n    - From the differential equation, \\( \\frac{di}{dt} = -\\frac{R_{\\text{eq}}}{L} i(t) \\)\n    - Therefore, \\( v(t) = -R_{\\text{eq}} i(t) \\)\n\n15. **Current Expression:**\n    - \\( i(t) = i(0) e^{-\\frac{R_{\\text{eq}}}{L} t} \\)\n    - Assuming initial current \\( i(0) \\) is known.\n\n16. **Determine Initial Current:**\n    - Just before the voltage source is removed, the current through the inductor can be found using the voltage source and the total resistance.\n    - \\( i(0) = \\frac{V}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{100V}{54\\Omega} \\approx 1.852 \\) A\n\n17. **Voltage Expression:**\n    - \\( v(t) = -R_{\\text{eq}} i(t) = -54 \\times 1.852 e^{-\\frac{54}{5} t} \\)\n    - Simplifying, \\( v(t) = -100 e^{-10.8 t} \\) V\n\n18. **Compare with Options:**\n    - None of the options match this expression. There must be a mistake in the approach.\n\n19. **Alternative Approach:**\n    - Consider that after the switch is closed and the source is removed, the circuit is source-free, and the energy dissipates through the resistors.\n\n20. **Correct Time Constant:**\n    - Recalculate the equivalent resistance.\n    - If resistors are in parallel or different configurations, the equivalent resistance changes.\n\n21. **Assume Series Configuration:**\n    - If all components are in series, the equivalent resistance is indeed 54\u03a9.\n    - But the time constant should be \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{5}{54} \\approx 0.0926 \\) seconds.\n\n22. **Re-examine the Options:**\n    - Option B: \\( -5e^{-0.8t} \\) V\n    - The exponent suggests a time constant of \\( \\tau = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\) seconds.\n\n23. **Possible Misinterpretation:**\n    - Maybe the equivalent resistance is different.\n    - Suppose the resistors are not all in series with the inductor.\n\n24. **Alternative Configuration:**\n    - If the 4\u03a9 resistor is parallel with the inductor, the equivalent resistance seen by the inductor is different.\n\n25. **Calculate Equivalent Resistance Correctly:**\n    - Suppose the 30\u03a9 and 20\u03a9 resistors are in series, and this combination is in parallel with the 4\u03a9 resistor.\n    - Equivalent resistance: \\( R_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{(30 + 20) \\times 4}{30 + 20 + 4} = \\frac{50 \\times 4}{54} \\approx 3.704 \\) \u03a9\n\n26. **Time Constant Recalculated:**\n    - \\( \\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{5}{3.704} \\approx 1.35 \\) seconds\n\n27. **Compare with Option Exponent:**\n    - Option B has \\( e^{-0.8t} \\), which suggests \\( \\tau = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\) seconds.\n    - Close but not exact. There might be a different configuration.\n\n28. **Consider Initial Energy in Inductor:**\n    - The initial energy is stored in the inductor when the switch is closed with the voltage source.\n    - After removing the source, the energy dissipates through the resistors.\n\n29. **General Solution:**\n    - The general solution for voltage in an RL circuit is \\( v(t) = V_0 e^{-\\frac{R}{L} t} \\), where \\( V_0 \\) is the initial voltage.\n\n30. **Determine Initial Voltage:**\n    - Initially, the voltage across the inductor is equal to the source voltage, 100V.\n\n31. **Express Voltage:**\n    - \\( v(t) = 100 e^{-\\frac{R}{L} t} \\)\n\n32. **Match with Options:**\n    - None directly match, but considering polarity and possible sign conventions, option B is \\( -5e^{-0.8t} \\) V.\n\n33. **Possible Scaling Factor:**\n    - Maybe the voltage is across a different component, scaled by the resistances.\n\n34. **Consider Voltage Division:**\n    - If the voltage is across the 4\u03a9 resistor, then \\( v(t) = i(t) \\times 4 \\)\n    - \\( i(t) = i(0) e^{-\\frac{R}{L} t} \\)\n    - \\( i(0) = \\frac{100V}{54\\Omega} \\approx 1.852 \\) A\n    - \\( v(t) = 1.852 \\times 4 e^{-\\frac{54}{5} t} \\approx 7.407 e^{-10.8 t} \\) V\n\n35. **Still Not Matching Options:**\n    - The options suggest a much slower decay and different voltage magnitudes.\n\n36. **Reconsider the Circuit Configuration:**\n    - Perhaps the inductor is in parallel with the resistors.\n\n37. **Assume Inductor in Parallel:**\n    - If the inductor is in parallel with the resistors, the voltage across the inductor is the same as across the resistors.\n\n38. **Differential Equation:**\n    - The current through the inductor is equal to the sum of currents through the resistors.\n    - This complicates the analysis.\n\n39. **Simplify Assumptions:**\n    - Given the options, it seems the time constant is \\( \\tau = 1.25 \\) seconds, corresponding to a resistance of \\( R = \\frac{L}{\\tau} = \\frac{5}{1.25} = 4 \\) \u03a9.\n\n40. **Equivalent Resistance:**\n    - If the equivalent resistance is 4\u03a9, then the voltage decay is \\( v(t) = V_0 e^{-\\frac{4}{5} t} = V_0 e^{-0.8t} \\)\n\n41. **Determine \\( V_0 \\):**\n    - Initially, the voltage across the inductor is 100V.\n    - However, option B has \\( -5e^{-0.8t} \\) V, which suggests a different initial voltage or scaling.\n\n42. **Possible Mistake in Options:**\n    - The options might be for a different component or with different initial conditions.\n\n43. **Consider the Correct Option:**\n    - Given the analysis, option B seems closest, but the magnitude and sign do not match the initial assumptions.\n\n44. **Final Decision:**\n    - Based on the time constant matching option B, and considering possible sign conventions, option B is likely the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{b} \\]"
