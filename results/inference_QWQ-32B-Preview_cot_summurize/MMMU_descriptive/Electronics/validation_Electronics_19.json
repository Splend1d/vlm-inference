The inductors are labeled \\( L_1 \\) and \\( L_2 \\), with values of 10 henries (H) each. There is a mutual inductance \\( M \\) between them, which is given as 9 henries (H). The currents flowing through the inductors are denoted as \\( i_1 \\) and \\( i_2 \\), with \\( i_1 = 10 \\sin t \\) and \\( i_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThe voltage across \\( L_1 \\) is labeled \\( v_1 \\), and the voltage across \\( L_2 \\) is labeled \\( v_2 \\). The circuit diagram shows the direction of the currents and the polarity of the voltages.\n\nTo calculate the voltage \\( v_2 \\), we need to use the concept of mutual inductance.

Therefore, the equation for \\( v_2 \\) simplifies to:\n\n\\[ v_2 = M \\frac{di_1}{dt} + L_2 \\times 0 = M \\frac{di_1}{dt} \\]\n\nNow, plug in the given values:\n\n- \\( M = 9 \\) H\n\n- \\( i_1 = 10 \\sin t \\)\n\nFirst, compute the derivative of \\( i_1 \\) with respect to time \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{di_1}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(10 \\sin t) = 10 \\cos t \\]\n\nThen, substitute this into the equation for \\( v_2 \\):\n\n\\[ v_2 = 9 \\times 10 \\cos t = 90 \\cos t \\]\n\nHowever, in the description, there is a negative sign in the formula:\n\n\\[ v_2 = -M \\frac{di_1}{dt} \\]\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the polarity of the voltage or the direction of the current might have been considered differently in the description.\n\nTo resolve this, we need to consider the dot convention for the coupled inductors, which defines the polarity of the mutual inductance voltage.\n\nAssuming the dots on the inductors are aligned such that an increase in current in one inductor causes a voltage in the other that opposes the change (Lenz's law), the mutual inductance voltage would indeed have a negative sign.\n\nTherefore, the correct formula should be:\n\n\\[ v_2 = -M \\frac{di_1}{dt} \\]\n\nUsing this, we get:\n\n\\[ v_2 = -9 \\times 10 \\cos t = -90 \\cos t \\]\n\nThus, the voltage \\( v_2 \\) is:\n\n\\[ v_2 = -90 \\cos t \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. -90 cos(t) V\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
