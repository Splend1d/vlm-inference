These sources are connected in parallel to a network of resistors. The resistors have values of 4 ohms, 3 ohms, 2 ohms, and 1 ohm. There is also a variable element labeled \"X\" which is specified to be a 2-ohm resistance in the question.

                    "text": "To find the power supplied by the 6-V source in the given circuit, we need to determine the current passing through that source and then use the formula for power, which is P = V * I, where P is power, V is voltage, and I is current.\n\nFirst, let's understand the circuit configuration based on the description:\n\n- There are two voltage sources: 6 V and 12 V, connected in parallel.\n\n- Resistors are arranged in series-parallel:\n\n  - One branch has a 4-ohm resistor in series with a 3-ohm resistor.\n\n  - Another branch has a 2-ohm resistor in series with a 1-ohm resistor.\n\n- These two branches are connected in parallel to the voltage sources.\n\n- Element X is a 2-ohm resistance, but its placement isn't specified in the description. For the sake of this problem, I'll assume it's in parallel with the other branches.\n\nHowever, since the exact placement of X isn't clear, I'll proceed with the information given, considering X as part of the circuit but not specifying its location without additional details.\n\nGiven that, let's simplify the circuit step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the equivalent resistance of each series branch:\n\n1. For the branch with 4 ohms and 3 ohms in series:\n\n   R1 = 4 + 3 = 7 ohms\n\n2. For the branch with 2 ohms and 1 ohm in series:\n\n   R2 = 2 + 1 = 3 ohms\n\nNow, these two resistances (7 ohms and 3 ohms) are in parallel. The equivalent resistance (Req) of these two branches is:\n\n1/Req = 1/R1 + 1/R2 = 1/7 + 1/3 = (3 + 7)/21 = 10/21\n\nTherefore, Req = 21/10 = 2.1 ohms\n\nNow, considering the two voltage sources are connected in parallel, we need to find the current supplied by each source.\n\nTo find the current supplied by the 6-V source, we can use the concept of current division in parallel circuits.\n\nFirst, calculate the total current supplied by both sources combined.\n\nHowever, since the sources are in parallel, the voltage across each source is the same, but their currents add up.\n\nBut in reality, when two voltage sources are connected in parallel, it's problematic because they may try to impose different voltages across the same points, leading to high currents and potential damage. This is generally not recommended in circuit design.\n\nAssuming ideal voltage sources, the voltages would adjust to a common value, but in practice, this can lead to instability.\n\nGiven that, for the sake of this problem, let's assume that the sources are ideal and the circuit is stable.\n\nIn such a case, the voltage across the parallel combination is determined by the sources, but since they are different, we need to consider the circuit behavior.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circuit is intended to have only one voltage source, and the other is a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 12-V source is actually a dependent source or there's a mistake in the description.\n\nGiven the potential confusion, let's consider an alternative approach.\n\nPerhaps the 12-V source is in series with one branch, and the 6-V source is in series with another branch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sources are connected differently.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the description, it's challenging to provide an accurate solution.\n\nHowever, to proceed, I'll make an assumption that the 6-V source is connected in series with the 7-ohm branch, and the 12-V source is connected in series with the 3-ohm branch.\n\nUnder this assumption, we can analyze the circuit as two separate loops with their respective voltage sources and resistances.\n\nFirst, consider the loop with the 6-V source and 7-ohm resistance.\n\nThe current (I1) through this loop can be found using Ohm's Law:\n\nI1 = V / R = 6 V / 7 ohms \u2248 0.857 A\n\nSimilarly, for the loop with the 12-V source and 3-ohm resistance:\n\nI2 = 12 V / 3 ohms = 4 A\n\nNow, the power supplied by the 6-V source is:\n\nP = V * I1 = 6 V * 0.857 A \u2248 5.142 W\n\nHowever, this is a simplified assumption and may not reflect the actual circuit configuration.\n\nAlternatively, if the sources are indeed in parallel, we need to use superposition or other methods to find the currents.\n\nLet's try using superposition.\n\nFirst, turn off the 12-V source (replace with a short circuit) and find the current through the 6-V source.\n\nThen, turn off the 6-V source and find the current through it (which would be zero since it's turned off), and then add the contributions.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the power supplied by the 6-V source, we can consider its contribution alone.\n\nWait, superposition might complicate things further.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the circuit description, it's difficult to provide a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circuit is a combination of series and parallel elements in a different configuration.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the circuit as a whole and write Kirchhoff's laws equations.\n\nLet's attempt that.\n\nAssume the following:\n\n- Node A is connected to the positive terminal of both voltage sources.\n\n- Node B is connected to the negative terminal of both voltage sources.\n\n- The 7-ohm branch (4+3 series) is connected between node A and node B.\n\n- The 3-ohm branch (2+1 series) is connected between node A and node B.\n\n- Element X (2 ohms) is connected between node A and node B.\n\nIf that's the case, then all elements are in parallel across the two voltage sources, which is still problematic due to the different voltage sources.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sources are connected differently.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll suggest an alternative approach.\n\nLet's consider that there is only one voltage source, say the 6-V source, and the 12-V is actually a misinterpretation.\n\nIn that case, with the 6-V source connected across the parallel combination of the two branches and element X.\n\nGiven that, the equivalent resistance would be:\n\nReq = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/Rx) = 1 / (1/7 + 1/3 + 1/2)\n\nCalculate the denominators:\n\n1/7 \u2248 0.1429\n\n1/3 \u2248 0.3333\n\n1/2 = 0.5\n\nSum = 0.1429 + 0.3333 + 0.5 = 0.9762\n\nTherefore, Req \u2248 1 / 0.9762 \u2248 1.024 ohms\n\nThen, the total current from the 6-V source is:\n\nI_total = V / Req = 6 V / 1.024 ohms \u2248 5.86 A\n\nNow, to find the power supplied by the 6-V source:\n\nP = V * I_total = 6 V * 5.86 A \u2248 35.16 W\n\nHowever, this is the total power supplied by the 6-V source to the entire circuit.\n\nIf the question is to find the power supplied by the 6-V source specifically, this would be the answer.\n\nBut considering that there are two voltage sources, the initial assumption might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 12-V source is a misinterpretation, and there's only one source.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll provide another perspective.\n\nLet's consider the circuit has only one voltage source of 6 V, and the resistors are connected in the described configuration.\n\nIn that case, proceed as above.\n\nAlternatively, if both sources are present and considered, the circuit analysis becomes more complex due to the parallel voltage sources.\n\nGiven that, and without a clear circuit diagram, it's challenging to provide an accurate solution.\n\nTherefore, based on the assumption of a single 6-V source and the given resistors in parallel with element X, the power supplied by the 6-V source is approximately 35.16 watts.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{35.16\\ \\text{W}} \\]"
