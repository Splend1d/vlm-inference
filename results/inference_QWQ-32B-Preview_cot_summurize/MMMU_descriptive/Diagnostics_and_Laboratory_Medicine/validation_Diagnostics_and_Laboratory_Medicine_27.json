The use of both H&E and reticulin stains indicates a thorough examination to understand the cellular and architectural features of the lesion.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThis lesion: <image 1>\n\nA. can be seen in a patient with acromegaly\nB. can be found incidentally\nC. may require the use of a reticulin stain to differentiate from normal gland\nD. can present as a non-functioning tumor with mass effect\nE. all are correct\n"

Here's why:\n\nA. can be seen in a patient with acromegaly: Acromegaly is a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone production, often due to a pituitary adenoma. The histological appearance described, with densely packed cells and possible fibrosis, is consistent with a pituitary adenoma, which can cause acromegaly.\n\nB. can be found incidentally: Pituitary adenomas, including those that are non-functioning, can be found incidentally during imaging studies for other purposes. The histological features described could represent such a tumor.\n\nC. may require the use of a reticulin stain to differentiate from normal gland: In pituitary pathology, reticulin stains are often used to highlight the reticulin fibers that can help distinguish between different types of pituitary cells and identify structural abnormalities. This is particularly useful in differentiating adenomas from normal pituitary tissue.\n\nD. can present as a non-functioning tumor with mass effect: Not all pituitary adenomas secrete hormones; some are non-functioning and can cause symptoms due to their mass effect on surrounding structures. The histological appearance of a densely cellular lesion with possible fibrosis is consistent with such a tumor.\n\nTherefore, all the options A through D are correct in this context, making E. all are correct the appropriate choice."
