The surrounding tissue is less densely stained and more translucent. The mass has a uniform staining pattern, indicating a dense cellular structure.\n\nGiven these observations, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. This tumor is a variant of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)\n\nGlioblastoma multiforme is a type of brain tumor characterized by its aggressive nature and the presence of densely cellular areas, often with areas of necrosis and abnormal blood vessels. The description mentions a dense, pink-stained area with no visible blood vessels, which could be consistent with a glioblastoma, especially if it's a necrotic area. However, glioblastomas typically show vascular proliferation and necrosis, which aren't explicitly mentioned here.\n\nB. This tumor is metastatic from a soft tissue sarcoma\n\nSoft tissue sarcomas can metastasize to various sites, including the brain. Metastatic tumors often appear as dense, cellular masses. The lack of visible blood vessels could be a feature, but it's not specific enough to confirm this diagnosis over others.\n\nC. This patient had a pigmented lesion removed 10 years before\n\nThe description doesn't mention any pigmentation in the tissue sample. The stain used is H&E, which can reveal pigments, but the description doesn't note any. Therefore, this option seems less likely.\n\nD. This represents a gliotic scar in an infarct\n\nGliotic scars can form after brain infarcts and appear as dense, glial cell-rich areas. These scars can be densely cellular and may not show typical blood vessels within them, which aligns with the description. However, gliotic scars are usually associated with previous ischemic events, which aren't mentioned in the description.\n\nE. This is a classic example of meningoangiomatosis\n\nMeningoangiomatosis is a rare, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by the presence of meningeal tissue with vascular anomalies, often leading to benign lesions in the brain. It's not typically described as a dense, cellular mass without vessels.\n\nConsidering the options, option A (glioblastoma multiforme) seems the most plausible, given the dense, cellular nature of the mass and its location, presumably in the brain, given the context of neurological pathology. However, the absence of mention of vascular proliferation or necrosis makes this conclusion less certain.\n\nAlternatively, option D (gliotic scar in an infarct) could also be a possibility, given the dense, cellular nature of the scar tissue. But again, there's no explicit mention of a previous infarct.\n\nGiven that the question is to choose the correct statement about the figure, and option A is provided as \"This tumor is a variant of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),\" it might be the intended answer, especially if the image is from a neurological pathology context where GBM is a common and important diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
