The tissue appears to have large, irregularly shaped fibers with a blue background. Within these fibers, there are numerous small, rod-like structures that are stained pink or red. These structures are characteristic of nemaline rods, which are abnormal protein aggregates found in certain muscle disorders. The presence of these rods suggests a specific type of myopathy.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe abnormal fiber that is seen with Gomori trichrome staining is typical of: <image 1>\n\nA.

These rod-like structures are identified as nemaline rods, which are abnormal protein aggregates characteristic of certain muscle disorders, specifically nemaline myopathy.\n\nNemaline myopathy is a type of congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of nemaline bodies or rods within muscle fibers. These inclusions are composed of abnormal aggregations of skeletal muscle proteins, particularly actin and nebulin. Gomori trichrome staining is a standard histological technique used to visualize muscle fibers and their components, and in nemaline myopathy, it highlights these characteristic rod-like structures.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\nA. Hypoxia: Hypoxia refers to a deficiency in the amount of oxygen reaching the body's tissues. While hypoxia can affect muscle tissue and lead to various pathological changes, it is not typically associated with the presence of nemaline rods.\n\nB. A mitochondrial disorder: Mitochondrial disorders affect the energy-producing structures within cells and can lead to a variety of muscle pathologies, including ragged-red fibers on muscle biopsy. However, nemaline rods are not a typical feature of mitochondrial disorders.\n\nC. Polymyositis: Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle inflammation and degeneration. Histologically, it is characterized by endomysial inflammation, fiber necrosis, and regeneration. Nemaline rods are not a feature of polymyositis.\n\nD. Nemaline myopathy: As described earlier, nemaline myopathy is characterized by the presence of nemaline rods within muscle fibers, which are clearly visible with Gomori trichrome staining.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is D. Nemaline myopathy.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
