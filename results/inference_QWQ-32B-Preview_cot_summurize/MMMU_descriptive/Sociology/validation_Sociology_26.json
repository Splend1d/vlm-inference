Some phones have physical keyboards, while others have touchscreens. The phones appear to be from different eras, with some looking more modern and others appearing quite dated. The phones are piled together, indicating they are no longer in use. The variety of designs and the apparent age of the phones suggest that they have been replaced by newer models over time.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nAs shown in <image 1>, the fact that your cell phone is using outdated technology within a year or two of purchase is an example of ____________.\n\nA.

                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the image depicts a collection of old mobile phones with varying designs and conditions, suggesting that they have been replaced by newer models over time. The question refers to the phenomenon where a cell phone becomes outdated within a year or two of purchase, and asks which concept this exemplifies.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The conflict perspective: This is a sociological approach that views society as being characterized by inequality and conflict between different groups. While it could be argued that planned obsolescence leads to conflict between consumers and manufacturers, the term \"conflict perspective\" is too broad and not specifically related to the rapid obsolescence of products.\n\nB. Conspicuous consumption: This term, coined by Thorstein Veblen, refers to the spending of money on and the acquisition of luxury goods and services to display wealth and income. While some people may engage in conspicuous consumption by frequently upgrading their phones, the description doesn't specifically indicate that these phones were purchased for status display.\n\nC. Media: This option seems unrelated to the concept of products becoming quickly outdated. Media refers to the channels through which information is disseminated, such as television, newspapers, and the internet.\n\nD. Planned obsolescence: This is a strategy where a product is designed to have a limited useful life, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain period, typically because it is no longer fashionable or because it can no longer perform the desired functions. This encourages consumers to purchase new products, driving continued sales and revenue for manufacturers.\n\nGiven the context of the image and the question, the most appropriate answer is D. Planned obsolescence. The fact that cell phones become outdated quickly suggests that they are designed to have a short useful life, encouraging consumers to buy new models, which aligns with the concept of planned obsolescence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
