The sections from bottom to top are:\n\n1. **Green Section**: This section includes various symbols and images related to basic human needs and survival, such as food, shelter, and tools.\n2. **Orange Section**: This section contains images and symbols related to social structures and institutions, such as family, community, and governance.\n3. **Blue Section**: This section includes images and symbols related to communication and media, such as books, newspapers, and electronic devices.\n4. **Purple Section**: This section contains images and symbols related to art and creativity, such as paintings, sculptures, and musical instruments.\n5. **Red Section**: This section includes images and symbols related to religion and spirituality, such as religious icons, temples, and sacred texts.\n\nBased on this description, the image represents various cultural universals, which are elements found in all human cultures. The options provided in the question are:\n\nA. Religion\nB. Prohibition against incest\nC. Family\nD. Media\n\nGiven the description of the image, it is clear that the pyramid includes symbols and images related to religion (red section), family (orange section), and media (blue section).

The sections include basic human needs, social structures, communication and media, art and creativity, and religion and spirituality. The options given are Religion, Prohibition against incest, Family, and Media.\n\nFrom the description, the pyramid includes sections for Religion (red section), Family (orange section), and Media (blue section). However, there is no mention of \"Prohibition against incest\" in the described sections. Therefore, the correct answer should be:\n\n**B. Prohibition against incest**\n\nBut wait, the question is \"Which is not a <image 1>?\" and according to the description, the image includes Religion, Family, and Media, but not Prohibition against incest. So, according to that, the answer should be B.\n\nHowever, looking back at the end of the description, it says: \"Therefore, the option that is not represented in the image is: **D. Media**\"\n\nThis seems contradictory because the description clearly mentions a blue section for communication and media, including books, newspapers, and electronic devices, which should correspond to option D. Media.\n\nPerhaps there is a misunderstanding here. Let's re-examine the description:\n\nThe pyramid sections are:\n\n1. Green: basic human needs (food, shelter, tools)\n\n2. Orange: social structures (family, community, governance)\n\n3. Blue: communication and media (books, newspapers, electronic devices)\n\n4. Purple: art and creativity (paintings, sculptures, musical instruments)\n\n5. Red: religion and spirituality (religious icons, temples, sacred texts)\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Religion\n\nB. Prohibition against incest\n\nC. Family\n\nD. Media\n\nAccording to the sections described:\n\n- Religion is in the red section.\n\n- Family is in the orange section.\n\n- Media is in the blue section.\n\nThere is no mention of \"Prohibition against incest\" in any of the sections.\n\nTherefore, the option that is not represented in the image is B. Prohibition against incest.\n\nBut the conclusion at the end of the description says that the option not represented is D. Media, which contradicts the earlier description.\n\nPerhaps there is a typo or error in the conclusion. Based on the description provided, media is included in the blue section, so it is represented in the image.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Prohibition against incest\" is considered a cultural universal that is not explicitly depicted in the pyramid, whereas media is depicted in the blue section.\n\nHowever, the question is ambiguous because it doesn't specify what \"<image 1>\" represents. If \"<image 1>\" refers to the cultural universal pyramid, and the pyramid includes media, then media is represented, and prohibition against incest is not.\n\nBut according to the final statement in the description, it concludes that media is not represented, which doesn't align with the earlier description.\n\nGiven this confusion, I would need clarification on what exactly \"<image 1>\" is supposed to represent. If it's the cultural universal pyramid as described, then prohibition against incest is not represented, making option B the correct answer.\n\nBut since the description ends by saying media is not represented, perhaps there's more to the image that isn't captured in the text description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"prohibition against incest\" is implicitly included in one of the sections, such as family or social structures, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the description.\n\nGiven the information provided, I would choose B. Prohibition against incest as the option not represented in the image.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
