This is an example of a conflict crime.\n\nSo, let's break this down. The scenario described involves a person being arrested for not complying with segregation laws, specifically for sitting in a section of a cinema that was reserved for white people, while being expected to sit in the blacks-only section. This type of arrest is rooted in the enforcement of racial segregation, which was a systemic form of discrimination.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. A consensus crime - This typically refers to crimes that are universally condemned and there's a general agreement that they are wrong, like murder or theft.\n\nB. A conflict crime - These are crimes that are defined by and reflect the interests and biases of the powerful. They often involve behaviors that are criminalized based on social, political, or economic conflicts.\n\nC. A social deviation - This is behavior that deviates from social norms but isn't necessarily illegal. It could include things like eccentric dress or unusual habits.\n\nD. A social diversion - I'm not familiar with this term in criminology. It might be a typo or less commonly used term.\n\nGiven the context, the arrest was for refusing to comply with segregation laws, which were designed to maintain racial hierarchy and were enforced by the authorities. This kind of law enforcement action is more aligned with conflict crimes because it enforces the interests of the dominant group (in this case, white supremacists) and criminalizes actions that challenge that dominance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. A conflict crime.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
