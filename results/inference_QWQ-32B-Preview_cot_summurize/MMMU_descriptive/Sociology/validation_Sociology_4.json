                    "text": "Based on the description provided, the image titled \"organic solidarity (modern)\" depicts a grid of nine circles, each containing a stick figure with various symbols or objects associated with them. These figures represent different groups or individuals, each with their own distinct characteristics, such as an anarchy symbol with a spoon, a dollar sign with a comb, an Om symbol with a rifle, and so on. The diversity of symbols and tools suggests a high degree of specialization and interdependence among these groups or individuals.\n\nThe caption at the bottom of the image reads \"solidarity from inter-dependence,\" which directly points towards the concept of organic solidarity as proposed by \u00c9mile Durkheim. Durkheim argued that in modern societies, organic solidarity arises from the interdependence that results from the division of labor. Each individual performs a specialized task, and this specialization leads to a reliance on others who perform different tasks. This interdependence fosters solidarity.\n\nGiven this context, the shift from mechanical to organic solidarity is primarily due to the division of labor. Mechanical solidarity, according to Durkheim, characterizes societies where there is little division of labor, and social cohesion comes from the similarity of individuals and their shared beliefs and values. In contrast, organic solidarity characterizes societies with a high degree of division of labor, where social cohesion comes from interdependence rather than similarity.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"What caused the shift from mechanical to [image 1]?\" is:\n\nC. Division of labor\n\nThis answer aligns with Durkheim's sociological theory and the depiction in the image, which shows diverse individuals with specialized roles and symbols, indicating a society held together by interdependence rather than similarity."
