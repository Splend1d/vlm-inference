The text \"CLASS STRUGGLE\" and \"GAME of life in Capitalist America!\" further reinforces this interpretation, as Marx's theory of history centers around the idea that societal development is driven by conflicts between different social classes, particularly in capitalist societies.\n\nEmile Durkheim, on the other hand, focused more on the division of labor and the role of social facts in shaping individual behavior. Erving Goffmann is known for his work on dramaturgy and the presentation of self in everyday life, while George Herbert Mead is associated with symbolic interactionism and the development of self through social interactions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Who believed that the history of society was one of [image 1]?\" would most likely be B. Karl Marx, as his theory of historical materialism posits that history is a series of class struggles between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in capitalist societies.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
