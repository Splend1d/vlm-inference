The central figure is holding a guitar and wearing a red cap. The crowd includes individuals with cameras and recording devices, suggesting that this is a public event or protest. There are several flags visible, including one with the text \"OCCUPY\" and another with a red background. The setting appears to be an urban area with tall buildings and traffic lights in the background. The overall atmosphere suggests a protest or demonstration related to social or economic issues.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nAs shown in <image 1>, the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011 grew to be an international movement.

The central figure is holding a guitar and wearing a red cap, suggesting a performer or speaker at the event. The crowd includes people with cameras and recording devices, indicating that this is a public event attracting attention and possibly media coverage. There are flags with texts like \"OCCUPY\" and another with a red background, which could represent various causes or affiliations within the movement.\n\nGiven this context, the question asks about the theoretical approach a sociologist would use to study the interactions between members at Occupy camps. The options provided are:\n\nA. Symbolic interactionism\n\nB. Functionalism\n\nC. Conflict theory\n\nD. Ethnocentrism\n\nTo answer this question, it's important to understand each of these sociological theories and how they might apply to the study of the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\n1. **Symbolic interactionism** focuses on the day-to-day interactions between individuals and how they create and modify the social world around them. This approach examines how people assign meaning to symbols, words, gestures, and actions in their interactions. In the context of the Occupy movement, a symbolic interactionist might look at how participants communicate and interpret symbols, such as the flags and signs at the protest, or how they interact with each other and with authorities.\n\n2. **Functionalism** views society as a complex system with interrelated parts designed to maintain stability and solidarity. Each part of society performs a function that contributes to the overall stability of the social system. Applying this to the Occupy movement, a functionalist might examine how the movement affects the larger social structure, perhaps considering it as a response to perceived dysfunctions in the economic system, or how the movement itself is organized to fulfill certain functions within society.\n\n3. **Conflict theory** is based on the idea that society is characterized by inequality and conflict, often due to competition over scarce resources. This theory is closely associated with the work of Karl Marx and is particularly relevant to studies of class struggle and social inequality. In the context of the Occupy movement, which specifically addresses economic disparity between the wealthy elite (the 1%) and the rest of the population, conflict theory seems highly applicable. A conflict theorist would likely analyze the movement as a manifestation of class conflict and an attempt to redress inequalities in wealth and power.\n\n4. **Ethnocentrism** is the tendency to view one's own culture as superior to that of other cultures. While ethnocentrism is an important concept in sociology, particularly in the study of cultural interactions and social stratification, it is not a theoretical approach for studying social phenomena in the same way that symbolic interactionism, functionalism, and conflict theory are.\n\nGiven that the Occupy Wall Street movement is explicitly about addressing economic inequality and challenging the concentration of wealth and power, conflict theory appears to be the most appropriate theoretical approach for studying the interactions within Occupy camps. Conflict theory aligns well with the movement's focus on social and economic disparities and the struggle for change.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is:\n\nC. conflict theory\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
