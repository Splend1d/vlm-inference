The top scene shows a person sitting at a desk, using a computer and interacting with a large screen displaying various digital interfaces. This person appears to be engaged in modern technology, symbolizing access to information and communication tools. The bottom scene depicts another person standing outdoors, holding a device that resembles a traditional radio or a simple communication tool. This person is surrounded by nature, indicating a lack of access to modern digital technology. \n\nTo the right of these illustrations, there is text that reads \"Digital Divide\" along with its phonetic pronunciation ['di-\u02a4\u0259-t\u0259l d\u0259-\u02c8v\u012bd]. Below this, there is a definition: \"The gap between people who have access to modern information and communications technology and those who don't.\"\n\nBased on this description, the image illustrates the concept of the digital divide, which refers to the disparity between individuals who have access to modern digital technologies and those who do not.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nThe ________ can be directly attributed to the <image 1>, because differential ability to access the internet leads directly to a differential ability to use the knowledge found on the internet.\n\nA. Digital divide\nB. Knowledge gap\nC. Feminist perspective\nD. E-gap\n"

The question states that the \"differential ability to access the internet leads directly to a differential ability to use the knowledge found on the internet.\" This directly relates to the concept of the digital divide.\n\nOption A, \"Digital divide,\" is the most appropriate answer because it specifically refers to the disparity in access to technology and, consequently, to the information and knowledge available online.\n\nOption B, \"Knowledge gap,\" could be related but is more broadly about differences in the amount of knowledge people have, not specifically tied to technology access.\n\nOption C, \"Feminist perspective,\" does not directly relate to the digital divide or the access to technology as described in the image and question.\n\nOption D, \"E-gap,\" might be a less common term and could be interpreted in various ways, but it's not as precise or widely recognized as \"digital divide\" in this context.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A. Digital divide."
