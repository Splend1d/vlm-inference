The stages are as follows:\n\n1. Leaving home\n2. Marriage\n3. Families with young children\n4. Families with adolescents\n5. Launching children\n6. Families in later life\n\nThe cycle begins with \"Leaving home\" and progresses through the other stages until it reaches \"Families in later life,\" completing the loop back to \"Leaving home.\" This suggests a continuous and cyclical nature of family life stages.\n\n***End of description***\nNow, answer the question:\n\nWhich of the following is a criticism of <image 1>?\n\nA. It is too broad and accounts for too many aspects of family.\nB. It is too narrowly focused on a sequence of stages.\nC. It does not serve a practical purpose for studying family behaviour.\nD. It is not based on comprehensive research.\n"
