                    "text": "I've got this image described here, and it's supposed to relate to value-neutrality. There are three cartoon characters: a journalist, a researcher, and a businessman, all standing together with a title saying \"value-neutrality.\" So, value-neutrality is about being impartial or unbiased in one's work or research. Got it.\n\nNow, I need to look at these statements and see which one illustrates that concept.\n\nOption A: \"Obesity in children is obviously a result of parental neglect and, therefore, schools should take a greater role to prevent it.\" This seems pretty opinionated. The word \"obviously\" suggests that it's taking a stance on what causes obesity and prescribing a solution. That doesn't sound neutral; it's making a clear judgment.\n\nOption B: \"In 2003, states like Arkansas adopted laws requiring elementary schools to remove soft drink vending machines from schools.\" This statement is factual. It's stating what happened in 2003 without expressing an opinion about whether it's good or bad, right or wrong. It's just presenting information. That sounds more neutral.\n\nOption C: \"Merely restricting children's access to junk food at school is not enough to prevent obesity.\" This seems like an opinion because it's saying that a particular approach isn't sufficient. It's making a judgment about the effectiveness of certain measures.\n\nOption D: \"Physical activity and healthy eating are a fundamental part of a child's education.\" Again, this sounds like a statement of opinion, asserting that these things are fundamental without providing evidence or remaining neutral.\n\nSo, between these options, B stands out as the most neutral because it's simply stating a fact without making any judgments or taking a particular stance.\n\nLet me think about this again. Value-neutrality is about being impartial. So, a neutral stance wouldn't advocate for any particular view or imply that one thing is better than another.\n\nOption A is clearly taking a side by blaming parental neglect and suggesting schools should intervene.\n\nOption B is just providing information about what was done in certain states.\n\nOption C is critiquing a specific approach, which isn't neutral.\n\nOption D is promoting the idea that physical activity and healthy eating are fundamental, which is an advocacy position.\n\nTherefore, the statement that best illustrates value-neutrality is B: \"In 2003, states like Arkansas adopted laws requiring elementary schools to remove soft drink vending machines from schools.\" It's presenting information without taking a stance on the issue.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
