                    "text": "So I'm trying to solve this problem about stars and exoplanets. Let's see what it's asking. We have a star that's similar to the Sun, so its radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere of this star is covered with dark spots, and these spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star has an effective temperature of 6000 Kelvin, and the spots are 1000 Kelvin cooler than that, so their temperature is 5000 Kelvin.\n\nNow, because only one hemisphere has these spots, and the star is rotating, we'll see changes in the star's brightness over time. This is called rotational modulation. The problem says that this variation in brightness can look similar to what happens when an exoplanet passes in front of the star, blocking some of its light.\n\nSo, the question is: if the star didn't have these spots, what size exoplanet would cause the same amount of dimming in the star's light as the spots do? We need to find the ratio of the exoplanet's radius to the star's radius.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how much light the spots are blocking compared to an unspotted star. The spots are cooler, so they emit less light than the rest of the star. To find out how much less, I can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says that the luminosity of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature.\n\nSo, the luminosity of the spotted area compared to the unspotted area is (5000/6000)^4. Let's calculate that:\n\n(5/6)^4 = (0.8333)^4 \u2248 0.4823\n\nSo, the spotted area emits about 48.23% of the light that the unspotted area does.\n\nNow, the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Since the star is a sphere, one hemisphere is half the surface area of the star. So, the spotted area is 20% of half the surface area, which is 10% of the total surface area.\n\nLet me confirm that:\n\nTotal surface area of the star: 4\u03c0R\u00b2\n\nOne hemisphere: 2\u03c0R\u00b2\n\nSpotted area: 0.20 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2\n\nSo, spotted area is 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 out of 4\u03c0R\u00b2, which is 0.4/4 = 0.1, or 10% of the total surface area.\n\nNow, the spotted area emits only 48.23% of the light of the unspotted area. So, the fraction of light blocked by the spots compared to an unspotted star is:\n\nFraction blocked = (1 - 0.4823) * fraction of surface area that's spotted\n\nFraction blocked = (1 - 0.4823) * 0.1 = 0.5177 * 0.1 = 0.05177, or about 5.177%\n\nSo, the spots cause the star to appear about 5.177% dimmer than it would be without spots.\n\nNow, we need to find the size of an exoplanet that would cause the same amount of dimming if it transited the star.\n\nWhen an exoplanet transits the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the ratio of the areas of the planet and the star.\n\nThe area ratio is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n\nSo, the fractional dimming is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n\nWe want this to be equal to the fractional dimming caused by the spots, which is 0.05177.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.05177\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 0.2275\n\nBut wait, this doesn't match any of the options provided:\n\nA. ~0.07\n\nB. ~0.32\n\nC. ~0.39\n\nD. ~0.11\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me double-check the fraction of the surface area that's spotted.\n\nThe spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is 20% of 50% of the total surface area.\n\nWait, 20% of one hemisphere is indeed 10% of the total surface area.\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider that only one hemisphere is spotted, so the spotted area is visible only when that hemisphere is facing the observer.\n\nBut the problem says that photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations due to rotational modulation, implying that as the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes in and out of view.\n\nSo, on average, only half of the spotted area is visible at any given time, because the star is spherical and rotates.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since it's one hemisphere, when that hemisphere is facing us, we see the entire spotted area, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, we see no spots.\n\nSo, the fractional dimming should vary between 0 and the full spotted dimming, depending on which hemisphere is facing us.\n\nBut the problem asks for the amplitude of the signal, which would be the difference between when the spotted hemisphere is facing us and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nSo, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star is dimmed by 5.177%, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, there is no dimming.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.177%.\n\nSo, to match this amplitude with an exoplanet transit, we need the exoplanet to block 5.177% of the star's light.\n\nTherefore, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.05177, and R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 0.2275.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spots are not uniformly distributed over the entire hemisphere, or maybe there's something about the temperature difference.\n\nWait, the spots are 1000K cooler, but I've assumed they emit 48.23% of the unspotted areas. Is that correct?\n\nLet me double-check the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nLuminosity is proportional to T^4.\n\nSo, L_spotted / L_unspotted = (T_spotted / T_unspotted)^4 = (5000 / 6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.\n\n(5/6)^4 = 625 / 1296 \u2248 0.4823, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the geometric albedo or other factors, but this seems like a straightforward problem.\n\nLet me try calculating the fractional dimming again.\n\nFractional dimming = (area_unspotted * L_unspotted + area_spotted * L_spotted) / (area_unspotted * L_unspotted + area_spotted * L_unspotted) - 1\n\nWait, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, the total luminosity when spots are present is:\n\nL_total = area_unspotted * L_unspotted + area_spotted * L_spotted\n\nCompared to the luminosity without spots:\n\nL_unspotted = (area_unspotted + area_spotted) * L_unspotted\n\nSo, the fractional dimming is:\n\nFractional dimming = (L_unspotted - L_total) / L_unspotted = 1 - L_total / L_unspotted\n\nL_total / L_unspotted = [area_unspotted * L_unspotted + area_spotted * L_spotted] / [(area_unspotted + area_spotted) * L_unspotted]\n\n= [area_unspotted + area_spotted * (L_spotted / L_unspotted)] / (area_unspotted + area_spotted)\n\n= [1 + (area_spotted / area_unspotted) * (L_spotted / L_unspotted - 1)] ^ -1\n\nWait, maybe I should simplify this.\n\nLet me define f = area_spotted / area_total = 0.10\n\nThen, area_unspotted = area_total - area_spotted = 1 - f = 0.90\n\nL_total = area_unspotted * L_unspotted + area_spotted * L_spotted\n\n= (1 - f) * L_unspotted + f * L_spotted\n\n= L_unspotted * [1 - f + f * (L_spotted / L_unspotted)]\n\nSo, fractional dimming = 1 - L_total / L_unspotted = 1 - [1 - f + f * (L_spotted / L_unspotted)]\n\n= f * [1 - (L_spotted / L_unspotted)]\n\n= f * [1 - (T_spotted / T_unspotted)^4]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nf = 0.10\n\nT_spotted = 5000K\n\nT_unspotted = 6000K\n\nSo,\n\nFractional dimming = 0.10 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4] = 0.10 * [1 - (5/6)^4] = 0.10 * [1 - 625/1296] = 0.10 * [1296 - 625]/1296 = 0.10 * 671/1296 \u2248 0.10 * 0.5177 \u2248 0.05177\n\nSo, 5.177%, which matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, for an exoplanet transit, the fractional dimming is (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n\nSo, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.05177\n\nTherefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 0.2275\n\nBut none of the options match this value. The closest is option B, ~0.32, but that's significantly higher than 0.2275.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the spots are only on one hemisphere, and the exoplanet would transit the entire star, so I need to account for the geometry differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the average brightness variation over a rotation period, rather than the peak amplitude.\n\nWait, the problem says \"photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet.\"\n\nSo, it's the amplitude of the brightness variation that resembles the presence of an exoplanet.\n\nIn the case of rotational modulation due to spots, the brightness varies between when the spotted hemisphere is facing us and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us.\n\nSo, the amplitude is the difference between these two states.\n\nWhen the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star is dimmer by 5.177%.\n\nWhen the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, there's no dimming.\n\nTherefore, the amplitude of the brightness variation is 5.177%.\n\nFor an exoplanet transit, the brightness decreases by (R_pl / R_star)^2 during transit and returns to normal otherwise.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the exoplanet transit is also (R_pl / R_star)^2.\n\nTherefore, setting them equal:\n\n(R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.05177\n\nR_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 0.2275\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm calculating the spotted area's effect.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose the star has a total surface area of 4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nOne hemisphere has 20% of its area covered in spots, so the spotted area is 0.20 * 2\u03c0R\u00b2 = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe unspotted area is the remaining 4\u03c0R\u00b2 - 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2.\n\nThe total luminosity is:\n\nL_total = L_unspotted + L_spotted\n\nL_unspotted = 3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 * \u03c3 * T_unspotted^4\n\nL_spotted = 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 * \u03c3 * T_spotted^4\n\nWhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nSo, L_total = \u03c3 * [3.6\u03c0R\u00b2 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4\u03c0R\u00b2 * T_spotted^4]\n\n= \u03c3 * \u03c0R\u00b2 * (3.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4)\n\nWithout spots, the luminosity would be:\n\nL_unspotted_total = 4\u03c0R\u00b2 * \u03c3 * T_unspotted^4\n\nSo, fractional dimming is:\n\nFractional dimming = (L_unspotted_total - L_total) / L_unspotted_total\n\n= [4\u03c0R\u00b2 * \u03c3 * T_unspotted^4 - \u03c3 * \u03c0R\u00b2 * (3.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4)] / (4\u03c0R\u00b2 * \u03c3 * T_unspotted^4)\n\n= [4 - (3.6 + 0.4 * (T_spotted / T_unspotted)^4)] / 4\n\n= [4 - 3.6 - 0.4 * (5000/6000)^4] / 4\n\n= [0.4 - 0.4 * (5/6)^4] / 4\n\n= [0.4 * (1 - (5/6)^4)] / 4\n\n= 0.1 * (1 - 625/1296)\n\n= 0.1 * (1296 - 625)/1296\n\n= 0.1 * 671/1296 \u2248 0.1 * 0.5177 \u2248 0.05177\n\nAgain, 5.177%, which leads to R_pl / R_star \u2248 0.2275.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. Maybe there's a different way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spots are not uniformly distributed over the hemisphere, or maybe their contrast is different.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the cosine effect because the star is spherical.\n\nThe actual amount of light emitted by a portion of the star depends on its angular position on the star's surface, due to the angle between the surface normal and the line of sight.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and the problem might not require that level of detail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the effective temperature should be considered differently.\n\nWait, maybe the effective temperature of the star is the average over the entire surface, taking into account the spots and the unspotted areas.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to recalculate the temperature contrast.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nThe effective temperature is defined such that the total luminosity is equal to that of a black body at that temperature.\n\nSo, L_total = \u03c3 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2 * Teff^4\n\nBut in our earlier calculation, we have L_total = \u03c3 * \u03c0R\u00b2 * (3.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4)\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u03c3 * 4\u03c0R\u00b2 * Teff^4 = \u03c3 * \u03c0R\u00b2 * (3.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4)\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 * Teff^4 = 3.6 * T_unspotted^4 + 0.4 * T_spotted^4\n\nGiven that Teff = 6000K, T_unspotted = 6000K, and T_spotted = 5000K.\n\nWait, but if Teff is given as 6000K, and T_unspotted is also 6000K, but spots are 5000K, then perhaps the effective temperature is already accounting for the spots.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I need to consider that the effective temperature provided is the average temperature considering the spots.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to find the actual temperature contrast between the spots and the unspotted areas relative to the effective temperature.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider the ratio of the areas.\n\nThe spotted area is 10% of the total surface area.\n\nThe exoplanet would cover (R_pl / R_star)^2 of the surface area.\n\nWe want the exoplanet to block the same amount of light as the spots do.\n\nSo, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = fractional light blocked by spots\n\nWe've calculated fractional light blocked by spots to be approximately 0.05177.\n\nTherefore, R_pl / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) \u2248 0.2275\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to consider the contrast in brightness differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the albedo or other factors, but I don't think that's necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the average effect over time, considering the star's rotation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that only half of the spotted hemisphere is visible at any given time due to the star's spherical shape.\n\nWait, no, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the entire spotted area, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, we see no spots.\n\nSo, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these two states, which is the fractional dimming caused by the spots, which is 5.177%.\n\nTherefore, (R_pl / R_star)^2 = 0.05177, so R_pl / R_star \u2248 0.2275.\n\nBut again, this doesn't match any of the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a miscalculation in the fractional dimming.\n\nLet me recalculate the fractional dimming more carefully.\n\nFractional dimming = f * (1 - (T_spotted / T_unspotted)^4)\n\nWhere f = area_spotted / area_total = 0.10\n\nT_spotted = 5000K, T_unspotted = 6000K\n\nSo,\n\nFractional dimming = 0.10 * (1 - (50"
