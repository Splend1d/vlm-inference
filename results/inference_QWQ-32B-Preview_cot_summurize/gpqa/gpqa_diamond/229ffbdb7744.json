We need to determine the correct transition route and the corresponding probability among the given options.\n\nFirst, let's recall some fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Selection Rules for Dipole Transitions:**\n\n   For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are:\n\n   - \u0394l = \u00b11\n\n   - \u0394m = 0, \u00b11\n\n   - \u0394j = 0, \u00b11 (but j= l for s=0, which is the case for hydrogen)\n\n2. **Transition Probabilities:**\n\n   The transition probability is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment matrix element.\n\nGiven the initial state |3,0,0\u27e9 and the final state |1,0,0\u27e9, we need to find a two-step dipole transition path that adheres to the selection rules.\n\nLet's analyze each option step by step:\n\n**Option A: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 2/3**\n\n- First transition: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9\n\n  - Check \u0394l: 1 - 0 = +1 (allowed)\n\n  - Check \u0394m: 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed)\n\n- Second transition: |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\n  - Check \u0394l: 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed)\n\n  - Check \u0394m: 0 - 0 = 0 (allowed)\n\n- Probability given: 2/3\n\n**Option B: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4**\n\n- First transition: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9\n\n  - Check \u0394l: 1 - 0 = +1 (allowed)\n\n  - Check \u0394m: -1 - 0 = -1 (allowed)\n\n- Second transition: |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\n  - Check \u0394l: 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed)\n\n  - Check \u0394m: 0 - (-1) = +1 (allowed)\n\n- Probability given: 1/4\n\n**Option C: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/3**\n\n- This is similar to option A, but with a different probability.\n\n**Option D: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 with probability 1/4**\n\n- First transition: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9\n\n  - Check \u0394l: 1 - 0 = +1 (allowed)\n\n  - Check \u0394m: 1 - 0 = +1 (allowed)\n\n- Second transition: |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\n  - Check \u0394l: 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed)\n\n  - Check \u0394m: 0 - 1 = -1 (allowed)\n\n- Probability given: 1/4\n\nAll options satisfy the selection rules for dipole transitions. Therefore, the difference lies in the transition probabilities.\n\nTo determine the correct probability, we need to calculate the transition probabilities for each path.\n\nHowever, since this is a multiple-choice question, and we are not expected to perform detailed calculations, we can look for consistency in the options.\n\nOptions A and C have the same transition path but different probabilities (2/3 and 1/3, respectively). Options B and D have different paths but the same probability (1/4 each).\n\nGiven that the sum of probabilities for all possible paths should be 1, if options B and D each have 1/4 probability, their combined probability is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. Therefore, the remaining probability for the other path(s) should be 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nIf option A has a probability of 2/3, that would be approximately 0.666, which is greater than 1/2, leading to a total probability exceeding 1 when combined with options B and D. This is not possible.\n\nTherefore, option A with probability 2/3 is inconsistent.\n\nOption C has probability 1/3, which is approximately 0.333. Adding this to the probabilities of options B and D (1/4 each, totaling 1/2 or 0.5) gives a total probability of 0.333 + 0.5 = 0.833, which is less than 1. This suggests that there might be another path not listed, or that the probabilities are not mutually exclusive in the way assumed.\n\nHowever, considering that options B and D have the same probability and option C has a different one, and given that option A's probability is too high, option C seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that options B and D are separate paths each with probability 1/4, and option C is another path with probability 1/3, the total probability would be more than 1, which is not possible.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps only one of options A or C is correct, and the probabilities need to be consistent.\n\nGiven the confusion, let's consider the relative probabilities.\n\nIn reality, the probability of a two-step transition depends on the product of the probabilities of each individual transition, assuming they are sequential and independent.\n\nFor option A/C: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\nFor option B: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,-1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\nFor option D: |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,1\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9\n\nThe probabilities depend on the transition dipole moments for each step.\n\nIn hydrogenic atoms, the transition probabilities are proportional to the square of the dipole matrix elements.\n\nWithout performing detailed calculations, we can consider the symmetry and the possible contributions.\n\nGenerally, the transition probabilities depend on the angular momentum couplings and the radial integrals.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of this question, we need to choose the correct option based on the given probabilities.\n\nGiven that options B and D have the same probability of 1/4, and option C has 1/3, and option A has 2/3, which seems too dominant, option C appears to be a reasonable choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. |3,0,0\u27e9 \u2192 |2,1,0\u27e9 \u2192 |1,0,0\u27e9 and 1/3\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
