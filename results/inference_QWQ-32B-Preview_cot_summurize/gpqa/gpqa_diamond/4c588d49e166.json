                    "text": "So I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nFirst, the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, the state vector |\u03c8\u27e9 is:\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T\n\nNext, there are two observables, P and Q, represented by their respective matrices.\n\nThe matrix for P is:\n\nP = [  0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n       [1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n       [  0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\nAnd for Q:\n\nQ = [1, 0, 0]\n\n       [0, 0, 0]\n\n       [0, 0, -1]\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of measuring P to get 0, and then measuring Q to get -1, in that order.\n\nAlright, so in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses to an eigenstate of that observable, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the projection of the state onto the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nSo, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.\n\nLet's find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy the equation det(P - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nP - \u03bbI = [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n                [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n                [  0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is:\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb ( \u03bb^2 - (1/\u221a2)^2 ) - (1/\u221a2)( -(1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) ) + 0\n\n= -\u03bb (\u03bb^2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2 \u03bb)\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (1/2)\u03bb - (1/2)\u03bb\n\n= -\u03bb^3\n\nSo, det(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 = 0\n\nThus, the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, 0, 0. Wait, that can't be right. If P is a Hermitian operator (which it should be if it represents an observable), it should have real eigenvalues, but for a 3x3 matrix, having all eigenvalues zero seems off, especially since the matrix has non-zero off-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me double-check the determinant calculation.\n\nP - \u03bbI = [ -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2, 0 ]\n\n                [1/\u221a2, -\u03bb, 1/\u221a2 ]\n\n                [  0, 1/\u221a2, -\u03bb ]\n\ndet(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0\n\n= -\u03bb [ \u03bb^2 - 1/2 ] - (1/\u221a2) [ -\u03bb/\u221a2 ]\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb)/2\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb(1/2 + 1/2)\n\n= -\u03bb^3 + \u03bb\n\n= -\u03bb(\u03bb^2 - 1)\n\nSo, det(P - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb(\u03bb^2 - 1) = -\u03bb(\u03bb - 1)(\u03bb + 1) = 0\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are \u03bb = 0, 1, -1.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense.\n\nNow, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.\n\nFirst, for \u03bb = 0:\n\n(P - 0*I)v = 0\n\nPv = 0\n\nSo,\n\n[  0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ] [x]   [0]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2 ] [y] = [0]\n\n[  0, 1/\u221a2, 0 ] [z]   [0]\n\nFrom the first row: (1/\u221a2)y = 0 \u21d2 y = 0\n\nFrom the third row: same as first row, y = 0\n\nFrom the second row: (1/\u221a2)x + (1/\u221a2)z = 0 \u21d2 x + z = 0 \u21d2 z = -x\n\nSo, the eigenvector for \u03bb = 0 is [x, 0, -x]^T = x[1, 0, -1]^T\n\nThus, the eigenvector is [1, 0, -1]^T (up to a scalar multiple)\n\nNext, for \u03bb = 1:\n\n(P - I)v = 0\n\n[ -1, 1/\u221a2, 0 ] [x]   [0]\n\n[1/\u221a2, -1, 1/\u221a2 ] [y] = [0]\n\n[  0, 1/\u221a2, -1 ] [z]   [0]\n\nFrom the first row: -x + (1/\u221a2)y = 0 \u21d2 y = \u221a2 x\n\nFrom the third row: (1/\u221a2)y - z = 0 \u21d2 z = (1/\u221a2)y = (1/\u221a2)(\u221a2 x) = x\n\nFrom the second row: (1/\u221a2)x - y + (1/\u221a2)z = 0\n\nPlugging y = \u221a2 x and z = x:\n\n(1/\u221a2)x - \u221a2 x + (1/\u221a2)x = (1/\u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 - \u221a2 )x = (2/\u221a2 - \u221a2 )x = (\u221a2 - \u221a2)x = 0\n\nSo, it's consistent.\n\nThus, the eigenvector for \u03bb = 1 is [x, \u221a2 x, x]^T = x[1, \u221a2, 1]^T\n\nSo, we can take [1, \u221a2, 1]^T as the eigenvector.\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = -1:\n\n(P + I)v = 0\n\n[ 1, 1/\u221a2, 0 ] [x]   [0]\n\n[1/\u221a2, 1, 1/\u221a2 ] [y] = [0]\n\n[ 0, 1/\u221a2, 1 ] [z]   [0]\n\nFrom the first row: x + (1/\u221a2)y = 0 \u21d2 x = - (1/\u221a2)y\n\nFrom the third row: (1/\u221a2)y + z = 0 \u21d2 z = - (1/\u221a2)y\n\nFrom the second row: (1/\u221a2)x + y + (1/\u221a2)z = 0\n\nPlugging x = - (1/\u221a2)y and z = - (1/\u221a2)y:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2 y) + y + (1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2 y) = - (1/2)y + y - (1/2)y = 0\n\nSo, it's consistent.\n\nThus, the eigenvector for \u03bb = -1 is [ - (1/\u221a2)y, y, - (1/\u221a2)y ]^T = y [ -1/\u221a2, 1, -1/\u221a2 ]^T\n\nSo, we can take [ -1/\u221a2, 1, -1/\u221a2 ]^T as the eigenvector.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability of measuring P to get 0 and then measuring Q to get -1.\n\nFirst, measure P and get 0.\n\nThe eigenvector for P=0 is [1, 0, -1]^T\n\nThe probability of getting P=0 is the square of the absolute value of the projection of |\u03c8\u27e9 onto this eigenvector.\n\nSo, |\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9|^2, where |a\u27e9 is the eigenvector for P=0.\n\nCompute \u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8a| = [1, 0, -1]\n\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = [-1, 2, 1]^T\n\n\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9 = (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2\n\nSo, |\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 = (-2)^2 = 4\n\nBut we need to normalize this with respect to the state |\u03c8\u27e9.\n\nWait, actually, the probability is |\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 / \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9\n\nFirst, compute \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9:\n\n\u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9 = (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, probability P(P=0) = |\u27e8a|\u03c8\u27e9|^2 / \u27e8\u03c8|\u03c8\u27e9 = 4 / 6 = 2/3\n\nNow, after measuring P=0, the system collapses to the eigenvector |a\u27e9 = [1, 0, -1]^T\n\nBut we need to normalize it.\n\nNormalize |a\u27e9:\n\n||a|| = sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is |a\u27e9 = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T\n\nNow, measure Q, and we want to get Q=-1.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvectors of Q corresponding to Q=-1.\n\nFind the eigenvectors of Q for eigenvalue -1.\n\nQv = -v\n\n(Q + I)v = 0\n\nQ + I = [1+1, 0, 0 ] = [2, 0, 0 ]\n\n                 [0, 0+1, 0 ] = [0, 1, 0 ]\n\n                 [0, 0, -1+1] = [0, 0, 0 ]\n\nSo, the system is:\n\n2x + 0y + 0z = 0 \u21d2 x = 0\n\n0x + 1y + 0z = 0 \u21d2 y = 0\n\n0x + 0y + 0z = 0 \u21d2 z is free\n\nThus, the eigenvector for Q=-1 is [0, 0, z]^T = z [0, 0, 1]^T\n\nSo, the eigenvector is [0, 0, 1]^T\n\nNow, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after the system is in |a\u27e9 is |\u27e8q|-1|a\u27e9|^2, where |q>-1\u27e9 is the eigenvector for Q=-1.\n\nSo, |q>-1\u27e9 = [0, 0, 1]^T\n\nCompute \u27e8q|-1|a\u27e9 = [0, 0, 1] [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T = (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) = -1/sqrt(2)\n\nThus, |\u27e8q|-1|a\u27e9|^2 = (-1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring Q=-1 after measuring P=0 is 1/2.\n\nBut the problem asks for the combined probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.\n\nSo, total probability is P(P=0) * P(Q=-1 | P=0) = (2/3) * (1/2) = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1/3, which corresponds to option D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}} \\]"
