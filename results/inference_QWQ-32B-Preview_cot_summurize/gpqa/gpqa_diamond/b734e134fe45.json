                    "text": "Let's see. I have this problem here about particles being collided in the center of a spherical detector. These collisions produce new particles that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one-third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls, which have a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The options are 40, 54, 28, and 68.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Particles are being produced in the center of a sphere and are moving outwards. Some of them reach the inner walls of the detector, and some don't. The fraction that reaches the walls depends on their direction of travel and possibly their speed, which is related to the Lorentz factor.\n\nI recall that the Lorentz factor, denoted by \u03b3, is defined as \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where v is the velocity of the particle and c is the speed of light. At ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to c, so \u03b3 is large.\n\nNow, the problem mentions that these particles are fast-decaying. That probably means they don't travel very far before decaying, so the distance they can travel before decaying is limited. The Lorentz factor affects their lifetime due to time dilation. In the particle's rest frame, its lifetime is \u03c40, but in the lab frame, it's \u03b3\u03c40. So, the larger the \u03b3, the longer the particle lives in the lab frame, and thus the farther it can travel before decaying.\n\nGiven that, if we increase the Lorentz factor, the particles live longer in the lab frame and can travel farther before decaying. Therefore, a higher Lorentz factor should allow more particles to reach the detector's inner walls.\n\nThe problem states that with \u03b3 ~ 20, one-third of the particles reach the walls. We need to find the \u03b3 where about two-thirds reach the walls.\n\nI need to find a relationship between \u03b3 and the fraction of particles reaching the walls.\n\nLet me think about how the fraction of particles reaching the walls depends on \u03b3.\n\nAssuming that the particles are emitted isotropically from the center, meaning in all directions equally, then the angle at which they are emitted will determine how far they travel before decaying.\n\nParticles emitted directly outward (along the radial direction) will travel the shortest distance to the wall, while particles emitted at angles closer to perpendicular to the radial direction will travel longer distances before hitting the wall.\n\nHowever, since the detector is spherical, the actual path length to the wall depends on the emission angle.\n\nWait, in a sphere, the path length for a particle emitted at an angle \u03b8 relative to the radial direction can be calculated using some geometry.\n\nI think the path length l for a particle emitted at angle \u03b8 in a sphere of radius r is given by l = r / sin \u03b8.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me visualize this.\n\nIf a particle is emitted at an angle \u03b8 relative to the radial direction, its path will be a straight line through the sphere. The path length l can be found using the law of sines in the triangle formed by the center, the emission point, and the impact point on the wall.\n\nActually, in a sphere, the path length for a particle emitted at angle \u03b8 is l = 2 r sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the formula for the chord length in a sphere.\n\nThe chord length l for a sphere of radius r and emission angle \u03b8 is l = 2 r sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the particle will travel a distance l before hitting the wall.\n\nIf the particle decays after a proper time \u03c40 in its rest frame, then in the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c40.\n\nThe distance the particle can travel before decaying in the lab frame is v \u03b3 \u03c40, where v is its speed.\n\nBut v is related to \u03b3 by v = c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2).\n\nSo, the distance it can travel is l_max = v \u03b3 \u03c40 = c \u03b3 \u03c40 sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2).\n\nWait, but \u03c40 is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is \u03b3 \u03c40.\n\nBut I need to relate this to the path length l.\n\nActually, perhaps it's simpler to think in terms of the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall and compare it to its lifetime.\n\nThe time to reach the wall is l / v.\n\nThe particle will reach the wall if l / v < \u03b3 \u03c40.\n\nSo, l / v < \u03b3 \u03c40.\n\nPlugging in l = 2 r sin(\u03b8/2), and v = c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2), we get:\n\n2 r sin(\u03b8/2) / (c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2)) < \u03b3 \u03c40.\n\nSimplifying:\n\nsin(\u03b8/2) < (c \u03b3 \u03c40 sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2)) / (2 r)\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the fraction of particles reaching the wall is proportional to the solid angle over which their path lengths are less than their decay length.\n\nBut this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a simpler relationship.\n\nLet me consider that for a given \u03b3, the decay length is l_decay = v \u03b3 \u03c40.\n\nGiven that v = c sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2), then l_decay = c \u03b3 \u03c40 sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3^2).\n\nSimplifying:\n\nl_decay = c \u03b3 \u03c40 sqrt((\u03b3^2 - 1)/\u03b3^2) = c \u03b3 \u03c40 (sqrt(\u03b3^2 - 1)/\u03b3) = c \u03c40 sqrt(\u03b3^2 - 1)\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nSo, l_decay = c \u03c40 sqrt(\u03b3^2 - 1)\n\nNow, in the problem, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. So, for particles to reach the wall, their decay length needs to be at least equal to the path length to the wall.\n\nBut the path length depends on the emission angle \u03b8.\n\nSo, for a given \u03b3, the fraction of particles reaching the wall is the fraction for which l = 2 r sin(\u03b8/2) < l_decay.\n\nSo, sin(\u03b8/2) < l_decay / (2 r)\n\nTherefore, \u03b8/2 < arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))\n\nSo, \u03b8 < 2 arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))\n\nThe solid angle corresponding to this acceptance angle is \u03a9 = 2 \u03c0 (1 - cos(\u03b8/2))\n\nWait, actually, the solid angle for a cone of half-angle \u03b1 is \u03a9 = 2 \u03c0 (1 - cos \u03b1)\n\nIn this case, \u03b1 = \u03b8/2, so \u03a9 = 2 \u03c0 (1 - cos(\u03b8/4))\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nActually, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the differential solid angle and integrate over the angles where l < l_decay.\n\nBut this seems too complicated for the purpose of this problem.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way to relate the fraction to \u03b3.\n\nGiven that at \u03b3 = 20, the fraction is 1/3, and we need to find \u03b3 where the fraction is 2/3.\n\nPerhaps there's a scaling relationship between \u03b3 and the fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fraction is proportional to \u03b3 or some power of \u03b3.\n\nWait, perhaps I can set up a ratio.\n\nLet me denote f(\u03b3) as the fraction of particles reaching the wall at Lorentz factor \u03b3.\n\nGiven f(20) = 1/3, and we need to find \u03b3 such that f(\u03b3) = 2/3.\n\nIf I can find the functional form of f(\u03b3), then I can solve for \u03b3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simple proportionality.\n\nWait, perhaps the fraction is proportional to \u03b3.\n\nSo, f(\u03b3) = k \u03b3, where k is a constant.\n\nGiven f(20) = 1/3, then 1/3 = k * 20, so k = 1/(3*20) = 1/60.\n\nThen, f(\u03b3) = \u03b3 / 60.\n\nSet f(\u03b3) = 2/3:\n\n\u03b3 / 60 = 2/3 \u2192 \u03b3 = (2/3)*60 = 40.\n\nSo, according to this, \u03b3 = 40.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the fraction is proportional to \u03b3^2.\n\nIf f(\u03b3) = k \u03b3^2, then f(20) = k * 400 = 1/3 \u2192 k = 1/(3*400) = 1/1200.\n\nThen, f(\u03b3) = \u03b3^2 / 1200.\n\nSet f(\u03b3) = 2/3:\n\n\u03b3^2 / 1200 = 2/3 \u2192 \u03b3^2 = (2/3)*1200 = 800 \u2192 \u03b3 = sqrt(800) \u2248 28.28.\n\nSo, \u03b3 \u2248 28.\n\nBut that's option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I got \u03b3 = 40 with linear proportionality.\n\nBut which one is correct?\n\nI think the relationship might not be linear.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe decay length l_decay is proportional to \u03b3, since l_decay = c \u03c40 sqrt(\u03b3^2 - 1) \u2248 c \u03c40 \u03b3 for large \u03b3.\n\nThe path length to the wall is l = 2 r sin(\u03b8/2).\n\nFor particles to reach the wall, l < l_decay.\n\nSo, sin(\u03b8/2) < l_decay / (2 r)\n\nTherefore, the acceptable emission angles are those for which \u03b8 < 2 arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))\n\nThe solid angle corresponding to this is \u03a9_accept = 2 \u03c0 (1 - cos(\u03b1)), where \u03b1 = arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))\n\nBut cos(arcsin(x)) = sqrt(1 - x^2)\n\nSo, \u03a9_accept = 2 \u03c0 (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2))\n\nThe total solid angle is 4 \u03c0, so the fraction is:\n\nf(\u03b3) = \u03a9_accept / (4 \u03c0) = [2 \u03c0 (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2))] / (4 \u03c0) = (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2)) / 2\n\nGiven l_decay = c \u03c40 sqrt(\u03b3^2 - 1), and for large \u03b3, l_decay \u2248 c \u03c40 \u03b3.\n\nSo, f(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - (c \u03c40 \u03b3 / (2 r))^2)) / 2\n\nNow, we are given that at \u03b3 = 20, f(20) = 1/3.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\n(1 - sqrt(1 - (c \u03c40 * 20 / (2 r))^2)) / 2 = 1/3\n\nLet me solve for c \u03c40 / (2 r):\n\nLet x = c \u03c40 / (2 r)\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n(1 - sqrt(1 - (20 x)^2)) / 2 = 1/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n1 - sqrt(1 - (20 x)^2) = 2/3\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- sqrt(1 - (20 x)^2) = -1/3\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nsqrt(1 - (20 x)^2) = 1/3\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 - (20 x)^2 = 1/9\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- (20 x)^2 = -8/9\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n(20 x)^2 = 8/9\n\nTake square root:\n\n20 x = sqrt(8/9) = (2 sqrt(2))/3\n\nTherefore, x = (2 sqrt(2))/(3 * 20) = sqrt(2)/(30)\n\nSo, c \u03c40 / (2 r) = sqrt(2)/30\n\nTherefore, c \u03c40 = (2 r sqrt(2))/30 = (2 * 30 * sqrt(2))/30 = 2 sqrt(2) meters\n\nWait, that seems off. The speed of light c is approximately 3.00 x 10^8 m/s, and r is 30 meters. So c \u03c40 should be much larger than 2 sqrt(2) meters.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check the steps again.\n\nFrom:\n\n(1 - sqrt(1 - (20 x)^2)) / 2 = 1/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n1 - sqrt(1 - (20 x)^2) = 2/3\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- sqrt(1 - (20 x)^2) = -1/3\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nsqrt(1 - (20 x)^2) = 1/3\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n1 - (20 x)^2 = 1/9\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- (20 x)^2 = -8/9\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n(20 x)^2 = 8/9\n\nTake square root:\n\n20 x = sqrt(8/9) = (2 sqrt(2))/3\n\nTherefore, x = (2 sqrt(2))/(3 * 20) = sqrt(2)/30\n\nSo, x = c \u03c40 / (2 r) = sqrt(2)/30\n\nTherefore, c \u03c40 = (2 r sqrt(2))/30 = (2 * 30 * sqrt(2))/30 = 2 sqrt(2) meters\n\nWait, but c \u03c40 should have units of length, which is correct, since it's the decay length in the lab frame.\n\nBut 2 sqrt(2) meters seems too small for c \u03c40, because c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s, and \u03c40 is the proper lifetime.\n\nUnless \u03c40 is extremely small, which would make sense for fast-decaying particles.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nNow, for a general \u03b3, the decay length is l_decay = c \u03c40 sqrt(\u03b3^2 - 1) \u2248 c \u03c40 \u03b3 for large \u03b3.\n\nSo, l_decay \u2248 c \u03c40 \u03b3\n\nWe have c \u03c40 = 2 sqrt(2) meters\n\nTherefore, l_decay \u2248 2 sqrt(2) \u03b3 meters\n\nNow, the fraction is:\n\nf(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2)) / 2\n\nPlug in l_decay \u2248 2 sqrt(2) \u03b3 and r = 30 meters:\n\nf(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - ((2 sqrt(2) \u03b3) / (2 * 30))^2)) / 2\n\nSimplify:\n\nf(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - (sqrt(2) \u03b3 / 30)^2)) / 2\n\nf(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - (2 \u03b3^2)/(900))) / 2\n\nf(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450)) / 2\n\nNow, we want f(\u03b3) = 2/3:\n\n(1 - sqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450)) / 2 = 2/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n1 - sqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450) = 4/3\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- sqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450) = 4/3 - 1 = 1/3\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nsqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450) = -1/3\n\nWait, the square root cannot be negative, so there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, actually, 1 - sqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450) = 4/3 implies that sqrt(1 - \u03b3^2 / 450) = 1 - 4/3 = -1/3\n\nBut square root cannot be negative, so perhaps I set up the equation incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my approximation is invalid.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nFrom f(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2)) / 2\n\nSet f(\u03b3) = 2/3:\n\n(1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2)) / 2 = 2/3\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2) = 4/3\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2) = 4/3 - 1 = 1/3\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nsqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2) = -1/3\n\nAgain, square root cannot be negative, which suggests that there's an error in my approach.\n\nPerhaps the approximation f(\u03b3) \u2248 (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2)) / 2 is not valid for f(\u03b3) = 2/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that for higher \u03b3, more particles reach the wall, but there's a maximum fraction limited by geometry.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reconsider the expression for f(\u03b3).\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nThe fraction of particles reaching the wall is equal to the solid angle over which l < l_decay divided by the total solid angle.\n\nThe path length l = 2 r sin(\u03b8/2)\n\nThe condition for reaching the wall is l < l_decay\n\nSo, sin(\u03b8/2) < l_decay / (2 r)\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 < 2 arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))\n\nThe solid angle corresponding to this is \u03a9 = 2 \u03c0 (1 - cos(\u03b1)), where \u03b1 = arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))\n\nSo, f(\u03b3) = \u03a9 / (4 \u03c0) = [2 \u03c0 (1 - cos(arcsin(l_decay / (2 r))))] / (4 \u03c0) = (1 - cos(arcsin(l_decay / (2 r)))) / 2\n\nNow, cos(arcsin(x)) = sqrt(1 - x^2)\n\nTherefore, f(\u03b3) = (1 - sqrt(1 - (l_decay / (2 r))^2)) / 2\n\nThis is the same expression I had before.\n\nGiven that,"
