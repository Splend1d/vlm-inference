                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After collision, they produce two photons with the same energy, one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about relativistic collisions and photon production.\n\n1. **Lorentz Factor**: The Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is given by \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. It tells us how much time dilation or length contraction occurs at high speeds.\n\n2. **Annihilation**: When an electron and a positron collide, they can annihilate into gamma photons. Typically, this process conserves energy and momentum.\n\n3. **Photons**: Photons always travel at the speed of light, and they have energy E = hf = pc, where h is Planck's constant, f is frequency, and p is momentum.\n\nGiven that both photons have the same energy and are emitted in different directions, I need to find the angle between these directions.\n\nLet me try to approach this step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the energies of the electron and positron before collision.**\n\nThe electron has a Lorentz factor \u03b3_e = 4.\n\nThe positron has a Lorentz factor \u03b3_p = 2.\n\nThe rest mass energy of an electron or positron is m_e c\u00b2 \u2248 0.511 MeV.\n\nTherefore, the total energy of the electron is E_e = \u03b3_e m_e c\u00b2 = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.\n\nSimilarly, the total energy of the positron is E_p = \u03b3_p m_e c\u00b2 = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.\n\n**Step 2: Total energy and momentum before collision.**\n\nSince they are moving towards each other along the horizontal axis, their momenta will be in opposite directions.\n\nLet's define the positive x-axis as the direction of the electron's motion (from left to right).\n\nThen, the momentum of the electron is p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e, where v_e is the velocity of the electron.\n\nSimilarly, the momentum of the positron is p_p = \u03b3_p m_e v_p, in the opposite direction, so p_p = -\u03b3_p m_e v_p.\n\nBut since \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we can express v in terms of \u03b3.\n\nFrom \u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), we get v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2).\n\nSo, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4) c.\n\nSimilarly, v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2) c.\n\nTherefore, p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e c sqrt(15).\n\nSimilarly, p_p = \u03b3_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) c = m_e c sqrt(3).\n\nSince they are moving towards each other, the total momentum before collision is p_e + (-p_p) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait a minute, but in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum should be zero. Maybe I need to consider the center-of-mass frame for this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the laboratory frame, the total momentum is p_e - p_p, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here.\n\nGiven that the photons are emitted in upper-right and lower-right directions, it seems like the collision is happening in a way that there is some transverse momentum involved.\n\nBut photons travel at the speed of light, so their momenta are always in the direction of their propagation.\n\nGiven that, and that momentum must be conserved, the sum of the momenta of the two photons must equal the total momentum before the collision.\n\nWait, but in the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum before the collision is zero, so the two photons must have equal and opposite momenta, meaning they should be emitted in opposite directions.\n\nBut in this problem, they are emitted in upper-right and lower-right directions, which suggests that the collision is not head-on, or perhaps there is some angle involved.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to consider the energies.\n\n**Step 3: Energies after collision.**\n\nThe two photons have equal energies, let's call each one E_\u03b3.\n\nSince energy is conserved, 2E_\u03b3 = E_e + E_p = 2.044 MeV + 1.022 MeV = 3.066 MeV.\n\nTherefore, E_\u03b3 = 3.066 MeV / 2 = 1.533 MeV.\n\nWait, but in reality, annihilation typically produces two photons each with energy equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.\n\nBut in this case, the electron and positron have kinetic energies due to their motion, so the total energy available is greater, and thus the photons can have higher energies.\n\nBut according to my calculation, E_\u03b3 = 1.533 MeV, which seems reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Momenta of the photons.**\n\nSince E_\u03b3 = p_\u03b3 c, then p_\u03b3 = E_\u03b3 / c = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\n**Step 5: Conservation of momentum.**\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the total momentum before the collision is zero, so the momenta of the two photons must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nBut in the laboratory frame, the total momentum before the collision is p_e - p_p, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, actually, since the electron is moving from the left with momentum p_e to the right, and the positron is moving from the right with momentum p_p to the left, their momenta are in opposite directions.\n\nSo, total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p.\n\nWait, but if the electron is moving to the right with p_e, and the positron is moving to the left with p_p, then the total momentum is p_e - p_p.\n\nBut actually, if we define the positive direction to be to the right, then the electron's momentum is +p_e, and the positron's is -p_p.\n\nTherefore, total momentum before collision is p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nSimilarly, the total energy is E_e + E_p = 2.044 MeV + 1.022 MeV = 3.066 MeV.\n\n**Step 6: Photons' directions.**\n\nThe photons are emitted in upper-right and lower-right directions. This suggests that in the laboratory frame, there is some transverse momentum.\n\nBut photons can only carry momentum in the direction of their propagation, which is along their direction of travel.\n\nGiven that, and that the total momentum must be conserved, the sum of the momenta of the two photons must equal the total momentum before the collision.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the momenta of the two photons as p_1 and p_2, with magnitudes p_\u03b3 each, and directions \u03b81 and \u03b82 from the horizontal axis.\n\nGiven that one is emitted upper-right and the other lower-right, perhaps \u03b81 = \u03b8 and \u03b82 = -\u03b8.\n\nThen, the horizontal components are p_\u03b3 cos\u03b8 and p_\u03b3 cos\u03b8, and the vertical components are p_\u03b3 sin\u03b8 and -p_\u03b3 sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, total horizontal momentum after collision is 2 p_\u03b3 cos\u03b8.\n\nTotal vertical momentum after collision is p_\u03b3 sin\u03b8 - p_\u03b3 sin\u03b8 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the total momentum after collision is only in the horizontal direction, with magnitude 2 p_\u03b3 cos\u03b8.\n\nThis must equal the total momentum before collision, which is p_e - p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore, 2 p_\u03b3 cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nAlso, from energy conservation, 2 E_\u03b3 = E_e + E_p = 3.066 MeV, as previously determined.\n\nAnd since E_\u03b3 = p_\u03b3 c, then p_\u03b3 = E_\u03b3 / c = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\nPlugging this into the momentum equation:\n\n2 * (1.533 MeV / c) cos\u03b8 = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nLet's plug in the values:\n\nm_e c \u2248 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo,\n\n2 * (1.533 / c) cos\u03b8 = 0.511 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but units are getting messy here. Let's make sure.\n\nE_\u03b3 = 1.533 MeV, p_\u03b3 = E_\u03b3 / c = 1.533 MeV / c.\n\nm_e c \u2248 0.511 MeV.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n2 * (1.533 / c) cos\u03b8 = 0.511 c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nMultiply both sides by c:\n\n2 * 1.533 cos\u03b8 = 0.511 c\u00b2 (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).\n\nWait, but c\u00b2 has units of (m/s)\u00b2, which doesn't make sense with MeV units. I think I need to work in natural units where c = 1, to simplify.\n\nIn natural units, c = 1, so energies and momenta are equivalent.\n\nSo, in natural units:\n\np_\u03b3 = E_\u03b3 = 1.533 MeV.\n\nTotal momentum before collision: p_e - p_p = \u03b3_e m_e v_e - \u03b3_p m_e v_p.\n\nBut v_e = sqrt(1 - 1/\u03b3_e\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) \u2248 0.968c.\n\nSimilarly, v_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) \u2248 0.866c.\n\nTherefore, p_e = \u03b3_e m_e v_e \u2248 4 * 0.511 MeV * 0.968 \u2248 1.96 MeV.\n\np_p = \u03b3_p m_e v_p \u2248 2 * 0.511 MeV * 0.866 \u2248 0.88 MeV.\n\nTherefore, total momentum before collision: p_e - p_p \u2248 1.96 MeV - 0.88 MeV = 1.08 MeV.\n\nAfter collision, total momentum is 2 p_\u03b3 cos\u03b8 = 2 * 1.533 MeV * cos\u03b8.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n2 * 1.533 cos\u03b8 = 1.08.\n\nTherefore, cos\u03b8 = 1.08 / (2 * 1.533) \u2248 1.08 / 3.066 \u2248 0.352.\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 \u2248 cos\u207b\u00b9(0.352) \u2248 69.5 degrees.\n\nBut the angle between the two photons is 2\u03b8, since one is emitted at +\u03b8 and the other at -\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, angle between them is approximately 139 degrees.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 138\n\nB. 96\n\nC. 172\n\nD. 74\n\n138 degrees is closest to my calculation of 139 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 138 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{138^\\circ} \\]"
