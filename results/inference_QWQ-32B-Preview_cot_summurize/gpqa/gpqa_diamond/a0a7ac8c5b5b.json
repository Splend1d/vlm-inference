                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes (which correspond to the Co(SCN)4^2- complex, I believe, but we need to confirm that) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Total cobalt concentration, c(Co) = 10^-2 M\n\n- [SCN-] concentration = 0.1 M\n\n- Stability constants: \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16\n\nFirst, we need to understand the complexes formed between Co(II) and SCN-. The stability constants (\u03b2) are given for different complexes, likely Co(SCN)^{n} with n=1 to 4.\n\nAssuming the complexes are:\n\n1. Co(SCN)^{+} with \u03b21=9\n\n2. Co(SCN)2 with \u03b22=40\n\n3. Co(SCN)3^{-} with \u03b23=63\n\n4. Co(SCN)4^{2-} with \u03b24=16\n\nBut there seems to be an inconsistency because typically, higher complexes have higher stability constants, but here \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16, which is lower. There might be a typo in the stability constants provided.\n\nAssuming \u03b24 is actually higher than \u03b23, perhaps \u03b24=160 or another value, but since it's given as \u03b24=16, I'll proceed with that.\n\nOur goal is to find the fraction of Co in the form of Co(SCN)4^{2-}, which is presumably the blue dithiocyanato complex.\n\nFirst, we need to set up the equilibrium expressions for the formation of these complexes.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- [Co] as the free Co^{2+} concentration\n\n- [SCN-] as the free thiocyanate concentration\n\n- [Co(SCN)^{+}] as the concentration of the first complex\n\n- [Co(SCN)2] as the concentration of the second complex\n\n- [Co(SCN)3^{-}] as the concentration of the third complex\n\n- [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] as the concentration of the fourth complex\n\nThe stability constants are defined as:\n\n\u03b21 = [Co(SCN)^{+}] / ([Co][SCN-])\n\n\u03b22 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co][SCN-])^2\n\n\u03b23 = [Co(SCN)3^{-}] / ([Co][SCN-])^3\n\n\u03b24 = [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] / ([Co][SCN-])^4\n\nHowever, in reality, \u03b2n should include the charges appropriately, but for simplicity, we'll proceed with these expressions.\n\nThe total cobalt concentration is:\n\nc(Co) = [Co] + [Co(SCN)^{+}] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^{-}] + [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = 10^-2 M\n\nThe total thiocyanate concentration is:\n\n[SCN-]_total = [SCN-] + [Co(SCN)^{+}] + 2[Co(SCN)2] + 3[Co(SCN)3^{-}] + 4[Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = 0.1 M\n\nOur unknowns are [Co], [Co(SCN)^{+}], [Co(SCN)2], [Co(SCN)3^{-}], and [Co(SCN)4^{2-}].\n\nThis is a system of five equations with five unknowns, which can be solved simultaneously.\n\nHowever, this is quite complex due to the number of variables and the non-linearity of the equations. An alternative approach is to assume that the formation of higher complexes is negligible compared to lower ones if their stability constants are lower.\n\nBut given the stability constants provided, \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16, which seems counterintuitive, as higher complexes usually have higher stability constants.\n\nAssuming that \u03b24=16 is a typo and should be higher than \u03b23, let's proceed by considering the formation of Co(SCN)4^{2-} as the main complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only some complexes are significant, and we can approximate by considering only the most stable complexes.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's consider simplifying assumptions.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the formation constants in terms of stepwise formation.\n\nLet\u2019s define the stepwise formation constants:\n\nK1 = [Co(SCN)^{+}] / ([Co][SCN-])\n\nK2 = [Co(SCN)2] / ([Co(SCN)^{+}][SCN-])\n\nK3 = [Co(SCN)3^{-}] / ([Co(SCN)2][SCN-])\n\nK4 = [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] / ([Co(SCN)3^{-}][SCN-])\n\nThe overall stability constants are related to the stepwise constants by:\n\n\u03b21 = K1\n\n\u03b22 = K1 * K2\n\n\u03b23 = K1 * K2 * K3\n\n\u03b24 = K1 * K2 * K3 * K4\n\nGiven \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16, we can solve for K1, K2, K3, K4.\n\nFrom \u03b21=K1=9\n\nFrom \u03b22=K1*K2=40 \u21d2 K2=40/9 \u2248 4.444\n\nFrom \u03b23=K1*K2*K3=63 \u21d2 K3=63/(9*4.444)\u22481.5\n\nFrom \u03b24=K1*K2*K3*K4=16 \u21d2 K4=16/(9*4.444*1.5)\u22480.282\n\nNow, we can express all complex concentrations in terms of [Co].\n\n[Co(SCN)^{+}] = \u03b21 [Co] [SCN-] = 9 [Co] [SCN-]\n\n[Co(SCN)2] = \u03b22 [Co] [SCN-]^2 = 40 [Co] [SCN-]^2\n\n[Co(SCN)3^{-}] = \u03b23 [Co] [SCN-]^3 = 63 [Co] [SCN-]^3\n\n[Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = \u03b24 [Co] [SCN-]^4 = 16 [Co] [SCN-]^4\n\nHowever, this assumes that [Co] is the free Co^{2+} concentration, which is not necessarily true because some Co is bound in complexes.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the mass balance equations.\n\nTotal cobalt:\n\n[Co] + [Co(SCN)^{+}] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3^{-}] + [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = 10^-2 M\n\nTotal SCN-:\n\n[SCN-] + [Co(SCN)^{+}] + 2 [Co(SCN)2] + 3 [Co(SCN)3^{-}] + 4 [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = 0.1 M\n\nThis is still a complex system to solve directly. Another approach is to assume that one complex dominates and approximate the others as negligible.\n\nGiven that \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16, it seems that Co(SCN)3^{-} is more stable than Co(SCN)4^{2-}, which is unusual. Perhaps there is a mistake in the stability constants provided.\n\nAssuming that \u03b24 should be higher than \u03b23, let's proceed by considering Co(SCN)4^{2-} as the most stable complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the first few complexes are significant.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's consider that the majority of Co is in the form of Co(SCN)4^{2-}, and approximate the percentage accordingly.\n\nLet\u2019s denote x = [Co(SCN)4^{2-}]\n\nThen, from \u03b24:\n\n\u03b24 = [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] / ([Co][SCN-])^4 = 16\n\nAssuming that [Co] is small compared to [SCN-], which is plausible if most Co is in complexes.\n\nHowever, this might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, we can assume that [Co] is negligible compared to the complexes, so [Co] \u2248 0.\n\nBut this might not be the case, as some free Co^{2+} may be present.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's better to set up the system of equations and solve numerically.\n\nLet\u2019s set:\n\na = [Co]\n\nb = [Co(SCN)^{+}] = 9 a [SCN-]\n\nc = [Co(SCN)2] = 40 a [SCN-]^2\n\nd = [Co(SCN)3^{-}] = 63 a [SCN-]^3\n\ne = [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] = 16 a [SCN-]^4\n\nTotal cobalt:\n\na + b + c + d + e = 10^-2\n\nTotal SCN-:\n\n[SCN-] + b + 2c + 3d + 4e = 0.1\n\nWe know [SCN-] = 0.1 - (b + 2c + 3d + 4e)\n\nBut since b, c, d, e are expressed in terms of a and [SCN-], this is a system that can be solved for a and [SCN-].\n\nThis seems too involved for a step-by-step solution here. Alternatively, perhaps we can make an approximation.\n\nAssuming that [SCN-] is approximately 0.1 M because the complexes sequester only a small fraction of SCN-.\n\nThen, b \u2248 9 a * 0.1\n\nc \u2248 40 a * (0.1)^2 = 40 a * 0.01 = 0.4 a\n\nd \u2248 63 a * (0.1)^3 = 63 a * 0.001 = 0.063 a\n\ne \u2248 16 a * (0.1)^4 = 16 a * 0.0001 = 0.0016 a\n\nTotal cobalt:\n\na + 0.9 a + 0.4 a + 0.063 a + 0.0016 a \u2248 10^-2\n\nSum of coefficients: 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 \u2248 2.3646\n\nSo, a \u2248 10^-2 / 2.3646 \u2248 0.00423 M\n\nThen, e \u2248 0.0016 * 0.00423 \u2248 6.768e-6 M\n\nPercentage of Co in Co(SCN)4^{2-}:\n\n(6.768e-6 / 10^-2) * 100% \u2248 0.06768 %\n\nThis seems too low compared to the options provided. There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stability constants are for different complexes, or perhaps \u03b24 corresponds to a different complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stability constants are log \u03b2, and we need to take antilogs.\n\nWait, the problem provides \u03b21=9, \u03b22=40, \u03b23=63, \u03b24=16. If these are logarithms, that would make sense, but it's unlikely since stability constants are usually given as \u03b2 values, not log \u03b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \u03b24 corresponds to a different reaction.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps it's best to consider that only the first few complexes are significant and approximate the concentrations accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the blue color is due to Co(SCN)4^{2-}, and we need to find its concentration relative to the total cobalt.\n\nLet\u2019s denote \u03b14 as the fraction of Co in the Co(SCN)4^{2-} form.\n\nThen, \u03b14 = [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] / c(Co)\n\nWe can express [Co(SCN)4^{2-}] in terms of the overall formation constant \u03b24 and the free SCN- concentration.\n\nHowever, this requires knowing the free [SCN-], which is complicated due to the formation of multiple complexes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of conditional formation constants or consider the distribution of species.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps it's best to use a computational tool or a software package designed for such equilibrium calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a simplifying assumption we can make based on the relative magnitudes of the stability constants.\n\nGiven that \u03b23=63 and \u03b24=16, it seems that Co(SCN)3^{-} is more stable than Co(SCN)4^{2-}, which is counterintuitive. Perhaps there is an error in the problem statement.\n\nAssuming that \u03b24 should be higher than \u03b23, let's proceed by considering that Co(SCN)4^{2-} is the most stable complex.\n\nUnder this assumption, most of the cobalt would be in the form of Co(SCN)4^{2-}, and the percentage would be close to 100%. However, this contradicts the options provided.\n\nGiven that the options are around 16-42%, it's clear that multiple complexes are significant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blue color is due to a different complex, and we need to identify which one corresponds to the blue dithiocyanato complex.\n\nUpon research, cobalt(II) complexes with thiocyanate can form various species, and the color can depend on the ratio of Co to SCN-.\n\nGiven the total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M, the SCN- is in excess, which may favor the formation of higher complexes.\n\nHowever, with \u03b24=16 being lower than \u03b23=63, it suggests that Co(SCN)3^{-} is more stable than Co(SCN)4^{2-}, which might not make sense chemically.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the first few complexes and approximate the percentage accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in the stability constants provided, and \u03b24 should be higher than \u03b23.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the percentage of Co in Co(SCN)4^{2-} is around 38.1%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentage is 42.3%, which is option C.\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the stability constants and the complexity of the system, it's challenging to provide an exact answer.\n\nTherefore, I would select option D, 38.1%, as it seems plausible based on the given data.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{38.1\\%} \\]"
