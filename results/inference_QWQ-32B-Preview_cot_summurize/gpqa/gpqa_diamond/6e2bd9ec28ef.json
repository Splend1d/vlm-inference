                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. We need to find the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and excess HI suggest a reduction or substitution reaction. Specifically, HI can act as a nucleophile or undergo substitution reactions, and red phosphorus is often used as a catalyst in such reactions.\n\nLet's start by drawing the structure of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. \n\n- Cyclohexane has a six-membered ring.\n\n- There's a formyl group at position 2: CHO.\n\n- A vinyl group at position 5: CH=CH2.\n\n- And a carboxylic acid at one of the carbons, likely at position 1: COOH.\n\nSo, the structure is something like:\n\n```\n\n      O\n\n      |\n\n1 - COOH\n\n   \\\n\n    2 - CHO\n\n   /\n\n3 - 4 - 5 - CH=CH2\n\n   /     \\\n\n6 -       -1\n\n```\n\nWait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nCyclohexane has positions 1 through 6. If we have a carboxylic acid at position 1, a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5, connected to position 4.\n\nActually, cyclohexane rings can be represented in a chair conformation, but for now, a hexagon will suffice.\n\nSo, structure:\n\n1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), 5 (CH=CH2), and the rest are CH2 or CH groups as needed to complete the ring.\n\nNow, reacting this with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is used in the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or in the reduction of carbonyl compounds. However, in the presence of HI, it might be involved in a substitution or reduction process.\n\nHI is a source of iodide ions, which can act as nucleophiles. Given the presence of multiple functional groups, it's possible that the formyl group (CHO) and the vinyl group (CH=CH2) could react.\n\nLet's consider the reactions step by step.\n\n1. **Formyl group (CHO):** This can be reduced to CH2OH (primary alcohol) or further to CH3 (methyl group) depending on the reaction conditions.\n\n2. **Vinyl group (CH=CH2):** This can undergo electrophilic addition or nucleophilic substitution, depending on the reagents.\n\nGiven that HI is present in excess, it's likely that both formyl and vinyl groups will react.\n\nLet's assume that the formyl group is reduced to CH2I (iodomethyl group) and the vinyl group undergoes iodination to give CHI-CH2I.\n\nSo, the product would have:\n\n- Position 1: COOH\n\n- Position 2: CH2I\n\n- Position 5: CHI-CH2I\n\nNow, we need to determine the IHD of this product.\n\nFirst, let's recall that IHD is calculated as:\n\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\nWhere:\n\n- C is the number of carbon atoms.\n\n- H is the number of hydrogen atoms.\n\n- X is the number of halogen atoms.\n\n- N is the number of nitrogen atoms.\n\nIn our case, there are no nitrogen atoms, so N=0.\n\nLet's count the atoms in the product.\n\n- Carbon atoms (C): The cyclohexane ring has 6 Carbons. Plus, the vinyl group has 2 more Carbons, but in the reaction, it's replaced by iodines. So, total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 (from vinyl) = 8 Carbons.\n\nWait, no. The vinyl group is already part of the ring, so it's part of the 6 Carbons. Wait, cyclohexane has 6 Carbons, and the vinyl group is substituent at position 5: CH=CH2. So, positions 5 and 6 are connected by a double bond.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the structure more carefully.\n\nLet me try to draw the structure again.\n\nAssume the cyclohexane ring is 1-2-3-4-5-6.\n\n- Position 1: COOH\n\n- Position 2: CHO\n\n- Position 5: CH=CH2\n\nSo, total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (from CHO) + 2 (from CH=CH2) = 9 Carbons.\n\nWait, but CHO is part of position 2, and CH=CH2 is part of position 5.\n\nActually, in cyclohexane, each position has a Carbon. So, positions 1 through 6 are Carbons in the ring.\n\n- Position 1: COOH (so, Carbon with COOH)\n\n- Position 2: CHO (so, Carbon with CHO)\n\n- Position 5: CH=CH2 (so, Carbon with CH=CH2)\n\n- Positions 3,4,6: likely CH2 or CH groups, depending on substitution.\n\nSo, total Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (from CHO) + 1 (from CH=CH2) = 8 Carbons.\n\nWait, no. The CHO is already part of position 2, and CH=CH2 is part of position 5. So, no additional Carbons from these groups; they are substituents on the ring Carbons.\n\nTherefore, total Carbons: 6 (ring).\n\nBut the vinyl group (CH=CH2) adds two more Carbons: the CH= and the CH3.\n\nWait, no. In vinyl group CH=CH2, the CH= is bonded to position 5, so position 5 is sp2 hybridized with CH=, and the CH2 is attached to it.\n\nSo, position 5: Carbon with CH= and attached to position 4 and position 6.\n\nPosition 4 and position 6: each has two hydrogens and one bond to position 5.\n\nWait, no. In cyclohexane, each Carbon has two hydrogens, unless substituted.\n\nBut position 5 has CH=CH2, which replaces one hydrogen.\n\nSo, position 5: Carbon with CH=CH2 and one hydrogen.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's try to count Carbons again.\n\n- Cyclohexane ring: 6 Carbons.\n\n- Position 5 has a vinyl group: CH=CH2, which adds one more Carbon (the CH2 part).\n\nSo, total Carbons: 7.\n\nWait, but CH= is part of position 5, and CH2 is attached to it.\n\nSo, position 5: Carbon with CH= and attached to position 4 and 6, and to the CH2 of the vinyl group.\n\nTherefore, total Carbons: 7.\n\nNow, after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI.\n\nAssuming that the formyl group (CHO at position 2) is reduced to CH2I, and the vinyl group (CH=CH2 at position 5) is iodinated to CHI-CH2I.\n\nSo, position 2: CH2I\n\nPosition 5: CHI-CH2I\n\nPosition 1: COOH\n\nOther positions: likely CH2 or CH, depending on substitution.\n\nNow, let's count the atoms in the product.\n\n- Carbons (C): 7 (as above).\n\n- Hydrogens (H): Let's see.\n\nIn the original cyclohexane, each Carbon has two hydrogens, but some are substituted.\n\n- Positions 1,2,5 have substitutions.\n\nPosition 1: COOH: instead of two hydrogens, it has COOH (which has two oxygens and no hydrogens directly attached).\n\nPosition 2: CH2I: instead of two hydrogens, it has two hydrogens and one iodine.\n\nPosition 5: CHI-CH2I: instead of one hydrogen, it has CHI (one hydrogen and one iodine) and CH2I (two hydrogens and one iodine).\n\nSo, hydrogens:\n\n- Positions 3,4,6: each has two hydrogens \u2192 6 H.\n\n- Position 1: COOH: 0 H.\n\n- Position 2: CH2I: 2 H.\n\n- Position 5: CHI-CH2I: 1 H + 2 H = 3 H.\n\nTotal H: 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 H.\n\n- Halogens (X): iodines.\n\nPosition 2: CH2I: 1 I.\n\nPosition 5: CHI-CH2I: 1 I + 1 I = 2 I.\n\nTotal X: 3 I.\n\n- Nitrogen (N): 0.\n\nNow, plug into the IHD formula:\n\nIHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2\n\n= (2*7 + 2 - 11 - 3 + 0)/2\n\n= (14 + 2 - 11 - 3)/2\n\n= (16 - 14)/2\n\n= 2/2\n\n= 1.\n\nSo, the index of hydrogen deficiency is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
