                    "text": "Let's tackle this astronomy problem step by step. We have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, and we need to find out how much brighter Star_1 is compared to Star_2 in terms of luminosity. The problem gives us a few pieces of information:\n\n1. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2.\n\n2. The mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2.\n\n3. Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength.\n\n4. The radial velocities are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2.\n\n5. We're to assume that both stars radiate as black bodies.\n\nOur goal is to find the ratio of their luminosities, specifically, how many times brighter Star_1 is compared to Star_2.\n\nFirst, let's recall some basic principles of stellar astronomy. The luminosity (L) of a star is related to its radius (R) and its surface temperature (T) by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n\\[ L = 4\\pi R^2 \\sigma T^4 \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\sigma\\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nGiven that both stars radiate as black bodies and appear brightest at the same wavelength, we can use Wien's displacement law, which relates the temperature of a black body to the wavelength at which it emits most strongly:\n\n\\[ \\lambda_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{b}{T} \\]\n\nwhere \\(b\\) is Wien's displacement constant.\n\nSince both stars have the same \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\), their temperatures must be the same. That is, \\(T_1 = T_2\\).\n\nWait a minute, but if their temperatures are the same, and Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, then according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity ratio should be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left( \\frac{R_1}{R_2} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} \\right)^4 = (1.5)^2 (1)^4 = 2.25 \\]\n\nSo, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's more to this problem. The masses of the stars are also given to be in the same ratio, 1.5 times, but since luminosity depends on radius and temperature, and we've already accounted for the radius difference with the same temperature, maybe that's all we need.\n\nHowever, the problem also provides radial velocities: 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But since both stars are moving radially at different speeds, does this affect their observed luminosities?\n\nWell, radial velocity can affect the observed wavelengths due to the Doppler effect, but since the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, that means that any Doppler shift has been accounted for, and their intrinsic \\(\\lambda_{\\text{max}}\\) are the same.\n\nTherefore, their temperatures are indeed the same.\n\nSo, going back to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, with \\(T_1 = T_2\\) and \\(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\\), the luminosity ratio is simply:\n\n\\[ \\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \\left( \\frac{R_1}{R_2} \\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \\]\n\nBut looking at the options:\n\nA. ~2.35\n\nB. ~2.23\n\nC. ~2.32\n\nD. ~2.25\n\nOption D is exactly 2.25, which matches our calculation.\n\nHowever, perhaps there's a more precise way to calculate this, considering other factors.\n\nLet's think about the mass-radius relationship in stars. Generally, for main-sequence stars, there is a relationship between mass and radius, but it's not always strictly linear. For example, more massive stars can be larger or smaller depending on their evolutionary stage.\n\nBut in this problem, it's given that both the mass and radius of Star_1 are 1.5 times those of Star_2. So, perhaps assuming that the stars are similar in composition and both are on the main sequence, their structures might scale in this way.\n\nMoreover, if they have the same temperature, then the luminosity should scale with the surface area, which is proportional to the square of the radius.\n\nWait, but maybe there's more to consider. Perhaps the mass affects the luminosity independently of the radius and temperature.\n\nLet's recall that in stellar structure, luminosity is also related to the rate of nuclear fusion in the core, which depends on the mass.\n\nHowever, if we're to strictly follow the black body radiation assumption and the given data, then the luminosity ratio should be based solely on the radius ratio, given that temperatures are equal.\n\nBut maybe there's a subtlety here that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the radial velocities affect the observed luminosities due to relativistic effects.\n\nLet's consider the relativistic Doppler effect on the observed flux.\n\nThe flux (F) observed from a star is related to its luminosity (L) and distance (d) by:\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2} \\]\n\nBut radial velocity affects the observed flux due to the Doppler boosting, which can increase or decrease the observed flux depending on whether the source is moving towards or away from the observer.\n\nThe formula for the flux correction due to Doppler boosting is:\n\n\\[ F_{\\text{obs}} = F \\left( \\frac{1 + \\beta}{1 - \\beta} \\right)^{1/2} \\]\n\nwhere \\(\\beta = v/c\\), with v being the radial velocity and c the speed of light.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we're not directly dealing with observed fluxes but with intrinsic luminosities. So, perhaps this effect is not directly relevant.\n\nMoreover, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, which suggests that any Doppler shift has been accounted for in determining their intrinsic properties.\n\nTherefore, it's probably safe to stick with the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the given radius ratio.\n\nThus, the luminosity ratio is \\( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \\), which corresponds to option D.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's any other factor that might slightly alter this ratio.\n\nFor example, perhaps the mass affects the gravitational redshift or the internal pressure, which could slightly affect the temperature or the radius.\n\nHowever, these effects are probably negligible for the purposes of this problem.\n\nAdditionally, if we consider that more massive stars might have higher core temperatures due to greater gravitational compression, but in this case, since both stars have the same surface temperature, that effect might not be directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the higher mass of Star_1 implies a higher luminosity beyond what's accounted for by the radius difference.\n\nBut again, given that temperatures are the same, and assuming similar compositions and evolutionary stages, the luminosity should scale with the surface area.\n\nTherefore, I think the straightforward approach is correct: the luminosity ratio is 2.25.\n\nSo, the answer should be D. ~2.25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
