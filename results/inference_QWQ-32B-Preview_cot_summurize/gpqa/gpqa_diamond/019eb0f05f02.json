                    "text": "So I have this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. It lists four different compounds and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are:\n\n1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate\n\n2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n3. benzophenone\n\n4. dimethyl fumarate\n\nAnd the choices are:\n\nA. 3 and 4\n\nB. 2 and 3\n\nC. 1 and 2\n\nD. 1, 2 and 4\n\nI need to figure out which of these compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image. This usually happens when there's an asymmetric carbon atom, which is a carbon bonded to four different groups.\n\nLet's look at each compound one by one.\n\nStarting with number 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. This sounds pretty complex. It's a biphenyl compound with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions, both of which are methyl esters. I need to visualize this structure. Biphenyls are two benzene rings linked together. With nitro and carboxylate groups at specific positions, it might have chiral centers depending on the connectivity.\n\nNumber 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. This sounds more familiar. It's a ester derived from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid (lactic acid) and methanol. Lactic acid has a chiral center at the second carbon, which is bonded to a hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, and a carbonyl group. When it forms an ester with methanol, the chiral center should still be present, so this likely has optical isomers.\n\nNumber 3: benzophenone. That's a molecule with two phenyl groups connected by a ketone group. The structure is symmetric, with a C=O bond between the two phenyl rings. I don't think there are any chiral centers here, so probably no optical isomerism.\n\nNumber 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the fumaric acid esterified with methanol. Fumaric acid is a dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. Dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl esters on the carboxylic acids. Fumaric acid itself doesn't have chiral centers, and neither does its dimethyl ester, so probably no optical isomerism here.\n\nBased on this initial thoughts, it seems that only compound 2 has optical isomerism. But let's double-check.\n\nLooking back at compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. I need to see if there are any chiral centers in this molecule. Biphenyls can have chiral axes, but I'm not sure about this specific substitution pattern. The nitro and carboxylate groups are both electron-withdrawing and are placed at the 6 and 2 positions respectively. Given the symmetry of the substitutions, it's possible that this molecule is achiral. Maybe I need to draw the structure to see.\n\nCompound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Yes, this is methyl lactate, which is derived from lactic acid. Lactic acid has a chiral center, and esterification doesn't eliminate the chirality. So, this should have two optical isomers: R and S configurations at the chiral carbon.\n\nCompound 3: benzophenone. This molecule has a plane of symmetry through the ketone group, so it's achiral. No optical isomerism.\n\nCompound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a straight-chain dicarboxylic acid with a trans double bond. Its structure is symmetric, and the dimethyl ester retains that symmetry. No chiral centers here, so no optical isomerism.\n\nSo, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, none of them have just option 2. Option C has 1 and 2, but I think 1 doesn't have optical isomerism. Option D has 1, 2, and 4, but again, only 2 seems to have it.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something about compound 1. Let's try to visualize it better.\n\nBiphenyl has two benzene rings connected directly. The positions are numbered such that the connecting carbon is position 1 and 1'. The other positions are numbered accordingly. In this compound, there are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2', which are methyl esters.\n\nGiven that it's a biphenyl, the arrangement of substituents can affect its symmetry. If the substitutions are symmetrical, the molecule might be achiral. However, if the substitutions are asymmetrical, it could have chiral centers or axes.\n\nIn this case, with nitro groups at 6 and 6' and methyl carboxylates at 2 and 2', it seems symmetrical. So, likely achiral.\n\nTherefore, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, but since that's not an option, maybe I need to consider another perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, could have geometric isomerism due to the double bond, but geometric isomerism is different from optical isomerism. Optical isomerism involves non-superimposable mirror images, usually due to chiral centers.\n\nWait, maybe compound 4 has optical isomers if it has chiral centers. But fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, which doesn't have chiral centers. So, its dimethyl ester shouldn't have chiral centers either.\n\nUnless there's an error in my assumption.\n\nSimilarly, compound 1 might have a chiral axis, but I doubt it.\n\nCompound 3 is definitely achiral.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is C, 1 and 2, but I'm not entirely sure about compound 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compound 4 does have optical isomers, and I'm missing something.\n\nLet me check the structure of dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid. When esterified with methanol, it becomes dimethyl fumarate, which still has a trans double bond. Since there are no chiral centers, it shouldn't have optical isomers.\n\nSimilarly, compound 1 seems symmetrical and achiral.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the answer is C, 1 and 2, but based on my analysis, only 2 seems to have optical isomerism.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, 1, 2, and 4, but that seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the options, perhaps the correct answer is C, 1 and 2.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident about compound 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider stereogenic centers in compound 1.\n\nBiphenyls can have atropisomers, which are stereoisomers resulting from restricted rotation around a bond, such as the single bond connecting the two benzene rings in biphenyl.\n\nIf the substitutions make the molecule chiral, then atropisomers can exhibit optical activity.\n\nSo, perhaps compound 1 has atropisomers due to the substitutions at 2,6 and 2',6' positions.\n\nIf that's the case, then it could show optical isomerism.\n\nI need to consider that.\n\nTherefore, both compound 1 and 2 could show optical isomerism: compound 1 due to atropisomerism and compound 2 due to chiral center.\n\nThat would make option C correct.\n\nAlternatively, if compound 1 doesn't have atropisomerism, then only compound 2 has optical isomerism.\n\nBut since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is C, 1 and 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D, 1, 2, and 4.\n\nBut I doubt that, since compound 4 doesn't have chiral centers.\n\nWait, maybe compound 4 does have optical isomers if fumaric acid is resolved into enantiomers.\n\nBut in reality, fumaric acid is a meso compound, which means it has chiral centers but is optically inactive due to internal compensation.\n\nWait, fumaric acid has two chiral centers, but in the trans configuration, they are identical, making it a meso compound.\n\nTherefore, dimethyl fumarate would also be a meso compound, optically inactive despite having chiral centers.\n\nSo, in that case, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C, 1 and 2.\n\nBut I'm still unsure about compound 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe only compound 2 shows optical isomerism, and the answer expected is C, but in reality, it's only 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compound 3 also shows optical isomerism, which would make option B correct.\n\nBut benzophenone is symmetrical and has no chiral centers, so that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compound 3 has some kind of stereogenicity, but I can't see it.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is C, 1 and 2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
