                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We need to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. That's a pretty complex molecule, so we need to think about how to introduce each substituent in the correct position.\n\nFirst, let's look at the target molecule:\n\n- It has a tert-butyl group at position 2.\n\n- An ethoxy group at position 1.\n\n- A nitro group at position 3.\n\nSo, we need to introduce these groups in a specific order, making sure that each new substituent goes to the correct position on the benzene ring.\n\nLet's consider the options provided and see which sequence makes the most sense.\n\nOption A:\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3\n\nii) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\niii) Fe / HCl\n\niv) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\nv) NaNO2 / HCl\n\nvi) H3O+, H2O / Heat\n\nvii) NaOH / EtBr\n\nviii) SO3 / H2SO4\n\nix) dilute H2SO4\n\nOption B:\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3\n\nii) SO3 / H2SO4\n\niii) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\niv) Fe / HCl\n\nv) NaNO2 / HCl\n\nvi) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\nvii) H3O+, H2O / Heat\n\nviii) dilute H2SO4\n\nix) NaOH / EtBr\n\nOption C:\n\ni) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\nii) Fe / HCl\n\niii) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3\n\niv) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\nv) NaNO2 / HCl\n\nvi) SO3 / H2SO4\n\nvii) dilute H2SO4\n\nviii) H3O+, H2O / Heat\n\nix) NaOH / EtBr\n\nOption D:\n\ni) tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3\n\nii) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\niii) SO3 / H2SO4\n\niv) NaNO2 / HCl\n\nv) dilute H2SO4\n\nvi) H3O+, H2O / Heat\n\nvii) NaOH / EtBr\n\nviii) Fe / HCl\n\nix) HNO3 / H2SO4\n\nAlright, let's understand what each step does:\n\n1. **tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3**: This is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to introduce a tert-butyl group onto the benzene ring.\n\n2. **HNO3 / H2SO4**: Nitration to introduce a nitro group.\n\n3. **Fe / HCl**: Reduction with iron and hydrochloric acid, which can reduce nitro groups to amino groups.\n\n4. **SO3 / H2SO4**: Sulfonation to introduce a sulfonic acid group.\n\n5. **NaNO2 / HCl**: Nitrosation to convert amino groups to diazonium salts.\n\n6. **H3O+, H2O / Heat**: Possibly hydrolysis or rearrangement.\n\n7. **NaOH / EtBr**: Ethers can be introduced via Williamson synthesis.\n\n8. **Dilute H2SO4**: Likely used to hydrolyze or neutralize previous reactions.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence.\n\nFirst, we need to introduce the tert-butyl group. Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3 can do that. So, step i in options A, B, and D makes sense.\n\nNext, we need to introduce the nitro group at position 3. The position where the nitro group will go depends on the existing substituents. Tert-butyl is an electron-donating group, which activates the ring toward electrophilic substitution and directs new substituents to the meta positions.\n\nSo, after introducing the tert-butyl group, nitration should introduce a nitro group at the meta position relative to the tert-butyl group.\n\nThen, we need to introduce the ethoxy group at position 1. Position 1 is ortho to the tert-butyl group and meta to the nitro group.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky because introducing the ethoxy group might require activating the ring again, possibly through a nucleophilic substitution.\n\nLet's consider the sequences:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n1. tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 introduces tert-butyl group.\n\n2. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 introduces nitro group at meta to tert-butyl.\n\n3. Fe / HCl \u2192 reduces nitro to amino.\n\n4. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration again? This seems redundant.\n\n5. NaNO2 / HCl \u2192 diazotization.\n\n6. H3O+, H2O / Heat \u2192 possibly hydrolysis.\n\n7. NaOH / EtBr \u2192 Williamson synthesis for ethoxy group.\n\n8. SO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 sulfonation.\n\n9. dilute H2SO4 \u2192 likely to remove sulfonic acid group.\n\nThis sequence seems complicated and might not lead directly to the desired product.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n1. tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 introduces tert-butyl group.\n\n2. SO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 introduces sulfonic acid group.\n\n3. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration.\n\n4. Fe / HCl \u2192 reduction.\n\n5. NaNO2 / HCl \u2192 diazotization.\n\n6. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration again?\n\n7. H3O+, H2O / Heat \u2192 hydrolysis.\n\n8. dilute H2SO4 \u2192 neutralization.\n\n9. NaOH / EtBr \u2192 ethoxy group introduction.\n\nThis also seems convoluted. Introducing a sulfonic acid group might not be helpful for our purposes.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n1. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 introduces nitro group.\n\n2. Fe / HCl \u2192 reduces nitro to amino.\n\n3. tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 introduces tert-butyl group.\n\n4. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration again.\n\n5. NaNO2 / HCl \u2192 diazotization.\n\n6. SO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 sulfonation.\n\n7. dilute H2SO4 \u2192 neutralization.\n\n8. H3O+, H2O / Heat \u2192 hydrolysis.\n\n9. NaOH / EtBr \u2192 ethoxy group introduction.\n\nThis sequence starts with nitration, then reduction, alkylations, etc. It's not clear how this leads to the desired product.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n1. tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 introduces tert-butyl group.\n\n2. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 introduces nitro group at meta.\n\n3. SO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 introduces sulfonic acid group.\n\n4. NaNO2 / HCl \u2192 diazotization.\n\n5. dilute H2SO4 \u2192 neutralization.\n\n6. H3O+, H2O / Heat \u2192 hydrolysis.\n\n7. NaOH / EtBr \u2192 ethoxy group introduction.\n\n8. Fe / HCl \u2192 reduction.\n\n9. HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration again.\n\nThis also seems overly complicated.\n\nNone of these sequences seem straightforward for making 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene from benzene. There must be a better way.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe we can use directed ortho metalation to introduce groups in specific positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a stepwise approach:\n\n1. Start with benzene.\n\n2. Nitrate it to get nitrobenzene.\n\n3. Reduce nitrobenzene to aniline.\n\n4. Alkylation of aniline to get N-tert-butylaniline.\n\n5. Nitration of N-tert-butylaniline to get the desired nitro group.\n\n6. Etherification to introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nBut looking back at the options, none of them follow this path.\n\nWait, maybe we need to consider the directing effects of the groups.\n\n- Tert-butyl is electron-donating and activates the ring, directing new substituents to the meta positions.\n\n- Nitro is electron-withdrawing and deactivates the ring, directing new substituents to the para and ortho positions.\n\nSo, if we first add tert-butyl, then nitro at meta, then introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nBut in option A, after introducing tert-butyl and nitro, they reduce the nitro to amino, then nitrate again, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nOption B introduces a sulfonic acid group after tert-butyl and before nitration, which might influence the direction of the nitro group.\n\nOption C starts with nitration, then reduction, then tert-butylation, then more nitration, etc.\n\nOption D is similar to option A.\n\nNone of these seem logical. Perhaps there's a typo in the options or the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is correct, but it's just not intuitive.\n\nLet me try to trace option A step by step:\n\n1. Benzene + tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 2-tert-butylbenzene (assuming tert-butyl goes to position 2, but actually, it could go to any position without pre-existing directing groups.\n\n2. 2-tert-butylbenzene + HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzene (nitro group goes to meta position relative to tert-butyl).\n\n3. 2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzene + Fe / HCl \u2192 2-tert-butyl-5-aminobenzene.\n\n4. 2-tert-butyl-5-aminobenzene + HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 ? Re-nitration might not be desirable.\n\nThis already seems off.\n\nOption B:\n\n1. Benzene + tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 2-tert-butylbenzene.\n\n2. 2-tert-butylbenzene + SO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 2-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n3. 2-tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid + HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration, but sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, so nitration might not occur easily.\n\nThis also seems problematic.\n\nOption C:\n\n1. Benzene + HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitrobenzene.\n\n2. Nitrobenzene + Fe / HCl \u2192 aniline.\n\n3. Aniline + tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 N-tert-butylaniline.\n\n4. N-tert-butylaniline + HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 nitration, but aniline is basic and might affect nitration.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nOption D:\n\n1. Benzene + tert-butyl chloride / AlCl3 \u2192 2-tert-butylbenzene.\n\n2. 2-tert-butylbenzene + HNO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzene.\n\n3. 2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzene + SO3 / H2SO4 \u2192 2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid.\n\n4. 2-tert-butyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonic acid + NaNO2 / HCl \u2192 diazonium salt.\n\n5. Diazonium salt + dilute H2SO4 \u2192 possibly hydrolysis.\n\n6. Hydrolysis products + H3O+, H2O / Heat \u2192 unclear.\n\n7. Then NaOH / EtBr for ether introduction.\n\n8. Fe / HCl reduction.\n\n9. HNO3 / H2SO4 nitration again.\n\nThis sequence is too convoluted and likely doesn't lead to the desired product.\n\nGiven that none of the options seem to logically lead to 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the question or the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct sequence is a combination of steps from different options.\n\nLet me attempt to devise my own sequence:\n\n1. Start with benzene.\n\n2. Nitrate it to get nitrobenzene.\n\n3. Reduce nitrobenzene to aniline.\n\n4. Alkylation of aniline with tert-butyl chloride to get N-tert-butylaniline.\n\n5. Nitration of N-tert-butylaniline to introduce the second nitro group at the desired position.\n\n6. Etherification using Williamson synthesis to introduce the ethoxy group.\n\nHowever, this sequence isn't listed in the options, so I must choose among A, B, C, or D.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option A is the closest, but even then, it doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is designed to introduce substituents in a specific order to control regioselectivity.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n- tert-butyl at position 2.\n\n- nitro at position 3.\n\n- ethoxy at position 1.\n\nSo, starting with benzene:\n\n1. Introduce tert-butyl at position 2.\n\n2. Introduce nitro at position 3 (meta to tert-butyl).\n\n3. Introduce ethoxy at position 1 (ortho to tert-butyl).\n\nBut achieving ortho selectivity might be challenging because nitro is deactivating and meta-directing, while tert-butyl is activating and meta-directing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a pre-existing directing group.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Since I have to choose among the given options, and none of them seem logical, I'll have to make an educated guess.\n\nOption A has the steps in the order of alkylations, nitration, reduction, nitration again, diazotization, hydrolysis, etherification, sulfonation, and finally neutralization.\n\nThis seems like a convoluted sequence and likely not the best way to synthesize the desired compound.\n\nOption B has alkylations, sulfonation, nitration, reduction, diazotization, nitration again, hydrolysis, neutralization, and etherification.\n\nAgain, too many steps and not straightforward.\n\nOption C starts with nitration, reduction, alkylation, nitration again, diazotization, sulfonation, neutralization, hydrolysis, and etherification.\n\nThis also seems inefficient.\n\nOption D has alkylations, nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, neutralization, hydrolysis, etherification, reduction, and nitration again.\n\nThis sequence is also not making much sense.\n\nGiven that, perhaps none of these options are correct, or there's a typo in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct sequence is a combination of steps from different options.\n\nHowever, since I have to choose one, I'll go with option A, as it at least starts with introducing the tert-butyl group and then introduces the nitro group, which seems logical.\n\nBut honestly, none of these options seem like they would lead to the desired product efficiently or in high yield.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
