                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. So, I've got this new ligand-receptor pair that's expressed in neural crest cells, and I'm trying to figure out what happens when they interact during development. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four of which are extracellular, and three beta sheets that form a binding site for the ligand. The ligand itself is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices.\n\nTo study this, I created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand's open reading frame (ORF) is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor's ORF is at the 3', fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is driven by the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) regulatory element. There's a stop cassette in between the ligand and mCherry, flanked by loxP sites, and another stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP, flanked by lox2272 sites.\n\nI've also raised antibodies against these overexpressed proteins and used them to test the construct expression on a Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. The total proteins give a signal proportional to the actin loading, which seems fine.\n\nThen, I bred a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background and crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre recombinase should excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP fused to the ligand and receptor, respectively.\n\nAfter the offspring are born, I visualize them under a fluorescent confocal microscope but don't observe any green signal. Now, I need to figure out why there's no green signal.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.\n\nB. The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.\n\nC. The receptor and the eGFP are not in frame.\n\nD. The ligand and the receptor are in a paracrine relationship.\n\nFirst, option A suggests that the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi apparatus. If this were the case, the protein might not reach the cell surface where it's intended to be, but it doesn't explain why there's no green signal at all. If it's stuck in the Golgi, there might still be some intracellular GFP signal, unless it's completely degraded or not folded properly.\n\nOption B mentions that the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Enhancers are regulatory elements that increase the likelihood of transcription of particular genes. If an enhancer is missing, expression might be reduced or absent. However, since the construct is present and I've confirmed expression in vitro with the Western blot, this seems less likely unless there's a specific enhancer in the mouse genome that's required for expression in vivo.\n\nOption C suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the protein product would likely be aberrant, possibly not functional, and might not be expressed at all or could be rapidly degraded. This could explain the absence of the green signal.\n\nOption D proposes that the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine signaling means that the ligand is secreted by one cell and acts on neighboring cells. If the ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship, their expression might be in different cell types, but in this construct, both the ligand and receptor are being expressed in the same cells due to the bicistronic vector. So, this might not directly explain the absence of the green signal.\n\nGiven that I don't see any green signal, the most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, which would prevent proper expression of the fusion protein. This could be due to a frameshift mutation or incorrect cloning that disrupted the reading frame between the receptor and eGFP.\n\nI should probably double-check the construct by sequencing to confirm the reading frame. Also, since I have antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, I could perform immunostaining on sections from these mice to see if the receptor is being expressed, even if eGFP isn't visible.\n\nAdditionally, since the ligand is fused to mCherry and there might be a stop cassette involved, I need to ensure that the Cre recombinase has properly excised the stop cassette to allow expression of mCherry and eGFP.\n\nMaybe I should check for mCherry expression as well. If mCherry is expressed but eGFP isn't, that would suggest a problem specifically with the receptor-eGFP fusion.\n\nAlternatively, there could be an issue with the Cre recombinase excising the stop cassettes. Perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites aren't being recognized properly, or there's a problem with the Cre expression.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of spectral overlap or incorrect filter settings on the confocal microscope. Maybe I'm not visualizing eGFP correctly, and there's some cross-talk with mCherry or other fluorescent proteins.\n\nBut given the options provided, I think option C, the receptor and eGFP not being in frame, is the most likely reason for the absence of the green signal.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
