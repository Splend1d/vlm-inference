I've created a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G gene, and I've added a tag to the protein for easier purification and identification of its binding partners.\n\nNow, I've engineered a plasmid with the GADD45G coding sequence and an HA tag at the N-terminus. I've used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and I'm selecting antibiotic-resistant colonies to test the expression level. But, I'm having trouble overexpressing the protein as expected. I've done some tests to figure out why, and I've looked at the DNA sequence of my construct.\n\nThe sequence provided is the plus strand (coding strand) of my construct:\n\n5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'\n\nI need to figure out why the protein isn't being overexpressed as expected. There are four options provided:\n\nA. The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.\n\nB. The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse.\n\nC. The ribosome terminated the translation early.\n\nD. The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of these options means and how they could affect protein expression.\n\nOption A suggests that without a linker sequence between the HA tag and the GADD45G protein, the nascent protein chain is being degraded by proteases. A linker sequence can be important for proper folding and stability of the fusion protein. If there's no linker, the two domains might be too close or in an orientation that makes the protein unstable or prone to degradation.\n\nOption B is about tRNA for the UAA codon. UAA is a stop codon, and there's no tRNA that recognizes stop codons; instead, release factors recognize them to terminate translation. So, this option seems a bit confused. Maybe it's trying to say that there's a premature stop codon in the sequence, causing early termination.\n\nOption C directly states that the ribosome is terminating translation early, which could be due to a premature stop codon in the coding sequence.\n\nOption D suggests that there's a missense mutation in the sequence for the antigenic determinant (the HA tag), which could affect the protein's structure or function.\n\nTo determine which of these is the issue, I need to analyze the DNA sequence provided.\n\nFirst, I should confirm whether there's a premature stop codon in the coding sequence. Since this is the plus strand, coding strand, I can transcribe it into mRNA and then translate it to see if there are any early stop codons.\n\nLet's transcribe the DNA sequence into mRNA:\n\nDNA: 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTC CAG ATT ACC GCA AAT GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGAC ACA GTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GG AAAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGCT GCT GTC GGC GCAG CGT CAG GGC TGC CTC ACT GCC GGC GTCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCG ACA ATG TAG CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT ACG CTG ATC CAG GCT TTC TGCT GCG AGA ACG ACA TCG ACA TAG TGC GCG TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CTAT CGT GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CCG GG CAC TGCA CTC CAT CCT CATT TCG AAC CCC AAC GAG GAC GCC TGGA AGG ATC CCG CCT TGG AGA AGC TCAG CCT GTT TTG CGA GGA GAG CCg CAG CGT TAAC GAC TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA 3'\n\nmRNA: 5' AUG UAC CCA UAC GAU GUC CAG AUU ACC GCA AAU GAC UCU GGA AGA AGU CCG CGG CCA GGAC ACA GUC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA UGC AGG UG CCG GGA AAG CGC UGC AUG AGU UGCU GCU GUC GGC GCA GCG UCA GGG UGC CUC ACU GCC GGC GUCU ACG AGU CAG CCA AAG UCU UGA ACG UGG ACC CCG ACA AUC GUC UCC UGU GCU GGC UGC GGG UG AAG AGA GAC GAG GGC GAC AUU GCG UGC AGA AUC CAC UUU ACC UGA UCC AGG CUU UCU GCU GCG AGA AAC GAC AUU GAC AUU AGU GCG CGU GGG CGA UG UGC AGC GGC UGG CGG CUU ACU GUG GCG CCG GCG AGG AGG CGG UG CGC CGG CAC UGC ACU GCC UCC UAU UUC GAU CCC AAU GAG GAC GCC UGG AAG GAU CCC GCC UGG AGA AGC UCA GCC UGU UUU GCG AGG AGA GCC CAG CGU UAA CGA UGG GGU CCC AGC AUU ACC CUC CCC GAG UGA 3'\n\nNow, let's translate this mRNA sequence into amino acids:\n\nAUG - Methionine (start codon)\n\nUAC - Tyrosine\n\nCCA - Proline\n\nUAC - Tyrosine\n\nGAU - Aspartic Acid\n\nGUC - Valine\n\nCAG - Glutamine\n\nAUU - Isoleucine\n\nACC - Threonine\n\nGCA - Alanine\n\nAAU - Asparagine\n\nGAC - Aspartic Acid\n\nUCU - Serine\n\nGGA - Glycine\n\nAGA - Arginine\n\nAGU - Serine\n\nCCG - Proline\n\nCGG - Arginine\n\nCCA - Proline\n\nGGAC - Glycine, Alanine\n\nACA - Threonine\n\nGUC - Valine\n\nCCG - Proline\n\nGAA - Glutamic Acid\n\nAGC - Serine\n\nACA - Threonine\n\nAGC - Serine\n\nCCA - Proline\n\nGGA - Glycine, Alanine\n\nUGC - Cysteine\n\nAGG - Arginine\n\nUG - (not a codon)\n\nCCG - Proline\n\nGGA - Glycine, Alanine\n\nAAG - Lysine\n\nCGC - Arginine\n\nUGC - Cysteine\n\nATG - Methionine\n\nAGU - Serine\n\nUGCU - (not a codon)\n\nGCU - Alanine\n\nGUC - Valine\n\nGGC - Glycine, Cysteine\n\nGCA - Alanine\n\nGCG - Alanine\n\nUCA - Serine\n\nAGG - Arginine\n\nUGC - Cysteine\n\nCCU - Proline\n\nACU - Threonine\n\nGCC - Alanine\n\nGGC - Glycine, Cysteine\n\nGUCU - (not a codon)\n\nACG - Threonine\n\nAGU - Serine\n\nCAG - Glutamine\n\nCCA - Proline\n\nAAG - Lysine\n\nU CU - (not a codon)\n\nUGA - Stop codon\n\nACG - Threonine\n\nUGG - Tryptophan\n\nACC - Threonine\n\nCCG - Proline\n\nACA - Threonine\n\nAUC - Isoleucine\n\nGUC - Valine\n\nUCC - Serine\n\nUGU - Cysteine\n\nGCU - Alanine\n\nGCG - Alanine\n\nGGU - Glycine\n\nGC G - (not a codon)\n\nGGU - Glycine\n\nGAG - Glutamic Acid\n\nAGA - Arginine\n\nGAC - Aspartic Acid\n\nGAG - Glutamic Acid\n\nGGC - Glycine, Cysteine\n\nGAC - Aspartic Acid\n\nAUU - Isoleucine\n\nGCG - Alanine\n\nUGC - Cysteine\n\nAGA - Arginine\n\nAUC - Isoleucine\n\nCAC - Histidine\n\nUUU - Phenylalanine\n\nACC - Threonine\n\nUGA - Stop codon\n\nUCC - Serine\n\nAGG - Arginine\n\nCUU - Leucine\n\nUCU - Serine\n\nGCU - Alanine\n\nGCG - Alanine\n\nAGA - Arginine\n\nAAC - Asparagine\n\nGAC - Aspartic Acid\n\nAUU - Isoleucine\n\nGAC - Aspartic Acid\n\nAUU - Isoleucine\n\nAGU - Serine\n\nGCG - Alanine\n\nCGU - Arginine\n\nGGG - Glycine, Glycine\n\nCGA - Arginine\n\nUG - (not a codon)\n\nUGC - Cysteine\n\nAGC - Serine\n\nGGC - Glycine, Cysteine\n\nTGG - Tryptophan\n\nCGG - Arginine\n\nCCG - Proline\n\nGCG - Alanine\n\nAGG - Arginine\n\nAGG - Arginine\n\nCGG - Arginine\n\nUG - (not a codon)\n\nCGC - Arginine\n\nCGG - Arginine\n\nCAC - Histidine\n\nUGC - Cysteine\n\nACU - Threonine\n\nGCC - Alanine\n\nUCC - Serine\n\nUAU - Tyrosine\n\nUUC - Phenylalanine\n\nGAU - Aspartic Acid\n\nCCC - Proline\n\nAAU - Asparagine\n\nGAG - Glutamic Acid\n\nGAC - Aspartic Acid\n\nGCC - Alanine\n\nUGG - Tryptophan\n\nAAG - Lysine\n\nGAU - Aspartic Acid\n\nCCC - Proline\n\nGCC - Alanine\n\nUGG - Tryptophan\n\nAGA - Arginine\n\nAGC - Serine\n\nUCA - Serine\n\nGCC - Alanine\n\nUGU - Cysteine\n\nGGC - Glycine, Cysteine\n\nCCG - Proline\n\nGAG - Glutamic Acid\n\nUGA - Stop codon\n\nWait a minute, this is getting too messy. Maybe I should use a tool to translate the sequence properly.\n\nAlternatively, I can look for stop codons in the mRNA sequence. Stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA.\n\nLooking at the mRNA sequence:\n\n- Around position 100: UGA (stop codon)\n\n- Around position 200: UGA (stop codon)\n\n- Around position 300: UGA (stop codon)\n\nWait, let's check more carefully.\n\nLooking for UGA, UAG, or UAA in the mRNA sequence.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n5' AUG UAC CCA UAC GAU GUC CAG AUU ACC GCA AAU GAC UCU GGA AGA AGU CCG CGG CCA GGAC ACA GUC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA UGC AGG UG CCG GGA AAG CGC UGC AUG AGU UGCU GCU GUC GGC GCA GCG UCA GGG UGC CUC ACU GCC GGC GUCU ACG AGU CAG CCA AAG UCU UGA ACG UGG ACC CCG ACA AUC GUC UCC UGU GCU GGC UGC GGG UG AAG AGA GAC GAG GGC GAC AUU GCG UGC AGA AUC CAC UUU ACC UGA UCC AGG CUU UCU GCU GCG AGA AAC GAC AUU GAC AUU AGU GCG CGU GGG CGA UG UGC AGC GGC UGG CGG CUU ACU GUG GCG CCG GCG AGG AGG CGG UG CGC CGG CAC UGC ACU GCC UCC UAU UUC GAU CCC AAU GAG GAC GCC UGG AAG GAU CCC GCC UGG AGA AGC UCA GCC UGU UUU GCG AGG AGA GCC CAG CGU UAA CGA UGG GGU CCC AGC AUU ACC CUC CCC GAG UGA 3'\n\nLooking for UGA, UAG, or UAA:\n\n- First UGA is at position around 100: UGA\n\n- Then UGA again around position 200: UGA\n\n- And another UGA around position 300: UGA\n\n- And finally, UGA at the end.\n\nWait, but in the context of the coding sequence, I need to see if any of these UGA are in-frame and act as premature stop codons.\n\nGiven that the sequence starts with AUG, which is the start codon, I need to see if any UGA appears before the expected end of the coding sequence.\n\nIf there's a UGA in the middle of the coding sequence, that would cause premature termination of translation.\n\nLooking more closely:\n\n- The first UGA is in the sequence: UCU UGA ACG UGG\n\n- UGA is in frame here, so this would cause premature termination.\n\n- There's another UGA later: UGA UCC AGG\n\n- Again, UGA is in frame.\n\n- And finally, UGA at the end.\n\nSo, it seems there are premature stop codons in the coding sequence, which is likely causing the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to truncated proteins that may be unstable or non-functional.\n\nTherefore, option C seems to be the correct answer: the ribosome is terminating translation early due to these premature stop codons.\n\nOption A mentions the lack of a linker sequence triggering proteolysis. While a linker can be important for protein stability, if there are premature stop codons, the protein might not even be translated properly, so this might not be the primary issue.\n\nOption B is confusing because tRNA doesn't recognize stop codons; release factors do. So, this option doesn't make much sense.\n\nOption D suggests a missense mutation in the HA tag sequence, but without knowing the exact sequence of the HA tag, it's hard to verify. However, given that there are premature stop codons in the coding sequence, that seems like a more plausible explanation for the lack of protein expression.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely reason for the inability to overexpress the GADD45G protein is the presence of premature stop codons in the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate translation early.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
