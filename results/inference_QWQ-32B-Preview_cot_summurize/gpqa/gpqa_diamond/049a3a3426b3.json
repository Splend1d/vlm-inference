                    "text": "Let's tackle these reactions step by step. I need to identify the suitable reagents A and B for the given transformations.\n\nFirst reaction:\n\nbutan-2-one + NaCN + A ---> 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile\n\nSo, starting with butan-2-one, which is also known as methyl ethyl ketone, and reacting it with sodium cyanide (NaCN). Then, with the addition of reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.\n\nI recall that in ketone chemistry, cyanide ion (CN-) can act as a nucleophile and attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of a cyanohydrin. The structure of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile matches that of a cyanohydrin derived from butan-2-one.\n\nThe general reaction for cyanohydrin formation is:\n\nR2C=O + CN- \u2192 R2C(OH)(CN)\n\nSo, butan-2-one (CH3CH2COCH3) reacting with CN- would give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile (CH3CH2COH(CN)).\n\nBut, in this reaction, there's an additional reagent A. I need to figure out what A is.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. A = NaHSO3\n\nB. A = H3O+\n\nC. A = H3O+\n\nD. A = NaHSO3\n\nSo, A could be either sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\n\nIn cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is often carried out in basic conditions, and then the product is acidified to stabilize it. Sodium bisulfite is sometimes used in organic synthesis to scavenge excess base or other impurities, but in this context, it might not be directly involved in the cyanohydrin formation.\n\nOn the other hand, H3O+ suggests acidification. So, perhaps after the cyanide addition, the mixture is acidified with H3O+ to protonate the oxygen and stabilize the cyanohydrin.\n\nBut looking at the options, both A and C have A as H3O+, and A and D have A as NaHSO3.\n\nI need to think carefully.\n\nActually, in cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is typically carried out in basic conditions, and then the product is acidified to precipitate or isolate it. So, perhaps A is H3O+ to acidify the mixture after the cyanide addition.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure, so I'll keep that in mind and move to the second reaction to see if that gives me more clues.\n\nSecond reaction:\n\n2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid\n\nHere, starting with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reacting it with B in water to form the corresponding carboxylic acid.\n\nSo, the conversion is from nitrile to carboxylic acid.\n\nI know that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, and this is often done under acidic or basic conditions.\n\nIn acidic conditions, hydrolysis of nitriles can be carried out using acids like hydrochloric acid (HCl) or acetic acid (CH3COOH).\n\nSimilarly, in basic conditions, using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is also possible, but in this case, B is reacted with water, so perhaps it's an acidic hydrolysis.\n\nLooking back at the options for B:\n\nA. B = CH3COOH\n\nB. B = HCl\n\nC. B = CH3COOH\n\nD. B = HCl\n\nSo, B could be either acetic acid (CH3COOH) or hydrochloric acid (HCl).\n\nI need to determine which one is suitable for this hydrolysis.\n\nBoth acids can be used for nitrile hydrolysis, but hydrochloric acid is more commonly used for this purpose. However, acetic acid can also be used, especially if milder conditions are desired.\n\nBut in this case, since it's specified that B is reacted with water, and both acids are soluble in water, either could work.\n\nPerhaps there's a specific reason to choose one over the other, but without more context, both seem plausible.\n\nNow, considering both reactions together:\n\nFor the first reaction, A could be H3O+ (which could be provided by an acid like HCl or CH3COOH), and for the second reaction, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH\n\nB. A = H3O+, B = HCl\n\nC. A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH\n\nD. A = NaHSO3, B = HCl\n\nGiven that A could be H3O+ and B could be either HCl or CH3COOH, options B and C are possible.\n\nBut in option A and D, A is NaHSO3, which I initially thought might not be directly involved in the cyanohydrin formation, but perhaps it serves another purpose.\n\nWait a minute, sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is sometimes used in organic synthesis to reduce nitriles to amides or amines, but in this case, we're forming a cyanohydrin, not reducing the nitrile.\n\nMoreover, in the first reaction, we're forming a cyanohydrin, and in the second reaction, we're converting the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.\n\nPerhaps there's a specific reason to choose NaHSO3 in the first step.\n\nAlternatively, NaHSO3 can be used as an antioxidant or to scavenge excess base in the reaction mixture.\n\nBut in this context, it's not entirely clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps A is H3O+, which would acidify the mixture after the cyanide addition, helping to stabilize the cyanohydrin.\n\nThen, for the second reaction, B could be either HCl or CH3COOH.\n\nBut to be more precise, perhaps looking up standard procedures for these transformations would help.\n\nUpon checking, cyanohydrin formation typically involves reacting a ketone with CN- under basic conditions, followed by acidification to protonate the oxygen.\n\nSo, A is likely H3O+, which is provided by an acid.\n\nThen, for the second reaction, hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid is often carried out using acid catalysts like HCl or H2SO4.\n\nSo, B is likely HCl.\n\nTherefore, option B seems most appropriate: A = H3O+ (implying an acid like HCl), B = HCl.\n\nOption C also has A = H3O+ and B = CH3COOH, which could also work, but HCl is more commonly used for nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nAdditionally, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, it could be provided by HCl, which would make sense if B is also HCl.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option B has A = H3O+ and B = HCl, while option C has A = H3O+ and B = CH3COOH.\n\nPerhaps both could work, but HCl is more standard for nitrile hydrolysis.\n\nHowever, the answer might expect the use of HCl for both steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps NaHSO3 has a specific role in the first step.\n\nUpon further consideration, sodium bisulfite can react with aldehydes and ketones to form addition products, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone that has already reacted with cyanide to form a cyanohydrin.\n\nPerhaps NaHSO3 is used to isolate the cyanohydrin by precipitating it or somehow facilitating its extraction.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, and based on standard procedures, I'll go with option B: A = H3O+ (implying an acid like HCl), B = HCl.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
