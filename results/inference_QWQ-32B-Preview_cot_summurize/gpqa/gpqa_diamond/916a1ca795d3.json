                    "text": "So I'm trying to figure out how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2 based on the information given about their eclipses and radial velocities. Let's see what I've got.\n\nFirst, both systems are binary star systems, meaning each has two stars orbiting around their common center of mass. The periods of their orbits are given: system_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has a period of 1 year. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses, which makes sense because in a binary system, eclipses occur when one star passes in front of the other from our perspective on Earth.\n\nAdditionally, there are spectroscopic observations that show sinusoidal variations in the radial velocities of the stars in each system. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s for the two stars, and for system_2, they are 15 km/s and 10 km/s.\n\nI need to find the mass ratio of system_1 to system_2, considering the mass of each system as the sum of the masses of its two stars.\n\nTo approach this, I recall that in a binary star system, the radial velocity amplitude of each star is related to its mass, the period of the orbit, and the semi-major axis of its orbit. The formula for the radial velocity amplitude (K) of a star in a binary system is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit,\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination angle of the orbit,\n\n- \\( P \\) is the orbital period.\n\nHowever, in binary systems where eclipses are observed, the inclination \\( i \\) is close to 90 degrees, meaning the orbit is edge-on, so \\( \\sin i \\) is approximately 1.\n\nAlso, in a binary system, the masses of the two stars are related to their semi-major axes by Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\]\n\nand the total mass of the system \\( M = m_1 + m_2 \\) is related to the orbital period and the sum of the semi-major axes by:\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{2 \\pi}{G} a^\\frac{3}{2} M^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\]\n\nWait, actually, the more precise form of Kepler's third law for binary systems is:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (m_1 + m_2)} a^3 \\]\n\nwhere \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis of one of the stars' orbits.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to relate the mass directly to the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nI remember that the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the mass of the companion star. Specifically, for each star in the binary system, its radial velocity amplitude is proportional to the mass of the other star.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{v}{1 + \\frac{m_1}{m_2}} \\]\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{v}{1 + \\frac{m_2}{m_1}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is some orbital speed related to the system.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the precise relationship between radial velocity amplitude and mass in binary systems.\n\nAfter a quick search, I find that the radial velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) for each star in a binary system is given by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{v \\sin i}{1 + \\frac{m}{M}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( v \\) is the orbital speed,\n\n- \\( i \\) is the inclination,\n\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the star,\n\n- \\( M \\) is the total mass of the system.\n\nBut I think there's a simpler relationship. Let's consider that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is related to the mass function of the system, but that might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the radial velocity amplitude is proportional to the mass of the companion star and inversely proportional to the total mass of the system.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the fact that the product of the mass and the radial velocity amplitude is constant for each system.\n\nActually, in binary systems, the masses are related to the radial velocity amplitudes by:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\]\n\nThis makes sense because the more massive star will have a smaller radial velocity amplitude, and vice versa.\n\nSo, for system_1, with \\( K_1 = 10 \\) km/s and \\( K_2 = 5 \\) km/s, the mass ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_{1a}}{m_{1b}} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \\]\n\nSimilarly, for system_2, with \\( K_1 = 15 \\) km/s and \\( K_2 = 10 \\) km/s, the mass ratio is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_{2a}}{m_{2b}} = \\frac{10}{15} \\approx 0.667 \\]\n\nNow, to find the total mass of each system, I need to express both masses in terms of one variable.\n\nFor system_1:\n\nLet \\( m_{1b} = m \\), then \\( m_{1a} = 0.5 m \\), so the total mass \\( M_1 = m_{1a} + m_{1b} = 0.5m + m = 1.5m \\).\n\nFor system_2:\n\nLet \\( m_{2b} = n \\), then \\( m_{2a} = 0.667 n \\), so the total mass \\( M_2 = m_{2a} + m_{2b} = 0.667n + n \\approx 1.667n \\).\n\nNow, I need to find the ratio \\( \\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \\frac{1.5m}{1.667n} \\).\n\nBut I don't know the values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). I need another equation to relate them.\n\nPerhaps I can use the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitudes to find the masses.\n\nI recall that the orbital period \\( P \\) is related to the masses and the semi-major axis \\( a \\) by Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (m_1 + m_2)} a^3 \\]\n\nAlso, the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the mass of the companion and the inclination angle:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{v \\sin i}{1 + \\frac{m}{M}} \\]\n\nBut since the systems are eclipsing binaries, the inclination is close to 90 degrees, so \\( \\sin i \\approx 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the mass-function, which relates the radial velocity amplitude, the period, and the mass function in a way that allows me to solve for the masses.\n\nThe mass function \\( f(m) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{K^3 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{m \\sin^3 i}{(1 + \\frac{m}{M})^2} \\]\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity amplitude is related to the mass of the companion and the orbital period.\n\nSpecifically, for star 1 in system_1:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{2 \\pi a_2 \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a_2 \\) is the semi-major axis of star 2.\n\nSimilarly, for star 2:\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{2 \\pi a_1 \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nBut since \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\) are related by the mass ratio:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} \\]\n\nSo, combining these, we can express the masses in terms of the radial velocity amplitudes and the period.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes is related to the total mass.\n\nWait, actually, I think there's a direct relationship between the total mass of the system, the period, and the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes.\n\nLet me try to derive that.\n\nFrom Kepler's laws, we have:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G (m_1 + m_2)} a^3 \\]\n\nAlso, the radial velocity amplitude is:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nAssuming \\( \\sin i = 1 \\), then:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a}{P} \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, solving for \\( a^3 \\):\n\n\\[ a^3 = \\frac{G (m_1 + m_2) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ a = \\left( \\frac{G (m_1 + m_2) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nPlugging this into the radial velocity equation:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G (m_1 + m_2) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G (m_1 + m_2) P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nwhere \\( M = m_1 + m_2 \\)\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi}{P} \\left( \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\]\n\nThis seems to be going in circles. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nI found a formula for the mass function in binary stars:\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{K^3 P}{2 \\pi G} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ f(m) = \\frac{m \\sin^3 i}{(1 + \\frac{m}{M})^2} \\]\n\nBut again, this seems too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that for a circular orbit, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is related to the mass of the companion and the orbital period by:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\]\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to look for a simpler relationship.\n\nI recall that in spectroscopic binary systems, the masses can be determined using the radial velocity curves and the orbital period.\n\nThe velocity semi-amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the mass of the companion and the orbital elements.\n\nSpecifically, for each star in the binary system:\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{v \\sin i}{1 + \\frac{m}{M}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the orbital speed, \\( i \\) is the inclination, \\( m \\) is the mass of the star, and \\( M \\) is the total mass.\n\nBut perhaps I should consider the center of mass concept.\n\nIn a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars.\n\nSo, \\( K \\propto \\frac{1}{m} \\)\n\nWait, more precisely, for star 1:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{v}{1 + \\frac{m_1}{m_2}} \\]\n\nand for star 2:\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{v}{1 + \\frac{m_2}{m_1}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( v \\) is the orbital speed.\n\nBut I think this is not accurate. Let me try to derive it properly.\n\nThe center of mass condition tells us that:\n\n\\[ m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( r_1 \\) and \\( r_2 \\) are the distances from each star to the center of mass.\n\nAlso, the total separation between the stars is \\( a = r_1 + r_2 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ m_1 r_1 = m_2 (a - r_1) \\]\n\n\\[ m_1 r_1 = m_2 a - m_2 r_1 \\]\n\n\\[ r_1 (m_1 + m_2) = m_2 a \\]\n\n\\[ r_1 = \\frac{m_2 a}{m_1 + m_2} \\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[ r_2 = \\frac{m_1 a}{m_1 + m_2} \\]\n\nNow, the radial velocity amplitude \\( K \\) is related to the orbital speed by \\( K = v \\sin i \\), assuming circular orbits and edge-on inclination.\n\nThe orbital speed \\( v \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ v = \\frac{2 \\pi r}{P} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ K = \\frac{2 \\pi r \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nFor star 1:\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_1 \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\n\\[ K_1 = \\frac{2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{m_2 a}{m_1 + m_2} \\right) \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nSimilarly, for star 2:\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{2 \\pi r_2 \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\n\\[ K_2 = \\frac{2 \\pi \\left( \\frac{m_1 a}{m_1 + m_2} \\right) \\sin i}{P} \\]\n\nNow, dividing \\( K_1 \\) by \\( K_2 \\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{m_2 a}{m_1 a} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \\frac{K_2}{K_1} \\]\n\nWhich is consistent with what I had earlier.\n\nNow, to find the total mass \\( M = m_1 + m_2 \\), I can express \\( m_1 \\) in terms of \\( m_2 \\):\n\n\\[ m_1 = \\frac{K_2}{K_1} m_2 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ M = m_1 + m_2 = \\frac{K_2}{K_1} m_2 + m_2 = m_2 \\left( \\frac{K_2}{K_1} + 1 \\right) \\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[ m_2 = \\frac{M K_1}{K_2 + K_1} \\]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nMaybe I can use Kepler's third law to relate the period and the total mass to the semi-major axis.\n\nFrom Kepler's third law:\n\n\\[ P^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M} a^3 \\]\n\nBut I also have \\( a = \\frac{G M P^2}{4 \\pi^2} \\), which doesn't seem right.
