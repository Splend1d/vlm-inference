                    "text": "So I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. We have a bunch of identical systems, like ten thousand of them, and in each system, there's a particle that can move along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i, where i is the imaginary unit, and sqrt means square root. And when we measure the position of these particles, they're only found between x=1 and x=3; nowhere else in that region.\n\nSo, the task is to find the numerical value of 'a'. The options are 0.6, 1.1, 0.85, and 0.35.\n\nFirst, I recall that in quantum mechanics, the wave function has to be normalized. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space has to be 1. So, the integral of the probability density over all space should equal 1.\n\nThe probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function, |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2.\n\nSo, I need to calculate |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 and then integrate it from x=1 to x=3, set that equal to 1, and solve for 'a'.\n\nGiven \u03c8(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i,\n\nFirst, find the complex conjugate of \u03c8(x), which is \u03c8*(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i.\n\nNow, |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = \u03c8(x) * \u03c8*(x) = [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i] * [(a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5*i]\n\nMultiplying these out:\n\n= (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (0.5)^2\n\nBecause the cross terms (-0.5*i * a / sqrt(1 + x)) and (0.5*i * a / sqrt(1 + x)) cancel each other out.\n\nSo, |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25\n\nNow, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |\u03c8(x)|\u00b2 dx should equal 1.\n\nSo, \u222b from 1 to 3 of [(a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) + 0.25] dx = 1\n\nLet me compute this integral.\n\nFirst, split the integral into two parts:\n\n\u222b from 1 to 3 of (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) dx + \u222b from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 1\n\nCompute the first integral: \u222b (a\u00b2 / (1 + x)) dx from 1 to 3.\n\nLet\u2019s do a substitution: let u = 1 + x, then du = dx.\n\nWhen x=1, u=2; when x=3, u=4.\n\nSo, \u222b from u=2 to u=4 of (a\u00b2 / u) du = a\u00b2 * ln(u) from 2 to 4 = a\u00b2 * (ln(4) - ln(2)) = a\u00b2 * ln(4/2) = a\u00b2 * ln(2)\n\nSecond integral: \u222b from 1 to 3 of 0.25 dx = 0.25 * (3 - 1) = 0.5\n\nSo, a\u00b2 * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1\n\nNow, solve for a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 * ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5\n\na\u00b2 = 0.5 / ln(2)\n\nNow, calculate ln(2). Natural log of 2 is approximately 0.6931.\n\nSo, a\u00b2 = 0.5 / 0.6931 \u2248 0.720\n\nThen, a \u2248 sqrt(0.720) \u2248 0.848\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.6\n\nB. 1.1\n\nC. 0.85\n\nD. 0.35\n\n0.848 is closest to 0.85, which is option C.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 0.85\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.85} \\]"
