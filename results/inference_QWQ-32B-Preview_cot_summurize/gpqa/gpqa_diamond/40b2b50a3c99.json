                    "text": "So I've got this question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. It's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, it talks about isomers, which are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements. There are two types mentioned: constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have the same formula but different connectivity in their structures, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements.\n\nThen, it mentions tautomerism, which I think is a type of isomerism where molecules can rapidly interconvert by the migration of a proton or some other functional group. So, tautomerism is when a molecule can exist in different forms that are rapidly interchanging.\n\nThe question is asking to identify which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism, and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.\n\nLet's tackle part A first: identifying which compound does not show tautomerism.\n\nBenzoquinone is a compound with a benzene ring and two ketone groups. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups.\n\nI need to think about whether these compounds can exist in different tautomeric forms. Tautomerism often involves the migration of a proton, leading to different arrangements of double bonds and single bonds.\n\nFor benzoquinone, I know that ketones can undergo tautomerism to enols, where a proton moves from an alpha-carbon to the oxygen of the ketone, forming a double bond between the carbon and oxygen. So, benzoquinone might be able to exist in an enolic form.\n\nSimilarly, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, so it might also be able to exist in enolic forms through tautomerism.\n\nBut the question is which one does not show tautomerism. Maybe one of them is more resistant to tautomerism due to its structure.\n\nBenzoquinone has a conjugated system in the benzene ring, which might stabilize the ketone groups and make tautomerism less favorable. On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, which might allow for more tautomeric forms.\n\nWait, but generally, ketones can tautomerize to enols, so both might show some degree of tautomerism. Maybe one of them doesn't show significant tautomerism under normal conditions.\n\nI recall that aromatic compounds like benzoquinone have their ketone groups tied into the aromatic system, which might make tautomerism less likely because it would disrupt the aromaticity. Enol forms might not be as stable as the ketone form in this case.\n\nIn contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't have aromatic stabilization, so its ketone groups might be more prone to tautomerism.\n\nTherefore, perhaps benzoquinone does not show significant tautomerism due to aromatic stabilization, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.\n\nSo, for part A, A = benzoquinone.\n\nNow, part B: identifying which compound shows optical isomerism.\n\nOptical isomerism occurs when a molecule has a chiral center, meaning it has a carbon atom bonded to four different groups, and thus exists as non-superimposable mirror images, or enantiomers.\n\nLet's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.\n\nFirst, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CHOH-COOH, and attaching a methyl group to the carboxylic acid would make it CH3-CHOH-CO-OCH3.\n\nLooking at the carbon atoms, the second carbon is connected to H, OH, CH3, and COOCH3, which are four different groups, so it's a chiral center. Therefore, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate should have optical isomers.\n\nNext, dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, specifically trans-butenedioic acid. Dimethyl fumarate would have two methyl groups attached to the carboxylic acids, so it's (CH3)2C:CH(COOCH3)2.\n\nIn this molecule, the double bond is between two carbon atoms, and both carbons are part of carboxylic esters and methyl groups. Since it's a trans isomer, the groups are arranged with the methyl groups on one side and the ester groups on the other.\n\nTo have optical isomerism, there needs to be a chiral center, which typically requires a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\nIn dimethyl fumarate, the double-bonded carbons are part of the carboxylic esters and methyl groups, but I need to check if any carbon atoms have four different substituents.\n\nLooking at the structure:\n\nO\n\n||\n\nO\n\n|\n\nC\n\n=\n\nC\n\n|\n\nO\n\n|\n\nO\n\nWith methyl groups attached to the oxygen atoms.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to draw it properly.\n\nFumarate is Z-ethene-1,2-dioic acid, but actually, fumarate is the trans isomer, so it's E-ethene-1,2-dioic acid.\n\nSo, dimethyl fumarate would be:\n\nO\n\n||\n\nO\n\n|\n\nC\n\n=\n\nC\n\n|\n\nO\n\n|\n\nO\n\nWith methyl groups attached to the oxygen atoms, making them esters.\n\nSo, it's O\n\n||\n\nOCH3\n\n|\n\nC\n\n=\n\nC\n\n|\n\nOCH3\n\n|\n\nO\n\nEach carbon in the double bond is connected to an oxygen atom and a methyl group on one side, and the other carbon on the other side.\n\nTherefore, these carbons have two identical groups (OCH3 and O), so they are not chiral centers.\n\nHence, dimethyl fumarate does not have a chiral center and should not exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nIn contrast, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center and should exhibit optical isomerism.\n\nTherefore, for part B, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct choice is:\n\nC. A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
