                    "text": "To identify the compound C9H11NO2 using the given data, we need to analyze both the IR and 1H NMR spectra provided. Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Interpret the IR Spectrum\n\nThe IR spectrum shows:\n\n- Medium to strong intensity bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\n- A strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n1. **Bands at 3420 cm\u207b\u00b9 and 3325 cm\u207b\u00b9:**\n\n   - These bands are likely due to N-H stretching vibrations, indicating the presence of an amine or an amide group.\n\n2. **Strong band at 1720 cm\u207b\u00b9:**\n\n   - This band is characteristic of a C=O stretching vibration, suggesting the presence of a carbonyl group.\n\nCombining these observations, the compound likely contains a carbonyl group and an amine or amide group.\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the 1H NMR Spectrum\n\nThe 1H NMR spectrum shows:\n\n- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H)\n\n- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)\n\n- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H)\n\n- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n\n- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)\n\n#### Analysis:\n\n1. **1.20 ppm (t, 3H):**\n\n   - This signal corresponds to a methyl group (CH\u2083) attached to a carbon atom, likely an ethyl group.\n\n2. **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H):**\n\n   - A broad singlet at this chemical shift could indicate an exchangeable proton, such as an amino group (NH\u2082).\n\n3. **4.5 ppm (q, 2H):**\n\n   - This signal corresponds to a methylene group (CH\u2082) adjacent to an oxygen atom, typical of an ethoxy group.\n\n4. **7.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n\n   - This signal suggests aromatic protons, possibly ortho to a substituent.\n\n5. **8.0 ppm (d, 2H):**\n\n   - Another set of aromatic protons, also likely ortho to a substituent.\n\n### Step 3: Correlate IR and NMR Data\n\nFrom the IR spectrum, we have evidence for a carbonyl group and an amine or amide group. The NMR spectrum suggests the presence of an ethyl group, an amino group, and aromatic protons.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on the spectral data:\n\n**A. Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**\n\n- Structure: C\u2086H\u2084(CO\u2082C\u2082H\u2085)(NH\u2082)\n\n- IR: Should show N-H bands (amine) and C=O band (carbonyl).\n\n- NMR:\n\n  - CH\u2083 of ethyl group: likely around 1.20 ppm (t).\n\n  - CH\u2082 of ethyl group: likely around 4.2-4.5 ppm (q).\n\n  - NH\u2082: broad singlet around 4.0 ppm.\n\n  - Aromatic protons: two sets of doublets around 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, consistent with para-substituted benzene.\n\nThis matches the given NMR data.\n\n**B. 3-Ethoxybenzamide**\n\n- Structure: C\u2086H\u2083(CO NH\u2082)(O C\u2082H\u2085)\n\n- IR: Should show N-H band (amide) and C=O band.\n\n- NMR:\n\n  - CH\u2083 of ethoxy group: around 1.20 ppm (t).\n\n  - CH\u2082 of ethoxy group: around 4.0 ppm (q).\n\n  - NH of amide: broad singlet, possibly around 8 ppm.\n\n  - Aromatic protons: patterns would depend on substitution.\n\nThe NMR data shows a signal at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), which might not align well with the expected chemical shift for the CH\u2082 in the ethoxy group in this compound.\n\n**C. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**\n\n- Structure: HCONH-C\u2086H\u2084(O C\u2082H\u2085)\n\n- IR: N-H band (amide) and C=O band.\n\n- NMR:\n\n  - CH\u2083 of ethoxy group: around 1.20 ppm (t).\n\n  - CH\u2082 of ethoxy group: around 4.0 ppm (q).\n\n  - NH of amide: broad singlet, possibly around 8 ppm.\n\n  - Aromatic protons: patterns would depend on substitution.\n\nAgain, the CH\u2082 signal at 4.5 ppm doesn't align well with expected shifts.\n\n**D. 4-aminophenyl propionate**\n\n- Structure: C\u2086H\u2084(NH\u2082)(CO\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2082CH\u2083)\n\n- IR: N-H band (amine) and C=O band.\n\n- NMR:\n\n  - CH\u2083 of propyl group: around 0.9 ppm (t).\n\n  - CH\u2082 of propyl group: around 1.2 ppm (m).\n\n  - CH of propyl group: around 2.3 ppm (t).\n\n  - NH\u2082: broad singlet around 4.0 ppm.\n\n  - Aromatic protons: two sets of doublets around 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.\n\nHowever, the given NMR shows a CH\u2083 at 1.20 ppm, which might be overlapping with propyl group signals, but the absence of other propyl group signals makes this less likely.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption A, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, best matches both the IR and NMR data provided. The presence of an ethyl group, an amino group, and aromatic protons in the expected chemical shifts supports this identification.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
