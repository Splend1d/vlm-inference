                    "text": "So I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds in space and how they affect the light from quasars. Specifically, it's about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A. 1.9, B. 2.4, C. 3, and D. 1.2.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Neutral hydrogen clouds absorb light at a specific wavelength called the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. This absorption occurs because the hydrogen atoms absorb photons at that wavelength, which corresponds to the energy needed to transition an electron from the ground state to the first excited state.\n\nNow, because of the expansion of the universe, there's a phenomenon called redshift. Redshift happens when light from a distant object is shifted to longer wavelengths as the object moves away from us. The amount of redshift is related to the object's distance and the rate of expansion of the universe.\n\nIn this case, the neutral hydrogen clouds are located at certain redshifts, and their absorption of Lyman alpha photons affects the light from background quasars. To detect these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes, the wavelength of the absorbed light needs to fall within the optical range that these telescopes can observe.\n\nOptical telescopes typically operate in the wavelength range from about 300 to 1100 nanometers (nm), which corresponds to about 3000 to 11000 Angstroms. So, the absorbed light needs to be within this range for detection.\n\nThe Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. However, because of redshift, this wavelength can be stretched into the optical range.\n\nThe formula for redshift is:\n\nz = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength\n\nWhere z is the redshift, the observed wavelength is the wavelength we see after redshift, and the rest wavelength is the original wavelength before redshift.\n\nIn this case, the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and we want the observed wavelength to be within the optical range of 3000 to 11000 Angstroms.\n\nSo, to find the lower limit on redshift, we need to find the smallest z such that the observed wavelength is at the lower end of the optical range, say 3000 Angstroms.\n\nLet's plug in the numbers:\n\nz = (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1784 / 1216 \u2248 1.466\n\nWait, but that's not one of the options. Maybe I need to consider the upper end of the optical range to find the lower limit of redshift. Let's try with 11000 Angstroms.\n\nz = (11000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 (11000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 9784 / 1216 \u2248 8.04\n\nThat's way higher than any of the options. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the absorption lines are detected in the optical range, meaning that the Lyman alpha wavelength has been redshifted into the optical window.\n\nSo, if the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and it's redshifted to, say, 4000 Angstroms, which is in the optical range, then:\n\nz = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength\n\nz = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 (4000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 2784 / 1216 \u2248 2.29\n\nThat's roughly 2.3, which corresponds to option B. 2.4.\n\nBut let's check with another wavelength in the optical range to see if this is consistent.\n\nLet's try with observed wavelength of 5000 Angstroms:\n\nz = (5000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 (5000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 3784 / 1216 \u2248 3.11\n\nThat's higher than 2.3.\n\nAnd with 3000 Angstroms:\n\nz = (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1784 / 1216 \u2248 1.466\n\nThat's lower than 2.3.\n\nSo, it seems that for the observed wavelength to be at the lower end of the optical range (around 3000 Angstroms), the redshift would be about 1.47, which is lower than option D. 1.2.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 1.47 is higher than 1.2.\n\nBut option D is 1.2, which is less than 1.47.\n\nI think I need to consider that ground-based optical telescopes cannot observe wavelengths below a certain value due to atmospheric absorption.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet light below about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), so optical telescopes on the ground can't see wavelengths shorter than that.\n\nTherefore, to detect the Lyman alpha absorption lines, the redshifted wavelength needs to be greater than 3000 Angstroms.\n\nSo, setting the observed wavelength to 3000 Angstroms:\n\nz = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength\n\nz = (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1.466\n\nBut 1.466 is not among the options, and it's higher than option D. 1.2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the absorption lines need to be in a part of the spectrum that is accessible to optical telescopes, which is above 3000 Angstroms, but perhaps there's a specific requirement for the detection.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the atmosphere's transparency window.\n\nOptical telescopes on the ground can observe from about 300 nm (ultraviolet) to about 1100 nm (near-infrared). However, the atmosphere absorbs wavelengths below about 300 nm, so the lower limit is around 300 nm or 3000 Angstroms.\n\nGiven that, the Lyman alpha wavelength of 1216 Angstroms needs to be redshifted to above 3000 Angstroms to be detectable.\n\nSo, z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength\n\nz = (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1.466\n\nBut 1.466 is not among the options, and it's higher than option D. 1.2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use a different formula for redshift.\n\nSometimes, redshift is defined as z = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest - 1\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, z = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest - 1\n\nThen, z = 3000 / 1216 - 1 \u2248 2.46 - 1 = 1.46\n\nSame result as before.\n\nSo, z \u2248 1.466\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options.\n\nPerhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about this differently.\n\nThe Lyman alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame.\n\nDue to redshift, this wavelength is stretched to \u03bb_obs = \u03bb_rest * (1 + z)\n\nWe need \u03bb_obs > 3000 Angstroms to be detectable with ground-based optical telescopes.\n\nSo, 1216 * (1 + z) > 3000\n\nThen, (1 + z) > 3000 / 1216 \u2248 2.466\n\nTherefore, z > 1.466\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nBut none of the options match this value directly.\n\nHowever, option B is 2.4, which is higher than 1.466.\n\nWait, maybe they are considering the upper limit of the optical range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the question.\n\nThe question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nSo, the smallest redshift at which the absorption line enters the optical window is when \u03bb_obs = 3000 Angstroms, which corresponds to z \u2248 1.466\n\nBut since this is not matching any of the options, maybe I need to consider that the absorption lines need to be within a specific part of the optical spectrum where telescopes are most sensitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the absorption lines are detectable only above a certain wavelength due to atmospheric transparency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the Lyman alpha line is being redshifted into the optical window, and the lower limit is when it just enters the observable range.\n\nIn that case, z = (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1.466\n\nBut since that doesn't match any options, maybe I need to consider a different rest wavelength or a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the absorption lines are detected in the optical spectrum, and I need to find the redshift where the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the optical window.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the optical window is from about 300 nm to 1100 nm, the lower limit would be when \u03bb_obs = 3000 Angstroms, giving z \u2248 1.466\n\nBut since that's not matching any options, maybe there's a different way to interpret this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the atmosphere's cutoff at around 3100 Angstroms due to the atmospheric extinction.\n\nIn that case, setting \u03bb_obs = 3100 Angstroms:\n\nz = (3100 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1.55\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the absorption lines need to be redshifted to a wavelength where they can be effectively observed, perhaps above 3500 Angstroms to avoid atmospheric absorption.\n\nLet's try \u03bb_obs = 3500 Angstroms:\n\nz = (3500 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 2284 / 1216 \u2248 1.876\n\nStill not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the absorption lines need to be redshifted to a wavelength where they are not overlapping with other atmospheric emissions or absorptions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the Lyman alpha line is being redshifted to the sensitivity range of optical telescopes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the formula used.\n\nLet me check the redshift formula again.\n\nThe standard formula is z = (\u03bb_obs - \u03bb_rest) / \u03bb_rest\n\nAlternatively, z = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest - 1\n\nUsing either, I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in cosmology, redshift is defined differently, but for these purposes, the formula should hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the absorption lines are detected in emission, but that doesn't make sense because they are absorptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the inverse relation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that z = \u03bb_obs / \u03bb_rest - 1\n\nSo, z = \u03bb_obs / 1216 - 1\n\nAnd I need to find the smallest z such that \u03bb_obs >= 3000 Angstroms.\n\nSo, z >= (3000 / 1216) - 1 \u2248 2.466 - 1 = 1.466\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the atmosphere's cutoff at a different wavelength.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the telescopes can observe down to 4000 Angstroms effectively.\n\nLet's try \u03bb_obs = 4000 Angstroms:\n\nz = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 2784 / 1216 \u2248 2.29\n\nThat's close to option B. 2.4\n\nAlternatively, if I set \u03bb_obs = 4100 Angstroms:\n\nz = (4100 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 2884 / 1216 \u2248 2.37\n\nCloser to 2.4\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the telescopes can observe down to 3500 Angstroms.\n\nAt \u03bb_obs = 3500 Angstroms:\n\nz = (3500 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 2284 / 1216 \u2248 1.876\n\nStill not matching 2.4\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the rest wavelength.\n\nIs the Lyman alpha wavelength exactly 1216 Angstroms?\n\nActually, the exact value is 1215.67 Angstroms, but using 1216 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the impact of the Earth's atmosphere more carefully.\n\nThe Earth's atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet light below approximately 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), but there are also absorptions in the optical range, such as the Lyman-alpha forest, but that's in the context of the intergalactic medium, not the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the absorption lines need to be redshifted beyond the atmospheric absorption lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question itself.\n\nThe question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which needs to be redshifted into the optical window (above approximately 3000 Angstroms), the calculation z = (3000 - 1216) / 1216 \u2248 1.466 seems correct.\n\nHowever, since 1.466 is not among the options, and the closest option is D. 1.2, which is lower than 1.466, that would imply that a redshift of 1.2 would redshift the Lyman alpha line to:\n\n\u03bb_obs = 1216 * (1 + 1.2) = 1216 * 2.2 = 2675.2 Angstroms\n\nWhich is below 3000 Angstroms, and thus not detectable with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nTherefore, option D. 1.2 cannot be the correct lower limit because at z=1.2, the absorption line would still be at 2675 Angstroms, which is below the atmospheric cutoff.\n\nTherefore, the lower limit must be higher than 1.2.\n\nOption A is 1.9, which would correspond to:\n\n\u03bb_obs = 1216 * (1 + 1.9) = 1216 * 2.9 = 3526.4 Angstroms\n\nWhich is above 3000 Angstroms and within the optical range.\n\nOption B is 2.4:\n\n\u03bb_obs = 1216 * (1 + 2.4) = 1216 * 3.4 = 4134.4 Angstroms\n\nAlso within the optical range.\n\nOption C is 3:\n\n\u03bb_obs = 1216 * (1 + 3) = 1216 * 4 = 4864 Angstroms\n\nStill within the optical range.\n\nBut the question is asking for the lower limit, meaning the smallest redshift at which the absorption line is detectable with optical telescopes.\n\nFrom earlier calculations, that would be z > 1.466\n\nAmong the options, option D. 1.2 is below this limit, so it's not sufficient.\n\nOption A. 1.9 is above 1.466, as are options B and C.\n\nTherefore, the lower limit should be at least 1.9.\n\nBut why is option B. 2.4 presented as a choice?\n\nPerhaps there is a miscalculation or misunderstanding in the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the atmosphere's transparency window more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the absorption lines are not just above 3000 Angstroms but need to be in a region where the atmospheric transmission is high.\n\nHowever, without more specific information, it's difficult to determine the exact reasoning behind the options provided.\n\nGiven the calculations, the lower limit on redshift should be approximately 1.466, meaning that any redshift above this value should allow the absorption lines to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.\n\nAmong the options, A. 1.9 is the smallest value that exceeds this lower limit.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A. 1.9\n\nHowever, option B. 2.4 is also above the lower limit, but it's higher than necessary.\n\nSimilarly, options C. 3 and D. 1.2 are above and below the lower limit, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A. 1.9\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.9} \\]"
