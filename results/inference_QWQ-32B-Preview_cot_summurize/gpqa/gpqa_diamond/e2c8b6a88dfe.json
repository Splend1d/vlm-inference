                    "text": "So I've got this problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. It's a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nOkay, so there's a supernova in our galaxy, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the galaxy. Both the ejecta and the galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the center of the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame.\n\nThe note says I can ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution of the galaxy, which simplifies things a lot. So, no need to worry about those factors.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the ejecta's frame and the galaxy's frame. Since both are inertial frames, I can use special relativity to relate observations in one frame to the other.\n\nFrom the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s. Wait, is that correct?\n\nActually, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up directly because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. But since the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light (60,000 km/s is about one-fifth of the speed of light, which is 300,000 km/s), I need to be careful.\n\nLet me recall the velocity addition formula in special relativity. If one object is moving at velocity u in one frame, and that frame is moving at velocity v relative to another frame, the velocity u' of the object in the second frame is given by:\n\nu' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/c\u00b2)\n\nBut in this case, I need to consider the relative velocity between the ejecta and the galaxy.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about this differently. Since both frames are inertial, and the ejecta sees the galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at 60,000 km/s, adjusted for relativistic effects.\n\nActually, the relativistic velocity addition formula is probably necessary here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- In the galaxy's frame, let's say the ejecta has velocity v towards the galaxy.\n\n- In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy has velocity u towards the ejecta.\n\nAccording to the velocity addition formula:\n\nu = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2)\n\nWait, I'm getting confused with the notation. Let me try to clarify.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- The galaxy's frame as S.\n\n- The ejecta's frame as S'.\n\n- The velocity of S' relative to S is v (ejecta moving towards the galaxy).\n\n- In S', the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u.\n\nSo, u is related to v by the velocity addition formula:\n\nu = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2)\n\nBut in this case, since S' is moving towards S at v, and in S', the galaxy is moving towards S' at u, which is the same as u' in the formula.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that in S, the galaxy is at rest, and the ejecta is moving towards it at v.\n\nIn S', the ejecta is at rest, and the galaxy is moving towards it at u.\n\nThen, the relationship between u and v is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:\n\nu = v / (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2)\n\nI think that's better.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of relativistic Doppler shift or time dilation, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider time dilation. Since time passes differently in different inertial frames moving relative to each other.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. I need to find out how much distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame during that time.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the time that corresponds to those 50 seconds in the galaxy's frame.\n\nIn special relativity, time dilation is given by:\n\nt' = t / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere t is the time in the stationary frame (galaxy's frame), t' is the time in the moving frame (ejecta's frame), v is the relative velocity, and c is the speed of light.\n\nBut in this case, I think I need to relate the times in the two frames.\n\nWait, perhaps I should solve for t in terms of t'.\n\nGiven that t' = t / gamma, where gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), then t = t' * gamma.\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the time t is longer than in the ejecta's frame by a factor of gamma.\n\nGiven that, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame would be v * t, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame.\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nSo, distance = v * t = v * (t' * gamma)\n\nGiven that t' is 50 seconds, and v is 60,000 km/s, but wait, is v equal to 60,000 km/s in the galaxy's frame?\n\nI think there's some confusion here.\n\nFrom the problem, \"from the reference frame of the ejecta, the center of the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it.\"\n\nSo, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Therefore, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at some velocity v.\n\nI need to find v, the velocity in the galaxy's frame.\n\nGiven the relativistic velocity addition formula, u = v / (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2), where u is the velocity of the galaxy in the ejecta's frame, and v is the velocity of the ejecta in the galaxy's frame.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nThen, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, which is related to u by the formula:\n\nv = (u + v') / (1 + (u * v')/c\u00b2)\n\nBut this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept that in special relativity, velocities are not simply added as in classical mechanics.\n\nI recall that in the case of approaching objects, the relative velocity is higher due to relativistic effects.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the relativistic formula for closing speed.\n\nUpon looking it up, the relativistic closing speed between two objects approaching each other is given by:\n\nw = (v + u) / (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere v and u are the speeds of the two objects in the same direction.\n\nBut in this case, since both are moving towards each other, I think this applies.\n\nSo, if in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v, and the galaxy is at rest, then the relative speed between them is v.\n\nBut from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nSo, according to the formula, u = v / (1 - v/c), because they are moving towards each other.\n\nWait, I think I have the formula wrong.\n\nActually, the relativistic velocity addition formula for objects moving towards each other is:\n\nu' = (u + v) / (1 + (u * v)/c\u00b2)\n\nIn this case, since the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u in the ejecta's frame, and the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v in the galaxy's frame, then u' would be the velocity of the galaxy in the ejecta's frame, which is given as u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nSuppose in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at velocity v.\n\nThen, in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at velocity u.\n\nThe relationship between u and v is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula.\n\nSpecifically, u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2), where u' is the velocity of the galaxy in the ejecta's frame.\n\nBut in this case, since the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u in the ejecta's frame, and the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v in the galaxy's frame, perhaps u = v.\n\nBut I know that's not correct because of relativistic effects.\n\nWait, maybe I should set u' = 0, since in the galaxy's frame, the galaxy is at rest.\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nI need to find v in terms of u.\n\nLet me try to solve for v in terms of u.\n\nGiven that u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2), and in this case, u' is the velocity of the galaxy in the ejecta's frame, which is -u (since they are moving towards each other).\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nThen, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v.\n\nAccording to the relativistic velocity addition formula, u = v / (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2)\n\nWait, I think I have it backwards.\n\nActually, the correct formula is:\n\nu = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere u' is the velocity of the galaxy in the ejecta's frame.\n\nBut in this case, u' = -u, because if the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta, it's in the opposite direction.\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the signs.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the positive direction is from the ejecta towards the galaxy.\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v (positive).\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u (positive).\n\nThen, according to the velocity addition formula:\n\nu = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2)\n\nBut what is u'?\n\nu' is the velocity of the galaxy in the ejecta's frame, which is u.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nI think I need to consider the relative velocity between the two frames.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.\n\nLet me consider time dilation directly.\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame, time is dilated by a factor of gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2), where v is the speed of the ejecta relative to the galaxy.\n\nSo, t = t' * gamma, where t is the time in the galaxy's frame, and t' is the time in the ejecta's frame.\n\nThe distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is then d = v * t = v * t' * gamma.\n\nBut I don't know v yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express gamma in terms of u, the speed seen in the ejecta's frame.\n\nI think I need to relate u and v.\n\nLet me look up the relativistic velocity transformation.\n\nAccording to the Lorentz transformation, the velocity in one frame is related to the velocity in another frame by:\n\nu_x = (v + u'_x) / (1 + (v * u'_x)/c\u00b2)\n\nWhere u_x is the velocity in frame S, u'_x is the velocity in frame S', and v is the relative velocity between the frames.\n\nIn this case, in the ejecta's frame (S'), the galaxy is moving towards it at u = 60,000 km/s.\n\nIn the galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v.\n\nSo, u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2)\n\nBut what is u'?\n\nIn the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at u, so u' should be -u, because directions are opposite.\n\nWait, no. If the galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at u in the ejecta's frame, then u' = -u.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to plug in the values.\n\nGiven that u = 60,000 km/s, and c = 300,000 km/s.\n\nThen, u/c = 0.2, and u\u00b2/c\u00b2 = 0.04.\n\nNow, the formula is u = (v + u') / (1 + (v * u')/c\u00b2)\n\nAssuming u' = -u, then:\n\nu = (v - u) / (1 - (v * u)/c\u00b2)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at u, and in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the galaxy at v.\n\nThen, the relationship between u and v is:\n\nu = v / (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2)\n\nI think that's the correct relationship.\n\nSo, u = v / (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2)\n\nNow, I can solve for v in terms of u.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nu * (1 + (v * u)/c\u00b2) = v\n\nu + (u * v * u)/c\u00b2 = v\n\nu + (u\u00b2 * v)/c\u00b2 = v\n\nNow, bring terms with v to one side:\n\nv - (u\u00b2 * v)/c\u00b2 = u\n\nFactor v:\n\nv (1 - (u\u00b2)/c\u00b2) = u\n\nTherefore, v = u / (1 - (u\u00b2)/c\u00b2)\n\nWait, that looks familiar. It's similar to the Lorentz factor.\n\nGiven that, v = u / (1 - (u\u00b2)/c\u00b2)\n\nNow, plug in u = 60,000 km/s and c = 300,000 km/s.\n\nFirst, calculate u/c:\n\nu/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2\n\nThen, (u/c)\u00b2 = 0.04\n\nSo, v = 0.2 c / (1 - 0.04) = (0.2 c) / 0.96 = (0.2 / 0.96) c\n\nCalculate 0.2 / 0.96:\n\n0.2 / 0.96 = 1/4.8 \u2248 0.208333...\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.208333 c\n\nNow, convert that to km/s:\n\nv \u2248 0.208333 * 300,000 km/s \u2248 62,500 km/s\n\nSo, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at approximately 62,500 km/s towards the galaxy.\n\nNow, I need to find the distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.\n\nFirst, find the time in the galaxy's frame corresponding to 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.\n\nTime dilation formula:\n\nt' = t / gamma\n\nWhere t' is the proper time (time in the moving frame, ejecta's frame), t is the time in the stationary frame (galaxy's frame), and gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2)\n\nSo, t = t' * gamma\n\nFirst, calculate gamma:\n\ngamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v\u00b2/c\u00b2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (62,500)^2 / (300,000)^2)\n\nCalculate v/c:\n\nv/c = 62,500 / 300,000 \u2248 0.208333\n\nThen, (v/c)^2 \u2248 0.043402778\n\nSo, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.043402778) \u2248 1 / sqrt(0.956597222) \u2248 1 / 0.97805 \u2248 1.0223\n\nTherefore, t = 50 s * 1.0223 \u2248 51.115 s\n\nNow, the distance traveled by the ejecta in the galaxy's frame is:\n\nd = v * t \u2248 62,500 km/s * 51.115 s \u2248 3,194,687.5 km\n\nBut that doesn't match any of the given options. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating v.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nv = u / (1 - (u\u00b2)/c\u00b2) = 0.2 c / (1 - 0.04) = 0.2 c / 0.96 \u2248 0.208333 c \u2248 62,500 km/s\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nThen, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.208333\u00b2) \u2248 1 / sqrt(0.956597) \u2248 1.0223, which also seems correct.\n\nThen, t = 50 s * 1.0223 \u2248 51.115 s\n\nAnd d = 62,500 km/s * 51.115 s \u2248 3,194,687.5 km\n\nBut the options are:\n\nA. 2,880,000 km\n\nB. 3,060,000 km\n\nC. 3,000,000 km\n\nD. 2,940,000 km\n\nNone of which match my calculation.\n\n"
