                    "text": "So I have this problem here about finding the expectation value of an electron's spin along the y-direction. The electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find <S_y>. The matrix for \u03c3_y is given as:\n\n\u03c3_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nAnd I know that S_y = (\u0127/2) * \u03c3_y.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what the spin state is. It's given as (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector:\n\n|\u03c8> = [ 3i, 4 ]^T\n\nBut I should probably normalize this vector because spin states are usually normalized. To normalize it, I need to find the norm of the vector and then divide each component by that norm.\n\nThe norm is:\n\n||\u03c8|| = sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) ) = sqrt( 9 + 16 ) = sqrt(25) = 5\n\nSo the normalized state is:\n\n|\u03c8> = (1/5) [ 3i, 4 ]^T = [ (3i)/5, 4/5 ]^T\n\nNow, the expectation value of S_y is <S_y> = <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8>\n\nSince S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y, I can write:\n\n<\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>\n\nSo I need to compute <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>\n\nFirst, let's find \u03c3_y |\u03c8>\n\n\u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] [ (3i)/5, 4/5 ]^T\n\n= [ 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ]^T\n\n= [ -4i/5, 3i^2/5 ]^T\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this becomes:\n\n= [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\nNow, <\u03c8| is the conjugate transpose of |\u03c8>:\n\n<\u03c8| = [ -(3i)/5, 4/5 ]\n\nSo, <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -(3i)/5, 4/5 ] [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\n= ( -(3i)/5 )*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)\n\n= (12i^2)/25 + (-12)/25\n\nSince i^2 = -1, this is:\n\n= (12*(-1))/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nTherefore, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nBut looking at the options, there's a positive and negative version of this. Wait, let me check my calculations again.\n\nLet me recompute <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8>\n\n<\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -(3i)/5, 4/5 ] [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\n= ( -(3i)/5 )*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)\n\n= (12i^2)/25 + (-12/25)\n\n= (12*(-1))/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nSo <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nBut the options have 12\u0127/25 and -12\u0127/25. So perhaps I made a sign error somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of \u03c3_y |\u03c8>\n\n\u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] [ (3i)/5, 4/5 ]^T\n\n= [ 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5), i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ]^T\n\n= [ -4i/5, 3i^2/5 ]^T\n\n= [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\nThen <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -(3i)/5, 4/5 ] [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\n= ( -(3i)/5 )*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5)\n\n= (12i^2)/25 + (-12/25)\n\n= -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nSo <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nWait, but in the options, there's -12\u0127/25, which matches my calculation.\n\nBut the answer key says A. 12\u0127/25\n\nMaybe I missed a sign somewhere.\n\nLet me check the definition of \u03c3_y again. In some conventions, \u03c3_y is defined with different signs.\n\n\u03c3_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]\n\nYes, that seems standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the normalization.\n\nWait, the original state is (3i, 4). Let's confirm the normalization.\n\n||\u03c8|| = sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5\n\nNormalized state: |\u03c8> = (1/5)[3i, 4]^T = [3i/5, 4/5]^T\n\nNow, <\u03c8| = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]\n\nThen \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\nThen <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = (-3i/5)*(-4i/5) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12i^2)/25 - 12/25 = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nSo <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nBut the answer key says A. 12\u0127/25\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or the answer key.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spin state is represented as a row vector instead of a column vector, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a different convention for the Pauli matrices.\n\nWait, maybe they define S_y = (-\u0127/2) \u03c3_y\n\nBut that would make <S_y> = (-\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = 12\u0127/25, which matches option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they define \u03c3_y with opposite signs.\n\nLet me check a standard reference. In the standard definition, \u03c3_y = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], and S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y.\n\nGiven that, my calculation seems correct, leading to -12\u0127/25.\n\nBut the answer key says A. 12\u0127/25\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the answer key.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the spin state as a row vector instead of a column vector.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf |\u03c8> = [3i, 4], then <\u03c8| = [ -3i, 4 ]\n\nThen \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] [3i, 4]^T = [ -4i, -3 ]^T\n\nThen <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -3i, 4 ] [ -4i, -3 ]^T = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = -12 + (-12) = -24\n\nThen <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127\n\nBut that doesn't match any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to normalize the state in this case as well.\n\nOriginal state: |\u03c8> = [3i, 4], norm = sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) ) = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5\n\nNormalized |\u03c8> = (1/5)[3i, 4]\n\nThen proceed as before, leading to the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nI know that for spin-1/2 particles, the expectation value of S_y can also be found using the formula:\n\n<S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (\u03c8*_x \u03c8_y - \u03c8_x \u03c8*_y )\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the eigenvectors of S_y to find the probabilities.\n\nThe eigenvectors of \u03c3_y are |+y> = [1, i]^T / sqrt(2) and |-y> = [1, -i]^T / sqrt(2)\n\nThen, the expectation value is <S_y> = <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> = (\u0127/2) * [ <\u03c8|+y><+y|\u03c8> - <\u03c8|-y><-y|\u03c8> ]\n\nBut that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the state |\u03c8> in terms of the eigenstates of S_y.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet |\u03c8> = a |+y> + b |-y>\n\nThen, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (a* a - b* b)\n\nBut I need to find a and b.\n\nGiven |\u03c8> = [3i, 4]^T / 5 = [3i/5, 4/5]^T\n\nAnd |+y> = [1, i]/sqrt(2), |-y> = [1, -i]/sqrt(2)\n\nThen, a = <+y|\u03c8> = [1, -i] [3i/5, 4/5]^T / sqrt(2) = (1)*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) / sqrt(2) = (3i/5 - 4i/5)/sqrt(2) = (-i/5)/sqrt(2) = -i/(5 sqrt(2))\n\nSimilarly, b = <-y|\u03c8> = [1, i] [3i/5, 4/5]^T / sqrt(2) = (1)*(3i/5) + (i)*(4/5)/sqrt(2) = (3i/5 + 4i/5)/sqrt(2) = (7i/5)/sqrt(2) = 7i/(5 sqrt(2))\n\nThen, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * ( a* a - b* b )\n\nFirst, a* = i/(5 sqrt(2)), b* = -7i/(5 sqrt(2))\n\nThen, a* a = (i/(5 sqrt(2))) * (-i/(5 sqrt(2))) = (i*(-i))/(25*2) = (1)/(50)\n\nSimilarly, b* b = (-7i/(5 sqrt(2))) * (7i/(5 sqrt(2))) = (49*(i^2))/ (25 * 2) = -49/(50)\n\nTherefore, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (1/50 - (-49/50)) = (\u0127/2) * (50/50) = (\u0127/2) * 1 = \u0127/2\n\nBut that doesn't match my previous calculation or the options provided.\n\nWait, there must be a mistake here.\n\nLet me recall that for expectation values using spectral decomposition, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (|a|^2 - |b|^2)\n\nBecause <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (p_+ - p_-), where p_+ and p_- are probabilities of measuring +\u0127/2 and -\u0127/2 respectively.\n\nBut actually, for spin-1/2 particles, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * ( <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> )\n\nWhich is what I calculated earlier as -12\u0127/25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (|a|^2 - |b|^2) is not correct.\n\nLet me check.\n\nActually, in the eigenbasis of S_y, <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (|a|^2 - |b|^2)\n\nBecause |\u03c8> = a |+y> + b |-y>, and <S_y> = (\u0127/2) * (|a|^2 * 1 + |b|^2 * (-1)) = (\u0127/2)( |a|^2 - |b|^2 )\n\nSo, let's compute |a|^2 and |b|^2.\n\nFrom earlier, a = -i/(5 sqrt(2)), b = 7i/(5 sqrt(2))\n\nThus, |a|^2 = (1/(5 sqrt(2)))^2 = 1/(50)\n\n|b|^2 = (7/(5 sqrt(2)))^2 = 49/(50)\n\nTherefore, <S_y> = (\u0127/2)(1/50 - 49/50) = (\u0127/2)( -48/50 ) = -24\u0127/25\n\nWait, that's different from my previous calculation of -12\u0127/25.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying p_+ and p_-.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is not the correct way to find <S_y>.\n\nI think my initial approach of calculating <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> is more reliable.\n\nLet me try to calculate <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> again.\n\nGiven |\u03c8> = [3i/5, 4/5]^T\n\n\u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\nThen <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T = ( -3i/5 )*( -4i/5 ) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12i^2)/25 + (-12/25) = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nThus, <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nBut the answer key says A. 12\u0127/25\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the answer key.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spin state is given as a row vector, and I need to treat it differently.\n\nLet me consider |\u03c8> = [3i, 4]\n\nThen, <\u03c8| = [ -3i, 4 ]\n\nThen, <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> = [ -3i, 4 ] * (\u0127/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i, 4]^T\n\nFirst, [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i, 4]^T = [ -4i, -3 ]^T\n\nThen, [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i, -3 ]^T = (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) = -12 - 12 = -24\n\nThus, <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24) = -12\u0127\n\nBut that doesn't match any options.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to normalize the state.\n\nNormalized |\u03c8> = (1/5)[3i, 4]\n\nThen, <\u03c8| S_y |\u03c8> = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * (\u0127/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i/5, 4/5]^T\n\nFirst, [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] * [3i/5, 4/5]^T = [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T\n\nThen, [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T = ( -3i/5 )*( -4i/5 ) + (4/5)*(-3/5) = (12i^2)/25 + (-12/25) = -12/25 - 12/25 = -24/25\n\nThus, <S_y> = (\u0127/2)*(-24/25) = -12\u0127/25\n\nThis matches option D.\n\nBut the answer key says A. 12\u0127/25\n\nPerhaps there is a typo in the answer key.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spin state is given as a row vector, and I need to treat it differently.\n\nBut in quantum mechanics, bra vectors are the conjugate transposes of ket vectors, so <\u03c8| is indeed [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different definition of S_y being used.\n\nIn some conventions, S_y = (-\u0127/2) \u03c3_y\n\nIf that's the case, then <S_y> = (-\u0127/2) * (-24/25) = 12\u0127/25, which matches option A.\n\nBut this seems unlikely, as the standard definition is S_y = (\u0127/2) \u03c3_y\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \u03c3_y is defined with opposite signs in their convention.\n\nIf \u03c3_y = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ], then:\n\n\u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] [3i/5, 4/5]^T = [i*(4/5), -i*(3i/5)]^T = [4i/5, 3/5]^T\n\nThen, <\u03c8| \u03c3_y |\u03c8> = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] [4i/5, 3/5]^T = (-3i/5)*(4i/5) + (4/5)*(3/5) = (12i"
