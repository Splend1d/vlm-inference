                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about an oscillating spheroid charge distribution and its radiation properties. So, we have a spheroid oscillating along the z-axis, and it's radiating electromagnetic waves with a wavelength \u03bb. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle depends on both \u03bb and the angle \u03b8 from the z-axis. The question is asking for the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, and also for the angular dependence function f(\u03b8).\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about antenna radiation patterns and how the radiation from an oscillating charge distribution behaves, especially for spheroidal geometries.\n\nSince the spheroid is symmetric along the z-axis, I suspect that the radiation pattern will have some azimuthal symmetry, meaning that it doesn't depend on the azimuthal angle \u03c6, only on \u03b8.\n\nI think that for an oscillating electric dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to (sin \u03b8 / \u03b8)^2, but I'm not sure if that directly applies here since it's a spheroid, not necessarily a dipole.\n\nWait, a spheroid can be thought of as an extended distribution of charges, so maybe I need to consider multipole expansions. Perhaps the radiation is dominated by a particular multipole moment, like the dipole or quadrupole moment.\n\nGiven that it's oscillating along the z-axis, maybe the dominant contribution is from the dipole moment.\n\nBut the problem mentions that it's a spheroid, which suggests that it might have some quadrupole moments that contribute significantly to the radiation.\n\nI should look up the radiation patterns for multipole moments.\n\nFrom what I remember, the radiation intensity for a electric dipole is proportional to sin\u00b2\u03b8, and for a quadrupole, it's proportional to (3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1).\n\nBut in this case, since it's a spheroid oscillating along the z-axis, maybe both dipole and quadrupole moments are present.\n\nPerhaps the radiation pattern is a combination of dipole and quadrupole radiation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a spheroid, the radiation is purely quadrupole in nature.\n\nI need to think about the multipole expansion for an oscillating charge distribution.\n\nIn general, the far-field radiation from an oscillating charge distribution can be expressed in terms of multipole moments: monopole, dipole, quadrupole, etc.\n\nHowever, for an oscillating charge distribution with overall neutral charge, the monopole moment is zero.\n\nIf the dipole moment is zero, then the leading term is the quadrupole radiation.\n\nBut in this case, since it's oscillating along the z-axis, perhaps there is a net dipole moment.\n\nWait, if it's a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, maybe the dipole moment is zero due to symmetry, and the leading term is quadrupole.\n\nLet me consider that.\n\nSuppose the spheroid has a charge distribution that's symmetric about the z-axis, and it's oscillating along the z-axis.\n\nIf the total charge is zero, and the charge distribution is antisymmetric with respect to z, then the dipole moment would oscillate, leading to dipole radiation.\n\nBut if the charge distribution is symmetric, maybe the dipole moment is zero, and quadrupole radiation dominates.\n\nI need to be careful here.\n\nLet's assume that the spheroid has a charge distribution that's antisymmetric with respect to the equatorial plane, meaning that for every positive charge at a certain z, there's a negative charge at -z.\n\nIn that case, the dipole moment would be zero, and the leading term would be quadrupole.\n\nBut if the charge distribution is such that there's a net dipole moment oscillating along z, then dipole radiation would be dominant.\n\nI think the problem doesn't specify the exact nature of the charge distribution, so I need to make an assumption.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider the dipole radiation case.\n\nThe radiation intensity for an electric dipole is proportional to sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, the function f(\u03b8) would be proportional to sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nIn this case, the maximum radiation is along \u03b8 = 90\u00b0, where sin \u03b8 = 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"the maximum power thus radiated is A\", and asks for the fraction of A radiated at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0.\n\nIf f(\u03b8) = sin\u00b2\u03b8, then at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, f(\u03b8) = (sin 30\u00b0)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the power at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 would be A/4.\n\nBut looking at the options, one of them has 1/4 as the fraction, specifically option C and D.\n\nHowever, the wavelength dependence is also part of the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the function f includes both \u03b8 dependence and \u03bb dependence.\n\nI need to recall how the radiation power depends on wavelength.\n\nIn electromagnetic radiation, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is generally proportional to the square of the acceleration and inversely proportional to the wavelength to some power.\n\nSpecifically, for dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to (k\u00b2)^2, where k is the wave number, which is 2\u03c0/\u03bb.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) \u221d (k\u00b2)^2 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/\u03bb\u00b2)^2 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (16\u03c0\u2074/\u03bb\u2074) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, f(\u03b8) \u221d \u03bb^(-4) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nSo, the angular dependence is sin\u00b2\u03b8, and the wavelength dependence is \u03bb^(-4).\n\nIn this case, at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, f(\u03b8) = sin\u00b2(30\u00b0) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nSo, the fraction of A radiated at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 would be 1/4.\n\nLooking at the options, option D has 1/4 and \u03bb^(-4), which matches this.\n\nBut wait, option C also has 1/4, but with \u03bb^(-3), which doesn't match.\n\nSo, if this is the case for dipole radiation, then option D seems correct.\n\nHowever, earlier I considered that for a spheroid oscillating along its symmetry axis, perhaps quadrupole radiation dominates.\n\nLet's consider that possibility.\n\nFor electric quadrupole radiation, the radiation intensity depends on the quadrupole moment and the angle \u03b8.\n\nThe general expression for the radiation power per unit solid angle for an electric quadrupole is proportional to (3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1)^2.\n\nSo, in this case, f(\u03b8) \u221d (3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1)^2.\n\nLet's evaluate this at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0.\n\ncos(30\u00b0) = \u221a3/2,\n\nso 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1 = 3*(\u221a3/2)^2 - 1 = 3*(3/4) - 1 = 9/4 - 1 = 5/4.\n\nTherefore, f(\u03b8) at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 is (5/4)^2 = 25/16.\n\nComparing to the maximum value, which occurs at \u03b8 where 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1 is maximum.\n\nThe maximum of 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1 is 2, occurring at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 (cos \u03b8 = 1).\n\nSo, f(\u03b8=0\u00b0) \u221d (2)^2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the fraction at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 is (25/16) / 4 = (25/16)/(16/4) = (25/16)/(4) = 25/64.\n\nThis doesn't match any of the given options, so perhaps quadrupole radiation is not the dominant contribution here.\n\nMoreover, quadrupole radiation generally falls off as \u03bb^(-5), but I need to confirm that.\n\nWait, for electric quadrupole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to k^4, where k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8) \u221d (k^4) * (3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1)^2 = (16\u03c0\u2074/\u03bb\u2074) * (3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - 1)^2.\n\nSo, the wavelength dependence is \u03bb^(-4), similar to the dipole case.\n\nWait, but I thought quadrupole radiation falls off faster with wavelength.\n\nMaybe I need to recall the general formula for multipole radiation.\n\nIn general, for an electric multipole of order q, the power radiated is proportional to (k)^(2q+1).\n\nFor electric dipole, q=1, so P \u221d k^3, which is \u03bb^(-3).\n\nFor electric quadrupole, q=2, so P \u221d k^5, which is \u03bb^(-5).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought dipole radiation power per solid angle is proportional to k^4, but that might be incorrect.\n\nLet me check.\n\nActually, for dipole radiation, the electric field falls off as 1/r, and the power per unit solid angle is proportional to 1/r\u00b2, but in the radiation zone, it's proportional to k\u00b2 times some angular factors.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to revisit the formulas for radiation from electric dipoles and quadrupoles.\n\nLet me look up the general formula for the power radiated per unit solid angle for electric dipoles and quadrupoles.\n\nFor an electric dipole, the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is given by:\n\nU(\u03b8) = (\u03bc\u2080 * e\u2080 * \u03c9\u2074 * p\u2080\u00b2 / (12\u03c0 * c)) * (sin \u03b8 / \u03bb)\u00b2\n\nWhere p\u2080 is the dipole moment, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, and \u03bb is the wavelength.\n\nSo, U(\u03b8) \u221d (sin \u03b8 / \u03bb)^2.\n\nWait, but k = 2\u03c0 / \u03bb, so k\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2) / \u03bb\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, U(\u03b8) \u221d k\u00b2 * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut overall power radiated by the dipole is P \u221d \u03c9^4 * p\u2080\u00b2 / c, and the radiation intensity is P divided by 4\u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be more precise.\n\nThe total power radiated by an electric dipole is P_dipole \u221d \u03c9^4 * p\u2080\u00b2 / c.\n\nAnd the radiation intensity U(\u03b8) = (dP / d\u03a9) \u221d U_0 * sin\u00b2\u03b8, where U_0 is a constant.\n\nGiven that the total power is integrated over all solid angles, \u222b U(\u03b8) d\u03a9 = P.\n\nFor a dipole, U(\u03b8) \u221d sin\u00b2\u03b8, and integrating over all angles gives a factor of 4\u03c0/3.\n\nWait, no, integrating sin\u00b2\u03b8 over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 and \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0 gives:\n\n\u222b\u222b sin\u00b2\u03b8 * sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0 \u222b sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 = 2\u03c0 * (4/3) = 8\u03c0/3.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me refer to a standard formula.\n\nThe radiation intensity for an electric dipole is:\n\nU(\u03b8) = (\u03bc\u2080 * e\u2080 * \u03c9\u2074 * p\u2080\u00b2 / (12\u03c0 * c)) * (sin \u03b8)^2\n\nAnd the total power radiated is P = (\u03bc\u2080 * e\u2080 * \u03c9^4 * p\u2080\u00b2) / (12\u03c0 * c)\n\nThen, U(\u03b8) = P * (sin \u03b8)^2 / (4\u03c0 / 3) = (3 P / 4\u03c0) * sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nWait, because \u222b U(\u03b8) d\u03a9 = \u222b (3 P / 4\u03c0) sin\u00b2\u03b8 * sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 = (3 P / 4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * \u222b sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 = (3 P / 2) * [ (cos \u03b8)^3 / 3 - cos \u03b8 ] evaluated from 0 to \u03c0 = (3 P / 2) * ( -1/3 + 1 - (1/3 -1) ) = (3 P / 2) * (8/3) = 4\u03c0 P.\n\nWait, this doesn't make sense.\n\nI must have messed up the integration.\n\nLet me calculate the integral of sin\u00b3\u03b8 over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0.\n\n\u222b sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8 = \u222b sin \u03b8 (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) d\u03b8 = - \u222b (1 - u\u00b2) du from u=0 to u=0, which is zero.\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nActually, sin\u00b3\u03b8 is an odd function, and integrating it from 0 to \u03c0 should give a non-zero value.\n\nWait, sin\u00b3\u03b8 is symmetric about \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, and it's positive in [0,\u03c0], so the integral should be positive.\n\nLet me compute it properly.\n\nLet u = cos \u03b8, then du = -sin \u03b8 d\u03b8.\n\nWhen \u03b8=0, u=1; \u03b8=\u03c0, u=-1.\n\nSo, \u222b sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8 = \u222b (1 - cos\u00b2\u03b8) sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 = - \u222b (1 - u\u00b2) du from 1 to -1 = \u222b (1 - u\u00b2) du from -1 to 1 = 2 \u222b (1 - u\u00b2) du from 0 to 1 = 2*(u - u\u00b3/3) from 0 to 1 = 2*(1 - 1/3) = 4/3.\n\nTherefore, \u222b U(\u03b8) d\u03a9 = (3 P / 4\u03c0) * 2\u03c0 * (4/3) = 2\u03c0 P / \u03c0 = 2 P.\n\nWait, that suggests that the total power radiated is 2 P, which doesn't make sense because it should be P.\n\nI must have messed up the expression for U(\u03b8).\n\nLet me look up the standard formula for radiation from an electric dipole.\n\nUpon checking, the radiation intensity for an electric dipole is:\n\nU(\u03b8) = (\u03bc\u2080 * e\u2080 * \u03c9\u2074 * p\u2080\u00b2 / (12\u03c0 * c)) * sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nAnd the total power radiated is P = (\u03bc\u2080 * e\u2080 * \u03c9^4 * p\u2080\u00b2) / (12\u03c0 * c)\n\nThen, integrating U(\u03b8) over all solid angles should give P.\n\nBut \u222b U(\u03b8) d\u03a9 = \u222b sin\u00b2\u03b8 * sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 over \u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 and \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nThis integral is 2\u03c0 \u222b sin\u00b3\u03b8 d\u03b8 from 0 to \u03c0 = 2\u03c0 * (4/3) = 8\u03c0/3.\n\nSo, to have \u222b U(\u03b8) d\u03a9 = P, we need U(\u03b8) = (3 P / (4\u03c0)) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, U(\u03b8) \u221d sin\u00b2\u03b8, with the proportionality constant such that the integral gives P.\n\nNow, in the context of the problem, f(\u03b8) represents the radiation power per unit solid angle, so f(\u03b8) \u221d sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nAt \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.\n\nThe maximum value of sin\u00b2\u03b8 is 1, at \u03b8 = 90\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of A radiated at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 is 1/4.\n\nNow, considering the wavelength dependence.\n\nFrom the expression U(\u03b8) \u221d \u03c9^4 * sin\u00b2\u03b8, and since \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 c / \u03bb, we have U(\u03b8) \u221d (2\u03c0 c / \u03bb)^4 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (16\u03c0\u2074 c\u2074 / \u03bb\u2074) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, f(\u03b8) \u221d \u03bb^(-4) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that for dipole radiation, the total power radiated is proportional to \u03c9^4, which is \u03bb^(-4).\n\nHowever, in some references, dipole radiation power is said to be proportional to \u03bb^(-3).\n\nI need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the expressions more carefully.\n\nThe total power radiated by an electric dipole is P \u221d \u03c9^4 * p\u2080\u00b2 / c.\n\nBut p\u2080, the dipole moment, might have units including length, so I need to see how it depends on \u03bb.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dimensionality.\n\nLet's consider the dimensions.\n\nPower P has units of watts, or joules per second.\n\nIn SI units, \u03bc\u2080 has units of henries per meter, which is kg*m*A^(-2)*s^(-2).\n\ne\u2080 has units of farads per meter, which is kg^(-1)*m^(-3)*A\u00b2*s^4.\n\n\u03c9 has units of radians per second, p\u2080 has units of coulomb-meters.\n\nSo, putting it all together, P \u221d (kg*m*A^(-2)*s^(-2)) * (kg^(-1)*m^(-3)*A\u00b2*s^4) * (s^(-4)*C\u00b2*m\u00b2) / (m*s^(-1)).\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe it's better to recall that for an electric dipole, the radiation power is P \u221d \u03c9^4 * p\u2080\u00b2 / c.\n\nGiven that \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 c / \u03bb, then P \u221d (2\u03c0 c / \u03bb)^4 * p\u2080\u00b2 / c = (16\u03c0\u2074 c\u2074 / \u03bb\u2074) * p\u2080\u00b2 / c = (16\u03c0\u2074 c\u00b3 p\u2080\u00b2) / \u03bb\u2074.\n\nSo, P \u221d \u03bb^(-4).\n\nTherefore, in the radiation intensity U(\u03b8) \u221d \u03bb^(-4) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nThis suggests that f(\u03b8) \u221d \u03bb^(-4) * sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, f(\u03b8) = (1/4) * \u03bb^(-4) * A.\n\nWait, but A is the maximum power, which is at \u03b8 = 90\u00b0, where sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, f(\u03b8=30\u00b0) = (1/4) * \u03bb^(-4) * A.\n\nTherefore, the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to \u03bb^(-4).\n\nLooking back at the options, option D matches this: 1/4, \u03bb^(-4).\n\nHowever, option C also has 1/4, but with \u03bb^(-3"
