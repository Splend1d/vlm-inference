                    "text": "I'm trying to solve this problem about nuclear physics, specifically regarding the emission of a particle X from a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The particle X has intrinsic parity -1, and I need to determine which partial wave is not permitted based on the given conditions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the initial state. The two nucleons are in a 1S0 state. The notation 1S0 tells me that:\n\n- The total spin S of the nucleons is 0 (since it's S0).\n\n- The orbital angular momentum L between the nucleons is 0 (S means L=0).\n\n- The total angular momentum J is also 0 (since J = |L - S| to L + S, and L=S=0, so J=0).\n\nNow, the system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics tell us that the isospin T(NN), angular momentum L(NN), and spin S(NN) of the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.\n\nGiven that T(NN) = 0 for the final state, we can use this to find constraints on S(NN) and L(NN).\n\nLet's recall that isospin T for nucleons can be either 0 or 1. Here, T(NN) = 0, which corresponds to a singlet state.\n\nGiven T(NN) = 0, the equation becomes:\n\n0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2\n\nThis implies that S(NN) + L(NN) must be odd.\n\nNow, in the final state, after emitting particle X, the two nucleons will have some angular momentum L(NN) and spin S(NN), and particle X will have its own angular momentum and parity.\n\nWe need to consider both conservation of angular momentum and parity.\n\nLet's denote the angular momentum of particle X as L(X), and its intrinsic parity as -1.\n\nThe total angular momentum before and after the emission must be conserved. Initially, the system has J=0, so the total angular momentum after emission must also be 0.\n\nTherefore, the angular momentum of the NN pair (J(NN)) plus the angular momentum of particle X (L(X)) must add up to 0.\n\nSo, J(NN) + L(X) = 0.\n\nSince angular momenta are vector quantities, this means that J(NN) must be equal in magnitude to L(X) and opposite in direction. However, since we're dealing with magnitudes here, and angular momentum quantum numbers are non-negative, the only way for their sum to be zero is if both are zero.\n\nBut in practice, for quantum numbers, the possible values for J(NN) and L(X) must satisfy the triangle inequality:\n\n|J(NN) - L(X)| \u2264 J(total) \u2264 J(NN) + L(X)\n\nGiven that J(total) = 0, this implies that J(NN) must equal L(X).\n\nSo, J(NN) = L(X).\n\nBut since J(total) = 0, J(NN) must be equal to L(X), and both must be such that their vector sum is zero. This typically means that J(NN) and L(X) are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, but in terms of quantum numbers, it means J(NN) = L(X).\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, for two angular momenta to add up to zero, they must be equal in magnitude and oppositely directed. So J(NN) must equal L(X), and their vectors are opposite.\n\nBut in terms of quantum numbers, J(NN) can couple with L(X) to give J(total) = 0 only if J(NN) = L(X), and the projection quantum numbers align appropriately.\n\nSo, to have J(total) = 0, J(NN) must equal L(X), and their projections must sum to zero.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps it's sufficient to consider that J(NN) = L(X).\n\nNow, regarding parity, the initial state has parity associated with the orbital angular momentum L=0, which has parity (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1.\n\nThe particle X has intrinsic parity -1.\n\nThe final NN state will have some parity, which is determined by its orbital angular momentum L(NN) and the intrinsic parities of the nucleons.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. The parity of the final NN state is determined by the parity of the orbital angular momentum between them and the intrinsic parities of the nucleons.\n\nAssuming the nucleons are spin-1/2 particles with intrinsic parities +1 (since they are fermions, but I need to confirm this), the parity of the NN state would be (-1)^L(NN) times the product of their intrinsic parities.\n\nBut actually, for nucleons, which are fermions, the intrinsic parity is not always well-defined, but in nuclear physics, it's often assumed to be +1 for protons and neutrons.\n\nWait, but in the context of this problem, perhaps it's safer to assume that the intrinsic parity of nucleons is +1.\n\nTherefore, the parity of the final NN state is (-1)^L(NN) * (+1) * (+1) = (-1)^L(NN).\n\nNow, considering the emission of particle X with intrinsic parity -1, the parity conservation requires that the initial parity equals the final parity.\n\nInitial parity: (+1) [from L=0]\n\nFinal parity: parity of NN state * parity of X\n\nSo, (+1) = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)\n\nTherefore, (+1) = (-1)^{L(NN) + 1}\n\nThis implies that (-1)^{L(NN) + 1} = +1\n\nTherefore, L(NN) + 1 must be even, meaning L(NN) is odd.\n\nSo, L(NN) must be odd for parity conservation.\n\nNow, recalling that T(NN) = 0 implies S(NN) + L(NN) is odd.\n\nWe also have that L(NN) is odd from parity conservation.\n\nLet's see what S(NN) can be.\n\nSince S(NN) is the total spin of the two nucleons, possible values are S(NN) = 0 or 1.\n\nIf L(NN) is odd, and S(NN) + L(NN) is odd, then S(NN) must be even, because odd + even = odd.\n\nBut S(NN) can only be 0 or 1, so S(NN) = 0.\n\nWait, 0 is even, and 1 is odd.\n\nIf L(NN) is odd, and S(NN) + L(NN) is odd, then S(NN) must be even, which is S(NN) = 0.\n\nTherefore, S(NN) = 0 and L(NN) is odd.\n\nNow, the total angular momentum J(NN) of the NN pair is given by J(NN) = |L(NN) - S(NN)| to L(NN) + S(NN).\n\nSince S(NN) = 0, J(NN) = L(NN).\n\nTherefore, J(NN) = L(NN), and since L(NN) is odd, J(NN) is odd.\n\nRecall that J(NN) = L(X), as per the earlier conclusion from angular momentum conservation.\n\nTherefore, L(X) must be odd.\n\nSo, the angular momentum of particle X, L(X), must be odd.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\nB. 1S0 -> 7D1 + p\n\nC. 1S0 -> 3P0 + s\n\nD. 1S0 -> 3S1 + p\n\nWe need to decode these notations.\n\nThe initial state is 1S0, which we've already discussed.\n\nThe final state is given in the form [2S(NN)+1]L(J) + l, where l is the lowercase letter denoting the angular momentum state of X.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says: \"the term symbol (e.g. 1S0) is in general defined (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L the total orbital angular momentum written in spectroscopic notation, and J the total angular momentum.\"\n\nSo, in the options, the first part before the arrow is the initial state, 1S0.\n\nThe second part is the final NN state plus the angular momentum of particle X.\n\nFor example, in option A: 1S0 -> 3D3 + f\n\n- 3D3 means for the NN pair: 2S(NN)+1 = 3, so S(NN) = 1\n\n- L(NN) = D corresponds to L=2\n\n- J(NN) = 3\n\n- Plus f, which corresponds to L(X) = 3 (f wave has L=3)\n\nWait, actually, in spectroscopic notation:\n\n- s: L=0\n\n- p: L=1\n\n- d: L=2\n\n- f: L=3\n\n- etc.\n\nSo, in option A: 3D3 + f means S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, J(NN)=3, and L(X)=3.\n\nSimilarly, decode the other options:\n\nB. 7D1 + p: S(NN)=3, L(NN)=2, J(NN)=1, L(X)=1\n\nC. 3P0 + s: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, J(NN)=0, L(X)=0\n\nD. 3S1 + p: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=0, J(NN)=1, L(X)=1\n\nNow, recall that we've concluded that S(NN) must be 0, and L(NN) must be odd.\n\nBut in option A, S(NN)=1, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that S(NN)=0.\n\nSimilarly, in option B, S(NN)=3, which is also not 0.\n\nOption C has S(NN)=1, again not 0.\n\nOption D has S(NN)=1, not 0.\n\nWait a minute, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nEarlier, I concluded that S(NN)=0, based on T(NN)=0 and the given equation T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod 2, along with parity considerations.\n\nBut according to that, S(NN) must be 0, and L(NN) must be odd.\n\nHowever, in all the options provided, S(NN) is 1 or 3, none have S(NN)=0.\n\nDoes this mean that none of these options are permitted?\n\nBut that can't be right, because the question asks which one is not permitted, implying that some are permitted and some are not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check the condition T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod 2.\n\nGiven T(NN)=0, so 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nThis implies S(NN) + L(NN) +1 is even.\n\nTherefore, S(NN) + L(NN) is odd.\n\nGiven that, and from parity considerations, L(NN) must be odd.\n\nTherefore, S(NN) must be even, since odd + even = odd.\n\nS(NN) can be 0 or 1, so S(NN)=0.\n\nWait, but in the options, S(NN) is 1 or 3, which are odd.\n\nThis suggests that none of these options satisfy the condition S(NN)=0.\n\nBut again, that would mean all options are invalid, which seems unlikely.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the intrinsic parities of nucleons are +1.\n\nLet me reconsider that.\n\nIn nuclear physics, both protons and neutrons are considered to have intrinsic parity +1.\n\nTherefore, the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L(NN).\n\nThen, the parity conservation equation is:\n\nInitial parity: (+1)\n\nFinal parity: parity of NN state * parity of X = (-1)^L(NN) * (-1)\n\nSo, (+1) = (-1)^{L(NN) + 1}\n\nThis implies L(NN) +1 is even, so L(NN) is odd.\n\nAdditionally, T(NN)=0 implies S(NN) + L(NN) is odd.\n\nWith L(NN) odd, S(NN) must be even.\n\nS(NN) can be 0 or 1, so S(NN)=0.\n\nBut in all options, S(NN) is 1 or 3, which are odd.\n\nThis suggests that none of these options are allowed, which can't be right.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the options are presented.\n\nLet me look at option C: 3P0 + s\n\nThis corresponds to S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, J(NN)=0, and L(X)=0.\n\nWait, L(NN)=1 is odd, and S(NN)=1 is odd, so S(NN) + L(NN)= even, which contradicts T(NN)=0 requiring S(NN) + L(NN) odd.\n\nWait, hold on, T(NN)=S(NN)+L(NN)+1 mod 2.\n\nGiven T(NN)=0, then 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.\n\nThis implies S(NN) + L(NN) +1 is even, so S(NN) + L(NN) is odd.\n\nIn option C, S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, so S(NN)+L(NN)=2, which is even, contradicting the required odd.\n\nSimilarly, in option A: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, S+N=3, which is odd, matching the condition.\n\nWait, now I see my mistake earlier.\n\nIn option A: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, S+N=3, odd, which matches T(NN)=0 condition.\n\nIn option C: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, S+N=2, even, which does not match.\n\nSo, option C violates the T(NN)=0 condition.\n\nTherefore, option C is not permitted.\n\nBut let's check the other options to confirm.\n\nOption A: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=2, S+N=3, odd: permitted.\n\nOption B: S(NN)=3, L(NN)=2, S+N=5, odd: permitted.\n\nOption D: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=0, S+N=1, odd: permitted.\n\nOption C: S(NN)=1, L(NN)=1, S+N=2, even: not permitted.\n\nAdditionally, check parity for option C.\n\nL(NN)=1, which is odd, matching the parity requirement.\n\nBut since S(NN)+L(NN) must be odd for T(NN)=0, and here it's even, it's not permitted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
