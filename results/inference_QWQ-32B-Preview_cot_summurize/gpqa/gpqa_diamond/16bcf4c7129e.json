                    "text": "Let's see. I have an unknown compound, and I have data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out which chemical formula matches the compound based on these spectra. The options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O2.\n\nFirst, let's look at the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption peak at 3000 wavenumbers. I know that broad peaks around 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 are often associated with O-H stretching in alcohols or carboxylic acids. So, maybe there's an O-H group in the compound.\n\nNext, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 wavenumbers. I recall that around 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, there's often a C=O stretching vibration, which suggests a carbonyl group is present. The peak at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9 could be from a C=C stretching vibration, indicating the presence of a double bond, or possibly from a conjugated system involving the carbonyl.\n\nNow, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a carbon in a C=C double bond. So, this confirms that there is a double bond in the molecule, which aligns with the FTIR data.\n\nFinally, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I need to think about what molecular ion this could correspond to. Maybe it's a fragment from the molecular ion, but I need to consider the possible molecular weights based on the given formulas.\n\nLet's calculate the molecular weights for each option:\n\n- C6H12O: (6*12) + (12*1) + (1*16) = 72 + 12 + 16 = 100\n\n- C6H10O: (6*12) + (10*1) + (1*16) = 72 + 10 + 16 = 98\n\n- C6H10O2: (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) = 72 + 10 + 32 = 114\n\n- C6H12O2: (6*12) + (12*1) + (2*16) = 72 + 12 + 32 = 116\n\nSo, the molecular weights are 100, 98, 114, and 116 respectively.\n\nNow, the fragment peak is at m/z = 45. I need to see which of these molecular weights could produce a fragment at 45. Let's consider the possible fragments:\n\n- For C6H12O (MW=100): a fragment at 45 would suggest a loss of 55 (100-45=55). What could correspond to 55? Maybe a CO2 loss (44) plus a hydrogen, but that's just a rough guess.\n\n- For C6H10O (MW=98): fragment at 45 would mean a loss of 53 (98-45=53). Not sure what that corresponds to.\n\n- For C6H10O2 (MW=114): fragment at 45 would mean a loss of 69 (114-45=69). Could this be a loss of a fragment like CH3CO (43), but not exactly 69.\n\n- For C6H12O2 (MW=116): fragment at 45 would mean a loss of 71 (116-45=71). Maybe loss of a ethyl group or something else.\n\nHmm, not very helpful. Maybe I should look at the NMR data more closely.\n\nThe 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. That means there are hydrogens directly attached to a double bond. In the options provided, all have six carbon atoms, but different numbers of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.\n\nLet's consider the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation can help determine the possible presence of double bonds or rings.\n\nThe formula for degrees of unsaturation is:\n\n(U) = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2\n\nWhere:\n\n- C = number of carbon atoms\n\n- H = number of hydrogen atoms\n\n- N = number of nitrogen atoms (which is 0 here)\n\n- X = number of halogen atoms (which is 0 here)\n\nSo, for each formula:\n\n- C6H12O: U = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = (12 + 2 - 12)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\n- C6H10O: U = (2*6 + 2 - 10)/2 = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\n- C6H10O2: U = (2*6 + 2 - 10 - 2*2)/2 = (12 + 2 - 10 - 4)/2 = (14 - 14)/2 = 0/2 = 0\n\n- C6H12O2: U = (2*6 + 2 - 12 - 2*2)/2 = (12 + 2 - 12 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1 (which isn't possible, so likely no nitrogen or halogens are present, maybe formula error)\n\nWait, seems like there might be an error in the degrees of unsaturation calculation for C6H12O2. Let's double-check:\n\nActually, the general formula for degrees of unsaturation is:\n\nU = (2C + 2 + N - H - X)/2\n\nBut in organic compounds, X (halogens) and N (nitrogen) are often zero unless specified. So, assuming N=0 and X=0:\n\n- For C6H12O2: U = (2*6 + 2 - 12)/2 = (12 + 2 - 12)/2 = 2/2 = 1\n\nSimilarly for C6H10O2: U = (2*6 + 2 - 10)/2 = (12 + 2 - 10)/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nOk, so corrected degrees of unsaturation:\n\n- C6H12O: U=1\n\n- C6H10O: U=2\n\n- C6H10O2: U=2\n\n- C6H12O2: U=1\n\nNow, considering the presence of a double bond (from the vinyl-hydrogens in NMR and the absorption peaks in FTIR), we can infer that there is at least one double bond, which corresponds to one degree of unsaturation.\n\nBut wait, C6H10O has two degrees of unsaturation, which could correspond to two double bonds or one double bond and one ring, etc.\n\nSimilarly, C6H10O2 also has two degrees of unsaturation, which might suggest a similar structure.\n\nC6H12O and C6H12O2 both have one degree of unsaturation, which could be a single double bond or a ring.\n\nGiven that the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9, which is likely a carbonyl group, and a peak at 1650 cm\u207b\u00b9, which could be from a C=C bond or conjugated system.\n\nAlso, the broad peak at 3000 cm\u207b\u00b9 suggests an O-H group.\n\nSo, the compound likely has a carbonyl group, a double bond, and an O-H group.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- C6H12O: This could be a hexanol with a double bond, for example, hex-3-ene-1-ol, which would have one degree of unsaturation from the double bond.\n\n- C6H10O: This has two degrees of unsaturation, possibly two double bonds or a double bond and a ring, with an O-H group.\n\n- C6H10O2: This also has two degrees of unsaturation, with two oxygen atoms, possibly a carboxylic acid group or an ester.\n\n- C6H12O2: One degree of unsaturation, with two oxygen atoms, possibly an ether or ester with a double bond.\n\nGiven that there's a carbonyl group (from the 1700 cm\u207b\u00b9 peak), I think C6H10O2 is a strong candidate because it can accommodate two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms, possibly as a carboxylic acid group (COOH) and a double bond.\n\nBut wait, carboxylic acids have a carbonyl and an O-H, which would fit the FTIR data.\n\nLet's consider the mass spectrum. There's a fragment peak at m/z=45. What could this correspond to?\n\n- For C6H10O2 (MW=114), a fragment at 45 would suggest a loss of 69 (114-45=69). If the compound is a carboxylic acid, perhaps loss of a fragment like CH3CH2CH2CH2+ (which is 43, not 45).\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, if it's an ester, it might have a structure like esters, with a carbonyl and an O-R group.\n\nBut let's think about possible structures for each formula.\n\nFor C6H10O2:\n\n- Hex-2-enoic acid: C6H10O2, with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group. This would fit the FTIR data with O-H and carbonyl peaks.\n\n- Methyl pent-2-enoate: Also C6H10O2, with a carbonyl and a double bond.\n\nFor C6H12O2:\n\n- Hex-3-ene-1,6-diol: C6H12O2, with a double bond and two O-H groups. This would fit the O-H peak but may not have a strong carbonyl peak unless there's a ketone or aldehyde present.\n\n- Hex-3-ene-1-ol-6-one: C6H12O2, with a double bond, an O-H, and a carbonyl group. This might fit all the spectral data.\n\nFor C6H12O:\n\n- Hex-3-ene-1-ol: C6H12O, with a double bond and an O-H group. But lacks the carbonyl group, which is suggested by the FTIR.\n\n- Cyclohexene-1-ol: Also C6H10O, but that's a different formula.\n\nWait, C6H12O corresponds to 1 degree of unsaturation, which could be a double bond or a ring.\n\nFor C6H10O:\n\n- Hex-2-ene-4-one: C6H10O, with a double bond and a carbonyl group. This would fit the carbonyl peak but may not have the O-H peak unless there's an additional O-H group, which might not be the case.\n\n- Cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbaldehyde: C6H10O, with a ring and a carbonyl group.\n\nBut the FTIR shows an O-H stretch, so there should be an O-H group present.\n\nLooking back, perhaps C6H12O2 is the best fit because it can accommodate the double bond, the O-H group, and the carbonyl group.\n\nNow, considering the mass spectrum fragment at m/z=45.\n\nWhat molecular ion would correspond to C6H12O2? MW=116.\n\nA fragment at m/z=45 would suggest a loss of 71 (116-45=71). What fragment could correspond to m/z=45?\n\nPossible fragments:\n\n- CH3CO: 43 (acetate without a hydrogen)\n\n- CH3CH2OH: 46 (but that's higher than 45)\n\n- CH2=CH2: 28 (ethylene)\n\n- Something else.\n\nMaybe the fragment is CH3CO less a hydrogen, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at m/z=114, corresponding to C6H10O2.\n\nWait, C6H10O2 has MW=114, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, if the molecular ion is at m/z=114, and there's a fragment at m/z=45, that would suggest a loss of 69 (114-45=69).\n\nWhat fragment corresponds to m/z=45 in C6H10O2?\n\nPossibly, a ketone group or an aldehyde group could fragment to give a smaller fragment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a propionyl group or something similar.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the options again.\n\nGiven that the FTIR shows O-H, carbonyl, and possibly a C=C bond, and the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, and the mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z=45.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. C6H10O2\n\nB. C6H12O2\n\nC. C6H12O\n\nD. C6H10O\n\nI think C6H10O2 is the most likely candidate because it can accommodate two degrees of unsaturation, which could be from a double bond and a carbonyl group, along with the O-H group.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. C6H10O2.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
