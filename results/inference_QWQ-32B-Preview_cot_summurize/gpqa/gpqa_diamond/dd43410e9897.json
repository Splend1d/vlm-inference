                    "text": "So I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about two electrons in p orbitals, and we're ignoring their spin angular momenta. We're given the coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system as |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l\u2081 and l\u2082 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for electrons 1 and 2, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum number and its z-component for the two-electron system.\n\nThe question is asking for the joint probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z and getting eigenvalues of -\u210f for each.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these quantum numbers represent. For a single electron in a p orbital, l = 1, and m can be -1, 0, or 1, corresponding to the three possible orientations of the orbital angular momentum.\n\nSince we have two electrons, each with l = 1, the total angular momentum quantum number l can range from |l\u2081 - l\u2082| to l\u2081 + l\u2082 in integer steps. So, l can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nIn this problem, we're given l = 2 and m = -1, so we're dealing with the state where the total angular momentum is in the l = 2, m = -1 state.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of measuring L\u2081z = -\u210f and L\u2082z = -\u210f simultaneously.\n\nTo find this probability, I think I need to express the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the uncoupled states |l\u2081, m\u2081; l\u2082, m\u2082>.\n\nThe general expression for the coupled state is:\n\n|l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> = \u03a3 [C^{l\u2081 l\u2082 l m}_{m\u2081 m\u2082}] |l\u2081, m\u2081; l\u2082, m\u2082>\n\nwhere C are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nSo, for |1,1,2,-1>, it should be expressed as a combination of |l\u2081, m\u2081; l\u2082, m\u2082> states where m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m = -1.\n\nGiven that l\u2081 = 1 and l\u2082 = 1, and l = 2, m = -1, I need to find the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this specific case.\n\nLooking up the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l\u2081 = 1, l\u2082 = 1, l = 2, m = -1, I find:\n\n|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt(2/3) |1,0;1,-1> - sqrt(1/3) |1,-1;1,0>\n\nSo, the state is a linear combination of |1,0;1,-1> and |1,-1;1,0>.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the probability of measuring L\u2081z = -\u210f and L\u2082z = -\u210f, which corresponds to m\u2081 = -1 and m\u2082 = -1, i.e., the state |1,-1;1,-1>.\n\nLooking at the expansion above, there is no |1,-1;1,-1> term in the expression for |1,1,2,-1>. It only has |1,0;1,-1> and |1,-1;1,0>.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient for |1,-1;1,-1> is zero, which means the probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u210f is zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 0.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check this. Maybe I mislooked the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAnother way is to consider the addition of angular momenta. For two angular momenta l\u2081 and l\u2082, the possible total angular momenta l are l\u2081 + l\u2082 down to |l\u2081 - l\u2082| in integer steps.\n\nIn this case, l\u2081 = 1, l\u2082 = 1, so l can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nGiven that we're in the l = 2, m = -1 state, we can use the fact that in the coupled representation, the state |l\u2081, l\u2082, l, m> is a combination of the uncoupled states |l\u2081, m\u2081; l\u2082, m\u2082> with m\u2081 + m\u2082 = m.\n\nSo, for m = -1, we have m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -1.\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n- m\u2081 = 0, m\u2082 = -1\n\n- m\u2081 = -1, m\u2082 = 0\n\n- m\u2081 = 1, m\u2082 = -2 (but m\u2082 cannot be -2 for l\u2082 = 1, since m\u2082 ranges from -1 to 1)\n\n- m\u2081 = -2, m\u2082 = 1 (similarly, m\u2081 cannot be -2)\n\nSo, only the first two combinations are possible.\n\nTherefore, |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |1,0;1,-1> and |1,-1;1,0>, as I had earlier.\n\nSince |1,-1;1,-1> is not in this expansion, the probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u210f is indeed zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the possibility of both electrons having m\u2081 = -1 and m\u2082 = -1, but in that case, m_total = m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -2, which would correspond to l = 2, m = -2 state, not m = -1.\n\nBut in our case, we're in the m = -1 state, so again, it confirms that the probability is zero.\n\nWait a minute, but let's think about the Pauli exclusion principle. Since we're dealing with electrons, which are fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under the exchange of the two electrons.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we're only considering the orbital angular momentum and ignoring spin. So, the orbital part must be antisymmetric if the spin part is symmetric, or vice versa.\n\nBut since we're ignoring spin in this problem, I'm not sure how to factor that in. Maybe I shouldn't worry about it for now, as the problem specifies to ignore spin.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state |1,1,2,-1> is not properly antisymmetrized, but again, since the problem says to ignore spin, maybe it's okay.\n\nBut to be sure, perhaps I should consider the antisymmetric combination of the orbitals.\n\nWait, but the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients don't take into account the statistics of the particles; they just deal with the addition of angular momenta.\n\nSo, perhaps the actual state of the two electrons should be the antisymmetric combination of the uncoupled states.\n\nBut if I do that, it might affect the probabilities.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nSuppose I have two electrons in p orbitals, with orbital angular momentum l = 1 each.\n\nThe coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific combination of the uncoupled states, as I had earlier.\n\nBut for electrons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.\n\nSo, if I have the orbital part in a symmetric state, the spin part must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.\n\nBut since we're ignoring spin in this problem, perhaps the orbital part should be antisymmetric.\n\nNow, the state |1,1,2,-1> is symmetric under exchange of the two electrons, because in the expansion, |1,0;1,-1> and |1,-1;1,0> are symmetric.\n\nWait, is that true?\n\nActually, |1,0;1,-1> + |1,-1;1,0> is symmetric under exchange, while |1,0;1,-1> - |1,-1;1,0> is antisymmetric.\n\nLooking back at the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, for l = 2, m = -1, the coefficient is sqrt(2/3)|1,0;1,-1> - sqrt(1/3)|1,-1;1,0>.\n\nThis is not symmetric or antisymmetric, it's a specific combination.\n\nBut in reality, for electrons, we need to make sure the total wavefunction is antisymmetric.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to consider the antisymmetric combination of the uncoupled states.\n\nBut the problem says to ignore spin, so maybe I should proceed as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability is still zero, regardless of symmetrization.\n\nBecause even if I have an antisymmetric combination, the |1,-1;1,-1> state would still not be present, since m\u2081 + m\u2082 = -2, which corresponds to a different m_total.\n\nWait, but m_total = -2 would correspond to l = 2, m = -2 state, not m = -1.\n\nSo, in any case, the |1,-1;1,-1> state is not part of the m = -1 state.\n\nTherefore, the probability of measuring both L\u2081z and L\u2082z as -\u210f is zero.\n\nSo, the answer should be A. 0.\n\nBut let's see why the other options might be incorrect.\n\nOption B is 2/3, which might correspond to the coefficient squared of one of the terms in the expansion, but that's not the case here.\n\nOption C is 1, which would mean certainty, but clearly, it's not the case.\n\nOption D is 1/2, which doesn't seem to relate to this specific state.\n\nTherefore, A. 0 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
