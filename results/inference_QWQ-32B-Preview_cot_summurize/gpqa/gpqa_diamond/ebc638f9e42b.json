                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an astronaut who's 22 years old, and he's going to travel from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth on a spacecraft that moves at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. We need to figure out how long the journey will take from the astronaut's point of view, and see which option fits best.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basics about special relativity because when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation becomes a significant factor. Time dilation means that time passes differently for the astronaut on the spacecraft compared to observers who are stationary relative to the Large Magellanic Cloud or Earth.\n\nThe formula for time dilation is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\( t' \\) is the time measured by the moving observer (the astronaut),\n\n- \\( t \\) is the time measured by the stationary observer,\n\n- \\( v \\) is the velocity of the moving observer,\n\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nBut wait, in this problem, we need to find the time experienced by the astronaut, which is \\( t' \\), and we need to relate it to the distance traveled and the speed of the spacecraft.\n\nFirst, I should find out the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. I know that the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and it's approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth.\n\nSo, the distance \\( d \\) is about 163,000 light-years.\n\nThe spacecraft travels at \\( v = 0.99999987 c \\).\n\nFrom the perspective of an observer on Earth or in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the time \\( t \\) it takes to travel that distance would be:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{d}{v} = \\frac{163,000 \\text{ light-years}}{0.99999987 c} \\]\n\nBut since a light-year is the distance light travels in one year, and the speed of light \\( c \\) is one light-year per year, this simplifies to:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{163,000 \\text{ years}}{0.99999987} \\approx 163,000.002 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nHowever, this is the time measured by a stationary observer. The astronaut on the spacecraft will experience time dilation, so the time he perceives, \\( t' \\), will be less than this due to his high speed.\n\nUsing the time dilation formula:\n\n\\[ t' = t \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ t' = 163,000.002 \\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( (0.99999987)^2 \\):\n\n\\[ (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026 \\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t' = 163,000.002 \\times \\sqrt{0.00000026} \\]\n\nCalculating the square root:\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{0.00000026} \\approx 0.00051 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ t' \\approx 163,000.002 \\times 0.00051 \\approx 83.13 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nBut the astronaut is currently 22 years old. So, his age when he reaches Earth would be:\n\n\\[ 22 + 83.13 = 105.13 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nNow, the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years, so 105 years is well within their average lifespan. However, we need to check the options provided:\n\nA. 77 years\n\nB. The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.\n\nC. 72 years\n\nD. 81 years\n\nOur calculation gives approximately 83 years, which is closest to option D. 81 years. But let's double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, the distance is 163,000 light-years.\n\nSpeed is \\( 0.99999987 c \\).\n\nTime from stationary frame:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{163,000 \\text{ light-years}}{0.99999987 c} \\approx 163,000.002 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nTime dilation factor:\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.00000026}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.00051} \\approx 1960.78 \\]\n\nWait a minute, I think I made a mistake here. The time experienced by the astronaut is:\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{t}{\\gamma} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\gamma \\) is the Lorentz factor.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ t' = \\frac{163,000.002 \\text{ years}}{1960.78} \\approx 83.13 \\text{ years} \\]\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nGiven that the astronaut is 22 years old now, he would be about 105 years old upon arrival, which is less than the average lifetime of 150 years, so option B is incorrect.\n\nAmong the given options, 81 years (option D) is the closest to our calculated 83.13 years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 81 years.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
