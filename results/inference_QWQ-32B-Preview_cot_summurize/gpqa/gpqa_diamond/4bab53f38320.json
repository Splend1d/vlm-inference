                    "text": "Let's tackle this NMR problem. We have a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two signals around 6.7 ppm (two singlets in a 1:1 ratio) and three signals around 2.2 ppm (all singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio).\n\nFirst, I need to understand what these signals represent. The signals around 6.7 ppm are likely from aromatic protons, since aromatic protons typically resonate between 6.5 and 8.0 ppm. The fact that there are two singlets in a 1:1 ratio suggests that there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each set being equivalent within itself.\n\nThe signals around 2.2 ppm are probably from methyl groups (CH3), as methyl protons often resonate around 0.8-1.5 ppm, but in this case, they might be influenced by neighboring groups, shifting them to higher fields. However, 2.2 ppm is a bit unusual for methyl groups, so maybe they are methine (CH) or methylene (CH2) groups.\n\nGiven that both compounds have the molecular formula C10H14, they are likely to be tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes, as suggested by the options.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene\n\nB. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nC. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\n\nD. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\n\nFirst, I need to draw out the structures of these compounds to see how their protons would appear in an NMR spectrum.\n\nStarting with option A:\n\n1. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nThis would have methyl groups at positions 1,2,3, and 5 on the benzene ring. Let's see how many unique sets of aromatic protons there are.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the substitution pattern is as follows:\n\n- Positions 1,2,3,5 have methyl groups.\n\n- Positions 4 and 6 are hydrogen atoms.\n\nGiven the symmetry, positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, so there would be only one set of aromatic protons at around 6.7 ppm.\n\n2. 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\nThis has ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring.\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, the substitution is symmetric, so there would be only one set of aromatic protons.\n\nBut the NMR spectrum shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, which suggests two distinct sets of aromatic protons. So, if we have one compound with one set and another with one set, in a 1:1 mixture, we might see two singlets in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nNow, let's check the protons below 2.2 ppm.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are only methyl groups attached to the ring, which should appear around 2.2 ppm.\n\nEach methyl group is equivalent in this compound, so there should be only one signal around 2.2 ppm from all the methyl groups.\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, there are ethyl groups attached to the ring. Each ethyl group has two sets of protons: the methylene (CH2) and the methyl (CH3).\n\nHowever, in a 1:1 mixture, if both compounds are present equally, the signals from their protons should add up accordingly.\n\nBut the spectrum shows three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, all as singlets.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider the chemical shifts and equivalence of protons more carefully.\n\nLet me consider option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFirst, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nThis has methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5.\n\nThe remaining positions are 3 and 6, which are both hydrogen atoms.\n\nGiven the symmetry, positions 3 and 6 are equivalent, so one set of aromatic protons.\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nThis has methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nThe remaining positions are 4 and 6, which are hydrogen atoms.\n\nAgain, positions 4 and 6 are equivalent, so one set of aromatic protons.\n\nIn a 1:1 mixture, we would see two singlets from the aromatic protons, which matches the spectrum.\n\nNow, looking at the protons below 2.2 ppm:\n\nBoth compounds have methyl groups attached to the ring.\n\nIn 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,4,5.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nGiven that methyl groups attached to different positions on the ring can have slightly different chemical shifts due to differences in electronic environment, it's possible to have multiple signals from methyl groups.\n\nBut in both compounds, there are four methyl groups, and in the mixture, they might split into multiple signals.\n\nHowever, the spectrum shows three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis suggests that among all the methyl groups from both compounds, there are three distinct environments with integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis seems plausible if some methyl groups are in equivalent positions across both compounds.\n\nSimilarly, for option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nFollowing similar reasoning, both compounds would each have one set of aromatic protons, leading to two singlets in the mixture.\n\nThe methyl groups would again possibly split into multiple signals based on their environments.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nAgain, each would have one set of aromatic protons, leading to two singlets in the mixture.\n\nNow, to decide between these options, I need to consider the proton environments more carefully.\n\nPerhaps looking at the number of unique methyl groups in each option's mixture.\n\nLet me consider option A again: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, there are four methyl groups.\n\nIn 1,4-diethylbenzene, there are two ethyl groups, each consisting of one CH2 and one CH3.\n\nSo, in total, in the mixture, there are methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene and from the diethylbenzene.\n\nThe CH2 groups in the ethyl chains might also appear around 2.2 ppm, depending on their environment.\n\nThis could lead to multiple signals from different types of protons.\n\nBut the spectrum shows three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nThis suggests that there are three distinct sets of equivalent protons, with integrals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nIn option A, the methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene might be one set, and the methyl and methylene groups from the diethylbenzene might be the other sets.\n\nBut it's unclear without drawing the structures and assigning the protons.\n\nLet me try to sketch the structures:\n\n1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\nBenzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nThe remaining positions 4 and 6 have hydrogen atoms.\n\n1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\nBenzene ring with ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.\n\nEach ethyl group has a CH2 and a CH3.\n\nIn the NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons from both compounds should appear as two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, assuming they are distinct.\n\nNow, for the protons below 2.2 ppm:\n\n- Methyl groups from 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\n- Methyl groups from the ethyls in 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n- Methylene groups from the ethyls in 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nThis could potentially lead to three different signals, depending on their chemical environments.\n\nSimilarly, in option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nBoth are tetramethylbenzenes, so only methyl groups attached to the ring.\n\nHowever, the methyl groups might have slightly different chemical shifts depending on their positions.\n\nBut it's less likely to produce three distinct signals compared to option A, which includes both methyl and methylene groups.\n\nTherefore, option A seems more plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the methyl groups in option A could lead to more than three signals, which contradicts the spectrum.\n\nI need to consider the integration ratios.\n\nThe aromatic protons are in a 1:1 ratio, which makes sense for a 1:1 mixture.\n\nThe signals below 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nIf we have two compounds in a 1:1 ratio, and their proton environments combine to give three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio, we need to see how that adds up.\n\nSuppose one compound has protons that integrate to a certain value, and the other has protons that integrate to another value.\n\nBut it's getting a bit complicated without specific integration values.\n\nMaybe I should consider the number of unique proton environments in each option.\n\nOption A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: four methyl groups, likely as one signal.\n\n- 1,4-diethylbenzene: two ethyl groups, each with one CH2 and one CH3.\n\n- So, potentially, one signal from the methyl groups of the tetramethylbenzene, one from the CH3 of the ethyl groups, and one from the CH2 of the ethyl groups.\n\nThis would give three signals in the NMR spectrum.\n\nIf the integration is 2:1:1, it could correspond to the relative number of protons: the methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene (12 protons, four methyls times three protons each), and the CH3 and CH2 from the ethyl groups (3 and 2 protons respectively).\n\nBut in a 1:1 mixture, the total protons would be:\n\n- From 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: 4 methyls * 3H = 12H.\n\n- From 1,4-diethylbenzene: 2 ethyls * (2H + 3H) = 10H.\n\nTotal protons: 22H.\n\nThe signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nAssuming the largest integral corresponds to the methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene (12H), and the other two signals correspond to the CH3 and CH2 from the ethyl groups (3H and 2H), the ratio would be 12:3:2, which is approximately 6:1.5:1.\n\nThis doesn't match the given 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, option A may not be correct.\n\nLet me consider option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nBoth are tetramethylbenzenes, so only methyl groups attached to the ring.\n\nHowever, the methyl groups may have slightly different chemical shifts depending on their positions.\n\nIf there are three distinct positions for the methyl groups across both compounds, that could lead to three signals.\n\nBut in a 1:1 mixture, the integration ratios need to add up to 2:1:1.\n\nAssuming each methyl group is unique in terms of its chemical shift, but some might overlap.\n\nThis seems a bit vague.\n\nPerhaps option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nSimilar to option B, both are tetramethylbenzenes with methyl groups at different positions, leading to potentially three distinct signals from the methyl groups.\n\nAgain, the integration ratios need to match 2:1:1.\n\nOption D: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nSame as above.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nGiven that in the mixture, the aromatic protons would be in a 1:1 ratio, and the methyl groups could give three distinct signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut without more specific information, it's hard to be certain.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is option A: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.\n\nThis would introduce both methyl and methylene groups, which could explain the three signals at 2.2 ppm.\n\nHowever, earlier calculations didn't match the integration ratios.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming the number of protons.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nIn a 1:1 mixture of 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene:\n\n- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: 4 methyl groups * 3H = 12H.\n\n- 1,4-diethylbenzene: 2 ethyl groups * (2H + 3H) = 10H.\n\nTotal protons: 22H.\n\nThe signals at 2.2 ppm are in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nIf we assume the largest integral corresponds to the methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzene (12H), and the other two signals correspond to the CH3 and CH2 from the ethyl groups (3H and 2H), then the ratio is 12:3:2.\n\nTo make this a 2:1:1 ratio, we can divide everything by 6:\n\n12/6 = 2, 3/6 = 0.5, 2/6 \u2248 0.33.\n\nThis doesn't match the given 2:1:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, option A is unlikely.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the methyl groups from the tetramethylbenzenes might not all be equivalent due to different positions.\n\nWait a minute, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups are in different positions, so their chemical shifts might differ.\n\nSimilarly, in 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups might have different chemical shifts.\n\nThis could lead to multiple signals from the methyl groups.\n\nLet's consider option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.\n\nIn 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\n- Methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5.\n\n- Positions 3 and 6 have hydrogen atoms.\n\nIn 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\n- Methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,5.\n\n- Positions 4 and 6 have hydrogen atoms.\n\nNow, in the mixture, the methyl groups could have different chemical shifts based on their\u90bb\u4f4dsubstitutions.\n\nPossibly, some methyl groups are adjacent to other methyl groups, while others are not.\n\nThis could lead to differences in chemical shift.\n\nAssuming that in both compounds, the methyl groups at positions 1 and 2 are equivalent, and positions 4 and 5 are equivalent in one compound, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent in the other.\n\nThis could result in three distinct signals from the methyl groups.\n\nLet's try to count the protons:\n\n- In 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\n- Positions 1 and 2: two methyl groups, equivalent, total 6H.\n\n- Positions 4 and 5: two methyl groups, equivalent, total 6H.\n\nBut depending on the exact positions, they might not be equivalent due to the different substitutions around the ring.\n\nSimilarly, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene:\n\n- Positions 1 and 2: two methyl groups, equivalent, total 6H.\n\n- Positions 3 and 5: two methyl groups, equivalent, total 6H.\n\nAgain, their chemical shifts might differ based on the neighboring groups.\n\nIn the mixture, we have:\n\n- From 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two sets of methyl groups, possibly different chemical shifts.\n\n- From 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: two sets of methyl groups, possibly different chemical shifts.\n\nThis could lead to up to four different signals, but the spectrum shows only three signals at 2.2 ppm.\n\nPerhaps some of these signals overlap.\n\nAlternatively, maybe one set from each compound overlaps, resulting in three distinct signals.\n\nGiven that, the integration ratios need to add up to 2:1:1.\n\nAssuming each set has 6H, in a 1:1 mixture, each set would contribute 6H, totaling 24H from methyl groups.\n\nBut the total protons below 2.2 ppm are integrated to a 2:1:1 ratio, totaling 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 parts.\n\nIf 24H are divided into 4 parts, each part is 6H.\n\nThus, the 2:1:1 ratio would correspond to 12"
