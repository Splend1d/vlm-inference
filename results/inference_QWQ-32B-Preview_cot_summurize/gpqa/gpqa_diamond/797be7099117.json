                    "text": "Let's tackle this titration problem step by step. We have 20.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.05 M acetic acid that we're diluting with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, and then we're titrating that mixture with 0.1 M NaOH at 25\u00b0C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's happening here. We have a weak acid, acetic acid, and we're titrating it with a strong base, NaOH. The dilution step is straightforward: we're mixing equal volumes of acetic acid and water, so the concentration of acetic acid should be halved.\n\nLet's calculate the initial moles of acetic acid:\n\nVolume of acetic acid = 20.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.02000 L\n\nConcentration of acetic acid = 0.05 M\n\nMoles of acetic acid = volume \u00d7 concentration = 0.02000 L \u00d7 0.05 mol/L = 0.0010 mol\n\nAfter diluting with 20.00 cm\u00b3 of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.04000 L\n\nNew concentration of acetic acid = moles / total volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.04000 L = 0.025 M\n\nNow, we're titrating this 0.025 M acetic acid solution with 0.1 M NaOH.\n\nFirst, let's find the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point.\n\nAt equivalence point, moles of NaOH added = moles of acetic acid initially present\n\nMoles of acetic acid = 0.0010 mol\n\nConcentration of NaOH = 0.1 M\n\nVolume of NaOH needed = moles / concentration = 0.0010 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.010 L = 10.00 cm\u00b3\n\nSo, the equivalence point is reached when 10.00 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M NaOH is added.\n\nNow, we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.\n\nFirst, let's find the pH at 25% titration.\n\n25% titration means that 25% of the equivalence point volume of NaOH has been added.\n\nVolume of NaOH added = 25% of 10.00 cm\u00b3 = 2.50 cm\u00b3\n\nMoles of NaOH added = volume \u00d7 concentration = 0.0025 L \u00d7 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol\n\nNow, we have a buffer solution consisting of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ion, formed by the reaction of acetic acid with NaOH.\n\nThe reaction is:\n\nCH\u2083COOH + OH\u207b \u2192 CH\u2083COO\u207b + H\u2082O\n\nMoles of acetic acid initially = 0.0010 mol\n\nMoles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol\n\nSo, moles of acetic acid remaining = 0.0010 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol\n\nMoles of acetate ion formed = moles of NaOH added = 0.00025 mol\n\nTotal volume after adding NaOH = initial volume of acetic acid + volume of water + volume of NaOH added = 20.00 cm\u00b3 + 20.00 cm\u00b3 + 2.50 cm\u00b3 = 42.50 cm\u00b3 = 0.04250 L\n\nNow, concentrations:\n\n[CH\u2083COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.04250 L \u2248 0.01765 M\n\n[CH\u2083COO\u207b] = 0.00025 mol / 0.04250 L \u2248 0.00588 M\n\nNow, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH:\n\npH = pKa + log ([A\u207b]/[HA])\n\nWhere pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075) \u2248 4.73\n\n[A\u207b] = [CH\u2083COO\u207b] = 0.00588 M\n\n[HA] = [CH\u2083COOH] = 0.01765 M\n\nSo,\n\npH = 4.73 + log (0.00588 / 0.01765) \u2248 4.73 + log (0.333) \u2248 4.73 - 0.477 \u2248 4.253\n\nSo, pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.25\n\nNow, let's find the pH at the equivalence point.\n\nAt the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH, and we have only the acetate ion in solution.\n\nMoles of acetate ion = moles of acetic acid initially = 0.0010 mol\n\nTotal volume at equivalence point = initial volume of acetic acid + volume of water + volume of NaOH added = 20.00 cm\u00b3 + 20.00 cm\u00b3 + 10.00 cm\u00b3 = 50.00 cm\u00b3 = 0.05000 L\n\nConcentration of acetate ion = moles / volume = 0.0010 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.020 M\n\nNow, acetate ion will hydrolyze in water to produce OH\u207b ions, making the solution basic.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nCH\u2083COO\u207b + H\u2082O \u21cc CH\u2083COOH + OH\u207b\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, Kb, which is related to the acid dissociation constant, Ka, of acetic acid by the expression:\n\nKb = Kw / Ka\n\nWhere Kw is the ion product constant for water, which is 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 at 25\u00b0C.\n\nSo,\n\nKb = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 / 1.85 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075 \u2248 5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070\n\nNow, we can set up an ICE table for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nInitial:\n\n[CH\u2083COO\u207b] = 0.020 M\n\n[CH\u2083COOH] = 0 M\n\n[OH\u207b] = 0 M\n\nChange:\n\n[CH\u2083COO\u207b] decreases by x M\n\n[CH\u2083COOH] increases by x M\n\n[OH\u207b] increases by x M\n\nEquilibrium:\n\n[CH\u2083COO\u207b] = 0.020 - x\n\n[CH\u2083COOH] = x\n\n[OH\u207b] = x\n\nNow, the expression for Kb is:\n\nKb = [CH\u2083COOH][OH\u207b] / [CH\u2083COO\u207b]\n\nAssuming x is small compared to 0.020 M, we can approximate:\n\nKb \u2248 x\u00b2 / 0.020\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 \u2248 Kb \u00d7 0.020 \u2248 5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 \u00d7 0.020 \u2248 1.082 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9\n\nTherefore,\n\nx \u2248 \u221a(1.082 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9) \u2248 1.04 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 M\n\nSo, [OH\u207b] \u2248 1.04 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 M\n\nNow, we can find pOH:\n\npOH = -log[OH\u207b] \u2248 -log(1.04 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076) \u2248 5.98\n\nAnd pH = 14 - pOH \u2248 14 - 5.98 \u2248 8.02\n\nWait, but the options don't have 8.02. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should have considered the concentration more accurately.\n\nWait, total volume at equivalence point is 50.00 cm\u00b3, and moles of acetate ion are 0.0010 mol, so concentration is 0.0010 mol / 0.05000 L = 0.020 M, which is correct.\n\nKb = 5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 is also correct.\n\nBut perhaps the approximation x << 0.020 M is not valid here. Let's solve the quadratic equation exactly.\n\nThe exact expression is:\n\nKb = x\u00b2 / (0.020 - x)\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + Kb x - Kb \u00d7 0.020 = 0\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx\u00b2 + (5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070) x - (5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 \u00d7 0.020) = 0\n\nx\u00b2 + (5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070) x - 1.082 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac) ] / (2a)\n\nHere, a = 1, b = 5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070, c = -1.082 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9\n\nDiscriminant D = b\u00b2 - 4ac = (5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070)\u00b2 - 4 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 (-1.082 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9) \u2248 0 + 4.328 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9 \u2248 4.328 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ -5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 + \u221a(4.328 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9) ] / 2\n\nx \u2248 [ -5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 + 6.58 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 ] / 2 \u2248 ( -5.41 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2070 + 6.58 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 ) / 2 \u2248 6.58 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 / 2 \u2248 3.29 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 M\n\nSo, [OH\u207b] \u2248 3.29 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 M\n\npOH = -log(3.29 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076) \u2248 5.48\n\npH = 14 - 5.48 \u2248 8.52\n\nOkay, now this matches option C.\n\nWait, but earlier I had pH \u2248 8.02 with approximation, but solving quadratically gives pH \u2248 8.52.\n\nSo, at equivalence point, pH is approximately 8.52.\n\nNow, let's recall the pH at 25% titration was approximately 4.25.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 3.17; 6.73\n\nB. 4.57; 6.92\n\nC. 4.26; 8.52\n\nD. 4.73; 7.00\n\nOur calculated values are pH \u2248 4.25 at 25% titration and pH \u2248 8.52 at equivalence point, which matches option C.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 4.26; 8.52\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C. } 4.26; 8.52} \\]"
