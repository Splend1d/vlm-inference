                    "text": "So I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. First, I need to make sure that this state is normalized because probabilities have to add up to one. So, I should find the normalization constant.\n\nThe general form is |alpha> = N[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where N is the normalization constant.\n\nTo find N, I need to ensure that <alpha|alpha> = 1.\n\nSo, <alpha|alpha> = N*[(1-i)|up< + (2+i)|down<] * N[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\n= N*N [ (1-i)(1+i) <up|up> + (1-i)(2-i) <up|down> + (2+i)(1+i) <down|up> + (2+i)(2-i) <down|down> ]\n\nSince |up> and |down> are orthogonal, <up|down> = <down|up> = 0.\n\nAnd <up|up> = <down|down> = 1.\n\nSo, <alpha|alpha> = N*N [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) ] = N*N [ (1 + 1) + (4 + 1) ] = N*N [2 + 5] = 7 N*N\n\nSet this equal to 1: 7 N*N = 1 => N = 1/sqrt(7)\n\nSo, |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\nNow, I need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of some operator A, whose matrix elements are given by Aij = hbar/2 if i \u2260 j, and 0 otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what operator A is. Since it's given in matrix form, and it's off-diagonal with Aij = hbar/2 for i \u2260 j and 0 otherwise, it must be something like:\n\nA = [ 0, hbar/2 ]\n\n[ hbar/2, 0 ]\n\nThis looks like the x-component of the spin operator, Sx, for a spin-1/2 particle, which is indeed (hbar/2) * \u03c3x, where \u03c3x is the Pauli matrix for x.\n\nSo, A = (hbar/2) \u03c3x = (hbar/2) [ 0 1; 1 0 ]\n\nEigenstates of Sx are the eigenstates of \u03c3x.\n\nLet's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.\n\nThe eigenvalues \u03bb satisfy det(A - \u03bbI) = 0\n\nSo, det[ (hbar/2)(\u03c3x - (2\u03bb/hbar)I) ] = 0\n\nBut since hbar/2 is a scalar, det(\u03c3x - (2\u03bb/hbar)I) = 0\n\nBut \u03c3x is [0 1; 1 0], so:\n\ndet[ - (2\u03bb/hbar) 1; 1 - (2\u03bb/hbar) ] = ( -2\u03bb/hbar )( -2\u03bb/hbar ) - 1*1 = (4\u03bb^2/hbar^2) - 1 = 0\n\nSo, 4\u03bb^2 = hbar^2 => \u03bb^2 = (hbar^2)/4 => \u03bb = \u00b1 hbar/2\n\nSo, eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.\n\nNow, find the eigenvectors.\n\nFor \u03bb = +hbar/2:\n\n(A - \u03bbI)v = 0 => [0 - hbar/2; hbar/2 0] v = 0\n\nSo, [ -hbar/2 v1 + hbar/2 v2 = 0 ]\n\n[ hbar/2 v1 - hbar/2 v2 = 0 ]\n\nBoth equations give v1 = v2.\n\nSo, eigenvector for \u03bb = +hbar/2 is [1; 1], or |+x> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>)\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = -hbar/2:\n\n[ hbar/2 v1 + hbar/2 v2 = 0 ]\n\n[ -hbar/2 v1 + hbar/2 v2 = 0 ]\n\nBoth equations give v1 = -v2.\n\nSo, eigenvector is [1; -1], or |-x> = (1/sqrt(2))(|up> - |down>)\n\nNow, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in these eigenstates, given that it's in state |alpha>.\n\nSo, the probability of measuring |+x> is |<+x|alpha>|^2\n\nSimilarly, probability of measuring |-x> is |<-x|alpha>|^2\n\nFirst, find <+x|alpha>:\n\n<+x|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [<up| + <down|] * (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\n= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|down> ] = (1/sqrt(14)) [1+i + 2 - i] = (1/sqrt(14))(3)\n\nSo, |<+x|alpha>|^2 = (9)/14 \u2248 0.6429\n\nSimilarly, <-x|alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [<up| - <down|] * (1/sqrt(7))[(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>]\n\n= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] = (1/sqrt(14)) [-1 + 2i]\n\nSo, |<-x|alpha>|^2 = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 \u2248 0.3571\n\nSo, probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.\n\nNow, I need to find the average value of the operator A.\n\nThe average value <A> is <alpha|A|alpha>\n\nFirst, express A in terms of |up> and |down>.\n\nA = (hbar/2) [ |up><down| + |down><up| ]\n\nSo, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2) [ <alpha|up><down|alpha> + <alpha|down><up|alpha> ]\n\nFirst, find <alpha|up> and <alpha|down>:\n\n<alpha|up> = (1/sqrt(7))(1 - i)\n\n<alpha|down> = (1/sqrt(7))(2 + i)\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2) [ (1 - i)(2 + i) + (2 + i)(1 - i) ]\n\nCompute (1 - i)(2 + i) = 2 + i - 2i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i\n\nSimilarly, (2 + i)(1 - i) = 2 - 2i + i - i^2 = 2 - i + 1 = 3 - i\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2)(3 - i + 3 - i) = (hbar/2)(6 - 2i) = (hbar)(3 - i)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Probabilities came out real, but the expectation value has an imaginary part. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, actually, in quantum mechanics, expectation values of Hermitian operators should be real. A is Hermitian because it's a spin operator. So, I must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nGiven A = (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|), which is Hermitian.\n\nNow, <A> = (hbar/2)[ <alpha|up><down|alpha> + <alpha|down><up|alpha> ]\n\nWe have <alpha|up> = (1 - i)/sqrt(7)\n\n<alpha|down> = (2 + i)/sqrt(7)\n\n|alpha> is N[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>], N = 1/sqrt(7)\n\nSo, <down|alpha> = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)\n\n<up|alpha> = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)\n\nWait, I think I confused <alpha|up> and <up|alpha>. Actually, <up|alpha> = N*(1 + i), and <down|alpha> = N*(2 - i)\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2)[ <alpha|up><down|alpha> + <alpha|down><up|alpha> ] = (hbar/2)[ (<up|alpha>)* <down|alpha> + (<down|alpha>)* <up|alpha> ]\n\nWait, <alpha|up> = (<up|alpha>)^* = N*(1 - i)\n\nSimilarly, <alpha|down> = N*(2 + i)\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2)[ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]\n\nCompute (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 2 - 3i - 1 = 1 - 3i\n\n(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i\n\nAdd them: (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 2\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2)(2) = hbar\n\nWait, but this doesn't match any of the options. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the matrix A. The matrix A is given by Aij = hbar/2 if i \u2260 j, and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn the computational basis {|up>, |down>}, this is A = [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0], which is indeed (hbar/2) \u03c3x.\n\nBut in standard quantum mechanics, Sx = (hbar/2) \u03c3x, and its eigenvalues are \u00b1hbar/2.\n\nBut when I calculate <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> = (hbar/2)( <alpha|up><down|alpha> + <alpha|down><up|alpha> )\n\nWith <alpha|up> = N*(1 - i), <alpha|down> = N*(2 + i), <down|alpha> = N*(2 - i), <up|alpha> = N*(1 + i)\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2)[ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ] / 7\n\nWait, N = 1/sqrt(7), but in the inner products, it's N^2 = 1/7.\n\nWait, no: <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [<up| (1 - i) + <down| (2 + i)] A [ (1 + i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express A in matrix form and compute <A> directly.\n\nGiven |alpha> = N[(1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>], N = 1/sqrt(7)\n\nSo, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7); (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]\n\nA = [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0]\n\nThen, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * A * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7); (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]\n\n= [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7); (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ]\n\nFirst, compute A * |alpha>:\n\nA * |alpha> = [0, hbar/2; hbar/2, 0] * [ (1 + i)/sqrt(7); (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] = [ (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7); (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]\n\nThen, <alpha| A |alpha> = [ (1 - i)/sqrt(7), (2 + i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (hbar/2)(2 - i)/sqrt(7); (hbar/2)(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]\n\n= (1 - i)(hbar/2)(2 - i)/7 + (2 + i)(hbar/2)(1 + i)/7\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 - i - 2i + i^2 = 2 - 3i - 1 = 1 - 3i\n\n(2 + i)(1 + i) = 2 + 2i + i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i\n\nSo, <A> = (hbar/2)/7 [ (1 - 3i) + (1 + 3i) ] = (hbar/14)(2) = hbar/7\n\nSo, <A> = hbar/7\n\nNow, looking back at the options, D says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7, which matches our calculations.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier step, I had probabilities of approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and <A> = hbar/7.\n\nBut option D has \"hbar / 7\", which is just hbar/7, not hbar/sqrt(7) or anything else.\n\nSo, it seems D is the correct choice.\n\nHowever, let me verify the probabilities again.\n\nProbability of |+x> is |<+x|alpha>|^2 = |(3)/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 \u2248 0.6429\n\nProbability of |-x> is |<-x|alpha>|^2 = |(-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)|^2 = (1 + 4)/14 = 5/14 \u2248 0.3571\n\nSo, approximately 0.64 and 0.36, which matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
