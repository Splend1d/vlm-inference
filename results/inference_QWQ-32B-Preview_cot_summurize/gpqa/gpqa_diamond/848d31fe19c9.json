                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an atomic nucleus that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed without decay, and we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that radioactive decay follows exponential decay principles. The probability of decay is constant over time, meaning the chance of decay in any given time interval is the same, regardless of how much time has already passed. This is often described by the half-life or decay constant of the isotope.\n\nGiven that, I should probably model this situation using the exponential decay formula. The general formula for the probability that a nucleus has not decayed after time \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[ P(t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the decay constant.\n\nWe're told that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. Wait, does that mean the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or is it something else? Let's make sure I understand this.\n\nIf the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, that means the probability that it decays in that time period is 32%, so the probability that it hasn't decayed after 100 minutes is 68%. So, \\( P(100) = 0.68 \\).\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n\\[ 0.68 = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 100} \\]\n\nFrom this, I can solve for \\( \\lambda \\):\n\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.68) = -\\lambda \\cdot 100 \\]\n\n\\[ \\lambda = -\\frac{\\ln(0.68)}{100} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\nFirst, find \\( \\ln(0.68) \\):\n\n\\[ \\ln(0.68) \\approx -0.38567 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ \\lambda \\approx -\\frac{-0.38567}{100} = 0.0038567 \\, \\text{per minute} \\]\n\nOkay, now we have the decay constant.\n\nNext, we need to find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already not decayed for 50 minutes.\n\nSince radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes doesn't depend on the past 50 minutes. Wait, but actually, because 50 minutes have already passed without decay, I need to consider the conditional probability.\n\nWait, no, in exponential decay, the process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next time interval is independent of how much time has already passed without decay. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute interval.\n\nBut let's confirm this. The probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decays in next 150 min}) = 1 - P(\\text{doesn't decay in next 150 min}) \\]\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decays in next 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} \\]\n\nWe already have \\( \\lambda \\approx 0.0038567 \\) per minute.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decays in next 150 min}) = 1 - e^{-0.0038567 \\times 150} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 0.0038567 \\times 150 \\):\n\n\\[ 0.0038567 \\times 150 \\approx 0.578505 \\]\n\nThen,\n\n\\[ e^{-0.578505} \\approx 0.560 \\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{decays in next 150 min}) = 1 - 0.560 = 0.440 \\]\n\nSo, 44%.\n\nWait, but let's check if we need to consider the fact that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.\n\nGiven the memoryless property, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is indeed independent of the past 50 minutes. So, the answer should be 44%.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 40%\n\nB. 48%\n\nC. 44%\n\nD. 52%\n\nOption C. 44% seems to be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we could think about the total time: 50 minutes have already passed, and we're looking at the next 150 minutes, so a total of 200 minutes.\n\nFirst, find the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes:\n\n\\[ P(t > 50) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 50} \\]\n\nThen, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is:\n\n\\[ P(50 < t < 200) = P(t > 50) - P(t > 200) \\]\n\nBut actually, that's not correct. The probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is:\n\n\\[ P(50 < t < 200) = P(t > 50) - P(t > 200) \\]\n\nWait, no. Actually, \\( P(t > 50) - P(t > 200) = P(50 < t < 200) \\), which is what we want.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(50 < t < 200) = e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 50} - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 200} \\]\n\nBut since the process is memoryless, this should be equal to \\( P(t < 150) \\), but adjusted for the time shift.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it.\n\nGiven the memoryless property, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it has already survived for 50 minutes, is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period.\n\nTherefore, it's simply \\( P(t < 150) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda \\cdot 150} \\), which we already calculated as approximately 44%.\n\nSo, the answer should be C. 44%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{44\\%} \\]"
