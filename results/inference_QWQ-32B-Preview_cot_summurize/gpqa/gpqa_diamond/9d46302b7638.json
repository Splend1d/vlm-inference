                    "text": "To find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we need to consider the properties of both planets and their orbits around the star. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors, including the stellar luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo.\n\nFirst, let's recall the formula for the equilibrium temperature \\( T_{\\text{eq}} \\) of a planet:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{L_{\\star}}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4} \\times \\left( 1 - A \\right)^{1/4}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( L_{\\star} \\) is the stellar luminosity,\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( D \\) is the distance from the planet to the star,\n- \\( A \\) is the planet's albedo.\n\nGiven that both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq},1}}{T_{\\text{eq},2}} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nbecause the stellar luminosity and albedo terms cancel out in the ratio.\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio of the distances \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\). To do this, we can use the information provided about the radial velocity (RV) shifts induced by each planet on the star.\n\nThe RV semi-amplitude \\( K \\) induced by a planet on its star is given by:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{2 \\pi G}{2 \\pi} \\times \\frac{M_p \\sin i}{(M_{\\star} + M_p)^{1/3} a (1 - e^2)^{1/2}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - e^2 \\sin^2 \\omega}}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since both planets are in circular orbits (\\( e = 0 \\)), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nK = \\frac{G^{1/3} (2 \\pi)^{2/3} M_p \\sin i}{(M_{\\star} + M_p)^{1/3} P^{2/3}}\n\\]\n\nBut for small masses of the planets compared to the star, \\( M_p \\ll M_{\\star} \\), this further simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nK \\approx \\left( \\frac{G}{M_{\\star}} \\right)^{1/3} \\times \\left( \\frac{M_p}{P} \\right)^{1/3} \\times \\sin i\n\\]\n\nHowever, since both planets are detected using the RV method, and assuming that the inclination angles are similar or that we are dealing with the same line of sight, we can consider \\( \\sin i \\) to be approximately the same for both planets.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_p1 / P_1^{1/3}}{M_p2 / P_2^{1/3}} = \\frac{M_p1}{M_p2} \\times \\left( \\frac{P_2}{P_1} \\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nBut we don't have the periods \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\) directly. Instead, we have the RV shifts induced by each planet, which are given in terms of \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. We need to relate these shifts to the RV semi-amplitudes.\n\nThe Doppler shift \\( \\Delta \\lambda \\) in wavelength is related to the radial velocity \\( v_r \\) by:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_0 \\times \\frac{v_r}{c}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( \\lambda_0 \\) is the rest wavelength, and \\( c \\) is the speed of light.\n\nGiven that Planet1 induces a periodic shift of up to 0.03 \u00c5 in the [OI] line at 6300 \u00c5, and Planet2 induces a shift of up to 0.04 \u00c5 in the same line, we can find the corresponding RV semi-amplitudes \\( K_1 \\) and \\( K_2 \\):\n\n\\[\nK_1 = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_1 \\times c}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{0.03 \\times c}{6300}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nK_2 = \\frac{\\Delta \\lambda_2 \\times c}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{0.04 \\times c}{6300}\n\\]\n\nThus, the ratio of the RV semi-amplitudes is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75\n\\]\n\nNow, using the simplified RV formula for circular orbits:\n\n\\[\nK \\propto \\frac{M_p}{\\sqrt{M_{\\star}} \\times a^{1/2}}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( M_{\\star} \\) is the same for both planets, the ratio becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \\frac{M_p1 / \\sqrt{a_1}}{M_p2 / \\sqrt{a_2}} = \\frac{M_p1}{M_p2} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\n\\]\n\nWe can rearrange this to find the ratio of the semi-major axes \\( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\):\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\times \\frac{M_p2}{M_p1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( \\frac{K_1}{K_2} \\times \\frac{M_p2}{M_p1} \\right)^2\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \\left( 0.75 \\times \\frac{5}{7} \\right)^2 = \\left( 0.75 \\times 0.714 \\right)^2 \\approx (0.535)^2 \\approx 0.286\n\\]\n\nNow, recall that the equilibrium temperature ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_{\\text{eq},1}}{T_{\\text{eq},2}} = \\left( \\frac{a_2}{a_1} \\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{0.286} \\approx 0.535\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.535, which corresponds to option A.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]"
