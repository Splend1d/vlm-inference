                    "text": "So I've got this problem here from a CERN Bubble Chamber experiment. It says that a particle X\u2070 decays into Y\u207a and Z\u207b, and the proper lifetime of X\u2070 is \u03c4\u2080 = 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. I'm also given that the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV and the mass of X\u2070 is 3.41 GeV. The options are in meters, so I'm guessing it's about the spatial resolution needed to see the decay products.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"resolution\" means in this context. In a bubble chamber, particles leave tracks as they move through the chamber, and the resolution would refer to how well we can distinguish between closely spaced tracks. So, the minimum resolution needed would be related to the typical distance that the X\u2070 travels before decaying.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"to observe at least 30% of the decays.\" That suggests that not all decays will be observable due to the resolution limits, and I need to ensure that at least 30% of them can be detected.\n\nLet me think about the decay process. The proper lifetime is given, which is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. However, in the bubble chamber, the particles are likely moving at relativistic speeds, so I need to consider time dilation.\n\nFirst, I should find the Lorentz factor \u03b3 for the X\u2070 particle. The Lorentz factor is given by \u03b3 = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass.\n\nGiven that the energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, I assume that's the total energy of the X\u2070 particle. The mass is 3.41 GeV, so:\n\n\u03b3 = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u2248 7.92\n\nNow, the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (t) is related to the proper lifetime (\u03c4\u2080) by t = \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080.\n\nSo, t = 7.92 * 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s \u2248 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 seconds\n\nThis is the time that the X\u2070 particle lives in the lab frame before decaying.\n\nNow, to observe the decay, we need to detect the decay products, Y\u207a and Z\u207b, separated by some distance in the bubble chamber. The resolution needed would be related to the mean free path of the X\u2070 particle before it decays.\n\nThe mean free path \u03bb is given by \u03bb = v * t, where v is the speed of the particle.\n\nTo find v, we can use the relativistic formula:\n\nv = c * \u03b2, where \u03b2 = \u221a(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2)\n\nFirst, find \u03b2:\n\n\u03b2 = \u221a(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) = \u221a(1 - 1/(7.92)\u00b2) \u2248 \u221a(1 - 0.0159) \u2248 \u221a0.9841 \u2248 0.992\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.992 * c\n\nNow, \u03bb = v * t \u2248 0.992 * 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s * 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s \u2248 0.992 * 3 * 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m \u2248 18.99 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m \u2248 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nWait, but the options are in meters, and 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m is 1.90 micrometers, which matches option B: 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m.\n\nBut the problem says \"at least 30% of the decays.\" My calculation seems to give the mean free path, which might correspond to the average distance traveled before decaying. However, to observe at least 30% of the decays, perhaps I need to consider the resolution needed to detect decays that occur within a certain distance.\n\nMaybe I need to find the distance corresponding to 30% of the decays.\n\nIn radioactive decay, the probability of decay is exponential: P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/\u03c4)\n\nBut in this case, I need to think about the spatial distribution of the decay points.\n\nSince the particle is moving at a constant velocity (ignoring interactions), the decay length follows an exponential distribution with mean \u03bb.\n\nThe probability that the decay occurs before a distance x is P(x) = 1 - e^(-x/\u03bb)\n\nI need to find x such that P(x) \u2265 0.30\n\nSo, 1 - e^(-x/\u03bb) \u2265 0.30\n\nTherefore, e^(-x/\u03bb) \u2264 0.70\n\nTake natural log: -x/\u03bb \u2264 ln(0.70)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: x/\u03bb \u2265 -ln(0.70)\n\nSo, x \u2265 \u03bb * (-ln(0.70))\n\nCalculate -ln(0.70) \u2248 0.3567\n\nTherefore, x \u2265 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 0.3567 \u2248 0.678 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m \u2248 6.78 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 m\n\nBut this seems contradictory because if the mean free path is 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, then 30% of the decays would occur within a shorter distance.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the resolution needed to resolve the decay vertex from the production point.\n\nIn other words, to observe the decay, the distance between the production point and the decay point must be larger than the resolution limit.\n\nIf the resolution is too poor, decays that occur too close to the production point might not be distinguishable from non-decays.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the minimum resolution r such that decays beyond r can be observed, and I need at least 30% of decays to be observable.\n\nGiven that the decay length distribution is exponential with mean \u03bb, the fraction of decays beyond r is e^(-r/\u03bb).\n\nI need this fraction to be at least 30%, so:\n\ne^(-r/\u03bb) \u2265 0.30\n\nTake natural log: -r/\u03bb \u2265 ln(0.30)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: r/\u03bb \u2264 -ln(0.30)\n\nSo, r \u2264 \u03bb * (-ln(0.30))\n\nCalculate -ln(0.30) \u2248 1.204\n\nTherefore, r \u2264 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 1.204 \u2248 2.29 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nBut this doesn't directly match any of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find the resolution r such that the fraction of decays with decay length greater than r is 30%.\n\nIn that case, e^(-r/\u03bb) = 0.30\n\nSo, -r/\u03bb = ln(0.30)\n\nTherefore, r = -\u03bb * ln(0.30)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: r = -1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * ln(0.30) \u2248 1.90 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 1.204 \u2248 2.29 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nThis is close to option B: 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, but not exactly the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating \u03bb.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation of \u03bb.\n\nGiven \u03b3 = 7.92, and \u03c4\u2080 = 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s, then t = \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 = 7.92 * 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s = 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s\n\nSpeed v = \u03b2 * c, where \u03b2 = \u221a(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) = \u221a(1 - 1/62.7264) \u2248 \u221a0.9841 \u2248 0.992\n\nSo, v \u2248 0.992 * 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s \u2248 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s\n\nThen, \u03bb = v * t \u2248 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s * 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s \u2248 1.888 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m \u2248 1.89 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nUsing this value, r = -\u03bb * ln(0.30) \u2248 -1.89 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * ln(0.30) \u2248 1.89 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 1.204 \u2248 2.27 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nStill not matching option B: 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the energy of 27 GeV is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nThe total energy E = m + T, where m is the rest mass and T is the kinetic energy.\n\nIf T = 27 GeV and m = 3.41 GeV, then E = 3.41 + 27 = 30.41 GeV\n\nThen, \u03b3 = E / m = 30.41 / 3.41 \u2248 8.92\n\nPreviously, I assumed E = 27 GeV, but maybe that's just the kinetic energy.\n\nLet me recalculate with E = 30.41 GeV.\n\nThen, t = \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 = 8.92 * 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s \u2248 7.14 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s\n\n\u03b2 = \u221a(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) = \u221a(1 - 1/80) \u2248 \u221a0.9875 \u2248 0.994\n\nv = \u03b2 * c \u2248 0.994 * 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s \u2248 2.982 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s\n\n\u03bb = v * t \u2248 2.982 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s * 7.14 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s \u2248 2.12 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nThen, r = -\u03bb * ln(0.30) \u2248 -2.12 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * ln(0.30) \u2248 2.12 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 1.204 \u2248 2.55 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nStill not matching option B: 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the energy is 27 GeV, but that includes the rest mass.\n\nSo, E = \u221a(p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074)\n\nGiven E and m, I can find p.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use E\u00b2 = p\u00b2c\u00b2 + m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nThen, p\u00b2c\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074\n\nSo, p = \u221a(E\u00b2 - m\u00b2c\u2074)/c\n\nBut since E is given in GeV, and m in GeV/c\u00b2, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1.\n\nIn that case, E = \u221a(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2)\n\nGiven E = 27 GeV and m = 3.41 GeV, then p\u00b2 = E\u00b2 - m\u00b2 = (27)\u00b2 - (3.41)\u00b2 = 729 - 11.6281 = 717.3719 GeV\u00b2\n\nSo, p = \u221a717.3719 GeV \u2248 26.78 GeV/c\n\nThen, \u03b3 = E / m = 27 / 3.41 \u2248 7.92, which matches my initial calculation.\n\nWait, earlier I added E = m + T, but in relativistic mechanics, E = \u03b3m, and p = \u03b3\u03b2m.\n\nSo, perhaps I should use E = \u03b3m, where m is the rest mass.\n\nGiven E = \u03b3m, then \u03b3 = E / m = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV \u2248 7.92\n\nThen, \u03b2 = \u221a(1 - 1/\u03b3\u00b2) \u2248 \u221a(1 - 1/62.7264) \u2248 \u221a0.9841 \u2248 0.992\n\nv = \u03b2c \u2248 0.992 * 3 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s \u2248 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s\n\nt = \u03b3 * \u03c4\u2080 \u2248 7.92 * 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s \u2248 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s\n\n\u03bb = v * t \u2248 2.976 \u00d7 10\u2078 m/s * 6.34 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2075 s \u2248 1.888 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nThen, to observe at least 30% of the decays, I need to find the resolution r such that the fraction of decays with decay length greater than r is 30%.\n\nSo, e^(-r/\u03bb) = 0.30\n\nThus, r = -\u03bb * ln(0.30) \u2248 1.888 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 1.204 \u2248 2.27 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nThis is close to option B: 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, but still not matching exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nMaybe I need to consider the spatial resolution needed to distinguish the decay vertex from the interaction point.\n\nIn particle physics, the resolution needed to observe a decay is related to the decay length.\n\nIf the decay length is shorter than the resolution, the decay cannot be observed.\n\nSo, to observe at least 30% of the decays, I need to set the resolution such that 30% of the decays have lengths greater than the resolution.\n\nThis is similar to what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the decay length distribution.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the uncertainty in measuring the decay length.\n\nIf the resolution is r, then to observe the decay, the decay length must be greater than r.\n\nThe fraction of decays with length greater than r is e^(-r/\u03bb).\n\nSet this equal to 0.30 and solve for r.\n\nThis is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the observable decays are those where the decay length is greater than the resolution limit, and I need to find the resolution such that 30% of decays are observable.\n\nSo, e^(-r/\u03bb) = 0.30\n\nThus, r = -\u03bb * ln(0.30)\n\nUsing \u03bb \u2248 1.888 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, r \u2248 2.27 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\n\nBut option B is 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, which is close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between resolution and the fraction of observable decays.\n\nIf the resolution is r, then the probability that a decay is observable is e^(-r/\u03bb).\n\nSet this equal to 0.30 and solve for r.\n\nThis gives r = -\u03bb * ln(0.30)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the rms (root-mean-square) decay length.\n\nThe rms decay length is \u03c3 = \u221a(<x\u00b2>) = \u221a(2 \u03bb\u00b2) = \u03bb \u221a2\n\nThen, perhaps the resolution needed is on the order of \u03c3.\n\nBut that would give r \u2248 1.888 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m * 1.414 \u2248 2.67 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, which is even further from option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the distance between the decay products.\n\nBut in a bubble chamber, the decay products will travel some distance before interacting and leaving tracks.\n\nHowever, I think the main issue is the decay length, which is what I've been considering.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the time it takes for the decay to occur and the time resolution of the bubble chamber.\n\nBut the problem specifies \"resolution,\" which likely refers to spatial resolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the momentum resolution or something similar, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the relativistic addition of velocities or something related to the decay in the lab frame.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the decay products are also moving relativistically, and their tracks might be too close to resolve.\n\nBut I think the main issue is still the decay length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the interaction length in the bubble chamber.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the decay can be observed only if the decay products are separated by a distance greater than the resolution.\n\nSo, I need to find the minimum resolution such that 30% of the decays have a separation greater than that resolution.\n\nIn that case, perhaps I need to find the distribution of the separation between the decay products.\n\nHowever, I think this complicates things unnecessarily.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll stick with my initial approach.\n\nGiven that, r \u2248 2.27 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m, which is close to option B: 2.08 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m.\n\nPerhaps there was a miscalculation in the value of \u03bb.\n\nLet me recalculate \u03bb more carefully.\n\nGiven \u03b3 = 7.92, \u03c4\u2080 = 8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 s, then t = \u03b3 \u03c4\u2080 = 7.92 *"
