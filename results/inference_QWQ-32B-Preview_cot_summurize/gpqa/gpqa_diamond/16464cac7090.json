                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. It's a bit complex, but if I break it down, I can figure it out.\n\nFirst, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually indicates that these liquids contain double or triple bonds, since bromine water is decolorized by addition reactions across these bonds.\n\nNext, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. This suggests that the double or triple bonds have been saturated or rearranged in some way.\n\nThen, hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, a hydrocarbon Z, which is a constituent of mixture Y and is widely used as a solvent. Hydrocarbon Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28% and does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it's saturated.\n\nAlso, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of the compounds in mixture X.\n\nAlright, let's start by figuring out what hydrocarbon Z is. Since it's widely used as a solvent and has a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, we can use that information to find its molecular formula.\n\nLet's denote the molecular formula of Z as C_nH_m.\n\nThe mass fraction of hydrogen is given by:\n\n( m * atomic mass of H ) / ( n * atomic mass of C + m * atomic mass of H ) = 14.28%\n\nAssuming atomic masses: C = 12 u, H = 1 u.\n\nSo,\n\n( m * 1 ) / ( n * 12 + m * 1 ) = 0.1428\n\nSimplify:\n\nm / (12n + m) = 0.1428\n\nLet's solve for m in terms of n:\n\nm = 0.1428 * (12n + m)\n\nm = 1.7136n + 0.1428m\n\nSubtract 0.1428m from both sides:\n\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n\n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n\n\nDivide both sides by 0.8572:\n\nm = 2.0 n\n\nSo, the empirical formula is C_nH_{2n}\n\nThis suggests that Z is an alkane, since alkanes have the general formula C_nH_{2n+2}. But according to the calculation, it's C_nH_{2n}, which is one hydrogen less than an alkane. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's double-check.\n\nGiven:\n\nm / (12n + m) = 0.1428\n\nLet's multiply both sides by (12n + m):\n\nm = 0.1428 * (12n + m)\n\nm = 1.7136n + 0.1428m\n\nSubtract 0.1428m from both sides:\n\nm - 0.1428m = 1.7136n\n\n0.8572m = 1.7136n\n\nDivide both sides by 0.8572:\n\nm = 2.0 n\n\nWait, the calculation seems correct. So, m = 2n.\n\nBut for alkanes, the formula is C_nH_{2n+2}, which would give m = 2n + 2, not m = 2n.\n\nHmm, perhaps Z is not an alkane then. Maybe it's a cycloalkane, which has the formula C_nH_{2n}.\n\nYes, cycloalkanes have the formula C_nH_{2n}, which matches our empirical formula.\n\nSo, Z is likely a cycloalkane.\n\nNow, since Z is widely used as a solvent, let's think about common cycloalkanes used as solvents.\n\nToluene is a common solvent, but its formula is C7H8, which is not a cycloalkane.\n\nBenzene is a solvent, but it's an aromatic compound, not a cycloalkane.\n\nCyclohexane is a common cycloalkane solvent. Its formula is C6H12.\n\nLet's check if this matches the hydrogen mass fraction.\n\nFor cyclohexane, C6H12:\n\nTotal mass = 6*12 + 12*1 = 72 + 12 = 84 u\n\nHydrogen mass fraction = (12*1) / 84 = 12/84 = 0.142857, which is approximately 14.28%.\n\nPerfect, that matches.\n\nSo, Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.\n\nNow, mixture Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, one of which is cyclohexane, and after hydrogenation, both components of Y turn into cyclohexane.\n\nThis suggests that one component is already cyclohexane, and the other is something that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\nWait, but it says that hydrogenation of both mixture X and mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, and cyclohexane doesn't react further with hydrogen.\n\nSo, perhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and another compound that hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\nBut since cyclohexane doesn't react further with hydrogen, the other component must be something like cyclohexene, which upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane.\n\nBut cyclohexene has the formula C6H10, and upon hydrogenation, it adds two hydrogens to become C6H12.\n\nWait, but the problem says that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, which suggests that it doesn't have double or triple bonds. But cyclohexene has a double bond and would decolorize bromine water.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, both of which hydrogenate to cyclohexane.\n\nBut methylcyclopentane has the formula C6H10, similar to cyclohexene.\n\nWait, but methylcyclopentane also has a ring and a side chain, but it's already a cycloalkane. Upon hydrogenation, it wouldn't change, unless it has some unsaturation.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet's consider the initial mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids with double or triple bonds, since they decolorize bromine water.\n\nThese undergo disproportionation in the presence of platinum and heat to form mixture Y, which consists of two other liquids without double or triple bonds.\n\nThen, upon severe hydrogenation, both X and Y give only cyclohexane.\n\nThis suggests that the components of X are precursors that, after disproportionation, form cyclohexane and another saturated compound.\n\nGiven that Z is cyclohexane, and it's a constituent of Y, the other component of Y must be something that also hydrogenates to cyclohexane.\n\nBut cyclohexane itself doesn't react with hydrogen further, so the other component must be something unsaturated that becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n\nWait, but earlier we established that mixture Y does not decolorize bromine water, meaning it doesn't have double bonds.\n\nSo, perhaps the other component is something like methylcyclopentane, which is saturated, but let's check its formula.\n\nMethylcyclopentane has 6 carbons: the ring has 5 carbons and one methyl group.\n\nIts formula is C6H12, same as cyclohexane.\n\nWait, but that's the same as cyclohexane.\n\nBut cyclohexane is already in mixture Y.\n\nSo perhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane, both C6H12.\n\nBut that seems odd because they have the same molecular formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and something else.\n\nWait, perhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and cyclohexene, but cyclohexene is unsaturated and would decolorize bromine water, which contradicts the statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and methylcyclopentene, which has a double bond.\n\nBut again, that would decolorize bromine water.\n\nWait, perhaps the other component is a cycloalkane with a different structure, but still C6H12.\n\nBut all C6H12 compounds are cyclohexane and its structural isomers, like methylcyclopentane.\n\nWait, perhaps it's adicyclopentane or some other isomer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and hexane.\n\nBut hexane is C6H14, which doesn't match Z.\n\nWait, but Z is C6H12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and something else.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the disproportionation reaction.\n\nDisproportionation usually involves a redox reaction where one species is both oxidized and reduced.\n\nIn this case, perhaps the initial mixture X contains two compounds that, upon heating with platinum, convert to cyclohexane and another saturated compound.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet's try another approach.\n\nSince mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids with double or triple bonds, and after disproportionation, we get mixture Y of two saturated liquids, and upon severe hydrogenation, both X and Y give cyclohexane.\n\nThis suggests that the components of X are precursors that ultimately lead to cyclohexane upon full saturation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the components of X are unsaturated compounds that are isomers or related to cyclohexene or similar.\n\nWait, perhaps X consists of cyclohexene and another compound, say methylcyclopentene.\n\nBut methylcyclopentene would hydrogenate to methylcyclopentane, which is C6H12, same as cyclohexane.\n\nBut methylcyclopentane is not the same as cyclohexane, although they have the same formula.\n\nWait, but the problem says that hydrogenation of both mixtures X and Y gives only one substance, Z, which is cyclohexane.\n\nThis suggests that methylcyclopentane would need to convert to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation, but methylcyclopentane is already a saturated hydrocarbon; it doesn't have any double bonds to hydrogenate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nMethylcyclopentane is already saturated; it has no double bonds, so it wouldn't react further with hydrogen.\n\nBut the problem says that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, implying that the other component of Y must also be cyclohexane or something that converts to cyclohexane.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and a cyclohexene isomer, but that contradicts the fact that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture X consists of two different cyclohexene isomers, say cis and trans, which upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and another compound.\n\nBut again, cyclohexene would decolorize bromine water.\n\nWait, maybe the initial mixture X consists of two different unsaturated compounds, say butadiene and something else, but that seems unlikely given the later steps.\n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nLet's look at the final part of the question: indicate the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X.\n\nWe have options: 22, 12, 18, 16.\n\nGiven that Z is C6H12, and mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, probably both have around 6-7 carbons each, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, but if mixture X is converted to mixture Y, which consists of two C6H12 molecules, perhaps the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X can be calculated based on that.\n\nBut I need a better approach.\n\nLet's consider the fact that mixture X has two liquids with double or triple bonds, and mixture Y has two saturated liquids, one of which is cyclohexane.\n\nAssuming that in the disproportionation reaction, one molecule loses a double bond and becomes more saturated, while the other gains saturation.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in mixture X, there are two isomers that rearrange upon heating with platinum to form cyclohexane and another compound.\n\nThis is still too unclear.\n\nMaybe I should consider the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n\nLet's denote the two liquids in mixture X as A and B.\n\nAssuming they are structural isomers or related compounds.\n\nSince they both ultimately hydrogenate to cyclohexane, their molecular formulas should be similar to cyclohexene or other C6H10 compounds.\n\nWait, but the problem says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids, and mixture Y is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids.\n\nGiven that hydrogenation of both mixtures gives only cyclohexane, it suggests that the components of X and Y are related through hydrogenation steps.\n\nPerhaps mixture X consists of two different unsaturated compounds, say cyclohexene and methylcyclopentene, which upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane.\n\nThen, hydrogenation of mixture X (cyclohexene + methylcyclopentene) would convert both to cyclohexane.\n\nSimilarly, hydrogenation of mixture Y (cyclohexane + methylcyclopentane) would also result in cyclohexane, since methylcyclopentane is already saturated.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that methylcyclopentane is C6H12, same as cyclohexane, but they are structurally different.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions that Z is a constituent of Y, which is widely used as a solvent, presumably cyclohexane.\n\nSo, perhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and another C6H12 compound, like methylcyclopentane.\n\nBut both would be C6H12, and hydrogenation wouldn't change them.\n\nWait, but the problem says that hydrogenation of mixture Y gives only cyclohexane, implying that the other component is also cyclohexane or converts to it.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and a compound that rearranges to cyclohexane upon hydrogenation.\n\nBut again, if it's already C6H12, it shouldn't change.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the other component is a cyclic compound with a different structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mixture X consists of two different cyclohexene isomers, say cis and trans, which upon disproportionation form cyclohexane and methylcyclopentane.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X are 12, assuming each molecule has 6 hydrogen atoms.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each molecule in mixture X has 8 hydrogen atoms, totaling 16.\n\nBut I need to find a better reasoning.\n\nLooking back at the options: 22, 12, 18, 16.\n\nIf Z is C6H12, and mixture Y consists of cyclohexane and another C6H12 compound, then the total hydrogen atoms in Y would be 24.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the total hydrogen atoms in mixture X.\n\nGiven that X is converted to Y through disproportionation, and Y is hydrogenated to Z, which is C6H12.\n\nPerhaps mixture X consists of two molecules, each with 8 hydrogen atoms, totaling 16.\n\nThis would make option D correct.\n\nBut I need to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps mixture X consists of cyclohexene (C6H10) and another compound with 12 hydrogen atoms, totaling 22.\n\nBut cyclohexene is C6H10, and another compound could be, say, 2-methylcyclopentene (C6H10), totaling 20 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThat doesn't match any options.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture X consists of two different cyclohexene isomers, each with 10 hydrogen atoms, totaling 20.\n\nAgain, not matching the options.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nPerhaps mixture X consists of benzene (C6H6) and another compound, but benzene doesn't fit with the earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe mixture X consists of two different compounds with 11 hydrogen atoms each, totaling 22.\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this, and without more specific information, I'll go with option D, 16, as it's a common total for two molecules in such a scenario.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[
