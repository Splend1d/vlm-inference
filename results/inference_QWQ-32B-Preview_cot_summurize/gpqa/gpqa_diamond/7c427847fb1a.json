I need to find the partition function Z for this system, where \u03b2 = 1/(kT), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what the partition function is. The partition function Z for a system is the sum over all possible states of the system of e^(-\u03b2E), where E is the energy of the state.\n\nSo, Z = sum over states of e^(-\u03b2E).\n\nIn this case, each spin can be either +1 or -1, and there are three spins, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the system.\n\nI should list all possible combinations of S1, S2, and S3, calculate the energy E for each combination, and then sum e^(-\u03b2E) for all of them.\n\nLet's list all possible states:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nNow, for each of these, I need to calculate E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nLet's compute E for each state:\n\n1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[1 + 1 + 1] = -J*3 = -3J\n\n2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J[(+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[1 -1 -1] = -J*(-1) = J\n\n3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[-1 +1 -1] = -J*(-1) = J\n\n4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J[(+1)(-1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[-1 -1 +1] = -J*(-1) = J\n\n5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)] = -J[-1 -1 +1] = -J*(-1) = J\n\n6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J[(-1)(+1) + (-1)(-1) + (+1)(-1)] = -J[-1 +1 -1] = -J*(-1) = J\n\n7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (-1)(+1)] = -J[1 -1 -1] = -J*(-1) = J\n\n8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J[(-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)] = -J[1 +1 +1] = -J*3 = -3J\n\nSo, the energies are:\n\n-3J, J, J, J, J, J, J, -3J\n\nNow, the partition function Z is the sum of e^(-\u03b2E) over all states.\n\nSo, Z = e^(-\u03b2*(-3J)) + e^(-\u03b2*J) + e^(-\u03b2*J) + e^(-\u03b2*J) + e^(-\u03b2*J) + e^(-\u03b2*J) + e^(-\u03b2*J) + e^(-\u03b2*(-3J))\n\nSimplify:\n\nZ = e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J) + e^(3\u03b2J)\n\nWait, because e^(-\u03b2*(-3J)) = e^(3\u03b2J)\n\nSo, Z = 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J)\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Z= 2e^(2J\u03b2)+6e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nB. Z= 6e^(2J\u03b2)+2e^(-2J\u03b2)\n\nC. Z= 2 e^(3J\u03b2)+6e^(-J\u03b2)\n\nD. Z= 2 e^(-3J\u03b2)+6e^(J\u03b2)\n\nMy result matches option C.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nIn the energies, I have two states with E = -3J and six states with E = J.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J), which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nFrom the list above, states 1 and 8 have E = -3J, and the rest (2 through 7) have E = J.\n\nSo, yes, two states with E = -3J and six states with E = J.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J), which is option C.\n\nBut the question shows option C as Z= 2 e^(3J\\beta)+6e^(-J\\beta), which matches what I have.\n\nHowever, the answer provided is A, which is Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta).\n\nThis doesn't match my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the way I calculated the energies.\n\nLet me re-examine the energy calculations.\n\nTake state 1: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -3J\n\nState 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J(1 + (-1) + (-1)) = -J(-1) = J\n\nState 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J(-1 + 1 + (-1)) = -J(-1) = J\n\nState 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J(-1 + (-1) + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nState 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J(-1 + (-1) + 1) = -J(-1) = J\n\nState 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J(-1 + 1 + (-1)) = -J(-1) = J\n\nState 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nE = -J(1 + (-1) + (-1)) = -J(-1) = J\n\nState 8: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nE = -J(1 + 1 + 1) = -J*3 = -3J\n\nYes, confirmed. Two states with E = -3J and six states with E = J.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J), which is option C.\n\nBut the provided answer is A, which is Z= 2e^(2J\\beta)+6e^(-2J\\beta). This doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the interpretation of the Hamiltonian.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the number of states with each energy.\n\nLet me count again.\n\nStates with E = -3J:\n\n- All spins up: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\n- All spins down: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\nThat's two states.\n\nStates with E = J:\n\n- S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\n- S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\n- S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1\n\n- S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1\n\n- S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1\n\n- S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1\n\nThat's six states.\n\nSo, Z = 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J), which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is misinterpreted.\n\nWait, maybe the energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the partition function is defined differently, but standard statistical mechanics defines Z = sum over states of e^(-\u03b2E).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider degeneracies differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to group states with the same energy.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nTwo states with E = -3J and six states with E = J.\n\nTherefore, Z = 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J), which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the spins can have other values, but the problem states S = +1 or -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interaction in the Hamiltonian, but the problem specifies E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the provided answer, and the correct answer is option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to compute Z, such as using spin pairing or something, but summing over all states is the most straightforward method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute Z differently by considering the interactions pairwise.\n\nFor example, consider the interaction between S1 and S2, S1 and S3, and S2 and S3 separately.\n\nBut in the end, the energy is given by the sum of these interactions, so summing over all states should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry or a way to reduce the number of states.\n\nBut anyway, summing over all states is accurate.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the partition function Z is 2*e^(3\u03b2J) + 6*e^(-\u03b2J), which is option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
