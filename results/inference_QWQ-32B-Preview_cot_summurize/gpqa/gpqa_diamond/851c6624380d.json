                    "text": "So I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's my state vector, right? And there's an observable represented by the matrix P, which has specific elements: first row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0), second row (1/\u221a2, 0, 1/\u221a2), and third row (0, 1/\u221a2, 0). I need to find the probability that measuring this observable will yield 0 at time t.\n\nOkay, in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes. So, first things first, I should find the eigenvalues of P. The eigenvalues are the possible results you can get from a measurement of that observable.\n\nSo, let's find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation, which is det(P - \u03bbI) = 0, where \u03bb represents the eigenvalues and I is the identity matrix.\n\nGiven P:\n\nP = | 0         1/\u221a2      0      |\n\n    | 1/\u221a2      0         1/\u221a2  |\n\n    | 0         1/\u221a2      0      |\n\nAnd I is:\n\nI = | 1 0 0 |\n\n    | 0 1 0 |\n\n    | 0 0 1 |\n\nSo, P - \u03bbI = | -\u03bb      1/\u221a2     0      |\n\n             | 1/\u221a2    -\u03bb       1/\u221a2  |\n\n             | 0       1/\u221a2     -\u03bb    |\n\nNow, det(P - \u03bbI) = |-\u03bb      1/\u221a2     0      |\n\n                               | 1/\u221a2    -\u03bb       1/\u221a2  |\n\n                               | 0       1/\u221a2     -\u03bb    |\n\nTo compute the determinant:\n\ndet = -\u03bb * ( (-\u03bb)*(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*(1/\u221a2) ) - (1/\u221a2)* ( (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)*0 ) + 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n= -\u03bb * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)*(-\u03bb/\u221a2) + 0\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2)\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb(1/2 + 1/(2\u221a2))\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate the determinant more carefully.\n\nActually, the determinant of a 3x3 matrix A = |a b c| |d e f| |g h i| is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n\nSo, applying that:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb) * [ (-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) ] - (1/\u221a2) [ (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) ] + 0 * [ (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) - (-\u03bb)(0) ]\n\n= (-\u03bb) * (\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2) * (-\u03bb/\u221a2) + 0\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2)\n\nWait, that still seems off. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate the minor for the first element:\n\n(-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) = \u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2\n\nThen, the minor for the second element:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0) = -\u03bb/\u221a2\n\nAnd the minor for the third element:\n\n(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) - (-\u03bb)(0) = 1/2 - 0 = 1/2\n\nNow, put it all together:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)(\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2) - (1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb/\u221a2) + 0*(1/2)\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2)\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me double-check the calculation.\n\nActually, the determinant should be:\n\ndet = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n\nSo, for our matrix:\n\na = -\u03bb, b = 1/\u221a2, c = 0\n\nd = 1/\u221a2, e = -\u03bb, f = 1/\u221a2\n\ng = 0, h = 1/\u221a2, i = -\u03bb\n\nTherefore:\n\ndet = (-\u03bb)[(-\u03bb)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2)] - (1/\u221a2)[(1/\u221a2)(-\u03bb) - (1/\u221a2)(0)] + 0[(1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) - (-\u03bb)(0)]\n\n= (-\u03bb)[\u03bb\u00b2 - 1/2] - (1/\u221a2)[-\u03bb/\u221a2] + 0\n\n= -\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2)\n\nWait, now combining terms:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + (1/2)\u03bb + (\u03bb/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb(1/2 + 1/2) = -\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb\n\nSo, the characteristic equation is:\n\n-\u03bb\u00b3 + \u03bb = 0\n\nFactor out \u03bb:\n\n\u03bb(-\u03bb\u00b2 + 1) = 0\n\nSo, \u03bb = 0 or \u03bb\u00b2 = 1 \u21d2 \u03bb = \u00b11\n\nTherefore, the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nNow, the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the measurement yields 0.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring an eigenvalue \u03bb is given by the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto the eigenspace corresponding to \u03bb.\n\nSo, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 0, and then compute the squared magnitude of the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvector for \u03bb = 0.\n\nTo find the eigenvector for \u03bb = 0, solve (P - 0*I)v = 0, which is just P*v = 0.\n\nSo, P*v = 0, where v is the eigenvector.\n\nGiven P:\n\n| 0         1/\u221a2      0      |   |x|   |0|\n\n| 1/\u221a2      0         1/\u221a2  | * |y| = |0|\n\n| 0         1/\u221a2      0      |   |z|   |0|\n\nSo, we have the system of equations:\n\n(0)x + (1/\u221a2)y + (0)z = 0 \u21d2 y = 0\n\n(1/\u221a2)x + (0)y + (1/\u221a2)z = 0 \u21d2 (1/\u221a2)x + (1/\u221a2)z = 0 \u21d2 x + z = 0 \u21d2 z = -x\n\n(0)x + (1/\u221a2)y + (0)z = 0 \u21d2 y = 0\n\nSo, the eigenvector corresponding to \u03bb = 0 is of the form v = |x| |0| |-x|\n\nChoose x = 1, then v = |1| |0| |-1|\n\nAlternatively, x = -1, v = |-1| |0| |1|\n\nBut for probability calculations, the overall phase doesn't matter, so we can take v = |1| |0| |-1|\n\nNow, the probability is |<v|\u03c8>|\u00b2, where |\u03c8> is the state vector.\n\nGiven |\u03c8> = |-1| |2| |1|\n\nSo, <v|\u03c8> = v\u2020 * \u03c8, where v\u2020 is the conjugate transpose of v.\n\nSince all elements are real, v\u2020 = |1  0  -1|\n\nTherefore, <v|\u03c8> = |1  0  -1| * |-1| |2| |1| = (1)*(-1) + (0)*(2) + (-1)*(1) = -1 + 0 - 1 = -2\n\nThen, |<v|\u03c8>|\u00b2 = (-2)\u00b2 = 4\n\nBut probability can't be greater than 1, so I must be missing something.\n\nAh, I think I forgot to normalize the eigenvector.\n\nThe eigenvector v = |1| |0| |-1| has a norm of sqrt(1\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-1)\u00b2) = sqrt(2)\n\nSo, the normalized eigenvector is |v> = (1/\u221a2)|1> + 0|2> + (-1/\u221a2)|3>\n\nTherefore, the probability is |<v|\u03c8>|\u00b2, where |v> is normalized.\n\nFirst, compute <v|\u03c8>:\n\n<v|\u03c8> = (1/\u221a2)(-1) + 0*(2) + (-1/\u221a2)(1) = -1/\u221a2 + 0 - 1/\u221a2 = -2/\u221a2 = -\u221a2\n\nThen, |<v|\u03c8>|\u00b2 = (\u221a2)\u00b2 = 2\n\nBut again, probability can't be greater than 1, so I must be missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to normalize the state vector |\u03c8>.\n\nLet me check the norm of |\u03c8>:\n\n|\u03c8> = |-1| |2| |1|\n\nNorm: sqrt((-1)\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(6)\n\nSo, the normalized state vector is |\u03c8> = (-1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6)\n\nNow, compute <v|\u03c8> with both vectors normalized.\n\n<v| = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)\n\n|\u03c8> = (-1/\u221a6, 2/\u221a6, 1/\u221a6)\n\nSo, <v|\u03c8> = (1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a6) + (0)(2/\u221a6) + (-1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a6) = -1/(\u221a2*\u221a6) + 0 - 1/(\u221a2*\u221a6) = -2/(\u221a2*\u221a6) = -2/\u221a12 = -2/(2\u221a3) = -1/\u221a3\n\nThen, |<v|\u03c8>|\u00b2 = (1/\u221a3)\u00b2 = 1/3\n\nSo, the probability is 1/3.\n\nWait, but that's option B. But the answer is given as D (2/3). Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are degenerate eigenvalues or multiple eigenvectors for \u03bb = 0.\n\nWait, in this case, P is a 3x3 matrix with eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.\n\nLet me check the eigenspace for \u03bb = 0.\n\nFrom earlier, the eigenvector is v = |1| |0| |-1|\n\nBut is there only one eigenvector for \u03bb = 0, or is there a degeneracy?\n\nWait, let's find the eigenvectors for all eigenvalues to confirm.\n\nFor \u03bb = 1:\n\nSolve (P - I)v = 0\n\nP - I = | -1      1/\u221a2     0      |\n\n        | 1/\u221a2    -1       1/\u221a2  |\n\n        | 0       1/\u221a2     -1     |\n\nSet up the equations:\n\n-1*x + 1/\u221a2*y + 0*z = 0 \u21d2 x = (1/\u221a2)y\n\n1/\u221a2*x - y + 1/\u221a2*z = 0\n\n0*x + 1/\u221a2*y - z = 0 \u21d2 z = (1/\u221a2)y\n\nSubstitute x = (1/\u221a2)y and z = (1/\u221a2)y into the second equation:\n\n1/\u221a2*(1/\u221a2 y) - y + 1/\u221a2*(1/\u221a2 y) = 0\n\n(1/2)y - y + (1/2)y = 0 \u21d2 (1/2 - 1 + 1/2)y = 0 \u21d2 0*y = 0\n\nSo, y is free, x = (1/\u221a2)y, z = (1/\u221a2)y\n\nTake y = \u221a2, then x = 1, z = 1\n\nSo, eigenvector for \u03bb = 1 is |1| |\u221a2| |1|\n\nSimilarly, for \u03bb = -1:\n\nSolve (P + I)v = 0\n\nP + I = | 1       1/\u221a2     0      |\n\n        | 1/\u221a2    1        1/\u221a2  |\n\n        | 0       1/\u221a2     1      |\n\nSet up the equations:\n\n1*x + 1/\u221a2*y + 0*z = 0 \u21d2 x = -1/\u221a2 y\n\n1/\u221a2*x + 1*y + 1/\u221a2*z = 0\n\n0*x + 1/\u221a2*y + 1*z = 0 \u21d2 z = -1/\u221a2 y\n\nSubstitute x = -1/\u221a2 y and z = -1/\u221a2 y into the second equation:\n\n1/\u221a2*(-1/\u221a2 y) + y + 1/\u221a2*(-1/\u221a2 y) = 0\n\n-1/2 y + y - 1/2 y = 0 \u21d2 ( -1/2 + 1 - 1/2 )y = 0 \u21d2 0*y = 0\n\nSo, y is free, x = -1/\u221a2 y, z = -1/\u221a2 y\n\nTake y = \u221a2, then x = -1, z = -1\n\nSo, eigenvector for \u03bb = -1 is |-1| |\u221a2| |-1|\n\nNow, back to \u03bb = 0, we have v = |1| |0| |-1|\n\nWait a minute, in my earlier calculation, I considered only one eigenvector for \u03bb = 0, but perhaps there is another independent eigenvector for \u03bb = 0.\n\nWait, let's check the dimension of the eigenspace for \u03bb = 0.\n\nFrom the earlier system:\n\ny = 0\n\nx + z = 0\n\nSo, x = -z, y = 0\n\nThus, the eigenvectors are of the form |x| |0| |-x|\n\nSo, only one independent eigenvector, which is |1| |0| |-1|\n\nTherefore, the eigenspace for \u03bb = 0 is one-dimensional.\n\nSo, my earlier calculation should be correct, probability is 1/3.\n\nBut the answer is given as D (2/3). Maybe I need to consider the orthogonal projection onto the eigenspace.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the spectral decomposition.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, for an observable P with eigenvalues \u03bb and corresponding projection operators P_\u03bb onto the eigenspaces, the probability of measuring \u03bb is <\u03c8|P_\u03bb|\u03c8>.\n\nIn this case, for \u03bb = 0, P_0 is the projection onto the eigenspace corresponding to \u03bb = 0.\n\nGiven that the eigenspace is one-dimensional, P_0 = |v><v|, where |v> is the normalized eigenvector.\n\nSo, P_0 = |v><v| = (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2)\u2020 * (1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2) = |1/\u221a2><1/\u221a2| + |0><0| + |-1/\u221a2><-1/\u221a2|\n\nWait, in matrix form, P_0 = |v><v| = |1/\u221a2><1/\u221a2| + |0><0| + |-1/\u221a2><-1/\u221a2|\n\nActually, in matrix form:\n\nP_0 = |1/\u221a2> <1/\u221a2| + |0> <0| + |-1/\u221a2> <-1/\u221a2|\n\nWait, more precisely:\n\nP_0 = |v><v| = |1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2>^T * |1/\u221a2, 0, -1/\u221a2| = (1/\u221a2)(1/\u221a2) + (0)(0) + (-1/\u221a2)(-1/\u221a2) = 1/2 + 0 + 1/2 = 1\n\nWait, no, that's the norm squared, which should be 1 since it's normalized.\n\nBut in matrix form, P_0 = |v><v| = |1/\u221a2><1/\u221a2| + |0><0| + |-1/\u221a2><-1/\u221a2|\n\nActually, in matrix form, P_0 = |v><v| = [1/2, 0, -1/2; 0, 0, 0; -1/2, 0, 1/2]\n\nSo, P_0 = |v><v| = |1/\u221a2><1/\u221a2| + |0><0| + |-1/\u221a2><-1/\u221a2| = [1/2, 0, -1/2; 0, 0, 0; -1/2, 0, 1/2]\n\nThen, the probability is <\u03c8|P_0|\u03c8>\n\nGiven |\u03c8> = |-1/\u221a6; 2/\u221a6; 1/\u221a6|\n\nCompute P_0 |\u03c8> = [1/2, 0, -1/2; 0, 0, 0; -1/2, 0, 1/2] * |-1/\u221a6; 2/\u221a6; 1/\u221a6| = [1/2*(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (-1/2)*(1/\u221a6); 0*(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + 0*(1/\u221a6); (-1/2)*(-1/\u221a6) + 0*(2/\u221a6) + (1/2)*(1/\u221a6)] = [-1/(2\u221a6) - 1/(2\u221a6); 0; 1/(2\u221a6) + 1"
