                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two positive and two negative particles, all of which are the same type, denoted as A. The mass of particle A is given as \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\) MeV. The antiproton is slowly moving, which suggests that its velocity is much smaller than the speed of light, so we can consider it at rest for simplification.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the energy conservation in this process. The total energy before the annihilation should equal the total energy after the annihilation.\n\nBefore annihilation:\n\n- Proton: mass \\( m_p \\), slowly moving, so its energy is approximately its rest energy, \\( E_p = m_p c^2 \\).\n\n- Antiproton: mass \\( m_p \\), slowly moving, so its energy is also approximately its rest energy, \\( E_{\\bar{p}} = m_p c^2 \\).\n\nTotal initial energy: \\( E_{\\text{initial}} = E_p + E_{\\bar{p}} = 2 m_p c^2 \\).\n\nAfter annihilation:\n\n- Four particles of type A, each with energy \\( E_A \\).\n\nTotal final energy: \\( E_{\\text{final}} = 4 E_A \\).\n\nBy conservation of energy:\n\n\\[ 2 m_p c^2 = 4 E_A \\]\n\n\\[ E_A = \\frac{2 m_p c^2}{4} = \\frac{m_p c^2}{2} \\]\n\nBut wait, this seems too straightforward, and I suspect there might be a mistake because the mass of particle A is given as 300 MeV, which is different from the proton mass. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, so \\( m_p c^2 = 938 \\) MeV.\n\nSo, \\( E_A = \\frac{938}{2} = 469 \\) MeV.\n\nHowever, the rest energy of particle A is \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\) MeV. So, the total energy of particle A should be greater than its rest energy due to its kinetic energy.\n\nThe total energy of a relativistic particle is given by:\n\n\\[ E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2 \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\), and \\( \\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\).\n\nFrom above, \\( E_A = 469 \\) MeV, and \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\) MeV.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \\frac{469}{300} \\approx 1.5633 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( \\beta \\) from \\( \\gamma \\):\n\n\\[ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{1 - \\beta^2} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\]\n\n\\[ 1 - \\beta^2 = \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma^2}} \\]\n\nPlugging in \\( \\gamma = 1.5633 \\):\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2.4436}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{1 - 0.4092} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta = \\sqrt{0.5908} \\]\n\n\\[ \\beta \\approx 0.7686 \\]\n\nSo, the velocity \\( v = \\beta c \\approx 0.7686 c \\).\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 0.96c\n\nB. 0.86c\n\nC. 0.77c\n\nD. 0.91c\n\nOur calculated value is approximately 0.7686c, which rounds to 0.77c.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 0.77c.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if there's any mistake in the approach.\n\nI assumed that the antiproton is at rest because it's slowly moving. Is that a valid assumption?\n\nGiven that it's slowly moving, its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy, so treating it as at rest should be a reasonable approximation.\n\nAlso, I considered that all four particles A are produced with the same energy. Is that correct?\n\nIn particle physics, in such annihilation processes, the products typically share the available energy. Assuming that the four particles share the energy equally seems plausible, especially if they are identical particles.\n\nAnother point to consider is the momentum conservation. Since the initial system (proton + antiproton) has negligible momentum (because the antiproton is slowly moving), the total momentum after annihilation should also be zero.\n\nThis implies that the momenta of the four particles A should sum to zero. Therefore, they must be emitted in such a way that their momenta cancel each other out. This could happen, for example, if they are emitted in opposite directions in pairs.\n\nHowever, since all particles are identical and we're only interested in the magnitude of their velocity, this should not affect the energy calculation.\n\nLet me check the energy calculation again.\n\nInitial energy: \\( 2 m_p c^2 = 2 \\times 938 \\) MeV = 1876 MeV.\n\nFinal energy: \\( 4 E_A = 1876 \\) MeV.\n\nSo, \\( E_A = 469 \\) MeV.\n\nGiven that \\( E_A = \\gamma m_A c^2 \\), and \\( m_A c^2 = 300 \\) MeV, then \\( \\gamma = 469 / 300 \\approx 1.5633 \\), as previously calculated.\n\nFrom \\( \\gamma \\), we find \\( \\beta \\approx 0.7686 \\), which rounds to 0.77c.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. 0.77c.\n\nI think this is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0.77c} \\]"
