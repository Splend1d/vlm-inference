                    "text": "So I've got this problem here involving two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let's see... the masses are 2m and 3m, and their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. Okay, first things first, since they're moving at relativistic speeds, I can't just subtract their velocities to find the relative speed. I need to use the relativistic velocity subtraction formula.\n\nSo, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2)/c^2)\n\nWhere v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two objects in the same reference frame. In this case, both are moving in the positive x-direction, so their velocities are both positive.\n\nGiven that v1 = 0.6c and v2 = 0.5c, plugging these values in:\n\nv_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2)\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\n\nNow, the denominator:\n\n1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2 = 1 - (0.3c^2)/c^2 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n\nSo, v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. Okay, so the relative speed is about 0.14 times the speed of light.\n\nNow, for the total energy of the system. In special relativity, the total energy E of an object is given by:\n\nE = \u03b3 * m * c^2\n\nWhere \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor, given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nSo, for each astronaut, I need to calculate their individual total energy and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the astronaut with mass 2m moving at 0.6c:\n\n\u03b31 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1 / 0.8 = 1.25\n\nSo, E1 = \u03b31 * 2m * c^2 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5m c^2\n\nNext, for the astronaut with mass 3m moving at 0.5c:\n\n\u03b32 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5c)^2 / c^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1 / 0.866 \u2248 1.1547\n\nSo, E2 = \u03b32 * 3m * c^2 \u2248 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 \u2248 3.4641m c^2\n\nNow, the total energy E_total = E1 + E2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \u2248 5.9641m c^2\n\nRounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 5.96 m c^2.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2\n\nB. v_rel = 1.1c , E= mc^2\n\nC. v_rel =0.1c , E= 4.96 mc^2\n\nD. v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\nSo, our calculated relative speed is 0.14c and total energy is approximately 5.96 m c^2, which matches option D.\n\nWait a minute, but in the problem statement, it says \"here, c is the speed of light,\" so I should make sure that all my calculations are consistent with that.\n\nAlso, I should confirm if there's any other relativistic effect I need to consider for the total energy. For example, are there any interaction energies between the two astronauts that I need to account for? Given that they're just moving independently in the same direction, I think their total energy is just the sum of their individual energies.\n\nMoreover, I should double-check my calculation for the relative velocity to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me recalculate v_rel:\n\nv_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 * v2)/c^2) = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c^2) = (0.1c) / (1 - 0.3) = (0.1c) / 0.7 \u2248 0.142857c\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the total energy:\n\nFirst astronaut: \u03b31 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.6^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1.25\n\nE1 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5m c^2\n\nSecond astronaut: \u03b32 = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.5^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) \u2248 1.1547\n\nE2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c^2 \u2248 3.4641m c^2\n\nTotal energy E_total \u2248 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \u2248 5.9641m c^2\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be D. v_rel = 0.14c , E= 5.96 mc^2\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]"
