                    "text": "So I've got this problem here. I need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in a total volume of 100 cm\u00b3 using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. I need to find out two things: the minimum volume of this acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given, but I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. Fe(OH)3 is a base, specifically a hydroxide of iron(III). To dissolve it, I need to react it with an acid. Since it's a hydroxide, it will react with hydrogen ions from the acid to form water and ferric ions (Fe\u00b3+).\n\nThe reaction should look like this:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O\n\nSo, one mole of Fe(OH)3 requires three moles of H+ to completely dissolve.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have.\n\nGiven mass of Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g\n\nMolar mass of Fe(OH)3:\n\nFe: 55.845 g/mol\n\nO: 16.00 g/mol \u00d7 3 = 48.00 g/mol\n\nH: 1.01 g/mol \u00d7 3 = 3.03 g/mol\n\nTotal molar mass = 55.845 + 48.00 + 3.03 = 106.875 g/mol\n\nSo, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.875 g/mol \u2248 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol\n\nNow, according to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+. Therefore, moles of H+ needed = 3 \u00d7 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol \u2248 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol\n\nThe acid is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. \"Monobasic\" means it provides one H+ per molecule.\n\nSo, molarity (M) = moles of solute / volume in liters\n\nRearranging, volume = moles / molarity\n\nVolume of acid needed = 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm\u00b3\n\nLooking at the options, option B has 28.05 cm\u00b3, which is very close to my calculation. So, that seems plausible.\n\nNow, I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.\n\nAfter reacting all the Fe(OH)3, I've added 28.07 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M acid.\n\nTotal volume of the solution is 100 cm\u00b3.\n\nThe acid is strong and monobasic, so it completely dissociates into H+ ions.\n\nInitially, moles of H+ from acid = 0.1 M \u00d7 0.02807 L = 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol\n\nBut, all of these H+ ions have been used to react with Fe(OH)3 to form water and Fe\u00b3+.\n\nSo, in the resulting solution, there are no excess H+ ions from the acid.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if all the H+ ions are used up in the reaction, then the solution should be neutral, pH=7. But the options suggest a pH between 2 and 4, which is acidic.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nFe(OH)3 is a base, and I'm adding an acid to it. The reaction is:\n\nFe(OH)3 + 3H+ \u2192 Fe\u00b3+ + 3H2O\n\nInitially, I have 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol Fe(OH)3 and 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol H+.\n\nAccording to the stoichiometry, 1 mole Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles H+.\n\nSo, 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol Fe(OH)3 would require 3 \u00d7 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 = 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol H+, which is exactly what I'm adding.\n\nTherefore, all the Fe(OH)3 should dissolve, and all the H+ should be consumed in the reaction.\n\nBut, Fe\u00b3+ is a Lewis acid, meaning it can accept electron pairs and act acidic in water by forming hydronium ions (H3O+).\n\nSo, in aqueous solution, Fe\u00b3+ hydrolyzes:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThis makes the solution acidic.\n\nTo find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of H+ ions produced by this hydrolysis.\n\nFirst, find the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ in the solution.\n\nMoles of Fe\u00b3+ = moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved = 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol\n\nTotal volume = 100 cm\u00b3 = 0.1 L\n\nConcentration of Fe\u00b3+ = moles / volume = 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol / 0.1 L = 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M\n\nNow, for the hydrolysis reaction:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is the acid dissociation constant, Ka.\n\nFor Fe\u00b3+, the Ka value needs to be known.\n\nI recall that Fe\u00b3+ is a relatively strong Lewis acid, but I don't remember the exact Ka value off the top of my head.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relationship between Ka and the base dissociation constant Kb of the conjugate base.\n\nFe(OH)3 has a Ksp (solubility product constant), but here I need Ka for the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to look up the Ka or use the relationship with Kb.\n\nActually, for a general metal ion hydrolysis:\n\nM\u207f\u207a + H2O \u21cc M(OH)(n-1)+ + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be expressed in terms of the dissociation constants of water and the solubility product of the hydroxide.\n\nBut this might be getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the general formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a strong acid and a weak base.\n\nWait, in this case, Fe\u00b3+ is acting as an acid, and OH\u207b is its conjugate base.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the standard approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the pH of a solution of a metal ion that hydrolyzes.\n\nThe general approach is to consider the concentration of H+ produced by the hydrolysis.\n\nFor a simple case, the concentration of H+ can be approximated by:\n\n[H+] \u2248 sqrt(n * c * Ka)\n\nWhere:\n\n- n is the charge of the metal ion\n\n- c is the concentration of the metal ion\n\n- Ka is the acid dissociation constant for the hydrolysis\n\nBut I need to know Ka.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the relationship involving the dielectric constant and other factors, but that seems too involved.\n\nPerhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 to find the pH.\n\nThe solubility product constant, Ksp, for Fe(OH)3 is known and is very small, indicating that Fe(OH)3 has low solubility in water.\n\nThe Ksp expression for Fe(OH)3 is:\n\nKsp = [Fe\u00b3+][OH\u207b]^3\n\nAt 25\u00b0C, the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 2.79 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079.\n\nBut in this problem, we have dissolved Fe(OH)3 in acid, so the solution is acidic, and [H+] will be significant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the charge balance in the solution.\n\nIn any aqueous solution, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n\nIn this solution, we have Fe\u00b3+, H+, and OH\u207b ions.\n\nBut since the acid is strong and monobasic, and all the H+ has been used to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, there should be no excess H+ or OH\u207b, but that can't be right because Fe\u00b3+ will hydrolyze to produce H+.\n\nWait, perhaps I should set up the charge balance equation.\n\nCharge balance equation:\n\n[Fe\u00b3+] + [H+] = [OH\u207b]\n\nBecause Fe\u00b3+ is the only positive ion besides H+, and OH\u207b is the only negative ion besides any potential others, but in this case, it's just Fe\u00b3+, H+, and OH\u207b.\n\nBut actually, considering that Fe(OH)3 is dissolved, and Fe\u00b3+ is present, and H+ and OH\u207b from water autoionization and hydrolysis.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the proton condition or something similar.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the equilibrium involving the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\nKa = [Fe(OH)\u00b2+][H+]/[Fe\u00b3+]\n\nBut I don't know Ka.\n\nAlternatively, I can relate Ka to the Kb of the conjugate base, which is Fe(OH)\u00b2+.\n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)\u00b2+ can be related to the Ksp and the Kb of Fe(OH)3.\n\nThis seems too involved.\n\nPerhaps there is a simpler way to estimate the pH.\n\nGiven that Fe\u00b3+ is a strong enough acid to lower the pH significantly, but I need a numerical value.\n\nLooking back at the options, the pH values range from 2 to 5, which are acidic conditions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can approximate the pH based on the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ and assuming a certain degree of hydrolysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pH is primarily determined by the excess H+ ions after reacting with Fe(OH)3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assuming that all the H+ ions are consumed in reacting with Fe(OH)3.\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\nWe have 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 mol Fe(OH)3 requiring 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol H+ to dissolve completely.\n\nI added exactly 28.07 cm\u00b3 of 0.1 M acid, which provides 2.807 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 mol H+.\n\nSo, in theory, all the H+ should be consumed in dissolving the Fe(OH)3, leaving no excess H+ in the solution.\n\nHowever, as Fe\u00b3+ is formed, it hydrolyzes to produce H+, which would make the solution acidic.\n\nSo, even though all added H+ is consumed, the Fe\u00b3+ will release H+ through hydrolysis.\n\nTherefore, I need to calculate the H+ produced by the hydrolysis of Fe\u00b3+.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can set up an expression for the hydrolysis.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the concentration of Fe\u00b3+ as c = 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the concentration of H+ produced is x M.\n\nThen, the equilibrium concentrations are:\n\n[Fe\u00b3+] = c - x\n\n[Fe(OH)\u00b2+] = x\n\n[H+] = x\n\nThen, the acid dissociation constant Ka is:\n\nKa = ([Fe(OH)\u00b2+][H+])/[Fe\u00b3+] = (x * x)/(c - x) = x\u00b2/(c - x)\n\nNow, Ka for Fe\u00b3+ can be related to the dissociation constants of water and the solubility product of Fe(OH)3.\n\nAlternatively, Ka can be expressed in terms of the Kb of Fe(OH)3.\n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)3 can be found using the relationship:\n\nKb = Kw / Ksp\n\nWhere Kw is the ion product constant for water (1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074 at 25\u00b0C).\n\nGiven that Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 2.79 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079, then:\n\nKb = (1.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074) / (2.79 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079) \u2248 3.58 \u00d7 10\u00b2\u2074\n\nWait, that can't be right. Kb for Fe(OH)3 should be very small because Fe(OH)3 is a weak base.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the expressions here.\n\nLet me recall that for a base like Fe(OH)3, the base dissociation constant Kb is related to Ksp and Kw.\n\nActually, for Fe(OH)3, which is a tribasic base, the Kb expressions can be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the acid dissociation constant for Fe\u00b3+.\n\nThe hydrolysis reaction is:\n\nFe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+\n\nThe Ka for this reaction can be related to the Kb of Fe(OH)3.\n\nThe Kb for Fe(OH)3 is given by:\n\nKb = [Fe(OH)\u00b2+][OH\u207b]/[Fe(OH)3]\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship:\n\nKa * Kb = Kw\n\nBut in this case, Ka is for the acid dissociation of Fe\u00b3+, and Kb is for the base dissociation of Fe(OH)3.\n\nI think there might be a more straightforward way to approach this.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I can look up the approximate Ka value for Fe\u00b3+.\n\nUpon checking, the Ka for Fe\u00b3+ is approximately 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074.\n\nNote: This value may vary slightly depending on the source, but for the sake of this problem, I'll use Ka = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074.\n\nNow, going back to the expression:\n\nKa = x\u00b2 / (c - x)\n\nWhere c = 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M, and Ka = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074.\n\nAssuming that x is much smaller than c, then c - x \u2248 c.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 \u2248 Ka * c\n\nTherefore, x \u2248 sqrt(Ka * c) \u2248 sqrt(3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 * 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3) \u2248 sqrt(2.994 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076) \u2248 1.73 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M\n\nTherefore, [H+] \u2248 1.73 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M\n\npH = -log[H+] \u2248 -log(1.73 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3) \u2248 2.76\n\nLooking back at the options, option A has pH 2.69, which is close to my calculation.\n\nHowever, in my earlier calculation, I found that the volume of acid needed is approximately 28.07 cm\u00b3, which matches option B's volume of 28.05 cm\u00b3.\n\nBut the pH in option B is 2.04, which doesn't match my calculated pH of 2.76.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the Ka value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different approach to find the pH.\n\nLet me consider another method.\n\nIf Fe\u00b3+ is in solution, it can undergo stepwise hydrolysis:\n\n1. Fe\u00b3+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ Ka1\n\n2. Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H+ Ka2\n\n3. Fe(OH)\u00b2+ + H2O \u21cc Fe(OH)3 + H+ Ka3\n\nHowever, the successive Ka values decrease significantly, so the first hydrolysis step is the most significant.\n\nGiven that Ka1 is approximately 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074, as I used earlier, and Ka2 and Ka3 are much smaller, I can approximate that the pH is primarily determined by the first hydrolysis step.\n\nTherefore, my earlier calculation should be a reasonable approximation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the pH of a solution of a metal ion that hydrolyzes.\n\nThe general formula is:\n\npH = (pKa + pKb)/2\n\nWhere pKa is related to the hydrolysis constant.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact relationship here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship involving the concentration and the Ka value.\n\nWait, perhaps I can calculate the pH more accurately by solving the quadratic equation without assuming that x is much smaller than c.\n\nStarting from:\n\nKa = x\u00b2 / (c - x)\n\nRearranging:\n\nx\u00b2 + Ka*x - Ka*c = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x:\n\nx\u00b2 + Ka*x - Ka*c = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [-Ka \u00b1 sqrt(Ka\u00b2 + 4*Ka*c)] / 2\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nKa = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074\n\nc = 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 M\n\nSo,\n\nx = [-3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 \u00b1 sqrt((3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074)\u00b2 + 4 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 \u00d7 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3)] / 2\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\nD = (3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074)\u00b2 + 4 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 \u00d7 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\n\n= 1.024 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 + 4 \u00d7 3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 \u00d7 9.356 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3\n\n= 1.024 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2077 + 0.0001182592\n\n= 0.00011827 \u2248 0.0001183\n\nNow, x = [-3.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2074 + sqrt(0.0001183)] / 2\n\n(Note: We take the positive root since concentration can"
