                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand how the presence of spots affects the temperature of the star and, consequently, the population ratios of different energy levels in atoms within the stellar atmosphere.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of the number densities of atoms in two different energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(n_2\\) and \\(n_1\\) are the number densities of atoms in levels 2 and 1, respectively.\n\n- \\(g_2\\) and \\(g_1\\) are the statistical weights of levels 2 and 1, respectively.\n\n- \\(E_2 - E_1\\) is the energy difference between the two levels.\n\n- \\(k\\) is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n- \\(T\\) is the temperature.\n\nIn this problem, we are dealing with the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two different energy levels. The wavelength of the transition is given as approximately 1448 \u00c5, which corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels.\n\nFirst, we need to find the energy difference between the two levels. The energy of a photon is given by:\n\n\\[\nE = h c / \\lambda\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n- \\(h\\) is Planck's constant.\n\n- \\(c\\) is the speed of light.\n\n- \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength.\n\nGiven \\(\\lambda = 1448\\) \u00c5 = \\(1448 \\times 10^{-10}\\) m, we can calculate \\(E\\):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s} \\times 2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}}{1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}} \\approx 1.388 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nTo work with more convenient units, we can convert this energy into electron volts (eV):\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1.388 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}} \\approx 0.866 \\, \\text{eV}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find the ratio \\(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\) for both cases: when the star does not have spots and when it has spots.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(T_{\\text{no spots}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\)\n\n- \\(T_{\\text{spots}} = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\)\n\nAssuming that the statistical weights \\(g_2\\) and \\(g_1\\) are the same in both cases (since they are properties of the atomic levels and don't change with temperature), the ratio of the population ratios can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)_{\\text{no spots}}}{\\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{e^{-\\frac{E}{k T_{\\text{no spots}}}}}{e^{-\\frac{E}{k T_{\\text{spots}}}}} = e^{-\\frac{E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} \\right)}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)_{\\text{no spots}}}{\\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)_{\\text{spots}}} = e^{-\\frac{0.866 \\, \\text{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}} \\left( \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} \\right) \\, \\text{K}^{-1}}\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the term inside the exponent:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} = \\frac{5500 - 6000}{6000 \\times 5500} = \\frac{-500}{33,000,000} = -1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}\n\\]\n\nNow, plug this back into the exponent:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{0.866}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\times (-1.515 \\times 10^{-5}) = \\frac{0.866 \\times 1.515 \\times 10^{-5}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx \\frac{0.866 \\times 1.515}{8.617} \\approx \\frac{1.311}{8.617} \\approx 0.152\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)_{\\text{no spots}}}{\\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)_{\\text{spots}}} = e^{0.152} \\approx 1.165\n\\]\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the provided options. It seems there might be a mistake in the approach. Let's reconsider the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Therefore, the ratio \\(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\) is higher when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. So, the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots should be greater than 1.\n\nGiven that, our calculation seems to suggest a factor of about 1.165, which is option C. However, let's verify the calculations again to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, double-check the energy calculation:\n\n\\[\nE = h c / \\lambda = (6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J s}) \\times (2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\text{m/s}) / (1448 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\text{m}) \\approx 1.388 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J}\n\\]\n\nConvert to eV:\n\n\\[\nE = 1.388 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J} / (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}) \\approx 0.866 \\, \\text{eV}\n\\]\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNext, the temperature difference term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} = \\frac{1}{6000} - \\frac{1}{5500} = -1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}\n\\]\n\nThe negative sign indicates that \\(T_{\\text{spots}} < T_{\\text{no spots}}\\), which makes sense.\n\nNow, plugging into the exponent:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{E}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{no spots}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{spots}}} \\right) = -\\frac{0.866 \\, \\text{eV}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}} \\times (-1.515 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{K}^{-1}) = \\frac{0.866 \\times 1.515 \\times 10^{-5}}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.152\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\ne^{0.152} \\approx 1.165\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that the ratio increases by a factor of about 1.165 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which implies that the ratio is higher when there are no spots, consistent with our calculation.\n\nBut 1.165 is closest to option C (~1.1), but let's check if there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider the fraction of the star's surface that is covered by spots. The problem states that 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which reduces the overall Teff to 5500 K.\n\nMaybe we need to account for the temperature distribution over the star's surface.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\(f = 0.4\\) is the fraction covered by spots.\n\n- \\(T_{\\text{spots}} = ?\\)\n\n- \\(T_{\\text{unspotted}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\)\n\nThe overall effective temperature \\(T_{\\text{eff}}\\) is given by the area-weighted average of the temperatures:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{eff}}^4 = f \\, T_{\\text{spots}}^4 + (1 - f) \\, T_{\\text{unspotted}}^4\n\\]\n\nGiven \\(T_{\\text{eff}} = 5500 \\, \\text{K}\\), \\(T_{\\text{unspotted}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\), and \\(f = 0.4\\), we can solve for \\(T_{\\text{spots}}\\):\n\n\\[\n5500^4 = 0.4 \\, T_{\\text{spots}}^4 + 0.6 \\times 6000^4\n\\]\n\nCalculate \\(5500^4\\) and \\(6000^4\\):\n\n\\[\n5500^4 = (5.5 \\times 10^6)^2 = 30.25 \\times 10^{12}, \\quad \\text{then } 30.25 \\times 10^{12} \\times 5500^2 = 30.25 \\times 10^{12} \\times 30.25 \\times 10^6 = 915.00625 \\times 10^{18} = 9.1500625 \\times 10^{20}\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let's calculate \\(5500^4\\) properly:\n\n\\[\n5500^2 = 30,250,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n5500^4 = (5500^2)^2 = (30,250,000)^2 = 915,006,250,000,000\n\\]\n\nSimilarly:\n\n\\[\n6000^2 = 36,000,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n6000^4 = (6000^2)^2 = (36,000,000)^2 = 1,296,000,000,000,000\n\\]\n\nNow, plug these into the equation:\n\n\\[\n915,006,250,000,000 = 0.4 \\, T_{\\text{spots}}^4 + 0.6 \\times 1,296,000,000,000,000\n\\]\n\n\\[\n915,006,250,000,000 = 0.4 \\, T_{\\text{spots}}^4 + 777,600,000,000,000\n\\]\n\nSubtract 777,600,000,000,000 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n137,406,250,000,000 = 0.4 \\, T_{\\text{spots}}^4\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{spots}}^4 = \\frac{137,406,250,000,000}{0.4} = 343,515,625,000,000\n\\]\n\nTake the fourth root:\n\n\\[\nT_{\\text{spots}} = \\left( 343,515,625,000,000 \\right)^{1/4} \\approx 4289 \\, \\text{K}\n\\]\n\nSo, the spotted regions have a temperature of approximately 4289 K.\n\nNow, considering that the star has both spotted and unspotted regions, the overall spectrum is a combination of the two.\n\nWhen calculating the population ratios, we need to consider the temperature distribution over the star's surface.\n\nHowever, for simplicity, perhaps the effective temperature can be used directly in the Boltzmann equation, assuming that the average temperature corresponds to the effective temperature.\n\nBut earlier, we used the effective temperatures directly, leading to a factor of about 1.165, which is close to option C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratio of the population ratios should be calculated using the temperatures of the spotted and unspotted regions, weighted by their areas.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the unspotted regions have \\(T = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\) and the spotted regions have \\(T = 4289 \\, \\text{K}\\), with fractions 0.6 and 0.4, respectively.\n\nThe overall population ratio would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left< \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right> = 0.6 \\times \\frac{n_2}{n_1}(6000 \\, \\text{K}) + 0.4 \\times \\frac{n_2}{n_1}(4289 \\, \\text{K})\n\\]\n\nWhen there are no spots, the population ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n_2}{n_1}(6000 \\, \\text{K}) = \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-E / (k \\times 6000)}\n\\]\n\nWhen there are spots, the population ratio is:\n\n\\[\n\\left< \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right> = 0.6 \\times \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-E / (k \\times 6000)} + 0.4 \\times \\frac{g_2}{g_1} e^{-E / (k \\times 4289)}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the population ratios is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{n_2}{n_1}(6000 \\, \\text{K})}{\\left< \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right>} = \\frac{e^{-E / (k \\times 6000)}}{0.6 e^{-E / (k \\times 6000)} + 0.4 e^{-E / (k \\times 4289)}}\n\\]\n\nThis expression is more complex, but it accounts for the temperature inhomogeneities on the star's surface.\n\nLet\u2019s compute the exponentials:\n\nFirst, calculate \\(E / (k T)\\) for both temperatures.\n\nGiven \\(E = 0.866 \\, \\text{eV}\\) and \\(k = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}\\):\n\nFor \\(T = 6000 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{k T} = \\frac{0.866}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 6000} \\approx \\frac{0.866}{0.517} \\approx 1.675\n\\]\n\nFor \\(T = 4289 \\, \\text{K}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{E}{k T} = \\frac{0.866}{8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 4289} \\approx \\frac{0.866}{0.369} \\approx 2.347\n\\]\n\nNow, compute the exponentials:\n\n\\[\ne^{-1.675} \\approx 0.187\n\\]\n\n\\[\ne^{-2.347} \\approx 0.096\n\\]\n\nNow, plug these into the expression for the ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.187}{0.6 \\times 0.187 + 0.4 \\times 0.096} = \\frac{0.187}{0.1122 + 0.0384} = \\frac{0.187}{0.1506} \\approx 1.24\n\\]\n\nThis suggests that the ratio increases by a factor of about 1.24 when there are no spots compared to when there are spots.\n\nThis is still close to option C (~1.1), but not exactly matching any of the provided options.\n\nPerhaps there is a different approach needed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the ratio of the population ratios to be calculated differently, considering the overall effective temperature change.\n\nGiven that the effective temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K due to the spots, perhaps the ratio should be calculated based on the change in effective temperature.\n\nUsing the Boltzmann equation again:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\left( \\frac"
