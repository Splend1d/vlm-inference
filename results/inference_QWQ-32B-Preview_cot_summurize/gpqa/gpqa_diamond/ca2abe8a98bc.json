                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound, and I need to figure out its chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data.\n\nFirst, the FTIR spectrum shows absorption peaks indicating the presence of an ester group. So, I know there's an ester functional group in the molecule.\n\nNext, the 1H NMR spectrum provides some clues about the types of protons present:\n\n- Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H.\n\n- Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\n\n- Two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups.\n\n- No signals corresponding to \u2013CH2 groups.\n\nSo, let's try to piece this information together.\n\nStarting with the aromatic ring: it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, likely benzene. Since it's di-substituted, there are two substituents attached to the ring.\n\nThe aromatic-H signals suggest that the substituents are in positions that don't create equivalent sets of protons on the ring. If the substituents were in the para position, for example, they might create two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. But with two distinct aromatic signals, it's possible that the substituents are in the meta or ortho positions, where the proton environments are different.\n\nNow, the vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. This suggests that there are vinyl groups attached to the ring or to other substituents. A vinyl group has two protons, each adjacent to the double bond.\n\nThe doublet likely corresponds to one of the vinyl protons, coupled to the other vinyl proton. The doublet of quartets suggests that this proton is also coupled to other protons, possibly from a \u2013CH3 group or another substituent.\n\nAdditionally, there are two signals corresponding to \u2013CH3 groups. Since there are two distinct signals for methyl groups, they are likely in different chemical environments.\n\nMoreover, there are no \u2013CH2 signals, which means there are no methylene groups in the molecule.\n\nGiven that it's a di-substituted benzene, let's consider possible substituents that could fit this description.\n\nSince there's an ester group present, one of the substituents could be an ester. Ester groups have the structure R-CO-O-R', where R and R' can be alkyl or aryl groups.\n\nLet's consider possible substituents:\n\n1. One substituent is an ester group, say, \u2013COOCH3 (methyl ester).\n\n2. The other substituent could be a vinyl group, \u2013CH=CH2.\n\nBut wait, the NMR shows vinyl-H signals, so there are protons on the vinyl group.\n\nHowever, if one substituent is \u2013COOCH3 and the other is \u2013CH=CH2, attached to the benzene ring in the meta or ortho positions.\n\nLet's try to count the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms to see which formula fits.\n\nFirst, benzene has 6 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms.\n\nAdding \u2013COOCH3: this adds 1 carbon from the carbonyl, 1 oxygen, 1 carbon from the methoxy group, and 3 hydrogens from the methyl group.\n\nSo, +1 C, +1 O, +1 C, +3 H.\n\nTotal so far: 6 +1 +1 = 8 C, 6 +3 = 9 H.\n\nAdding \u2013CH=CH2: this adds 2 carbon atoms and 3 hydrogen atoms.\n\nTotal: 8 +2 = 10 C, 9 +3 = 12 H.\n\nBut looking at the options, none match C10H12O2.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nBenzene: 6 C, 6 H.\n\n\u2013COOCH3: +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013CH=CH2: +2 C, +3 H.\n\nTotal: 6 +2 +2 = 10 C, 6 +3 +3 = 12 H, 1 O.\n\nBut the options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.\n\nHmm, I need to have two oxygen atoms, but I only have one in this scenario.\n\nWait, the ester group has one oxygen. Maybe there's another oxygen somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the substituents has an oxygen.\n\nLet me consider if the ester group has two oxygens. No, esters have one oxygen.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a different functional group.\n\nWait, the FTIR shows an ester group, but maybe there's another oxygen-containing group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ester is part of a larger substituent.\n\nLet me consider if the substituents could be different.\n\nOption: one substituent is \u2013COOCH3, and the other is \u2013OCH3.\n\nWait, but \u2013OCH3 is an ether, not an ester.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit because the FTIR indicates an ester.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both substituents are esters.\n\nWait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents.\n\nIf both are ester groups, say, \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013COOCH3.\n\nThen, benzene: 6 C, 6 H.\n\n\u2013COOCH3: +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTwo of them: +4 C, +6 H, +2 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +4 = 10 C, 6 +6 = 12 H, 2 O.\n\nBut the options have 11 or 12 carbons and 12 or 14 hydrogens.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one ester group is larger.\n\nFor example, \u2013COOCH2CH3 (ethyl ester).\n\nThen, \u2013COOCH2CH3: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\nAnd \u2013CH=CH2: +2 C, +3 H.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 O.\n\nBut the options require two oxygen atoms.\n\nWait, the FTIR shows an ester, which has one oxygen.\n\nMaybe there's another oxygen somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituent is something like \u2013COOCH2COOCH3 or something, but that seems too complicated for a di-substituted benzene.\n\nWait, maybe one substituent is \u2013COOCH2CH3 and the other is \u2013OH, which would provide the second oxygen.\n\nThen, benzene: 6 C, 6 H.\n\n\u2013COOCH2CH3: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013OH: +0 C, +1 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 = 9 C, 6 +5 +1 = 12 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nBut the options start with 11 C, so that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is substituted.\n\nFor example, \u2013CH=CH-OCH3, which would introduce another oxygen.\n\nThen, \u2013CH=CH-OCH3: +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nAnd \u2013COOCH3: +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +2 +2 = 10 C, 6 +3 +3 = 12 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nStill not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a larger substituent.\n\nWait, maybe the substituent is \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, which is vinyl ester.\n\nThen, \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3: +3 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nAnd \u2013COOCH3: +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C, 6 +3 +3 = 12 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nThat matches C11H12O2, which is option B.\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense with the NMR data.\n\nIn this case, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one \u2013COOCH3 and one \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3.\n\nThe aromatic protons would likely be deshielded differently due to the substituents, giving two distinct signals.\n\nThe vinyl group in \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 would have two protons: one on each end of the double bond.\n\nIn the NMR, one would see splitting patterns based on coupling to each other and possibly to nearby protons.\n\nThe \u2013CH3 group from \u2013COOCH3 would be one signal, and perhaps there's another \u2013CH3 group from somewhere else.\n\nWait, but in this structure, \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 has no \u2013CH3 group directly attached to the vinyl group.\n\nWait, \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3: the \u2013CH3 is attached to the ester oxygen.\n\nSo, there would be one \u2013CH3 signal from \u2013COOCH3.\n\nIs there another \u2013CH3 group?\n\nIn this structure, only one \u2013CH3 group is present.\n\nBut the NMR shows two \u2013CH3 signals.\n\nSo, perhaps there's another \u2013CH3 group.\n\nWait, maybe the substituent is \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 and \u2013COOCH3.\n\nTotal \u2013CH3 groups: two.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, total \u2013CH3 groups: one from each ester.\n\nThus, two \u2013CH3 signals.\n\nNow, regarding the vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets.\n\nIn \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, the protons on the vinyl group are coupled to each other (likely giving a doublet), and one of them is also coupled to the protons from the \u2013COOCH3 group, possibly giving a doublet of quartets.\n\nThis could match the observed NMR signals.\n\nSo, this structure seems consistent with the data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different arrangement.\n\nLet me consider if the substituents could be \u2013COOCH2CH3 and \u2013CH=CH2.\n\nThen, \u2013COOCH2CH3: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013CH=CH2: +2 C, +3 H.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 O.\n\nBut we need two oxygen atoms.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another oxygen somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \u2013CH=CH2 is substituted with an oxygen.\n\nFor example, \u2013CH=CH-OCH3, which would be +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nThen, \u2013COOCH2CH3: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nThat would be C11H14O2, option D.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 and \u2013COOCH3, which gave C11H12O2, option B.\n\nWhich one is correct?\n\nLet me check the NMR data again.\n\nIn the first case (\u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 and \u2013COOCH3):\n\n- Aromatic-H: two signals, likely due to different chemical environments from the substituents.\n\n- Vinyl-H: two protons, one doublet and one doublet of quartets, which could arise from coupling in the \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 group.\n\n- \u2013CH3: two signals, one from each ester.\n\nIn the second case (\u2013CH=CH-OCH3 and \u2013COOCH2CH3):\n\n- Aromatic-H: two signals, again due to different substituents.\n\n- Vinyl-H: in \u2013CH=CH-OCH3, the vinyl protons could show as a doublet and a doublet of quartets due to coupling to each other and to the \u2013OCH3 group.\n\n- \u2013CH3: one from \u2013OCH3 and one from \u2013COOCH2CH3.\n\nWait, but \u2013OCH3 is an ether, not an ester. The FTIR shows an ester, so there needs to be at least one ester group.\n\nIn this second case, there are two ester groups? Wait, \u2013COOCH2CH3 is an ester, and \u2013CH=CH-OCH3 is an ether. So, only one ester group.\n\nBut the FTIR shows an ester, so one ester is present.\n\nHowever, the options have two oxygen atoms, so perhaps there are two ester groups.\n\nWait, in the first case, \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3 and \u2013COOCH3, both are esters.\n\nThat would give two ester groups, matching the two oxygen atoms.\n\nBut in this case, total \u2013CH3 groups are two, which matches the NMR.\n\nIn the second case, only one ester and one ether, but FTIR shows an ester, so it's possible.\n\nBut the options have two oxygen atoms, so likely there are two ester groups.\n\nTherefore, the first case seems more consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different arrangement.\n\nLet me consider if the substituents could be \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, as I initially thought.\n\nThat would give C11H12O2, option B.\n\nBut the options also include C11H14O2 and C12H12O2.\n\nWait, maybe the molecular formula is C12H12O2, option A.\n\nIs there a way to have that?\n\nIf the substituents are, for example, \u2013COOCH2CH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3.\n\nThen, benzene: 6 C, 6 H.\n\n\u2013COOCH2CH3: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013CH=CHCOOCH3: +3 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +3 = 12 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nWait, that's C12H14O2, option C.\n\nBut the options don't include that.\n\nWait, option C is C12H14O2.\n\nBut in this case, total H is 14, but in the NMR, there are no \u2013CH2 signals, which might be present in \u2013COOCH2CH3.\n\nWait, but \u2013COOCH2CH3 has a \u2013CH2\u2013 group, which would give \u2013CH2 signals in NMR, but the problem states there are no \u2013CH2 signals.\n\nTherefore, this arrangement is inconsistent with the NMR data.\n\nThus, the molecular formula can't be C12H14O2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, giving C11H12O2, option B.\n\nBut earlier, I thought about that, and it seemed plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH2CH3 and \u2013OCH3.\n\nThen, benzene: 6 C, 6 H.\n\n\u2013COOCH2CH3: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013OCH3: +1 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +1 = 10 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nBut the options don't include C10H14O2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me consider if the substituents could be \u2013COOCH(CH3)2 and \u2013CH=CH2.\n\nThen, \u2013COOCH(CH3)2: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013CH=CH2: +2 C, +3 H.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +2 = 11 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 O.\n\nBut we need two oxygen atoms.\n\nWait, perhaps another substituent has an oxygen.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one substituent is \u2013COOCH(CH3)2 and the other is \u2013OCH3.\n\nThen, \u2013COOCH(CH3)2: +3 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013OCH3: +1 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +3 +1 = 10 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nAgain, not matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, totaling 11 C and 12 H, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the substituents are \u2013COOCH2CH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, giving C12H14O2, option C.\n\nBut earlier, that was inconsistent with the NMR due to the presence of \u2013CH2 signals.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct formula is C11H12O2, option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe the substituents are \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH2CH3.\n\nThen, \u2013CH=CHCOOCH2CH3: +4 C, +5 H, +1 O.\n\n\u2013COOCH3: +2 C, +3 H, +1 O.\n\nTotal: 6 +4 +2 = 12 C, 6 +5 +3 = 14 H, 1 +1 = 2 O.\n\nThat's C12H14O2, option C.\n\nBut again, the NMR shows no \u2013CH2 signals, which would be present in \u2013CH=CHCOOCH2CH3.\n\nTherefore, this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, giving C11H12O2, option B.\n\nThis seems to be the most consistent so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH2CH3, giving C12H14O2, option C.\n\nBut again, the NMR doesn't show \u2013CH2 signals, which would be present in \u2013CH=CHCOOCH2CH3.\n\nTherefore, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, which is C11H12O2, option B.\n\nThis seems to be the best fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substituents are \u2013COOCH2CH3 and \u2013CH=CHCOOCH3, giving C12"
