                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have some spectral data for an unknown white solid, and we need to identify which of the given compounds it matches based on mass, IR, and 1H NMR spectra.\n\nFirst, the mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) and another peak at m/z = 158 (32%). This suggests that the molecular formula likely corresponds to a molecular weight of around 156 g/mol, with the m/z = 158 peak possibly indicating the presence of chlorine, since chlorine has two naturally occurring isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37, with Cl-35 being more abundant.\n\nLet's consider the molecular formula for each option:\n\nA. 4-chlorobenzoic acid: C7H5O2Cl. Calculating the molecular weight: (7*12.01) + (5*1.01) + (2*16.00) + 35.45 = 84.07 + 5.05 + 32.00 + 35.45 = 156.57 g/mol. That matches the m/z = 156.\n\nB. 2-chlorobenzoic acid: Similar to A, the molecular formula is the same, C7H5O2Cl, so molecular weight should also be around 156.57 g/mol.\n\nC. 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: C7H6O2Cl. Molecular weight: (7*12.01) + (6*1.01) + (2*16.00) + 35.45 = 84.07 + 6.06 + 32.00 + 35.45 = 157.58 g/mol. Close to 156, but slightly off.\n\nD. Phenyl chloroformate: C8H7O2Cl. Molecular weight: (8*12.01) + (7*1.01) + (2*16.00) + 35.45 = 96.08 + 7.07 + 32.00 + 35.45 = 170.60 g/mol. This is higher than 156, so probably not this one.\n\nSo, options A and B are looking good so far.\n\nNext, the IR spectrum shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1.\n\nThe broad peak in that region is typical of O-H stretching vibrations, which suggests the presence of a hydroxyl group. However, looking at the options:\n\nA and B are 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 2-chlorobenzoic acid, respectively, which have a carboxylic acid group (COOH), which would show a broad peak in that region due to O-H stretching.\n\nOption C is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which also has an O-H group from the hydroxyl, so it could also show a broad peak in that region.\n\nOption D is phenyl chloroformate, which doesn't have an O-H group, so it wouldn't show this broad peak.\n\nBut since A and B both have carboxylic acids, which have O-H groups, they could both account for this broad peak.\n\nThe strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). In A and B, the carboxylic acid has a C=O stretch around 1700-1750 cm^-1, so that fits. In C, the benzaldehyde also has a C=O from the aldehyde group, which typically appears around 1720 cm^-1. So, all three A, B, and C could match this IR data.\n\nMoving on to the 1H NMR data:\n\n11.0 ppm (s, 1H): This is likely the carboxylic acid proton, which can be sharp and downfield due to hydrogen bonding.\n\n8.02 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet at around 8.0 ppm suggests aromatic protons.\n\n7.72 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet at 7.72 ppm, also aromatic.\n\nFirst, in benzoic acids (options A and B), the carboxylic acid proton is often exchangeable and can appear as a sharp singlet around 10-12 ppm due to hydrogen bonding. So, the 11.0 ppm singlet fits.\n\nFor the aromatic protons, in ortho, meta, and para substituted benzenes, the proton patterns differ.\n\nIn option A, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the chloro group is at the para position to the carboxylic acid. Typically, in para-disubstituted benzene, the aromatic protons are equivalent and should appear as a single multiplet. However, in this NMR, there are two sets of protons: one doublet at 8.02 ppm and another at 7.72 ppm. This suggests that the protons are not all equivalent, which might not fit with a para-substituted benzoic acid.\n\nOption B, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, has the chloro group at the ortho position to the carboxylic acid. In ortho-disubstituted benzenes, the aromatic protons are typically split into two sets due to the coupling through the ring. This could match the two doublets observed in the NMR.\n\nOption C, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, has substitutions at positions 2 and 3, which are adjacent (ortho) to each other. The aromatic protons would likely be split into multiple peaks due to coupling, which might not directly match the two doublets observed.\n\nOption D, phenyl chloroformate, has different substituents, and its NMR would likely show different patterns.\n\nGiven this, option B, 2-chlorobenzoic acid, seems to better match the NMR data with two sets of aromatic protons.\n\nAdditionally, the mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z = 158, which is likely due to the presence of chlorine-37. Both A and B have chlorine, so this doesn't distinguish between them.\n\nHowever, considering the NMR data, where option A (para substitution) would likely show a single set of aromatic protons due to equivalence, whereas option B (ortho substitution) would show splitting into two sets, matching the observed doublets.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable structural suggestion for the unidentified drug is option B, 2-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
