For now, we can consider its H+ contribution negligible in comparison.\n\n3. **Calculate the net moles of H+ and OH-:**\n\n   - Total moles of H+ = moles from HCl = 0.08 moles\n   - Total moles of OH- = moles from Ba(OH)2 = 0.18 moles\n\n   - Since OH- and H+ will react to form water:\n     \\[\n     \\text{H}^+ + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{H2O}\n     \\]\n     The reaction will consume equal moles of H+ and OH-.\n\n   - Moles of H+ remaining = 0.08 - 0.18 = -0.10 moles\n     Since the result is negative, it means all H+ ions are consumed, and there are excess OH- ions.\n\n   - Therefore, moles of OH- remaining = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles\n\n4. **Calculate the total volume of the solution:**\n\n   - Total volume = 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L\n\n5. **Calculate the concentration of OH-:**\n\n   - [OH-] = moles of OH- / total volume = 0.10 moles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.0833 M\n\n6. **Calculate the pOH and then the pH:**\n\n   - pOH = -log[OH-] = -log(0.0833) \u2248 1.08\n   - pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.08 \u2248 12.92\n\nHowever, this result does not match any of the given options. Let's re-examine the calculations.\n\n**Re-examination:**\n\n- Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles\n- Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 moles\n- Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 moles\n\nAfter neutralization:\n- H+ + OH- \u2192 H2O\n- Excess OH- = 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles\n\nBut, CH3COOH can react with OH-:\n\\[\n\\text{CH3COOH} + \\text{OH}^- \\rightarrow \\text{CH3COO}^- + \\text{H2O}\n\\]\n\n- Moles of OH- remaining after reacting with CH3COOH:\n  - OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.05 moles OH- react with 0.05 moles CH3COOH\n  - Excess OH- = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 moles\n\n- Total volume = 1.2 L\n- [OH-] = 0.05 moles / 1.2 L \u2248 0.0417 M\n- pOH = -log(0.0417) \u2248 1.38\n- pH = 14 - 1.38 \u2248 12.62\n\nThis matches option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]"
