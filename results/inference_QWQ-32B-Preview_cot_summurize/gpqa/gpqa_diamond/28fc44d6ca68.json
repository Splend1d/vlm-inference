                    "text": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. We have an atomic nucleus with mass M and rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, one twice as massive as the other, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.\n\nFirst, let's understand the masses involved. Let's denote the rest masses of the two fragments as m1 and m2, with m1 = 2 * m2. According to the problem, m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M.\n\nSince m1 = 2 * m2, we can write:\n\n2 * m2 + m2 = 0.99 * M\n\n3 * m2 = 0.99 * M\n\nm2 = (0.99 * M) / 3 = 0.33 * M\n\nThen, m1 = 2 * m2 = 0.66 * M\n\nNow, the total rest mass energy of the fragments is:\n\nE_rest = m1 * c\u00b2 + m2 * c\u00b2 = 0.66 * M * c\u00b2 + 0.33 * M * c\u00b2 = 0.99 * M * c\u00b2\n\nGiven that the initial rest mass energy is M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, the rest mass energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.\n\nThe difference between the initial rest mass energy and the final rest mass energy is the kinetic energy released in the fission:\n\n\u0394E = M * c\u00b2 - (m1 * c\u00b2 + m2 * c\u00b2) = 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV\n\nThis kinetic energy is shared between the two fragments. Since the fragments are moving in opposite directions due to conservation of momentum, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\n\nLet's denote the momenta of the fragments as p1 and p2, with p1 = -p2 (since they're equal in magnitude but opposite in direction).\n\nFrom relativistic dynamics, the total energy of each fragment is:\n\nE1 = sqrt( p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 * c\u2074 )\n\nE2 = sqrt( p2\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 * c\u2074 )\n\nThe total energy conservation gives:\n\nE1 + E2 = M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nBut we also have:\n\nE1 - E2 = p1 * c - p2 * c = 2 * p1 * c (since p2 = -p1)\n\nSo, E1 - E2 = 2 * p1 * c\n\nWe can solve for p1 using these equations:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nE1 - E2 = 2 * p1 * c\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2 * E1 = 300 GeV + 2 * p1 * c \u21d2 E1 = 150 GeV + p1 * c\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n2 * E2 = 300 GeV - 2 * p1 * c \u21d2 E2 = 150 GeV - p1 * c\n\nNow, we can use the expression for E1:\n\nE1 = sqrt( p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 * c\u2074 )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nE1\u00b2 = p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nSubstituting E1 from above:\n\n(150 GeV + p1 * c)^2 = p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + (0.66 * M)^2 * c^4\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n22500 GeV\u00b2 + 300 GeV * p1 * c + p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + (0.66 * M)^2 * c^4\n\nThe p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 terms cancel out:\n\n22500 GeV\u00b2 + 300 GeV * p1 * c = (0.66 * M)^2 * c^4\n\nBut M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV, so M = 300 GeV / c\u00b2\n\nThus, (0.66 * M)^2 * c^4 = (0.66 * 300 GeV / c\u00b2)^2 * c^4 = (0.66 * 300 GeV)^2 / c\u2074 * c^4 = (198 GeV)^2 = 39204 GeV\u00b2\n\nSo, we have:\n\n22500 GeV\u00b2 + 300 GeV * p1 * c = 39204 GeV\u00b2\n\nSolving for p1 * c:\n\n300 GeV * p1 * c = 39204 GeV\u00b2 - 22500 GeV\u00b2 = 16704 GeV\u00b2\n\np1 * c = 16704 GeV\u00b2 / 300 GeV = 55.68 GeV\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n\nT1 = E1 - m1 * c\u00b2\n\nWe have E1 = 150 GeV + p1 * c = 150 GeV + 55.68 GeV = 205.68 GeV\n\nm1 * c\u00b2 = 0.66 * M * c\u00b2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n\nTherefore, T1 = 205.68 GeV - 198 GeV = 7.68 GeV\n\nNow, let's calculate T1 using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.\n\nIn the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is given by:\n\nT = (1/2) * m * v\u00b2\n\nFirst, we need to find the velocities of the fragments.\n\nFrom conservation of momentum:\n\nm1 * v1 + m2 * v2 = 0\n\nGiven m1 = 2 * m2, and v2 = -v1 (since they move in opposite directions):\n\n2 * m2 * v1 + m2 * (-v1) = 0 \u21d2 2 * m2 * v1 - m2 * v1 = m2 * v1 = 0\n\nThis implies v1 = 0, which can't be right. Wait, that can't be right. Let's re-examine.\n\nActually, since m1 = 2 * m2, and they move in opposite directions with momenta p1 and p2 = -p1, their velocities are related by:\n\np1 = m1 * v1\n\np2 = m2 * v2 = -p1 \u21d2 v2 = -p1 / m2\n\nBut m1 = 2 * m2, so p1 = m1 * v1 = 2 * m2 * v1\n\nThus, v1 = p1 / (2 * m2)\n\nAnd v2 = -p1 / m2\n\nNow, the kinetic energies in the non-relativistic approximation are:\n\nT1 = (1/2) * m1 * v1\u00b2 = (1/2) * 2 * m2 * (p1 / (2 * m2))\u00b2 = m2 * (p1\u00b2 / (4 * m2\u00b2)) = p1\u00b2 / (4 * m2)\n\nSimilarly, T2 = (1/2) * m2 * v2\u00b2 = (1/2) * m2 * (p1 / m2)\u00b2 = (1/2) * m2 * (p1\u00b2 / m2\u00b2) = p1\u00b2 / (2 * m2)\n\nThe total kinetic energy is T1 + T2 = p1\u00b2 / (4 * m2) + p1\u00b2 / (2 * m2) = (p1\u00b2 / 4 m2) + (2 p1\u00b2 / 4 m2) = (3 p1\u00b2 / 4 m2)\n\nBut we know that in reality, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV\n\nSo, 3 GeV = 3 p1\u00b2 / (4 m2)\n\nTherefore, p1\u00b2 / m2 = 4 GeV\n\nNow, from earlier, p1 * c = 55.68 GeV, so p1 = 55.68 GeV / c\n\nThus, p1\u00b2 = (55.68 GeV)^2 / c\u00b2\n\nBut in natural units, c = 1, so p1\u00b2 = (55.68 GeV)^2\n\nTherefore, p1\u00b2 / m2 = (55.68 GeV)^2 / m2 = 4 GeV\n\nSo, m2 = (55.68 GeV)^2 / 4 GeV = (3099.9424 GeV\u00b2) / 4 GeV = 774.9856 GeV\n\nBut earlier, m2 * c\u00b2 = 0.33 * M * c\u00b2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV\n\nSo, m2 = 99 GeV / c\u00b2\n\nThis suggests a inconsistency, which probably comes from using non-relativistic approximation for a relativistic problem.\n\nLet's instead calculate T1 in the non-relativistic approximation using the total kinetic energy.\n\nGiven T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, and T1 / T2 = m2 / m1 (since kinetic energies are inversely proportional to masses in elastic collisions, but this might not directly apply here)\n\nWait, actually, in the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energies are distributed according to the reduced mass.\n\nAlternatively, since m1 = 2 * m2, and they have equal and opposite momenta, p1 = -p2.\n\nThus, p1 = p and p2 = -p\n\nThen, v1 = p / m1 and v2 = -p / m2\n\nThe kinetic energies are:\n\nT1 = (1/2) m1 v1\u00b2 = (1/2) m1 (p / m1)^2 = (1/2) p\u00b2 / m1\n\nT2 = (1/2) m2 v2\u00b2 = (1/2) m2 (p / m2)^2 = (1/2) p\u00b2 / m2\n\nThus, T1 / T2 = (1/2) p\u00b2 / m1 / (1/2) p\u00b2 / m2 = m2 / m1 = 1/2\n\nSo, T1 = (1/2) T2\n\nAnd T1 + T2 = 3 GeV \u21d2 (1/2) T2 + T2 = (3/2) T2 = 3 GeV \u21d2 T2 = 2 GeV, T1 = 1 GeV\n\nTherefore, in the non-relativistic approximation, T1 = 1 GeV\n\nBut from the relativistic calculation, T1 = 7.68 GeV\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I got T1 = 7.68 GeV, but that seems too high compared to the total kinetic energy of 3 GeV.\n\nWait, actually, that can't be right. If T1 + T2 = 3 GeV, and T1 = 7.68 GeV, that would imply T2 = -4.68 GeV, which is impossible.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.\n\nLet me double-check the relativistic calculation.\n\nWe had:\n\nE1 = 150 GeV + p1 * c = 150 GeV + 55.68 GeV = 205.68 GeV\n\nm1 * c\u00b2 = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV\n\nThen, T1 = E1 - m1 * c\u00b2 = 205.68 GeV - 198 GeV = 7.68 GeV\n\nBut T1 + T2 should be 3 GeV, so T2 = 3 GeV - 7.68 GeV = -4.68 GeV, which is unphysical.\n\nThis suggests an error in the calculation.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nUsing the conservation of energy and momentum:\n\nInitial energy: M * c\u00b2 = 300 GeV\n\nInitial momentum: 0\n\nFinal energies: E1 and E2\n\nFinal momenta: p1 and p2, with p2 = -p1\n\nThus:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\np1 = -p2\n\nAlso, E1\u00b2 = p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + m1\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nE2\u00b2 = p2\u00b2 * c\u00b2 + m2\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nSince p2 = -p1, p2\u00b2 = p1\u00b2\n\nSo, E1\u00b2 - p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nE2\u00b2 - p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m2\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\nE1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2 - 2 * p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 * c\u2074 + m2\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nBut E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, and E1 * E2 = (E1 + E2)^2 / 2 - (E1\u00b2 + E2\u00b2)/2\n\nWait, maybe it's better to solve for p1.\n\nFrom E1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nAnd E1\u00b2 - p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nE2\u00b2 - p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m2\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote E1 and E2 as variables.\n\nWe have:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nE1\u00b2 - p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nE2\u00b2 - p1\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = m2\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\nE1\u00b2 - E2\u00b2 = m1\u00b2 * c\u2074 - m2\u00b2 * c\u2074\n\n(E1 - E2)(E1 + E2) = (m1\u00b2 - m2\u00b2) c\u2074\n\nBut E1 + E2 = 300 GeV, so:\n\n(E1 - E2) * 300 GeV = (m1\u00b2 - m2\u00b2) c\u2074\n\nBut m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M, M = 300 GeV / c\u00b2\n\nSo, m1 = 0.66 * 300 GeV / c\u00b2 = 198 GeV / c\u00b2\n\nm2 = 0.33 * 300 GeV / c\u00b2 = 99 GeV / c\u00b2\n\nThus, m1\u00b2 = (198 GeV)^2 / c\u2074\n\nm2\u00b2 = (99 GeV)^2 / c\u2074\n\nTherefore, m1\u00b2 - m2\u00b2 = [(198)^2 - (99)^2] (GeV)^2 / c\u2074 = [39204 - 9801] (GeV)^2 / c\u2074 = 29403 (GeV)^2 / c\u2074\n\nSo, (E1 - E2) * 300 GeV = 29403 (GeV)^2 / c\u2074 * c\u2074 = 29403 (GeV)^2\n\nTherefore, E1 - E2 = 29403 GeV\u00b2 / 300 GeV = 98.01 GeV\n\nNow, we have:\n\nE1 + E2 = 300 GeV\n\nE1 - E2 = 98.01 GeV\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n2 * E1 = 398.01 GeV \u21d2 E1 = 199.005 GeV\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\n2 * E2 = 201.99 GeV \u21d2 E2 = 100.995 GeV\n\nNow, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:\n\nT1 = E1 - m1 * c\u00b2 = 199.005 GeV - 198 GeV = 1.005 GeV\n\nSimilarly, T2 = E2 - m2 * c\u00b2 = 100.995 GeV - 99 GeV = 1.995 GeV\n\nSo, T1 + T2 = 1.005 GeV + 1.995 GeV = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nNow, in the non-relativistic approximation, we had T1 = 1 GeV and T2 = 2 GeV, which is close to the relativistic values.\n\nBut wait, in the non-relativistic calculation, I got T1 = 1 GeV, while relativistically it's 1.005 GeV. The difference seems very small.\n\nWait, but the options are in MeV, which is 10^-3 GeV.\n\nSo, the difference between the relativistic T1 and non-relativistic T1 is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV = 5 MeV.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 10 MeV.\n\nB. 2 MeV.\n\nC. 20 MeV.\n\nD. 5 MeV.\n\nSo, the answer seems to be D. 5 MeV.\n\nBut let me verify the non-relativistic calculation again to ensure.\n\nIn the non-relativistic case:\n\nT1 = (1/2) m1 v1\u00b2\n\nT2 = (1/2) m2 v2\u00b2\n\nWith m1 = 2 m2 and v1 = -v2 (in terms of magnitude, since they move in opposite directions).\n\nFrom conservation of momentum:\n\nm1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0 \u21d2 2 m2 v1 + m2 (-v1) = 0 \u21d2 2 m2 v1 - m2 v1 = m2 v1 = 0 \u21d2 v1 = 0, which can't be.\n\nWait, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake.\n\nActually, if m1 = 2 m2 and they have equal and opposite momenta, p1 = -p2.\n\nThus, p1 ="
