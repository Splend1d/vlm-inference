                    "text": "So there's this problem about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment that's aligned with a magnetic field in the +Z direction. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both fields have the same magnitude B. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to recall some basics about spin and magnetic moments in quantum mechanics. For a spin 1/2 particle, the spin operator along the z-axis is Sz, and the magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma * Sz, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nInitially, the particle is aligned with the magnetic field in the +Z direction. So, the initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2, right? Because spin up along Z.\n\nNow, when the magnetic field is turned off and then turned on along the +Y direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian determines the time evolution of the system.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu \u00b7 B. So, initially, H_initial = -mu_z * B_z = -gamma * Sz * B.\n\nWhen the field is turned off and then turned on along +Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H = -mu_y * B_y = -gamma * Sy * B, where Sy is the spin operator along Y.\n\nWait, but mu = gamma * Sz, so mu_y would be gamma * Sy, right? Because the magnetic moment vector is proportional to the spin vector.\n\nSo, H = -gamma * Sy * B.\n\nNow, I need to find how the z-component of the magnetic moment oscillates over time after this sudden change.\n\nThe average of the z-component of the magnetic moment is <mu_z> = <psi| mu_z |psi> = gamma * <psi| Sz |psi>.\n\nBut the state |psi> evolves in time according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma * Sy * B.\n\nSo, I need to solve for |psi(t)> given the initial state |psi(0)>.\n\nThe initial state is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2, which we can denote as |+z>.\n\nNow, under the new Hamiltonian H = -gamma * Sy * B, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i * H * t / \u0127).\n\nSo, |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = exp(i * gamma * Sy * B * t / \u0127) |+z>.\n\nI need to compute <Sz>(t) = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>.\n\nThis seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, where the state evolves in time, or the Heisenberg picture, where the operators evolve in time.\n\nMaybe the Heisenberg picture is easier for this problem.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, the state is stationary, and the operators evolve in time according to:\n\nA(t) = exp(i * H * t / \u0127) A exp(-i * H * t / \u0127)\n\nSo, Sz(t) = exp(i * H * t / \u0127) Sz exp(-i * H * t / \u0127)\n\nWith H = -gamma * Sy * B.\n\nI need to compute Sz(t), and then find <Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z>.\n\nThis might be more straightforward.\n\nFirst, let's recall the commutation relations for the spin operators:\n\n[Sx, Sy] = i * \u0127 * Sz\n\n[Sy, Sz] = i * \u0127 * Sx\n\n[Sz, Sx] = i * \u0127 * Sy\n\nAlso, the spin operators for a spin 1/2 particle are represented by Pauli matrices divided by 2.\n\nSo, Sz = \u0127/2 * \u03c3z\n\nSy = \u0127/2 * \u03c3y\n\nWhere \u03c3z and \u03c3y are the Pauli matrices:\n\n\u03c3z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]\n\n\u03c3y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]\n\nOkay, so H = -gamma * Sy * B = -gamma * (\u0127/2) * \u03c3y * B = -(gamma * \u0127 * B / 2) * \u03c3y\n\nNow, to find Sz(t), I need to compute:\n\nSz(t) = exp(i * H * t / \u0127) Sz exp(-i * H * t / \u0127)\n\nLet me define h_bar = \u0127 for simplicity.\n\nSo, H = -(gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y\n\nThen, Sz(t) = exp(i * [-(gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y] * t / h_bar) Sz exp(-i * [-(gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y] * t / h_bar)\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\nexp(i * [-(gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y] * t / h_bar) = exp(-i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nSimilarly, exp(-i * [-(gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y] * t / h_bar) = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nSo, Sz(t) = exp(-i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t) Sz exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nNow, to compute this, I can use the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, but for spin operators, there are standard formulas for the evolution under a Hamiltonian proportional to one of the spin operators.\n\nAlternatively, I know that evolving under H = -omega * Sy corresponds to rotations about the y-axis with angular frequency omega.\n\nHere, omega = gamma * B / 2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nH = - (gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y\n\nSo, the Hamiltonian is proportional to \u03c3y with a coefficient of - (gamma * h_bar * B / 2).\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i * H * t / h_bar) = exp(i * (gamma * h_bar * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t / h_bar) = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nSo, the evolution is a rotation about the y-axis with angular frequency gamma * B / 2.\n\nTherefore, Sz(t) = U\u2020(t) Sz U(t)\n\nWait, no: in the Heisenberg picture, A(t) = U\u2020(t) A U(t)\n\nWait, actually, in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, the state evolves as |psi(t)> = U(t) |psi(0)>, and in the Heisenberg picture, operators evolve as A(t) = U\u2020(t) A U(t).\n\nBut I think I had it backwards earlier.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nIn the Heisenberg picture, A(t) = U\u2020(t) A U(t), where U(t) = exp(-i * H * t / h_bar)\n\nSo, in this case, U(t) = exp(-i * H * t / h_bar) = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nTherefore, Sz(t) = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t) Sz exp(-i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nNow, to compute this, I can use the identity:\n\nexp(A) B exp(-A) = B + [A, B] + (1/2!) [A, [A, B]] + (1/3!) [A, [A, [A, B]]] + ...\n\nHere, A = i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t\n\nAnd B = Sz = \u0127/2 * \u03c3z\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz + i * (gamma * B / 2) * t * [\u03c3y, \u03c3z] + (1/2!) (i * (gamma * B / 2) * t)^2 * [\u03c3y, [\u03c3y, \u03c3z]] + ...\n\nRecall that [\u03c3y, \u03c3z] = 2i \u03c3x\n\nAnd [\u03c3y, [\u03c3y, \u03c3z]] = [\u03c3y, 2i \u03c3x] = 2i [\u03c3y, \u03c3x] = 2i * (-2i \u03c3z) = 4 \u03c3z\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz + i * (gamma * B / 2) * t * (2i \u03c3x) + (1/2) (i * (gamma * B / 2) * t)^2 * (4 \u03c3z) + ...\n\nSimplify:\n\nSz(t) = Sz - (gamma * B / 2) * t * 2 \u03c3x + (1/2) (i^2) (gamma * B / 2)^2 t^2 * 4 Sz + ...\n\nSz(t) = Sz - (gamma * B) t \u03c3x - (gamma * B / 2)^2 t^2 * 4 Sz / 2 + ...\n\nWait, i^2 = -1\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz - (gamma * B) t \u03c3x - (1/2) (gamma * B / 2)^2 t^2 * 4 Sz + ...\n\nSz(t) = Sz - (gamma * B) t \u03c3x - (gamma * B / 2)^2 * 2 t^2 Sz + ...\n\nThis seems messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since H is proportional to Sy, and Sz commutes with Sy only if they are equal, which they're not, their commutator is non-zero.\n\nWait, actually, [Sy, Sz] = i \u0127 Sx\n\nSo, [Sy, Sz] = i \u0127 Sx\n\nThen, [Sy, [Sy, Sz]] = [Sy, i \u0127 Sx] = i \u0127 [Sy, Sx] = i \u0127 * (-i \u0127 Sz) = \u0127^2 Sz\n\nSo, using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula:\n\nexp(A) B exp(-A) = B + [A, B] + (1/2!) [A, [A, B]] + ...\n\nWith A = i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t\n\nAnd B = Sz\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz + i * (gamma * B / 2) * t * [\u03c3y, Sz] + (1/2!) (i * (gamma * B / 2) * t)^2 * [\u03c3y, [\u03c3y, Sz]] + ...\n\nBut [\u03c3y, Sz] = [\u03c3y, \u0127/2 \u03c3z] = \u0127/2 [\u03c3y, \u03c3z] = \u0127/2 * 2i \u03c3x = i \u0127 \u03c3x\n\nAnd [\u03c3y, [\u03c3y, Sz]] = [\u03c3y, i \u0127 \u03c3x] = i \u0127 [\u03c3y, \u03c3x] = i \u0127 * (-i \u0127 \u03c3z) = \u0127^2 \u03c3z\n\nSo, Sz(t) = Sz + i * (gamma * B / 2) * t * (i \u0127 \u03c3x) + (1/2) (i * (gamma * B / 2) * t)^2 * (\u0127^2 \u03c3z) + ...\n\nSz(t) = Sz - (gamma * B / 2) * t * \u0127 \u03c3x - (1/2) (gamma * B / 2)^2 t^2 * \u0127^2 \u03c3z + ...\n\nThis still looks complicated. Maybe I should consider that Sz(t) can be expressed as a combination of Sz and Sx, since the rotation is about Sy.\n\nIn general, a rotation about Sy by an angle theta is given by:\n\nexp(-i * Sy * theta / h_bar)\n\nAnd the transformation of Sz under this rotation is:\n\nSz' = exp(-i * Sy * theta / h_bar) Sz exp(i * Sy * theta / h_bar)\n\nWhich can be computed using the angular momentum algebra.\n\nIn fact, for a rotation about y by angle theta, the transformation of Sz is:\n\nSz' = Sz cos(theta) - Sx sin(theta)\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nActually, under a rotation about y by angle theta, the transformation of the spin operators are:\n\nSx' = Sx cos(theta) + Sz sin(theta)\n\nSy' = Sy\n\nSz' = -Sx sin(theta) + Sz cos(theta)\n\nWait, I think I have a confusion here.\n\nLet me look up the rotation formulas for spin operators.\n\nFor a rotation about the y-axis by an angle theta, the transformation of the spin operators are:\n\nSx' = Sx cos(theta) + Sz sin(theta)\n\nSy' = Sy\n\nSz' = -Sx sin(theta) + Sz cos(theta)\n\nSo, in this case, Sz(t) = -Sx sin(omega t) + Sz cos(omega t), where omega = gamma * B / 2\n\nWait, is that right?\n\nWait, in the Heisenberg picture, the operators evolve in time, so Sz(t) = -Sx sin(omega t) + Sz cos(omega t), with omega = gamma * B / 2\n\nNow, I need to find <Sz(t)> = <+z| Sz(t) |+z>\n\nGiven that |+z> is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +\u0127/2.\n\nSo, <Sz(t)> = <+z| (-Sx sin(omega t) + Sz cos(omega t)) |+z> = -<+z| Sx |+z> sin(omega t) + <+z| Sz |+z> cos(omega t)\n\nNow, <+z| Sz |+z> = \u0127/2\n\nAnd <+z| Sx |+z> = ?\n\nFor a spin 1/2 particle, the matrix elements of Sx in the Sz basis are:\n\nSx = \u0127/2 [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]\n\nSo, <+z| Sx |+z> = \u0127/2 * [1, 0] [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ] [1, 0]^T = \u0127/2 * [1, 0] [1, 0]^T = \u0127/2 * 1 = \u0127/2\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, [1, 0] [0, 1; 1, 0] [1, 0]^T = [1, 0] [0, 1]^T = 1*0 + 0*1 = 0\n\nSo, <+z| Sx |+z> = 0\n\nTherefore, <Sz(t)> = -0 * sin(omega t) + (\u0127/2) cos(omega t) = (\u0127/2) cos(omega t)\n\nBut the magnetic moment is mu = gamma * Sz, so <mu_z>(t) = gamma * <Sz(t)> = gamma * (\u0127/2) cos(omega t)\n\nBut the problem says that the average of the z-component of the particle's moment starts oscillating, and asks for its oscillation frequency.\n\nFrom the above, it seems that <mu_z>(t) oscillates with frequency omega = gamma * B / 2\n\nBut wait, in the Hamiltonian H = -gamma * Sy * B, the coefficient is -gamma * B, and the angular frequency is typically |gamma * B|, but in this case, it's omega = gamma * B / 2\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining omega.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * Sy * B = -gamma * (\u0127/2) * \u03c3y * B\n\nThe time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i * H * t / h_bar) = exp(i * (gamma * \u0127 * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t / h_bar) = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t)\n\nSo, the evolution is a rotation about the y-axis with angular frequency omega = gamma * B / 2\n\nTherefore, the oscillation frequency should be omega / (2 * pi), but in terms of radians per second, it's omega.\n\nBut the options are in terms of gamma * B with different coefficients.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. gamma*B/sqrt(2)\n\nB. gamma*B/2\n\nC. gamma*B\n\nD. sqrt(2)*gamma*B\n\nFrom my calculation, it seems like the frequency is gamma * B / 2, which corresponds to option B.\n\nBut I feel like I might be missing something, because the problem mentions that the average of the z-component starts oscillating, and perhaps there's a different frequency involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the full time evolution more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the state |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t) |+z>\n\nExpress |+z> in the Sy eigenbasis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute |psi(t)> explicitly.\n\nIn the Sz basis, |+z> = [1, 0]^T\n\nAnd \u03c3y = [0, -i; i, 0]\n\nSo, U(t) = exp(i * (gamma * B / 2) * \u03c3y * t) = exp[i * theta * \u03c3y], where theta = (gamma * B / 2) * t\n\nThe expansion of exp[i * theta * \u03c3y] is:\n\ncos(theta) I + i sin(theta) \u03c3y\n\nTherefore, U(t) = cos(theta) I + i sin(theta) \u03c3y\n\nSo, |psi(t)> = U(t) |+z> = [cos(theta) I + i sin(theta) \u03c3y] |+z>\n\n= cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) \u03c3y |+z>\n\nNow, \u03c3y |+z> = [0, -i; i, 0] [1, 0]^T = [0, i]^T = i |\u2212z>\n\nSo, |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) (i |\u2212z>) = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nTherefore, |psi(t)> = cos(theta) |+z> - sin(theta) |\u2212z>\n\nNow, <Sz>(t) = <psi(t)| Sz |psi(t)>\n\nSz in matrix form is [\u0127/2, 0; 0, -\u0127/2]\n\nSo, <Sz>(t) = ["
