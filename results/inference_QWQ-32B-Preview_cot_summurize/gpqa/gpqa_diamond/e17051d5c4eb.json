                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the behavior of different substituents on a benzene ring during an electrophilic substitution reaction, specifically bromination. The key concept here is the directing effect and the activating or deactivating nature of the substituents.\n\nFirst, let's list out the substances with their substituents:\n\n1. C6H5-CH3: Toluene (Methylbenzene)\n\n2. C6H5-COOC2H5: Phenyl ethanoate (Benzene with an ester group)\n\n3. C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene\n\n4. C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene\n\n5. C6H5-C2H5: Ethylbenzene\n\n6. C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid\n\nIn electrophilic substitution reactions, the position where the incoming electrophile attacks depends on the substituents already present on the benzene ring. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct the incoming group to the ortho/para positions or the meta position.\n\nHere's a general guide:\n\n- Activating groups: Donate electrons to the ring, making it more nucleophilic. They direct the incoming group to the ortho and para positions.\n\n- Deactivating groups: Withdraw electrons from the ring, making it less nucleophilic. They can direct the incoming group to either ortho/para or meta positions, depending on the group.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. Methyl (CH3): Activating, ortho/para directing.\n\n2. Ester (COO): Deactivating, meta directing.\n\n3. Chloro (Cl): Mildly deactivating, ortho/para directing.\n\n4. Nitro (NO2): Strongly deactivating, meta directing.\n\n5. Ethyl (C2H5): Similar to methyl, activating, ortho/para directing.\n\n6. Carboxylic acid (COOH): Strongly deactivating, meta directing.\n\nThe question is about the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer. So, we need to consider how likely it is for the bromine to attach at the para position relative to the existing substituent.\n\nFor activating groups (methyl and ethyl), the reaction is more likely to occur at the ortho and para positions. However, steric hindrance might favor para over ortho, especially with larger groups like ethyl.\n\nFor deactivating groups, the situation is more complex. Groups like Cl are mildly deactivating and ortho/para directing, but the deactivation might reduce the ortho and para positions' reactivity, potentially shifting the product distribution.\n\nNitro and carboxylic acid groups are strongly deactivating and meta directing, so the para isomer should be less favored in these cases.\n\nGiven that, let's arrange the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer yield:\n\n1. Substances with strongly deactivating and meta directing groups should have the least para isomer yield: Nitrobenzene (4) and Benzoic acid (6).\n\n2. Substances with deactivating but ortho/para directing groups: Chlorobenzene (3). The deactivation reduces the ortho and para positions' reactivity, so the para isomer yield might be lower than in activating groups.\n\n3. Substances with activating and ortho/para directing groups: Toluene (1) and Ethylbenzene (5). These should have higher para isomer yields due to the activating nature of the substituents.\n\n4. Substances with deactivating and meta directing groups: Phenyl ethanoate (2). Although it's deactivating and meta directing, it might still have some ortho/para reactivity.\n\nWait, but according to the initial classification:\n\n- Nitro and carboxylic acid are strongly deactivating and meta directing, so least para isomer.\n\n- Chloro is mildly deactivating and ortho/para directing, so more para isomer than nitro and carboxylic acid but less than activating groups.\n\n- Methyl and ethyl are activating and ortho/para directing, so more para isomer than chloro.\n\n- Ester is deactivating and meta directing, so similar to nitro and carboxylic acid but perhaps between chloro and nitro/carboxylic acid.\n\nSo, perhaps the order should be:\n\nNitro (4) < Carboxylic acid (6) < Ester (2) < Chloro (3) < Methyl (1) < Ethyl (5)\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. Let's check the provided options:\n\nA. 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3\n\nB. 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4\n\nC. 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\n\nD. 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3\n\nOption C seems closest to our proposed order: 4 (nitro) < 2 (ester) < 6 (carboxylic acid) < 3 (chloro) < 1 (methyl) < 5 (ethyl)\n\nHowever, our initial thought was nitro and carboxylic acid have the least para isomer yield, followed by ester, then chloro, and finally methyl and ethyl.\n\nBut in option C, carboxylic acid is before chloro, which aligns with carboxylic acid being more deactivating than chloro, thus having even less para isomer yield.\n\nSo, perhaps C is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, option D has 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3, which also places nitro and carboxylic acid at the beginning, but then ester before methyl and ethyl.\n\nConsidering that ester is deactivating and meta directing, its para isomer yield should be less than that of chloro, which is mildly deactivating but ortho/para directing.\n\nBut in option D, ester is before chloro, which might not make sense.\n\nTherefore, option C seems more plausible.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy, let's consider the relative directing abilities:\n\n- Nitro and carboxylic acid are strongly deactivating and meta directing, so para isomer yield is low.\n\n- Ester is deactivating and meta directing, but perhaps not as strongly as nitro and carboxylic acid, so para isomer yield is higher than nitro and carboxylic acid but lower than chloro.\n\n- Chloro is mildly deactivating and ortho/para directing, so para isomer yield is higher than ester but lower than activating groups.\n\n- Methyl and ethyl are activating and ortho/para directing, so para isomer yield is higher than chloro.\n\nThus, the order would be: nitro < carboxylic acid < ester < chloro < methyl < ethyl\n\nWhich matches option C: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{C}} \\]"
