                    "text": "Let's dive into this problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, we have Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point very close to 277 K under normal conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the product of the reaction between a certain keto acid and Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering all heavier and lighter isotopes if multiple instances of an element exist.\n\nLet's start by trying to identify Substance X.\n\nGiven that Substance X reacts with a liquid to produce a gas whose molecule has an equal number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate that releases another substance when heated, it seems like a chemical reaction involving metals or other reactive elements.\n\nThe fact that Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry suggests it might be a common reagent like lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), borohydride (BH4), or something similar. However, we need to consider the specific properties mentioned.\n\nLet's consider the gas W, which has molecules with an equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about common gases and their neutron and proton counts.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Hydrogen gas (H2): Each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So, total protons = 2, total neutrons = 0. Not equal.\n\n- Helium gas (He): Atomic number 2, neutrons can vary, but in He-4, it has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That fits the condition.\n\n- Nitrogen gas (N2): Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (in N-14), so total protons = 14, total neutrons = 14. That also fits.\n\n- Oxygen gas (O2): Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (in O-16), so total protons = 16, total neutrons = 16. Also fits.\n\n- Neon gas (Ne): Atomic number 10, in Ne-20, it has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. Fits.\n\nSo, possible gases are He, N2, O2, Ne, etc.\n\nNow, considering that Substance X reacts with a liquid Y to produce one of these gases and a precipitate G, which upon heating releases B with a melting point close to 277 K.\n\nLet's consider the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above freezing point of water. So, B likely melts around 4\u00b0C.\n\nLooking up substances that melt around this temperature, water itself melts at 0\u00b0C, but 4\u00b0C is its maximum density point. However, perhaps B is a substance that melts around this temperature.\n\nNow, considering that Substance X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, and reacts with a keto acid to produce a product containing 2 atoms of oxygen.\n\nKeto acids are compounds containing both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. For example, alpha-ketoglutarate.\n\nIf Substance X reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms, it might be involved in a reduction or addition reaction.\n\nGiven that Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, it might contain an element like deuterium (D, hydrogen-2) or something similar.\n\nLet's consider lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) as a possible Substance X. It's a common reducing agent in organic chemistry. However, it doesn't necessarily incorporate a heavier isotope unless specified.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, perhaps it's a variant of a common reagent where one of the elements is replaced by a heavier isotope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Substance X is a compound containing elements like lithium, aluminum, boron, etc., which are common in organic synthesis reagents.\n\nLet's consider another approach. Let's think about the gas W again. Since its molecules have an equal number of neutrons and protons, and considering common gases produced in chemical reactions, nitrogen gas (N2) and oxygen gas (O2) are likely candidates.\n\nLet's assume W is N2. Then, the reaction between Substance X and liquid Y produces N2 gas and precipitate G.\n\nWhen G is heated, it releases B, which melts around 277 K.\n\nNow, considering that Substance X reacts with a keto acid to produce a product containing 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nKeto acids have the general structure RC(=O)CH2COOH. Reacting with a reducing agent like LiAlH4 would typically reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but that might not directly lead to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Substance X is involved in an oxidation reaction where it removes oxygen atoms.\n\nWait, maybe Substance X is a base that can deprotonate the keto acid, leading to formation of an enolate, but that might not directly lead to a product with only 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to look at this differently.\n\nLet's consider the product of the reaction between the keto acid and Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the product has 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nKeto acids generally have at least two oxygen atoms (one in the ketone group and one in the carboxylic acid group). So, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the number of oxygen atoms, or perhaps it removes some.\n\nBut the problem says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen, so maybe the keto acid had more, and Substance X removed some oxygen atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is an alcohol or something with only one oxygen atom, but that would mean the product has only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the statement.\n\nWait, maybe the product has exactly 2 oxygen atoms, so perhaps the keto acid was reduced or something.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Let's try another angle.\n\nConsidering that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry, perhaps it's a heavy water derivative or something similar.\n\nHeavy water is D2O, where D is deuterium, hydrogen-2.\n\nBut D2O isn't typically used as a reagent in organic synthesis, although deuterium labeling is used in some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Substance X contains a heavier isotope of carbon, like carbon-13.\n\nBut carbon-13 is only about 1% in natural abundance, so incorporating it might not make a significant difference in properties.\n\nWait, perhaps Substance X is sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), NaHCO3, but that doesn't necessarily incorporate a heavier isotope.\n\nThis is not leading me anywhere. Maybe I need to consider the precipitate G and what it could be.\n\nThe precipitate G forms when Substance X reacts with liquid Y, and when heated, it releases B, which melts around 277 K.\n\nPerhaps G is a salt that decomposes upon heating to release B.\n\nConsidering that B melts around 4\u00b0C, which is close to the freezing point of water, perhaps B is water ice? But that seems unlikely because ice melts at 0\u00b0C, not 4\u00b0C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is a substance that has a melting point around 4\u00b0C, such as a specific kind of lipid or something, but that seems too vague.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently. Perhaps B is a gas that condenses at around 277 K, but the problem says \"melting point,\" which suggests a solid-liquid transition.\n\nWait, perhaps B is a substance that sublimes or has a low boiling point, but melting point is specified.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look back at the gas W.\n\nIf W is N2, and the reaction produces N2 gas and precipitate G, then perhaps Substance X contains nitrogen in a higher oxidation state, which is reduced to N2.\n\nFor example, lithium nitride (Li3N) reacts with water to produce ammonia (NH3), but ammonia isn't N2. So, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Substance X is a azide, like sodium azide (NaN3), which decomposes to produce N2 gas.\n\nBut sodium azide reacts with water to produce hydrazoic acid (HN3), which is toxic, and doesn't fit well with the precipitate forming.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to consider that Substance X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4), which is similar to LiAlH4 but with deuterium instead of hydrogen.\n\nLiAlD4 is known to be used in organic synthesis for reduction reactions, similar to LiAlH4.\n\nIf LiAlD4 reacts with a keto acid, it would reduce the keto group to an alcohol, similar to LiAlH4, but with deuterium incorporated into the product.\n\nHowever, the problem mentions that the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen, and the reduction of a keto acid to an alcohol would typically reduce the ketone to an alcohol, removing the ketone group and leaving one oxygen atom in the carboxylic acid group, unless further reduction occurs.\n\nWait, actually, if LiAlD4 reduces a keto acid, it could reduce both the ketone and the carboxylic acid groups, leading to a fully reduced alkane with no oxygen atoms, but that contradicts the statement that the product contains 2 oxygen atoms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only the ketone group is reduced to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact, resulting in a hydroxy acid with two oxygen atoms.\n\nThat seems plausible.\n\nSo, if Substance X is LiAlD4, reacting with a keto acid would produce a hydroxy acid with two oxygen atoms.\n\nNow, considering that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope, in this case deuterium.\n\nLiAlD4 contains deuterium, which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen.\n\nNow, let's consider the reaction of LiAlD4 with liquid Y to produce N2 gas and precipitate G.\n\nWait, but earlier I assumed W is N2, but perhaps it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reaction of LiAlD4 with water (if Y is water) produces hydrogen gas (H2 or D2), but deuterium gas is still hydrogen gas, just heavier.\n\nHowever, D2 gas molecules have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, which fits the condition of equal neutrons and protons.\n\nSo, if Y is water, and LiAlD4 reacts with water to produce D2 gas and precipitate G, which could be aluminum hydroxide or something similar.\n\nThen, when G is heated, it might release B, which could be water, but water melts at 0\u00b0C, not 4\u00b0C.\n\nThis is not matching up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the gas W is not D2, but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the gas W is not related to the reaction of LiAlD4 with water, but to a different reaction.\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Maybe LiAlD4 isn't the right Substance X.\n\nLet's consider another common reagent in organic chemistry: borohydride, such as sodium borohydride (NaBH4).\n\nNaBH4 is used for reducing aldehydes and ketones to alcohols.\n\nIf we consider a deuterated version, NaBD4, which incorporates deuterium.\n\nHowever, NaBD4 is not as common as LiAlD4, but it's possible.\n\nIf NaBD4 reacts with a keto acid, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, similar to LiAlD4.\n\nAgain, this would produce a hydroxy acid with two oxygen atoms, matching the condition.\n\nNow, if NaBD4 reacts with water, it could produce D2 gas and sodium borate or something similar as precipitate G.\n\nThen, heating G might release B, which could be water or something else.\n\nAgain, water melts at 0\u00b0C, not 4\u00b0C.\n\nThis isn't fitting.\n\nPerhaps Substance X is not a borohydride or an aluminum hydride.\n\nLet's think about other common reagents in organic chemistry that incorporate heavier isotopes.\n\nAnother possibility is\u683c\u6c0f\u8bd5\u5242 (Grignard reagents), which are organomagnesium halides, like RMgX, where R is an alkyl or aryl group, and X is a halogen.\n\nHowever, Grignard reagents typically don't incorporate heavier isotopes unless specifically prepared that way.\n\nMoreover, their reaction with keto acids would lead to addition of the Grignard reagent to the keto group, followed by hydrolysis to produce a tertiary alcohol, which would have only one oxygen atom, unless the keto acid has multiple keto groups.\n\nBut typically, keto acids have one keto group and one carboxylic acid group.\n\nSo, reacting with a Grignard reagent would likely lead to a product with only one oxygen atom, which contradicts the condition of having two oxygen atoms.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different type of reagent.\n\nLet's think about oxidizing agents used in organic chemistry, like potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or Jones reagent (chromium-based oxidizing agent).\n\nHowever, oxidizing agents typically remove hydrogen or add oxygen, which might not align with the reaction described.\n\nMoreover, these reagents are more likely to increase the number of oxygen atoms in the product, not decrease it to two.\n\nThis seems\u4e0d\u7b26.\n\nPerhaps Substance X is a reducing agent, given that it reduces keto acids to products with two oxygen atoms.\n\nWait, but reducing a keto acid would typically reduce the ketone group to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid group intact, resulting in a hydroxy acid with two oxygen atoms.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, Substance X is likely a reducing agent, such as LiAlH4 or NaBH4, or their deuterated versions.\n\nGiven that it incorporates a heavier isotope, it's probably LiAlD4 or NaBD4.\n\nNow, considering the reaction with liquid Y to produce gas W (with equal neutrons and protons) and precipitate G, which releases B upon heating.\n\nIf Y is water, and Substance X is LiAlD4, the reaction would produce D2 gas and aluminum hydroxide precipitate.\n\nHeating aluminum hydroxide (G) can produce aluminum oxide (B), which has a much higher melting point (around 2054\u00b0C), not close to 277 K.\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is something else besides water.\n\nMaybe Y is an acid, and the reaction produces a different gas.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies liquid Y.\n\nAssuming Y is water is perhaps too hasty.\n\nMaybe Y is something else, like an alcohol or an acid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Y is liquid ammonia.\n\nHowever, that seems less likely.\n\nLet's consider that Substance X is used in organic synthesis, and it reacts with a keto acid to produce a product with two oxygen atoms.\n\nGiven that, and considering the reaction with liquid Y to produce gas W and precipitate G, perhaps Substance X is a metal hydride, like lithium aluminum hydride or sodium borohydride, as previously considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a metal amide, like sodium amide (NaNH2), which is used in organic synthesis to deprotonate substrates.\n\nHowever, sodium amide reacts with water to produce ammonia gas (NH3), which has 3 protons and 0 neutrons (assuming protium), which doesn't fit the condition of equal neutrons and protons in gas W.\n\nUnless deuterated ammonia is considered, but that might be reaching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to consider that Substance X is calcium hydride (CaH2), which is used in some organic synthesis reactions.\n\nCaH2 reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas (H2) and calcium hydroxide precipitate.\n\nH2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (in protium), which doesn't fit the condition of equal neutrons and protons.\n\nUnless it's deuterium gas (D2), which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the condition.\n\nSo, if Substance X is calcium deuteride (CaD2), reacting with water would produce D2 gas and calcium hydroxide precipitate.\n\nHeating calcium hydroxide can decompose to calcium oxide and water vapor.\n\nCalcium oxide has a melting point of around 2613\u00b0C, not close to 277 K.\n\nAgain, doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps Substance X isn't calcium deuteride.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Substance X is lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4), as previously considered.\n\nLet's consider its reaction with water:\n\nLiAlD4 + 4 H2O \u2192 LiOH + Al(OH)3 + 4 D2\n\nHere, gas W is D2, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons, fitting the condition.\n\nPrecipitate G is aluminum hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes to aluminum oxide and water vapor.\n\nAluminum oxide has a melting point of around 2054\u00b0C, not close to 277 K.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps my assumption about G is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps G is lithium aluminum hydroxide, but that seems unlikely.\n\nThis isn't working out.\n\nMaybe I need to consider a different approach.\n\nLet's look back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Substance X, known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, reacts violently with liquid Y with the release of a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons, and a precipitate G forms, which, when heated, releases B.
