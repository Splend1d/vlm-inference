                    "text": "To solve this problem, we need to relate the properties of the exoplanets, such as their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods, given some ratios between them. We are also told that all three planets have the same albedo, similar to Earth's, which is 0.3.\n\nFirst, let's recall some fundamental relationships in astronomy that might help us connect these properties.\n\n1. **Equilibrium Temperature**: The equilibrium temperature of a planet can be related to its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The equilibrium temperature \\( T \\) is given by:\n\n   \\[\n   T = \\left( \\frac{L(1 - A)}{16 \\pi \\sigma D^2} \\right)^{1/4}\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n   - \\( L \\) is the luminosity of the star,\n   - \\( A \\) is the albedo of the planet,\n   - \\( D \\) is the distance from the planet to the star,\n   - \\( \\sigma \\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\n   Since all planets are around the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their distances from the star.\n\n2. **Kepler's Third Law**: For circular orbits, the square of the orbital period \\( P \\) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis \\( a \\):\n\n   \\[\n   P^2 \\propto a^3\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods can be expressed in terms of the ratio of their semi-major axes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{a_3}{a_1} \\right)^{3/2}\n   \\]\n\nOur goal is to find \\( \\frac{P_3}{P_1} \\).\n\nGiven:\n- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4.\n- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is approximately 2.3.\n- The ratio of masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15.\n- The ratio of masses between Planet2 and Planet3 is approximately 1.35.\n- Albedo for all three planets is 0.3.\n\nFirst, let's use the equilibrium temperature ratios to find the ratios of their distances from the star.\n\nFrom the equilibrium temperature formula, since \\( L \\) and \\( A \\) are the same for all planets, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2}\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( \\frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \\), we can solve for \\( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\):\n\n\\[\n1.4 = \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^{1/2} \\implies \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right) = 1.4^2 = 1.96\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for Planet2 and Planet3:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 = \\left( \\frac{D_3}{D_2} \\right)^{1/2} \\implies \\left( \\frac{D_3}{D_2} \\right) = 2.3^2 = 5.29\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find \\( \\frac{D_3}{D_1} \\) by multiplying the two ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D_3}{D_1} = \\frac{D_3}{D_2} \\times \\frac{D_2}{D_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 \\approx 10.3564\n\\]\n\nNow, using Kepler's Third Law, the ratio of the orbital periods is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \\left( \\frac{D_3}{D_1} \\right)^{3/2} = (10.3564)^{3/2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\( (10.3564)^{3/2} \\):\n\nFirst, find the square root of 10.3564:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{10.3564} \\approx 3.218\n\\]\n\nThen cube it:\n\n\\[\n3.218^3 \\approx 32.99 \\approx 33.0\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33 times larger than that of Planet1.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, the closest option is C. ~33.4.\n\nBut let's double-check our calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, confirm the multiplication of the distance ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D_3}{D_1} = 5.29 \\times 1.96 = 10.3564\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, calculate \\( (10.3564)^{3/2} \\):\n\n\\[\n(10.3564)^{1.5} = (10.3564)^{1} \\times (10.3564)^{0.5} = 10.3564 \\times 3.218 \\approx 33.27\n\\]\n\nSo, approximately 33.3, which rounds to 33.4.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. ~33.4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{C} \\]"
