Normative, Descriptive\n\nThe question is asking us to compare two types of morality, one being a code of conduct that all rational beings should adhere to, and the other being a code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society.\n\nOption A is incorrect because descriptive and normative morality are not the correct terms to describe the two types of morality being discussed. Descriptive morality would be a description of the actual moral behavior of a group or society, while normative morality would be a description of the ideal moral behavior that all rational beings should adhere to.\n\nOption B is incorrect because instrumental and normative morality are not the correct terms to describe the two types of morality being discussed. Instrumental morality would be a description of the actual moral behavior of a group or society, while normative morality would be a description of the ideal moral behavior that all rational beings should adhere to.\n\nOption D is incorrect because ethical and descriptive morality are not the correct terms to describe the two types of morality being discussed. Ethical morality would be a description of the actual moral behavior of a group or society, while descriptive morality would be a description of the ideal moral behavior that all rational beings should adhere to.\n\nOption C is correct because normative morality is a code of conduct that all rational beings should adhere to, while descriptive morality is a code of conduct adopted by a particular group or society. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",
