During transcription, the DNA molecule is unwound, and the genetic information is copied into a complementary RNA molecule. The RNA molecule, called mRNA, is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it can be translated into proteins by the ribosomes.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Transcription does not occur on the ribosomes.\nB. Transcription occurs in the nucleus, not the cytosol.\nD. Transcription is not limited to cell division. It occurs throughout the life of a cell.",
