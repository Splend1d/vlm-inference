The order of a set is the number of elements in the set. If H is a subgroup of G, then aH is also a subset of G. Therefore, the number of elements in aH is equal to the number of elements in Ha.\n\nStatement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint.\n\nThis statement is also true. If aH and Hb are identical, then aH = Hb, which means that a and b are in the same coset of H in G. If aH and Hb are disjoint, then aH and Hb have no elements in common. In either case, aH and Hb have the same number of elements.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A. True, True.",
