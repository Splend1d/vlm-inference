The distance the crate is lifted is 2 m, and the angle between the force and the direction of the displacement is 0\u00b0 (since the force is applied vertically upward).\n\ncos(0\u00b0) = 1, so the formula becomes:\n\nWork = Force \u00d7 Distance \u00d7 1\n\nSince the force is the weight of the crate, which is equal to the mass of the crate times the acceleration due to gravity:\n\nWork = (100 kg) \u00d7 (9.81 m/s\u00b2) \u00d7 (2 m)\n\nWork = 1962 J\n\nTherefore, the work done on the 100-kg crate that is hoisted 2 m in a time of 4 s is 1962 J.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 200 J.",
