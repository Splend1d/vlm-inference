Sequential circuits, such as flip-flops and counters, can have feedback. Feedback is a common feature in sequential circuits.\n\nII. Combinational circuits have a \"memoryless\" property; sequential circuits do not.\n- This statement is also false. Combinational circuits, as mentioned in statement I, can have feedback, which means they have some form of memory. Sequential circuits, on the other hand, have memory because their output depends on the current state and the previous inputs.\n\nIII. Both sequential and combinational circuits must be controlled by an external clock.\n- This statement is true. Both sequential and combinational circuits require a clock signal to function properly. The clock signal provides a timing reference for the circuit to perform its operations.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III only.",
