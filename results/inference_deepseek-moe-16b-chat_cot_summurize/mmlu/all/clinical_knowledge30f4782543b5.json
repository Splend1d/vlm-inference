            "content": " The compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative) are blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).\n\nThe reason is that blood group B (rhesus negative) has the Rh antigen, which is a protein on the surface of red blood cells. People with blood group B (rhesus negative) are Rh-negative, while people with blood group O (rhesus negative) are Rh-negative as well. Therefore, blood type O (rhesus negative) can be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative) without causing an immune reaction.\n\nBlood type AB (rhesus negative) can also be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative), but it is not necessary unless the person needs additional red blood cells or plasma.\n\nBlood type B (rhesus positive) should not be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative) because it contains the Rh antigen, which can cause an immune reaction. Similarly, blood type O (rhesus positive) should not be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative) because it contains the Rh antigen, which can cause an immune reaction.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).",
