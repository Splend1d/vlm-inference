            "content": " The correct answer is A. detecting the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet by looking for the Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum.\n\nThis method, also known as the transit method, involves observing the periodic dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it. The Doppler effect, which causes the star's light to shift towards the red or blue depending on the relative motion between the star and the observer, can also be observed in this case. By measuring the frequency shift of the star's light, astronomers can determine the orbital period of the planet and, hence, its mass.\n\nMethod B, detecting the shift of the star's position against the sky due to the planet's gravitational pull, is not as effective for discovering massive planets. This is because the effect is too small to be observed with current technology, and the required precision is not achievable.\n\nMethod C, detecting a planet ejected from a binary star system, is not a common method for discovering massive planets. Ejected planets are usually ejected from their host star due to gravitational interactions with other stars or planets in the system, and their existence is not directly related to the mass of the planet.\n\nMethod D, detecting the starlight reflected off the planet, is not a common method for discovering massive planets. This method, known as the transit method, involves observing the periodic dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it. The reflected light method is less effective and less precise than the transit method.",
