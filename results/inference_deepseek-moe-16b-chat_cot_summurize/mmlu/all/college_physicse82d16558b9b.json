As the temperature of the universe increases, the energy of the objects also increases. This is because as the temperature increases, the energy of the particles in the universe increases, and they move faster.\n\nWhen the temperature was 12 K, the energy of the objects in the universe was lower than it is today. This means that the objects were closer together than they are today. As the temperature of the universe increases, the energy of the objects also increases, and they move faster. This means that the objects are now farther apart than they were at 12 K.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. one-quarter as distant as they are today",
