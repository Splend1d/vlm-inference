            "content": " The knee joint is a hinge joint, which means it allows for movement in one plane, primarily flexion and extension. It is not a ball and socket joint, so option A is incorrect.\n\nOption B is also incorrect, as a baker's cyst, also known as a popliteal cyst, is a fluid-filled swelling that occurs behind the knee. It is not found anterior to the knee.\n\nOption D is incorrect, as 'knock knee' deformity is due to an excessive valgus position of the tibia, not bilateral genu varum.\n\nOption C is correct. The patellar tap, also known as aspiration, is a diagnostic procedure used to remove fluid from a joint, such as the knee joint, to help diagnose conditions like arthritis or infection. A positive aspiration, or the presence of fluid in the joint, is indicated by a decrease in resistance to the needle, a change in the appearance of the fluid, or the presence of cells or crystals in the fluid.",
