            "content": " The statement that is not true is B. A neutral atom always has equal numbers of electrons and protons. In a neutral atom, the number of electrons and protons is equal, but the atom is not neutral. The number of electrons and protons is equal because the atom has no overall electric charge. However, the atom does have a net electric charge due to the presence of other charged particles in the atom, such as the protons and electrons in the nucleus.\n\nThe other statements are true:\n\nA. The nucleus contains most of the atom\u2019s mass but almost none of its volume. This is because the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which are much more massive than electrons. The electrons, which are much lighter, occupy a much smaller volume than the nucleus.\n\nC. A neutral atom always has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. This is true because the number of neutrons and protons in an atom is equal to the number of electrons. The number of neutrons and protons is equal to the number of electrons because the nucleus contains protons and neutrons, which are neutral, and electrons, which are negatively charged.\n\nD. The electrons can only orbit at particular energy levels. This is true because the electrons in an atom can only exist in certain energy levels, or shells, around the nucleus. These energy levels are quantized, which means that the electrons can only exist at certain discrete energy levels, rather than continuously.",
