Coating synthetic beads with a different glycoprotein, ZP2, fails to lead to sperm aggregation on the beads.\n\nThe other options are all expected outcomes based on the information given:\n\nA. Injecting eggs with antibodies that bind to ZP3 blocks in vitro fertilization. This is expected because antibodies bind to ZP3, which is required for the sperm to bind to the egg.\n\nB.
