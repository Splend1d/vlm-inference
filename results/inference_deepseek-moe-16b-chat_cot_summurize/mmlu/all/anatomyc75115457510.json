            "content": " The correct statement is C. The ossification centre appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage.\n\nThe mandible, or lower jawbone, undergoes significant growth and development throughout childhood and adolescence. The growth of the mandible is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n\nA. The mental symphysis closes at about 1 year postnatally: This statement is incorrect. The mental symphysis, which is the joint between the two halves of the mandible, does not close postnatally. It remains open throughout life, allowing the mandible to move during activities such as eating and speaking.\n\nB. The condylar growth cartilage ceases activity at puberty: This statement is also incorrect. The condylar growth cartilage, which is located on the ramus of the mandible, continues to grow and develop until late adolescence or early adulthood.\n\nC. The ossification centre appears about 8 weeks I.U.L medial to Meckel's cartilage: This statement is correct. The ossification centre, also known as the epiphyseal plate, is the area of cartilage where new bone growth occurs. In the mandible, the ossification centre appears medial to Meckel's cartilage, which is a small, crescent-shaped structure located on the ventral (front) aspect of the ramus. The ossification centre continues to grow and develop until the late teens or early twenties, at which point the mandible has reached its full adult size.\n\nD. The functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible is the lateral pterygoid muscle: This statement is incorrect. The functional matrix that acts on the angle of the mandible is the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and the muscles that surround it, including the lateral pterygoid muscle. The lateral pterygoid muscle is responsible for moving the jaw laterally and is one of the muscles that helps to open the mouth. However, it does not act on the angle of the mandible in the same way that the TMJ and other surrounding muscles do.",
