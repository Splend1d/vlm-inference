IgE is a type of antibody that plays a key role in the immune response to allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, and certain foods. When an allergen binds to the surface of an IgE molecule, it triggers the release of histamine and other chemicals that can cause symptoms such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing.",
