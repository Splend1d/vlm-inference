It is a crucial structure in the development of the skull base and plays a significant role in the formation of the craniovertebral junction.\n\nA. is incorrect: The spheno-occipital synchondrosis is not a secondary growth cartilage. It is a primary cartilaginous union that forms during embryonic development and continues to develop throughout childhood.\n\nB. is correct: The spheno-occipital synchondrosis influences the position of the viscerocranium. This joint is responsible for the stability of the skull base and plays a critical role in maintaining the proper alignment of the skull and the spine.\n\nC. is incorrect: The spheno-occipital synchondrosis ceases activity at 7 years of age. The growth of this joint is complete by the end of childhood, and it continues to ossify and mature into adulthood.\n\nD. is incorrect: The spheno-occipital synchondrosis cannot be reactivated in patients affected by acromegaly. Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder caused by the overproduction of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. It can lead to enlargement of the facial features, hands, and feet. However, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis is not involved in this condition, and its activity cannot be reactivated.",
