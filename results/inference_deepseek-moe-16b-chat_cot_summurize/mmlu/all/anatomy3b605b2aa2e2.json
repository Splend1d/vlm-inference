When the primary motor cortex is activated, it sends signals to the muscles to contract, resulting in movement. The specific pattern of muscle activation depends on the type of movement being performed. In general, the primary motor cortex activates the muscles on the same side of the body as the hemisphere of the brain where the primary motor cortex is located. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.",
