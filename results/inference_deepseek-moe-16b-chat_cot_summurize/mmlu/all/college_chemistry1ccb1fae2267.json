            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the frequency of the hyperfine splitting (f) and the magnetic field strength (B) and the distance between the lines (d). The relationship is given by:\n\nf = (1.31 x 10^7) / (B x d)\n\nwhere f is the frequency in MHz, B is the magnetic field strength in Tesla, and d is the distance between the lines in cm.\n\nWe are given that the magnetic field strength is 2.12 Tesla and the distance between the lines is 500 MHz. We need to convert these values to Tesla and cm, respectively.\n\n2.12 Tesla = 2.12 x 10^(-3) T\n500 MHz = 500 x 10^(-6) Hz\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the equation:\n\nf = (1.31 x 10^7) / (2.12 x 10^(-3) x 500 x 10^(-6))\n\nf = (1.31 x 10^7) / (1.06 x 10^(-1))\n\nf = 1.23 x 10^7 / 1.06\n\nf = 1.16 x 10^6\n\nNow, we need to convert this frequency to field units of mT. We can do this by multiplying the frequency by the distance between the lines:\n\nmT = f x d\n\nmT = (1.16 x 10^6) x 500 x 10^(-6)\n\nmT = 5.8 x 10^4\n\nSo, the hyperfine splitting in field units of mT is 5.8 x 10^4 mT.\n\nTo convert this to wavenumbers, we can use the relationship:\n\n1 mT = 1000 cm^-1\n\n5.8 x 10^4 mT = 5.8 x 10^4 x 1000 cm^-1\n\n5.8 x 10^7 cm^-1 = 5.8 x 10^4 cm^-1\n\nTherefore, the hyperfine splitting in wavenumbers is 5.8 x 10^4 cm^-1.\n\nSo, the answer is B. 500 MHz = 16.850 mT = 0.01667 cm^-1.",
