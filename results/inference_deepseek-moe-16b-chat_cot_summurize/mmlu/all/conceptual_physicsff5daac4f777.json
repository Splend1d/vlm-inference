            "content": " To solve this problem, we can use the principle of work, which states that work equals force multiplied by distance. In this case, the force is 25 N, and the distance is the length of the rope that is pulled down.\n\nFirst, let's find the force acting on the crate. Since the crate is being lifted with a force of 100 N, and the force pulling the rope is 25 N, the force acting on the crate is 100 - 25 = 75 N.\n\nNow, let's find the work done in lifting the crate. The work done is equal to the force multiplied by the distance. In this case, the distance is the length of the rope that is pulled down, which is 1 m. So, the work done is 75 N * 1 m = 75 J.\n\nTo convert the work done to centimeters, we can use the conversion factor 1 J = 1 cm. So, the work done is 75 J * 100 cm/J = 7500 cm.\n\nTherefore, for every 1-m length of rope pulled down, the crate rises 7500 cm. Since 1 m is equal to 100 cm, the crate rises 7500 cm / 100 cm/m = 75 cm.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 50 cm.",
