This is because the energy of the incident radiation is high enough to cause a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* transition in the protein molecule, which is a characteristic of the ultraviolet region. The other options, X-ray, visible, and infrared, are not correct because they do not correspond to the energy required for this type of transition.",
