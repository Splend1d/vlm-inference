According to Darwin's theory of natural selection, the organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring. However, this does not necessarily mean that there will be overproduction of offspring. In fact, the opposite can often be true, as organisms may have to compete for limited resources, such as food and mates. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",
