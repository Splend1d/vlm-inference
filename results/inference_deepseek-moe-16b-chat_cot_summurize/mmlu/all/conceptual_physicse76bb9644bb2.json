This equation is a fundamental principle of modern physics and has been confirmed through numerous experiments.\n\nThe equation shows that energy and mass are related in a way that is not simply a matter of moving mass. Instead, it suggests that mass itself can be converted into energy, as demonstrated by the famous equation E = mc^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Energy is fundamentally different than mass.",
