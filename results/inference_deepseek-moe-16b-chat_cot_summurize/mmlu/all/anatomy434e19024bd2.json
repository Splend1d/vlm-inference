These receptors are called Golgi tendon organs and are responsible for providing information about the tension and length of the muscles that attach to the TMJ. The medial pterygoid muscle is a key player in the stability of the TMJ, and its contraction can help to maintain the position of the TMJ. The lateral pterygoid muscle, on the other hand, is responsible for moving the TMJ, and its contraction can change the position of the TMJ. The articular disc of the TMJ and the lateral pterygoid muscle are also involved in the proprioception of the TMJ, but they are not the major sources of information.",
