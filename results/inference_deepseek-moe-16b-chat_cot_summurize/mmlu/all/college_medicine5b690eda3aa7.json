            "content": " The pKb of a weak base is typically lower than its pOH. This is because the weak base is only partially ionized in water, and the un-ionized fraction contributes to the basicity of the solution. As a result, the pH of the solution will be closer to the pOH than the pKb.\n\nAt 25\u00baC, the relationship between pKb, pOH, and pH for a weak base can be approximated by the following equation:\n\npKb = 14 - (14/x)\n\nwhere x is the charge on the ionizable group in the weak base. For example, for a typical weak base like ammonia (NH3), x = 1, so the equation becomes:\n\npKb = 14 - (14/1) = 14 - 14 = 0\n\nThis means that the pKb of a weak base like ammonia is 0 at 25\u00baC. Therefore, the pKb of a very weak base would likely be lower than the pOH, which is closer to 7 at 25\u00baC.",
