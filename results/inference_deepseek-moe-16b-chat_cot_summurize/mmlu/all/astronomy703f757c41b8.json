            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure of a gas is proportional to its temperature and the volume of the container it occupies. The equation is:\n\nP = nRT/V\n\nwhere P is the pressure, n is the number of moles of gas, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and V is the volume.\n\nWe are given the atmospheric pressure on Mars (P) as 600 pascals, the acceleration due to gravity (g) as 4 m/s^2, and the surface area of Mars (A) as 145000000 square km. We need to find the mass of the Martian atmosphere (m).\n\nFirst, we need to convert the surface area of Mars from square km to square meters. Since 1 square km is equal to 1000000 square meters, we have:\n\nA = 145000000 * 1000000 = 1450000000000000 square meters\n\nNext, we need to convert the acceleration due to gravity from m/s^2 to km/s^2. Since 1 km/s^2 is equal to 9.80665 m/s^2, we have:\n\ng = 4 * 9.80665 = 39.2266 m/s^2\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of gas (n) in the Martian atmosphere. We know that the mass of one mole of a gas is equal to its molecular weight (M). The molecular weight of dry air is approximately 28.966 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of gas (n) is:\n\nn = m / M\n\nwhere m is the mass of the Martian atmosphere.\n\nWe can now use the ideal gas law to find the volume (V) of the Martian atmosphere. We know that the pressure (P) is 600 pascals, the temperature (T) is 288.15 K (the average temperature of Mars), and the number of moles (n) is 1.45 x 10^21 moles (from the previous step). The gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/mol K. We can now solve for the volume (V):\n\nP = nRT/V\n600 = 1.45 x 10^21 * 8.314 * 288.15 / V\n\nSolving for V, we get:\n\nV = (600 * 8.314 * 288.15) / 1.45 x 10^21\nV = 1.013 x 10^10 cubic meters\n\nNow, we can use the ideal gas law again to find the mass (m) of the Martian atmosphere. We know that the volume (V) is 1.013 x 10^10 cubic meters, the pressure (P) is 600 pascals, and the temperature (T) is 288.15 K. The gas constant (R) is 8.314 J/mol K. We can now solve for the mass (m):\n\nP = nRT/V\n600 = 1.45 x 10^21 * 8.314 * 288.15 / 1.013 x 10^10\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = (600 * 8.314 * 288.15) / 1.45 x 10^21\nm = 1.22 x 10^14 kg\n\nTherefore, the approximate mass of the Martian atmosphere is 2.2 x 10^14 kg, which corresponds to option B.",
