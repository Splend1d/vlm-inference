            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible area of the yard, given that a total of x feet of fencing is to form three sides of the yard.\n\nLet's denote the length of the yard as L and the width as W. Since the yard has three sides, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:\n\nL + L + W + W = x\n2L + 2W = x\n\nWe want to maximize the area of the yard, which is given by:\n\nArea = L * W\n\nWe can express the perimeter in terms of L:\n\nL = (x - 2W) / 2\n\nNow substitute this expression for L into the area formula:\n\nArea = (x - 2W) / 2 * W\n\nTo find the maximum possible area, we can take the derivative of the area with respect to W and set it equal to zero:\n\nd(Area)/dW = (x - 2W) / 2 - W = 0\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2 * (x - 2W) / 2 - 2W = 0\n\nSimplifying:\n\nx - 2W = 2W\nx = 4W\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for x back into the perimeter equation:\n\n2L + 2W = 4W\n2L = 2W\nL = W\n\nSo the length of the yard is equal to the width. This means the yard is a square.\n\nNow we can find the maximum possible area of the square:\n\nArea = L * W\nArea = W * W\nArea = W^2\n\nSince the yard is a square, the maximum possible area is equal to the square of the length:\n\nArea = W^2 = (x / 4)^2\n\nSo the maximum possible area of the yard is x^2 / 16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
