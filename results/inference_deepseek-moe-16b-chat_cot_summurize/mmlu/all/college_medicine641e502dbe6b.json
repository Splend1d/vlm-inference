This description matches the characteristics of a hormone known as a \"cytokine\". Cytokines are a type of small signaling protein that are produced by cells of the immune system. They are involved in communication between cells and play a role in the immune response. Therefore, the scientist's discovery is likely to be categorized as a cytokine.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. Amino acid.",
