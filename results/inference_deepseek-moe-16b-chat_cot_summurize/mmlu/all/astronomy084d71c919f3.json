It represents the total amount of energy emitted by the object across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including visible, infrared, ultraviolet, and other types of radiation. The bolometric luminosity is a key parameter in understanding the energy output and overall behavior of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects.",
