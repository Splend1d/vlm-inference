While it is true that Neptune and Pluto have a 3:2 orbital resonance, this does not prevent them from colliding in the future. In fact, Neptune and Pluto are currently in a 3:2 orbital resonance, but they are still expected to collide in approximately 4.5 billion years when the solar system reaches the end of its current stage of evolution. This is because the gravitational interactions between the planets and other objects in the solar system can cause significant changes to their orbits over time, and Neptune and Pluto are no exception.",
