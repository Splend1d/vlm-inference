When blood glucose levels are high, the pancreas releases insulin, which signals muscle cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream. Insulin also promotes the uptake of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Adrenaline, cortisol, and glycogen do not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.",
