This means that the distance between two points in space is not just a matter of how far apart they are, but also depends on the time it takes for an object to travel between them. This discovery had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and has led to the development of the theory of relativity.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\nA. Space and time are not separate entities, but rather they are interconnected.\nB. Space and time are not parts of one whole, but rather they are interconnected.\nC. The inverse-square law does not apply to space and time, but rather to the strength of gravitational forces between objects.\nD. Space and time are not special to space travelers, but rather they are fundamental concepts that apply to everyone and everything in the universe.",
