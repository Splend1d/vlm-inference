            "content": " The correct answer is C. The normal force on the ball may be greater or less than mg.\n\nWhen a ball rolls on the inside surface of a cone, it experiences a centripetal force that keeps it moving in a circular path. This force is provided by the normal force acting on the ball at the point of contact with the cone. The normal force is equal to the weight of the ball, mg, when the ball is at the lowest point of its circular path.\n\nHowever, the centripetal force required to maintain the circular path also depends on the velocity of the ball. As the ball rolls up the cone, its velocity increases, and so does its centripetal force. This means that the normal force also needs to increase to maintain the circular path.\n\nTherefore, the normal force on the ball may be greater or less than mg, depending on the position of the ball on the cone and its velocity.",
