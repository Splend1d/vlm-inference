All of the above\n\nEncryption and decryption provide secrecy, which is a form of confidentiality, but they also provide authentication, integrity, and privacy.\n\nEncryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, which can only be deciphered by someone with the correct decryption key. This ensures that the information being transmitted is confidential and cannot be read by anyone who intercepts the communication.\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. Encryption can be used to authenticate the sender of a message, ensuring that the recipient receives the message from the intended sender.\n\nIntegrity refers to the accuracy and completeness of data. Encryption can be used to ensure that data has not been tampered with during transmission. This is known as data integrity.\n\nPrivacy refers to the protection of personal information. Encryption can be used to protect personal information, such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other sensitive data, from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.\n\nIn summary, encryption and decryption provide secrecy, authentication, integrity, and privacy, making them a powerful tool for protecting sensitive information.",
