It is a vital part of the energy metabolism in muscle cells, as it helps to maintain the balance between ATP and ADP. The reaction is:\n\nCreatine kinase (CK) + ATP \u2192 Creatine kinase (CK) + ADP\n\nThis reaction is reversible, meaning that the enzyme can catalyze the reverse reaction as well:\n\nCreatine kinase (CK) + ADP \u2192 Creatine kinase (CK) + ATP\n\nThe creatine kinase reaction is not irreversible, as it is a reversible enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The other options are incorrect:\n\nB. The creatine kinase reaction is not slow compared with glycolysis. In fact, the creatine kinase reaction is very fast, as it occurs in the millisecond range.\n\nC. The creatine kinase reaction is not activated until all the ATP has been used up. The enzyme is present in the muscle cells at all times, even when ATP is available.\n\nD. The creatine kinase reaction is not inhibited by low pH in the muscle. In fact, the creatine kinase reaction is activated by low pH, as it is a pH-sensitive enzyme.",
