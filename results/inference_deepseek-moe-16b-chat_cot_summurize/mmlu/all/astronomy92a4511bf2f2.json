            "content": " The correct answer is D. From radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites.\n\nThe Earth is estimated to be around 4.5 billion years old, and this is determined through radioactive dating of rocks and meteorites. Radioactive dating is a method of determining the age of an object by measuring the amount of a particular radioactive material it contains. In the case of the Earth, scientists use the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium and potassium to determine the age of rocks and meteorites.\n\nOption A, the layering of materials within the Earth, is not a reliable method for determining the age of the Earth. This method is more useful for understanding the structure and composition of the Earth\u2019s interior, rather than its age.\n\nOption B, fossils of ancient life, is also not a reliable method for determining the age of the Earth. While fossils can provide information about the history of life on Earth, they do not provide information about the age of the planet itself.\n\nOption C, the cratering history of Earth\u2019s surface, is not a reliable method for determining the age of the Earth. While craters on the Earth\u2019s surface can provide information about the planet\u2019s geological history, they do not provide information about the age of the planet itself.",
