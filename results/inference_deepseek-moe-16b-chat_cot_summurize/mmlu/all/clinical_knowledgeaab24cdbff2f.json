It has two main functions: to produce hormones that help regulate blood sugar levels and to produce enzymes that aid in digestion. The pancreas is made up of several different types of cells, including the islets of Langerhans, which are clusters of cells that produce hormones. The islets of Langerhans include the alpha cells, which produce glucagon, and the beta cells, which produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing cells to take in glucose from the bloodstream. When blood sugar levels are high, the pancreas releases insulin, which helps to lower blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells.",
