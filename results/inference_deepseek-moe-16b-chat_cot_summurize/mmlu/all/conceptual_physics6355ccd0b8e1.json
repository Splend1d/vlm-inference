This means that time will pass more slowly for you than it does for someone on the ground. This is because time is affected by the speed of an object, and when you are moving quickly, time seems to slow down.\n\nSo, when you look at a clock on the spaceship, it will appear to be running slow compared to a clock on the ground. This is because the spaceship is moving through time at a different rate than the Earth.\n\nOn the other hand, when you look at a clock on the ground, it will appear to be running slow compared to a clock on the spaceship. This is because the spaceship is moving through time at a different rate than the Earth.\n\nSo, both of these situations will cause clocks on a fast-moving spaceship to appear to run slow when viewed from Earth.",
