A semiconductor is considered n-type if it has more free electrons than holes. Silicon is a common semiconductor material, but it is considered p-type because it has more holes than free electrons.\n\nDiamond is an insulator, not a semiconductor, so it is not an n-type semiconductor. Silicon carbide is also an insulator, so it is not an n-type semiconductor. Arsenic-doped silicon, on the other hand, is an n-type semiconductor because it has more free electrons than holes.",
