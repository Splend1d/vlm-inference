Dijkstra's algorithm has a time complexity of O(|E| * log |V|), where |E| is the number of edges and |V| is the number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, P_1 can be solved in polynomial time.\n\nTo solve P_2, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm that finds the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a graph. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Therefore, P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. P_1 can be solved in polynomial time but P_2 is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.",
