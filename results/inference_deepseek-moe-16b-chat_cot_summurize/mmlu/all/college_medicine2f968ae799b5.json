Uracil.\n\nRNA (ribonucleic acid) is similar to DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in structure and function, but there are some differences in the nucleotide bases. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil. Uracil is a pyrimidine base, similar to thymine, and it pairs with adenine in RNA.\n\nA, C, and D are all correct answers. A is for Adenine, which is found in both DNA and RNA. C is for Uracil, which is found in RNA and replaces thymine in RNA. D is for Guanine, which is found in both DNA and RNA.",
