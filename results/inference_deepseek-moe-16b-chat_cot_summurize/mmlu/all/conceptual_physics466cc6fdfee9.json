The parallelogram law states that the diagonal of a parallelogram with sides a and b is equal to the sum of the diagonals of the two triangles formed by the sides and the diagonal. In this case, the two vectors are the sides of the parallelogram, and the diagonal is the resultant.\n\nThe magnitude of the resultant vector can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nResultant = sqrt((3 N)^2 + (4 N)^2)\nResultant = sqrt(9 N^2 + 16 N^2)\nResultant = sqrt(25 N^2)\nResultant = 5 N\n\nSo, the magnitude of the resultant vector is 5 N. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 5 N",
