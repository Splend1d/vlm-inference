DNA, mRNA and RNA polymerase.\nD. chromatin, DNA and amino acids.\n\nThe process of translation requires the presence of mRNA, ribosomes, and an enzyme called RNA polymerase. mRNA provides the genetic code for the synthesis of a protein, ribosomes are the cellular structures that translate the mRNA into a protein, and RNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of a polypeptide chain from amino acids.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.",
