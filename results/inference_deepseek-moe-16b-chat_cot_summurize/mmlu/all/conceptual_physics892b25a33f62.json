            "content": " The model of light most supported by the photoelectric effect is the particle model.\n\nThe photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a material when it is exposed to light. This phenomenon was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century and was later explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. Einstein proposed that light is composed of discrete particles, now known as photons, which are emitted by the light source and interact with the electrons in the material.\n\nAccording to this particle model, when a photon of sufficient energy strikes an electron, it can knock the electron out of the material. The energy of the photon is directly related to the frequency of the light, with higher frequency photons (i.e., more energetic photons) being able to knock out more electrons.\n\nThe wave model of light, on the other hand, suggests that light is a continuous wave that propagates through space. This model is unable to explain the photoelectric effect because it does not account for the discrete nature of the emitted electrons.\n\nTherefore, the model of light most supported by the photoelectric effect is the particle model.",
