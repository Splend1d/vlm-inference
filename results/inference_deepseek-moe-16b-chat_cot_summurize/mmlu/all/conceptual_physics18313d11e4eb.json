The more thermal energy a substance has, the higher its temperature. The other options are not directly related to temperature. Vibrational kinetic energy is related to the movement of atoms or molecules within a substance, but it is not directly related to temperature. Average translational kinetic energy is related to the movement of particles in a substance, but it is not directly related to temperature. Rotational kinetic energy is related to the rotation of particles within a substance, but it is not directly related to temperature.",
