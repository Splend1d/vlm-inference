Anaerobic energy production occurs in the absence of oxygen and is responsible for short bursts of intense activity, such as sprinting or weightlifting. Aerobic energy production, on the other hand, occurs in the presence of oxygen and is responsible for sustained, low-to-moderate intensity exercise, such as jogging or cycling. The TCA cycle (Krebs' cycle) and the electron transfer chain are both components of aerobic energy production, but they do not contribute to the production of ATP directly.",
