            "content": " The symplastic pathway for the movement of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem is a continuous pathway. The sucrose is transported from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells to the phloem parenchyma, where it is stored temporarily. From there, it is transported to the companion cells, which are located in the bundle sheath of the mesophyll cells. The companion cells then transport the sucrose to the fibers, which are part of the phloem parenchyma. Finally, the sucrose is transported to the sieve tube cells, which are located in the companion cells.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Companion cells, phloem parenchyma, fibers, sieve tube.",
