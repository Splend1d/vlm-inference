Every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation.\n- An equivalence relation is a relation where every element in A is related to every other element in A by some property. A partial-ordering relation is a relation where every element in A is related to at least one other element in A. Therefore, every equivalence relation is a partial-ordering relation. This statement is true.\n\nB. Number of relations form A = {x, y, z} to B= (1, 2), is 64.\n- There are 3 elements in set A and 2 elements in set B. Therefore, there are 3 * 2 = 6 possible relations. However, this statement is incorrect because the number of relations is not 64. This statement is false.\n\nC. Empty relation _ is reflexive.\n- A reflexive relation is a relation where every element in A is related to itself. An empty relation is a relation where there are no elements in A. Therefore, an empty relation is not reflexive. This statement is true.\n\nD. Properties of a relation being symmetric and being un-symmetric are negative of each other.\n- A symmetric relation is a relation where if aRb, then bRa. An asymmetric relation is a relation where if aRb, then bRa is not true. Therefore, the properties of being symmetric and being asymmetric are negative of each other. This statement is true.\n\nSo, the true statements are A and D.",
