Drugs may be implicated in the causation of gout: While certain drugs can cause gout, it is not a direct result of taking them. Gout is caused by a buildup of uric acid in the joints.\n\nB. A history of diarrhoea is not relevant: Diarrhoea can be a symptom of many conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, which can cause musculoskeletal symptoms. Therefore, it is relevant to ask about diarrhoea as part of a musculoskeletal history.\n\nC. Difficulty rising from a chair is diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica: Difficulty rising from a chair can be a symptom of many conditions, including polymyalgia rheumatica, but it is not diagnostic of the condition. Other symptoms, such as muscle pain and stiffness, are more specific to polymyalgia rheumatica.",
