            "content": " The most similar normative theory to corporate profit maximization is hedonistic utilitarianism. Hedonistic utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that holds that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure. In this sense, corporate profit maximization aligns with the goal of maximizing overall happiness or pleasure, as it seeks to increase the overall value of a company.\n\nPreference utilitarianism, which is another consequentialist ethical theory, also aligns with corporate profit maximization to some extent. Preference utilitarianism holds that the best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure, but it does so by taking into account the preferences of all affected individuals. While corporate profit maximization may not always take into account the preferences of all affected individuals, it does seek to maximize the overall value of a company, which can be seen as a form of maximizing overall happiness or pleasure.\n\nThe Categorical Imperative, which is a deontological ethical theory, does not align with corporate profit maximization. Deontological ethical theories, such as the Categorical Imperative, hold that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of their consequences. Corporate profit maximization, on the other hand, is a consequentialist ethical theory that seeks to maximize overall happiness or pleasure through the consequences of its actions.\n\nThe ethics of care, which is another deontological ethical theory, also does not align with corporate profit maximization. The ethics of care holds that certain actions are right or wrong based on the intentions and relationships of the individuals involved, rather than the consequences of their actions. Corporate profit maximization, as a consequentialist ethical theory, seeks to maximize overall happiness or pleasure through the consequences of its actions, which does not align with the ethics of care.",
