Phosphorylation.\n\nPhosphorylation is a post-translational modification that involves the addition of a phosphate group to a protein. This process can change the activity, stability, or localization of the protein. However, it does not change the primary structure of the protein, which is determined by the sequence of amino acids during translation.\n\nA. Lipidation: This process involves the attachment of lipids to proteins, which can change the protein's function or localization.\n\nB. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds: This process occurs during translation and involves the addition of amino acids to the protein chain.\n\nC. Glycosylation: This process involves the attachment of carbohydrates to proteins, which can change the protein's function or localization.",
