This approach allows for the prevention of pain and the management of breakthrough pain, while also allowing for individualized pain relief based on the patient's pain scores. Long-acting drugs can be used twice daily, but they should not be the sole source of pain relief. Pain relief should not be withheld solely based on pain scores, as this can lead to inadequate pain management.",
