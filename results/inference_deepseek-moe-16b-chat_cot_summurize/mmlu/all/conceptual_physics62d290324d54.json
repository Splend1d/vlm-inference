This is because the closed end of the tube acts as a reflection point, causing the sound wave to bounce back and forth inside the tube. This reflection creates a standing wave pattern, with nodes and antinodes, and the length of the tube is directly proportional to the wavelength of the standing wave. Since the wavelength of the standing wave is four times the length of the tube open at both ends, the length of the tube closed at one end will also be four times the value for a tube open at both ends.",
