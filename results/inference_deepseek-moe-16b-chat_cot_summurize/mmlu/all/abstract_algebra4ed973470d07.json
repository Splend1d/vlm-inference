            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3.\n\nA group is Abelian if the group operation is commutative, i.e., for all a, b in the group, a * b = b * a. The symmetric group S_n is not Abelian for n >= 3 because the order in which the elements are combined in the group operation matters. For example, in S_3, the operation (12)(23) is not the same as (23)(12). Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: If a is a permutation that is an m-cycle and b is a permutation that is an n-cycle, then |ab| = lcm(m,n).\n\nA permutation is an m-cycle if it can be written as a_1 * a_2 * ... * a_m = a_1, where a_i are distinct elements of the group. Similarly, a permutation is an n-cycle if it can be written as a_1 * a_2 * ... * a_n = a_n.\n\nIf a is an m-cycle and b is an n-cycle, then their product ab can be written as a_1 * a_2 * ... * a_m * a_m+1 * a_m+2 * ... * a_n = a_1 * a_2 * ... * a_n, where a_m+1 = a_m, a_m+2 = a_m+1, ..., a_n = a_m. This is the same as the identity permutation, which means that the order of the elements in ab does not matter. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
