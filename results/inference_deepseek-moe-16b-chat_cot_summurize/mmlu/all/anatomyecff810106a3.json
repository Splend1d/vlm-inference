Pulmonary arteries.\n\nThe right ventricle of the heart is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood, which is low in oxygen, from the right atrium to the lungs. The lungs are responsible for exchanging the oxygen in the blood for carbon dioxide, a waste product. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, which are the only veins that carry oxygen-poor blood.\n\nThe inferior vena cava, on the other hand, is responsible for carrying oxygen-rich blood from the lower body and the legs back to the heart. The left ventricle, which pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body, is not involved in this process. The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, which then distributes the blood to the body.\n\nThe pulmonary arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs, are not involved in the process of blood flowing from the right ventricle to the inferior vena cava.",
