The magnetic force is given by the equation F = qvBsin\u03b8, where F is the force, q is the charge of the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field strength. The angle\u03b8 between the velocity and the magnetic field determines the direction of the force. If the angle\u03b8 is 90 degrees, the force is in the same direction as the velocity, and the particle will continue in the same direction. If the angle\u03b8 is less than 90 degrees, the force is perpendicular to the velocity, and the particle will change direction. Therefore, the magnetic force can change both the speed and the direction of a moving charged particle.",
