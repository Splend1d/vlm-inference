The fallopian tube is a muscular tube that connects the ovaries to the uterus. The ovum (egg) is released from the ovary during ovulation and travels down the fallopian tube, where it may be fertilized by a sperm cell. If fertilization occurs, the resulting zygote (fertilized ovum) will then travel down the fallopian tube and implant in the lining of the uterus.",
