It occurs due to failure of fusion of the maxillary and mandibular processes during embryonic development. This failure results in the persistence of a gap between the maxillary and mandibular segments of the face, which leads to the wide or unusually wide mouth characteristic of macrostomia.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. Failure of fusion of the left and right mandibular processes would result in a unilateral cleft lip or palate, not macrostomia.\nC. Failure of fusion of the maxillary and frontonasal processes would result in a frontonasal dysplasia, not macrostomia.\nD. Failure of fusion of the mandibular and hyoid arches would result in a cleft chin, not macrostomia.",
