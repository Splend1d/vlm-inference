Transverse waves are waves in which the oscillations of the medium are at right angles to the direction of propagation of the wave. Examples of transverse waves include light waves, sound waves, and water waves. Longitudinal waves, on the other hand, are waves in which the oscillations of the medium are parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave. Examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves in a solid material and sound waves in a liquid. Therefore, the answer is A.",
