            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors.\n\nWe know that for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the heat pump extracts heat from an outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heats the environment indoors to 27\u00b0C.\n\nThe amount of work required to extract heat from the outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and heat it to 27\u00b0C can be calculated using the formula:\n\nWork = Heat Capacity * Change in Temperature\n\nThe heat capacity of the heat pump can be calculated as:\n\nHeat Capacity = 4.2 kJ/kgK\n\nThe change in temperature is 20\u00b0C (27\u00b0C - 7\u00b0C).\n\nWork = 4.2 kJ/kgK * 20\u00b0C\nWork = 84 kJ/kg\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest amount of work required for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors.\n\nSince the heat pump is operating at a constant efficiency, the amount of work required for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors is:\n\nWork = 84 kJ/kg / 15,000 J\nWork = 0.0056 kJ/J\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors is approximately 0.0056 kJ.\n\nHowever, since the options are given in Joules, we need to convert this value to Joules.\n\n0.0056 kJ * 1,000 = 5.6 J\n\nTherefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors is approximately 5.6 J.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
