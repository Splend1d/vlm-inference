            "content": " When water changes to steam, energy is absorbed by the water. This is because the water molecules gain kinetic energy as they transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase, which is a result of the increase in temperature. The energy absorbed by the water is used to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold the water molecules together, allowing them to expand and form steam. This process is known as vaporization.",
