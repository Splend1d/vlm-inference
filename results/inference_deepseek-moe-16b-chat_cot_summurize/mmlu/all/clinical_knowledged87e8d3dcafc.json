It is located in the medulla oblongata, which is a part of the brainstem. The cardiovascular centre receives information about blood pressure from the aortic and carotid bodies, which are specialized sensory receptors located in the aorta and carotid arteries. These receptors detect changes in blood pressure and send signals to the cardiovascular centre to adjust the heart rate and blood pressure accordingly.\n\nThe baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, and vasomotor centre are also involved in regulating blood pressure, but they do not detect changes in blood pressure. Instead, they respond to changes in blood pressure that have already occurred. The baroreceptors detect changes in blood pressure in the aortic arch and carotid sinus, while the chemoreceptors detect changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. The vasomotor centre is involved in regulating blood flow to different organs and tissues, but it does not detect changes in blood pressure.",
