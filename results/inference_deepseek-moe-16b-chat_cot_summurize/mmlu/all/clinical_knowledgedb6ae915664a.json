            "content": " The correct answer is A. It causes stridor due to compression of the oesophagus.\n\nA large goitre can cause complications such as compression of the trachea and oesophagus, leading to stridor and dysphagia, respectively. However, the question asks for the most specific complication, and stridor is the most immediate and severe complication of a large goitre.\n\nB. Dysphagia is an indication for surgery is not necessarily true. While dysphagia can be a sign of a large goitre, it is not always an indication for surgery. The decision to operate depends on the size of the goitre, the presence of symptoms, and the patient's overall health.\n\nC. It causes hoarseness due to compression of the trachea is not true. Hoarseness is not a common complication of a large goitre.\n\nD. It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre is not true. A large goitre can cause more severe symptoms, but it does not necessarily cause a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre. The severity of thyrotoxicosis depends on the size of the goitre, but also on the presence of other factors such as the presence of autonomous thyroid nodules or the presence of Graves' disease.",
