The auditory tube (also known as the eustachian tube) opens to equalize pressure in the middle ear, and the cricopharyngeus muscle contracts to help move food down the esophagus. The gag reflex is a protective reflex that helps prevent choking, and it is not directly related to the act of swallowing.",
