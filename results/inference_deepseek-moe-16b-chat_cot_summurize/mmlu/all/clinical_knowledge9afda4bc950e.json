            "content": " The correct answer is D. Rectal cancer is the most common cause of rectal bleeding.\n\nRectal bleeding can be caused by a variety of conditions, including hemorrhoids, anal fissures, colorectal cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. A digital examination may reveal an anal fissure, but it is not specific to this condition. A bright red blood on the finger usually signifies a caecal lesion, but this is not a common cause of rectal bleeding. Proctoscopy can be useful in the assessment of rectal bleeding, as it allows the physician to directly visualize the rectum and anus. However, it is not of no value in the assessment of rectal bleeding.\n\nRectal cancer is the most common cause of rectal bleeding, accounting for about 5-10% of all cases. Other less common causes of rectal bleeding include colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, and polyps. Therefore, the statement that rectal cancer is the most common cause of rectal bleeding is true.",
