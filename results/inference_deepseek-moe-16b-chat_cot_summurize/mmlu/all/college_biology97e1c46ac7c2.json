The other statements are all true. Telolecithal eggs do indeed undergo meroblastic cleavage, where the egg is divided into two unequal parts, with one part containing the yolk and the other part containing the egg's polar body. The vegetal pole does indeed undergo cleavage more readily than the animal pole, and the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.",
