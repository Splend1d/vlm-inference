            "content": " To determine which of the given statements are true, we will analyze the function f(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^3.\n\nA. f has all of its relative extrema on the line x = y.\nLet's consider the partial derivatives of f with respect to x and y:\n\u2202f/\u2202x = 2x - 2y\n\u2202f/\u2202y = -2x + 3y^2\n\nNow, let's set the partial derivatives equal to zero to find the critical points:\n2x - 2y = 0\n-2x + 3y^2 = 0\n\nSolving these equations, we get x = y and x = y^2. So, the function has relative extrema on the lines x = y and x = y^2. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\nB. f has all of its relative extrema on the parabola x = y^2.\nAs we determined in part A, the function has relative extrema on the lines x = y and x = y^2. The parabola x = y^2 is a subset of these lines, so it is possible for the function to have a relative minimum or maximum at a point on the parabola. Therefore, statement B is true.\n\nC. f has a relative minimum at (0, 0).\nTo determine if there is a relative minimum at (0, 0), we need to check the second partial derivatives of f:\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2 = 2\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = 6y\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u2202y = -2\n\nNow, let's evaluate these second partial derivatives at the point (0, 0):\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2(0, 0) = 2\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2(0, 0) = 6(0) = 0\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u2202y(0, 0) = -2\n\nSince all second partial derivatives are either 0 or undefined at the point (0, 0), we cannot determine if there is a relative minimum at this point. Therefore, statement C is false.\n\nD. f has an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3).\nTo determine if there is an absolute minimum at (2/3, 2/3), we need to check the second partial derivatives of f:\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2 = 2\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2 = 6y\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u2202y = -2\n\nNow, let's evaluate these second partial derivatives at the point (2/3, 2/3):\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u00b2(2/3, 2/3) = 2\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202y\u00b2(2/3, 2/3) = 6(2/3) = 4\n\u2202\u00b2f/\u2202x\u2202y(2/3, 2/3) = -2\n\nSince all second partial derivatives are either 0 or undefined at the point (2/3, 2/3), we cannot determine if there is an absolute minimum at this point. Therefore, statement D is false.\n\nIn conclusion, the only true statement is B. f has all of its relative extrema on the parabola x = y^2.",
