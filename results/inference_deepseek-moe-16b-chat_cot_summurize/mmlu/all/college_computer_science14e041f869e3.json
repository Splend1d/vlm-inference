The total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N can be calculated using the formula:\n\nTotal number of nodes = K^(N+1) - 1\n\nThe number of nonterminal nodes (i.e., the number of nodes that are not leaves) can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of nonterminal nodes = K^(N+1) - 1 - K^N\n\nNow, we can express the ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes in terms of K:\n\nRatio = (Number of nonterminal nodes) / (Total number of nodes) = (K^(N+1) - 1 - K^N) / (K^(N+1) - 1)\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n\nRatio = K^(N+1) - K^N / (K^(N+1) - 1)\n\nNow, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\nRatio = K^(N+1) - K^N / (K - 1)\n\nThis is the same as the expression for the ratio of the number of nonterminal nodes to the total number of nodes in a complete K-ary tree of depth N. Therefore, the answer is B. K-1/K.",
