However, the function f : (0, 1] \u2192 (0, 1) is not defined at x = 0, so it is not onto. Therefore, statement I is not true.\n\nII. The image of f is compact.\nThe image of a function is the set of all possible output values. In this case, the image of f is the set of all y in (0, 1] such that there exists an x in (0, 1) with f(x) = y. This set is not compact because it is not closed and bounded. Therefore, statement II is not true.\n\nIII. f is continuous, one-to-one, and onto.\nThis statement is true. A function is continuous if and only if it is both one-to-one and onto. Since f is one-to-one and onto, it is also continuous.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and III only.",
