In this case, there are two equivalent nitrogen nuclei coupled to the unpaired electron. Therefore, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum will be 2^2 = 4 lines. However, since the unpaired electron is coupled to two equivalent nitrogen nuclei, the lines will be split into two groups, each with two lines. Therefore, the final answer is 2 lines.\nThe answer is: 2",
