These fibers are responsible for producing high levels of force and speed during short bursts of activity. Type IIa fibres, also known as fast-twitch muscle fibers, are the second to fatigue during all-out exercise. Type IIX fibres, also known as fast-twitch muscle fibers, are the third to fatigue during all-out exercise.
