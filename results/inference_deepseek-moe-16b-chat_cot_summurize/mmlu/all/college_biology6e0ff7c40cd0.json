            "content": " The correct answer is B. mtDNA is passed from mother to child and is free from recombination that occurs between pairs of chromosomes.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a type of DNA found in the mitochondria of cells. It is inherited only from the mother and is not subject to recombination, which is the process of exchanging genetic material between non-sister chromatids during meiosis. This makes mtDNA a useful tool for studying the relatedness of animal populations, as it provides a clear and consistent record of a population's ancestry.\n\nOption A is incorrect because mtDNA mutates at a rate similar to nuclear DNA, not slower.\n\nOption C is incorrect because there are many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the hypervariable, noncoding regions of mtDNA.\n\nOption D is incorrect because not all mitochondrial proteins are coded for by mitochondrial genes. Some are encoded by nuclear genes and imported into the mitochondria.",
