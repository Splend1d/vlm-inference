            "content": " The rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis is phosphofructokinase (PFK). It is the enzyme that determines the rate of glycolysis, which is the first step in cellular respiration. PFK catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, which is the key intermediate in glycolysis.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway by which glucose is broken down to produce energy in the form of ATP and NADH. It occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and consists of a series of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The overall reaction of glycolysis is:\n\nGlucose \u2192 2 \\* ATP + 2 \\* NADH + 2 \\* H\u207a + 2 \\* Pi\n\nThe rate limiting step of glycolysis is the conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase (PFK). Once PFK is inhibited or blocked, the rate of glycolysis is slowed down, and the overall rate of glycolysis is limited.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. phosphofructokinase (PFK).",
