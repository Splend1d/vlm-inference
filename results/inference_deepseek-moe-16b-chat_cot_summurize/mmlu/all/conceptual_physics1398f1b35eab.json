            "content": " The correct answer is C. Inertia of both rocks is the same.\n\nIn physics, inertia is the resistance of any physical object to a change in its state of motion, including changes to its speed and direction. It is defined as the ratio of an object's mass to its acceleration. In this case, the heavy rock and the light rock have the same mass, so if the inertia of both rocks is the same, they will have the same acceleration when they are in free fall.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the force due to gravity is not the same on each rock. The force of gravity acting on a heavy rock is greater than the force acting on a light rock due to their greater mass.\n\nOption B is incorrect because air resistance is not always zero in free fall. In fact, air resistance is always present, even in free fall, and it can affect the motion of the rock.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the ratio of force to mass is not the same for both rocks. The force due to gravity acting on a heavy rock is greater than the force due to gravity acting on a light rock due to their greater mass.",
