This system provides a rapid and intense burst of energy, allowing muscles to contract with maximum force. The CP system relies on the presence of creatine phosphate (CP) in muscle cells, which can be quickly converted to ATP to fuel muscle contractions. This energy system is particularly important for activities that require short, intense bursts of energy, such as sprinting or weightlifting.",
