Symbolic culture refers to the use of symbols, signs, and other cultural artifacts to communicate and transmit knowledge, beliefs, and values.\n\nI. A young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean from an older monkey, even when the food is not covered in dirt or sand. This is an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture because the older monkey is using a cultural symbol (the ocean) to teach the younger monkey a behavior (rinsing off food).\n\nII. A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent. This is also an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture because the parent is using a cultural symbol (the rules of baseball) to teach the child a behavior (playing baseball).\n\nIII. A new group of inductees in a military organization experiencing hazing rituals from older students, which they then later carry out on new recruits. This is not an example of the transmission of knowledge through symbolic culture. Instead, it is an example of the transmission of knowledge through socialization and learning by imitation. The older students are not using cultural symbols to teach the younger students a behavior; they are simply teaching them how to behave in a specific social context.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. III only.",
