According to this principle, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. Therefore, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is the same as the speed of light in the lab frame.\n\nLet's denote the speed of light in the lab frame as c. Since the tube is traveling at 1/2 c relative to the lab frame, the speed of light in the water relative to the lab frame is:\n\nc - 1/2 c = 1/2 c\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nA. 1/2 c",
