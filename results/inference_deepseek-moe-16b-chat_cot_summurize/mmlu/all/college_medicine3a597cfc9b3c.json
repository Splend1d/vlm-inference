Endometrium, cell division.\n\nThe endometrium is the lining of the uterus, and during pregnancy, it thickens and prepares for the implantation of a fertilized egg. The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the developing placenta after conception and is the hormone that pregnancy tests detect. The hCG hormone stimulates the endometrium to continue to thicken, providing a suitable environment for the fertilized egg to implant and grow.",
