The differential equation is:\n\nx dy + (y - xe^x) dx = 0\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nx dy = (y - xe^x) dx\n\nNow, we can find the integrating factor, which is given by:\n\nIF = e^(\u222bx dx) = e^(x^2/2)\n\nMultiply the entire differential equation by the integrating factor:\n\ne^(x^2/2) dx (x dy) = e^(x^2/2) (y - xe^x) dx\n\nNow, the left side is the derivative of the product of y and the integrating factor:\n\nd/dx (y e^(x^2/2)) = y e^(x^2/2) - xe^(x^2/2)\n\nNow, we can integrate both sides with respect to x:\n\ny e^(x^2/2) = \u222b(y e^(x^2/2)) dx - \u222b(xe^(x^2/2)) dx\n\ny e^(x^2/2) = (1/2)y e^(x^2/2) - (1/2)xe^(x^2/2) + C\n\nNow, we can solve for y:\n\ny = (1/2)e^(x^2/2) - (1/2)xe^(x^2/2) + Ce^(-x^2/2)\n\nNow, we can find the value of f(2) by plugging in x = 2:\n\nf(2) = (1/2)e^(2^2/2) - (1/2)(2)e^(2^2/2) + Ce^(-2^2/2)\n\nf(2) = (1/2)e^2 - (1/2)(2)e^2 + Ce^(-2)\n\nf(2) = (1/2)e^2 - (1/2)e^2 + Ce^(-2)\n\nf(2) = (1/2)e^2 - (1/2)e^2 + Ce^(-2)\n\nf(2) = (1/2)e^2 - (1/2)e^2\n\nf(2) = 0\n\nSo, the value of f(2) is 0.
