It is a vital organ in the immune system, as it plays a key role in the removal of old or damaged red blood cells and in the production of white blood cells. The spleen also contains macrophages, which are specialized cells that engulf and destroy foreign particles, such as bacteria and viruses, that have entered the bloodstream. Additionally, the spleen is a key player in the immune response, as it is a site of activation of T-cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in the immune response.",
