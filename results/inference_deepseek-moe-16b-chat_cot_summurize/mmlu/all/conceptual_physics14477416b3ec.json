This is because when the sum of all the forces acting on an object is zero, the net force acting on the object is also zero. When the net force acting on an object is zero, the object will not accelerate, and therefore, it will come to rest.\n\nIn this case, the sum of all the vector forces on the object is zero, so the object will come to rest. This is because the forces acting on the object are balanced, and there is no net force acting on the object. When there is no net force acting on an object, the object will not accelerate, and therefore, it will come to rest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The object will come to rest.",
