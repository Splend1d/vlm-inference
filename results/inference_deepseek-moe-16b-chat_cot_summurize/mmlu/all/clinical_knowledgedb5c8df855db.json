            "content": " The correct answer is B. Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles. This is because Type I fibres are slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant, and used for endurance activities, while Type II fibres are fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant, and used for strength and power activities. Elite endurance runners typically have a higher proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles due to the nature of their training and the events they participate in.",
