            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the radiation force exerted on a surface:\n\nF = (1/2) * \u03c3 * T^4 * A\n\nwhere F is the radiation force, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W/m^2 K^4), T is the temperature of the surface, and A is the area of the surface.\n\nWe are given the solar flux (F_solar) at Earth's surface, which is 1,000 W/m^2. We are also given the area of the surface (A) as 3 m^2. However, we are not given the temperature of the surface. Since we are dealing with solar radiation, we can assume that the temperature of the surface is the same as the temperature of the Sun, which is approximately 5,778 K.\n\nNow, we can plug in the values into the formula:\n\nF = (1/2) * 5.67 x 10^-8 * (5778 K)^4 * 3 m^2\n\nF = (1/2) * 5.67 x 10^-8 * 1.09 x 10^16 * 3\n\nF = 1.4 x 10^-5 N\n\nSo, the total radiation force exerted on the surface is 1.4 x 10^-5 N. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 1 x 10^-5 N",
