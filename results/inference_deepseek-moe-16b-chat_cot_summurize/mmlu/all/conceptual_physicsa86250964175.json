            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of vector addition and the sine function.\n\nThe horizontal component of the force is given by the cosine of the angle, and the vertical component is given by the sine of the angle.\n\nFirst, let's find the horizontal component of the force. The horizontal component is the component of the force that is acting in the same direction as the angle. In this case, the angle is 45\u00b0 above the horizontal, so the horizontal component is the cosine of 45\u00b0.\n\ncos(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.7071\n\nSo, the horizontal component of the force is approximately 0.7071 times the total force.\n\nNext, let's find the vertical component of the force. The vertical component is the component of the force that is acting perpendicular to the angle. In this case, the angle is 45\u00b0, so the vertical component is the sine of 45\u00b0.\n\nsin(45\u00b0) = \u221a2/2 \u2248 0.7071\n\nSo, the vertical component of the force is approximately 0.7071 times the total force.\n\nFinally, we can find the total force by adding the horizontal and vertical components.\n\nTotal force = Horizontal component + Vertical component\nTotal force = 0.7071F + 0.7071F\nTotal force = 1.4142F\n\nSince the problem states that the force is 10 N, we can substitute this value into the equation.\n\nTotal force = 1.4142(10)\nTotal force = 14.142\n\nSo, the total force is approximately 14.142 N.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 12 N.",
