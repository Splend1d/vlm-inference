When an electric field is applied to an electron, it causes the electron to gain kinetic energy, which results in an increase in its speed. Similarly, when a magnetic field is applied to an electron, it causes the electron to change its direction of motion, which also results in an increase in its speed. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",
