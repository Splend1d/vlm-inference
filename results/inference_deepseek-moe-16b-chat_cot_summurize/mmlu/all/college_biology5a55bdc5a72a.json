The kinetochore is a complex of proteins that forms on the centromere of a chromosome and is responsible for attaching the chromosome to the mitotic spindle during cell division. The kinetochore consists of several protein complexes, including the inner and outer kinetochore, the microtubule-binding proteins, and the motor proteins that move the chromosomes during cell division. The other options, chromatophore, chromomere, and centriole, are not related to the attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle during cell division.",
