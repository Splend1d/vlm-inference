This means that the light changes direction as it enters the raindrop. The light is also dispersed as it enters the raindrop, which means that the light is separated into its different colors.\n\nOnce the light is inside the raindrop, it undergoes internal reflection as it bounces back and forth between the inside and outside surfaces of the raindrop. This internal reflection causes the light to be bent back towards the outside of the raindrop, where it is then refracted again as it exits the raindrop.\n\nThe result of all of these processes is a rainbow, which is a circular arc of colors that appears in the sky. The colors in a rainbow are typically red on the outside, with the colors getting lighter and more violet as you move towards the inside of the arc.",
