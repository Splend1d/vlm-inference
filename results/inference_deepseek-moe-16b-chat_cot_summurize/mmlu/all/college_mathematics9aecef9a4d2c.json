The sum of any two elements in S is also in S. For example, 2 + 8 = 10, which is also in S.\n\nB. (S, +, x) is closed under multiplication modulo 10.\nThis statement is also true. The product of any two elements in S is also in S. For example, 2 * 8 = 16, which is also in S.\n\nC. (S, +, x) has an identity under addition modulo 10.\nThis statement is also true. The identity element under addition modulo 10 is 0. For example, adding 0 to any element in S does not change the element.\n\nD. (S, +, x) has no identity under multiplication modulo 10.\nThis statement is FALSE. The identity element under multiplication modulo 10 is 1. For example, multiplying 1 by any element in S does not change the element.\n\nTherefore, the FALSE statement is D.",
