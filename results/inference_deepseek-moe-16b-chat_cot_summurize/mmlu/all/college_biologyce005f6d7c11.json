Capillary action.\n\nRoot pressure, also known as the root-pressure theory, is a phenomenon that occurs when water is drawn from the soil into the plant's roots against the force of gravity. This happens because the roots have a higher water potential than the surrounding soil, and water moves from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Translocation: Translocation is the movement of water, minerals, and other substances from one part of a plant to another, usually from the roots to the leaves. It is not related to root pressure.\n\nB. Adhesion: Adhesion is the ability of water molecules to stick to the surface of a solid, such as a root surface. It is not related to root pressure.\n\nC. Osmosis: Osmosis is the movement of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration. It is not related to root pressure.",
