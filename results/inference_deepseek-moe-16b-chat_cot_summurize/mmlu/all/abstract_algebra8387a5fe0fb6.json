An abelian group is a group in which the operation is commutative, i.e., for all a, b in G, a * b = b * a.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. g = g^-1 for every g in G: In an abelian group, the operation is commutative, which means that for every g in G, g * g^-1 = g^-1 * g = 0. Therefore, g = g^-1 for every g in G. This statement is true.\n\nB. g = g^2 for every g in G: In an abelian group, the operation is commutative, which means that for every g in G, g * g = g * g^2. Therefore, g = g^2 for every g in G. This statement is also true.\n\nC. (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G: In an abelian group, the operation is commutative, which means that for every g, h in G, (g * h)^2 = g^2 * h^2. Therefore, (g o h)^2 = g^2 * h^2 for every g,h in G. This statement is also true.\n\nD. G is of finite order: In an abelian group, the operation is commutative, which means that for every g in G, g * g = g * g * g. Therefore, G is of finite order. This statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, all the statements A, B, C, and D are true for an abelian group (G, 0).",
