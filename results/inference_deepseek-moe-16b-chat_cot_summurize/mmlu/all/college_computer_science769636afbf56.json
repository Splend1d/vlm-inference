Quicksort.\n\nQuicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.\n\nIn the worst case, when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot, the algorithm has a time complexity of \u0398(n^2). However, on average, the algorithm has a time complexity of \u0398(n log n), which is achieved by choosing the pivot element randomly.",
