            "content": " The mucosa of the hard palate is keratinised and has submucosa and minor salivary glands posterolaterally. The hard palate is the bony part of the roof of the mouth, and its mucosa is the outermost layer of tissue. The mucosa is keratinised, which means it contains keratinocytes, a type of cell that produces keratin, a protein that provides protection and strength to the skin and mucous membranes. The keratinised mucosa also has submucosa, which is a layer of connective tissue that lies just beneath the mucosa and contains blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and a few minor salivary glands. The minor salivary glands secrete saliva into the mouth, helping to keep the mouth moist and aiding in digestion. The submucosa is important because it provides a barrier between the oral cavity and the nasal cavity, preventing food and saliva from entering the nasal passages.",
