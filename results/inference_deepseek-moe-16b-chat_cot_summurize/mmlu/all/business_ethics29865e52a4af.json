The correct answer is C, which refers to the importance of internal company policies and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a key piece of legislation that was enacted in response to corporate scandals such as Enron and WorldCom. It sets strict standards for financial reporting and transparency, and requires companies to have strong internal controls and auditing processes in place to prevent fraud and ensure accurate financial reporting.\n\nOn the other hand, internal company policies are also crucial for driving ethical business practices. These policies should clearly outline the company's values and expectations for ethical behavior, and should be communicated to all employees. They should also provide mechanisms for reporting and addressing any unethical behavior that may occur.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is not a legislation such as the one in the United States, but rather a specific act.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Unethical Corporate Practices Act is not a real legislation, and it is not clear what it refers to.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Unethical Corporate Practices Act is not a real legislation, and it is not clear what it refers to.",
