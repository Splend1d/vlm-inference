He knew that on the summer solstice, the Sun's rays would pass directly into the Syene (modern-day Aswan, Egypt) and would be vertical at that location. He also knew that at the same time, the Sun's rays would not reach as far north in Alexandria, Egypt, where he was located. By measuring the difference in the angle of the Sun's rays at these two locations, he was able to estimate the Earth's circumference. This method of triangulation is still used today in surveying and navigation.",
