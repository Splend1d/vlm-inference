If A is finite, then B is finite.\nThis statement is not always true. Consider the following example:\nA = {a, b, c}\nB = {a, b}\nIn this case, A is finite, but B is not.\n\nII. If A is regular, then B is regular.\nThis statement is not always true. A regular language is a language that can be recognized by a finite state automaton. If A is a regular language, then B, which is a subset of A, must also be a regular language. However, there are regular languages that are not context-free, so this statement is not always true.\n\nIII. If A is context-free, then B is context-free.\nThis statement is not always true. A context-free language is a language that can be recognized by a pushdown automaton. If A is a context-free language, then B, which is a subset of A, must also be a context-free language. However, there are context-free languages that are not regular, so this statement is not always true.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements I, II, and III must always be true for all finite sets A and B.\n\nThe correct answer is D.
