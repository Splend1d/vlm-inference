The Hall coefficient is a measure of the strength of the electric field that is generated by the flow of charge carriers in a semiconductor material. It is a property of the material itself and is not affected by the doping process.\n\nThe Hall coefficient is positive for electrons and negative for holes. Therefore, if the Hall coefficient is positive, it indicates that the charge carriers are electrons, and if it is negative, it indicates that the charge carriers are holes.\n\nThe other options listed (specific heat, thermal conductivity, and electrical resistivity) are not directly related to the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor. While these properties may be affected by the doping process, they do not provide a direct indication of the sign of the charge carriers.",
