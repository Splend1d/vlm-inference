The first concept, consequentialist reasoning, is a moral philosophy that focuses on the consequences of actions. The second concept, cost-benefit analysis, is a method used to determine whether a particular action or decision will be beneficial or not.\n\nOption A: Consequentialist, Cost-benefit analysis - This option is incorrect because consequentialist reasoning is a moral philosophy, not a method for determining the benefits of a decision.\n\nOption B: Rationalised, Annual audit - This option is incorrect because rationalised reasoning is a method for making decisions based on logic and evidence, not an annual audit.\n\nOption C: Consequentialist, Annual audit - This option is incorrect because consequentialist reasoning is a moral philosophy, not an annual audit.\n\nOption D: Rationalised, Cost-benefit analysis - This option is correct because rationalised reasoning is a method for making decisions based on logic and evidence, and cost-benefit analysis is a method for determining whether a particular action or decision will be beneficial or not. Therefore, these two concepts are closely related and often used together in businesses.",
