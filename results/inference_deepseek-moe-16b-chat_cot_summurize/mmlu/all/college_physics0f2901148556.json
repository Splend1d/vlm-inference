            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the energy in the electromagnetic waves and the temperature of the cavity.\n\nThe energy in an electromagnetic wave is given by the formula:\n\nE = h * f\n\nwhere h is the Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the wave, and E is the energy of the wave.\n\nThe energy of an electromagnetic wave is also related to its temperature by the formula:\n\nE = k * T\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the wave.\n\nNow, let's consider the melting of ice. The energy from the electromagnetic waves is used to raise the temperature of the ice, causing it to melt. The amount of energy required to melt a unit mass of ice is given by the formula:\n\nE = m * c_p * T\n\nwhere m is the mass of the ice, c_p is the specific heat capacity of ice, and T is the temperature of the ice.\n\nWe are given that the Kelvin temperature of the cavity is increased by a factor of two, so the new temperature is 2T. We can now relate the energy in the electromagnetic waves to the temperature of the ice using the formula:\n\nE = k * T\n\nSubstituting the new temperature, we get:\n\nE = k * 2T\n\nNow, we can relate the energy in the electromagnetic waves to the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time using the formula:\n\nE = m * c_p * T\n\nSubstituting the new temperature, we get:\n\nE = m * c_p * 2T\n\nThe mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is given by the formula:\n\nm = E / (c_p * T)\n\nSubstituting the new energy and temperature, we get:\n\nm = (k * 2T) / (c_p * 2T)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nm = k / c_p\n\nNow, we can compare the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time with the original mass of ice. The original mass of ice is given by the formula:\n\nm = E / (c_p * T)\n\nSubstituting the original energy, temperature, and mass, we get:\n\nm = (k * T) / (c_p * T)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nm = k / c_p\n\nComparing the two expressions for the mass of ice, we can see that they are equal:\n\nk / c_p = k / c_p\n\nTherefore, the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed amount of time is increased by a factor of 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 16",
