However, due to the fact that Venus and Earth have opposite orbits around the Sun, the phases of the Earth that you would see would be the opposite of what you would see from Earth.\n\nFrom Venus, you would see the Earth as a half-lit sphere in the sky, with the side facing the Sun fully illuminated and the side facing away from the Sun in shadow. The phase of the Earth that you would see would depend on the relative positions of Venus, Earth, and the Sun.\n\nIf the Earth was between Venus and the Sun, you would see a Full Earth, with the entire illuminated side facing towards Venus. If the Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun from Venus, you would see a New Earth, with the entire unilluminated side facing towards Venus.\n\nIf the Earth was to the left or right of the Sun, you would see a Waning or Waxing crescent Earth, respectively, with the illuminated crescent facing towards Venus.\n\nIn summary, if you lived on Venus and had a telescope that could see through Venus's thick clouds, you would see the phases of the Earth in the opposite order as those seen from Earth.",
