The XMAS tree scan is a stealth scan that sends a series of TCP packets with a specially crafted sequence number, which makes it difficult for the target system to detect the scan. The scan does not establish a full TCP connection, but instead sends a series of packets with a gradually increasing sequence number, which can be used to gather information about the target system's open ports and services.",
