Critical points occur where the derivative of the function is equal to zero or undefined.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of f(x):\n\nf'(x) = e^x - c\n\nNow, let's set the derivative equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n0 = e^x - c\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the property of exponents:\n\ne^x = c\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\nx = log(c)\n\nSince x = log(c) is the only critical point, we can conclude that the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = log(c).\n\nNow, let's find the value of f(x) at x = log(c):\n\nf(log(c)) = e^(log(c)) - c * log(c)\n\nf(log(c)) = c - c * log(c)\n\nSince log(c) is positive for all real numbers c, the minimum value of f(x) is achieved when x = log(c). Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) is f(log(c)) = c - c * log(c).\n\nNow, let's compare this minimum value to the given options:\n\nA. f(c) = e^c - c^2\nB. f(e^c) = e^(e^c) - e^c * e^c\nC. f(1/c) = e^(1/c) - c * e^(1/c)\nD. f(log c) = c - c * log(c)\n\nNone of the given options match the minimum value of f(x) = c - c * log(c). Therefore, the correct answer is not among the given options.",
