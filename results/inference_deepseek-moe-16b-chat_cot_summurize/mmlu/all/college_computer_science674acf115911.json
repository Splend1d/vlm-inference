Even if P = NP, integer factorization is still likely not to be polynomial-time computable.\n\nThe reason for this is that even if we could solve any problem in polynomial time, it doesn't necessarily mean that the inverse problem (finding the factors of a number) would also be in polynomial time. This is because the problem of finding the factors of a number is a special case of the more general problem of finding the factors of a number in a specific range, which is a problem that is known to be NP-hard.\n\nTherefore, even if P = NP, it is still likely that integer factorization will remain difficult to compute in polynomial time, and thus will remain secure in many cryptographic protocols.",
