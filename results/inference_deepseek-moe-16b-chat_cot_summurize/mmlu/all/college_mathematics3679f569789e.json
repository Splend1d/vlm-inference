            "content": " To solve this, let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1:\nSuppose \u2211|a_i| diverges and \u2211 a_i = 2. There is a rearrangement a_i_k of the terms such that \u2211 a_i_k = 4.\n\nProof:\nSince \u2211 a_i = 2, we know that the sum of the terms a_i is 2. If \u2211|a_i| diverges, then there must be at least one term a_i that is not included in the sum. Let's call this term a_i_k. Since a_i_k is not included in the sum, we have:\n\n\u2211 a_i = 2\n\u2211 a_i_k = 4\n\nSince \u2211 a_i_k = 4, we can rearrange the terms a_i_k to obtain a_i_k = 4 - \u2211 a_i. Therefore, the sum of the rearranged terms a_i_k is 4.\n\nStatement 2:\nThere exists metric spaces X and Y with X closed and bounded and a continuous mapping f : X \u2192 Y such that f(X) is NOT \u201cclosed and bounded\u201d.\n\nProof:\nConsider the metric space X = [0, 1] with the standard topology, and the continuous mapping f: X \u2192 Y, where Y is an unbounded set. Since X is closed and bounded, it is a compact set. However, f(X) is not compact, as it is unbounded. Therefore, f(X) is not closed and bounded.\n\nSince we have shown that both statements are true, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
