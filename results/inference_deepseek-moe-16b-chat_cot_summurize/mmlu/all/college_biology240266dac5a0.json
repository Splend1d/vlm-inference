            "content": " The correct answer is B. Palisade mesophyll.\n\nThe palisade mesophyll is the most likely tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant to have the highest rate of oxygen production. This is because the palisade mesophyll is the innermost layer of the leaf, where most of the photosynthesis occurs. It contains a large number of chloroplasts, which are the site of photosynthesis, and is in close proximity to the vascular cambium, which is responsible for the production of new cells for the leaf.\n\nThe other tissues mentioned in the question, such as the cortex, epidermis, and vascular cambium, do not play a significant role in photosynthesis. The cortex is the outer layer of the root, stem, and leaves, and contains cells that store nutrients and water. The epidermis is the outer layer of the leaf, and is responsible for protecting the plant from damage and dehydration. The vascular cambium is a layer of cells that produce new cells for the vascular system of the plant, but it does not play a significant role in photosynthesis.\n\nTherefore, the palisade mesophyll is the most likely tissue in an actively photosynthesizing plant to have the highest rate of oxygen production.",
