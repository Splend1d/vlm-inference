The patient is a middle-aged businessman who is irate and creating a scene because he was told he would have to see the dental hygienist instead of the dentist. The patient loudly rants that he makes too much money to be subjected to treatment by a half-trained associate. The clerk explains to the dentist that the patient was 40 minutes late to his appointment, and the only opening now was with the hygienist. The patient snaps back that his time is worth more than any of the people in the office. What personality disorder is this patient likely exhibiting?\n\nA. Histrionic\nB. Narcissistic\nC. Paranoid\nD. Obsessive-compulsive\n",

This is because the patient is focused on his own needs and wants, and is not willing to compromise or understand the situation from the perspective of the office staff. He also seems to have a sense of entitlement and believes that his time is more valuable than others. The other options, Histrionic, Paranoid, and Obsessive-compulsive, do not fit the behavior described in the scenario.",
