This error occurs when a program tries to write more data to a buffer than the buffer is allocated to hold. This can cause the program to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to crashes or other unexpected behavior.\n\nIn the context of the given options, the correct answer is C. C and C++ are both low-level languages that are prone to buffer-overflow errors due to their use of raw memory allocation. In contrast, Python and Ruby are high-level languages that have built-in protections against buffer-overflow errors. Additionally, C# is a high-level language that is not known for having buffer-overflow errors.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. C and C++.",
