            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of binomial distribution. The binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a probability p of success.\n\nIn this case, the probability of getting a head in a single toss of a fair coin is 0.5, and the probability of getting a tail is also 0.5.\n\nWe are tossing the coin 100 times, so the total number of tosses is 100.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a binomial distribution is given by:\n\nP(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n\nwhere n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success, and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time.\n\nWe want to find the probability that the total number of heads (H) is between 51 and 55. To do this, we can calculate the probability of getting 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 heads and sum them up.\n\nP(51 <= H <= 55) = P(H=51) + P(H=52) + P(H=53) + P(H=54) + P(H=55)\n\nWe can calculate each of these probabilities using the binomial PMF formula.\n\nP(H=51) = C(100, 51) * (0.5)^51 * (0.5)^(100-51)\nP(H=52) = C(100, 52) * (0.5)^52 * (0.5)^(100-52)\nP(H=53) = C(100, 53) * (0.5)^53 * (0.5)^(100-53)\nP(H=54) = C(100, 54) * (0.5)^54 * (0.5)^(100-54)\nP(H=55) = C(100, 55) * (0.5)^55 * (0.5)^(100-55)\n\nWe can calculate these probabilities using the binomial coefficient formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)\n\nwhere n! is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nC(100, 51) = 100! / (51! * 49!)\nC(100, 52) = 100! / (52! * 48!)\nC(100, 53) = 100! / (53! * 47!)\nC(100, 54) = 100! / (54! * 46!)\nC(100, 55) = 100! / (55! * 45!)\n\nAfter calculating these probabilities, we can sum them up to get the probability of getting 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55 heads.\n\nP(51 <= H <= 55) = P(H=51) + P(H=52) + P(H=53) + P(H=54) + P(H=55)\n\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of getting a head or a tail is the same for each toss, so the probability of getting a head in a single toss is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of getting a tail is also 0.5.\n\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of getting a head or a tail is the same for each toss, so the probability of getting a head in a single toss is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of getting a tail is also 0.5.\n\nSince the coin is fair, the probability of getting a head or a tail is the same for each toss, so the probability of getting a head in a single toss is 0.5.
