            "content": " Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects joints, causing inflammation, pain, and stiffness. It is characterized by a symmetrical polyarthritis, which means that it affects multiple joints on both sides of the body.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Rheumatoid factor is present in 25% of rheumatoid cases: This is not true. Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an antibody that is found in the blood of about 80% of people with RA, but it is not present in all cases of RA.\n\nB. It is an example of an oligoarthropathy: This is not true. Oligoarthropathy refers to a group of autoimmune diseases that primarily affect small joints, such as the fingers and toes. RA primarily affects larger joints, such as the knees, hips, and shoulders.\n\nC. Anaemia is a common finding: This is not true. Anaemia is not a common finding in RA. In fact, it is more common in other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\n\nD. Heberden's nodes are a feature: This is true. Heberden's nodes are a common feature of RA. They are small, bony enlargements that develop at the distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. They are a sign of joint damage and can be seen in about 50% of people with RA.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Heberden's nodes are a feature of rheumatoid arthritis.",
