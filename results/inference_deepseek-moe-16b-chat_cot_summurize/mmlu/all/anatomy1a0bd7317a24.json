Mucous membranes are present in various parts of the body, such as the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital system. They produce mucus, which acts as a barrier and a lubricant, and also contains antibodies and white blood cells that help to fight off bacteria and other pathogens.\n\nThe other options do not directly contribute to the body's defense mechanism against bacteria:\n\nA. Hair in the nose: While hair in the nose can trap some particles, it is not a primary defense mechanism against bacteria.\n\nB. Osteoblasts: Osteoblasts are cells that form bone tissue. They are not involved in the body's defense mechanism against bacteria.\n\nC. Saliva: While saliva does contain enzymes that can help break down some bacteria, it is not the primary defense mechanism against environmental bacteria.",
