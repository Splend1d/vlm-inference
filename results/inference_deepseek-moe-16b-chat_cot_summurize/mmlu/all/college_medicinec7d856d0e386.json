This is because glycine is the smallest amino acid and has a small side chain, which allows it to easily fit into the hydrophobic region of the transmembrane domain. The other amino acids, such as tyrosine, arginine, and isoleucine, have larger side chains that would not fit as easily into the hydrophobic region of the transmembrane domain.",
