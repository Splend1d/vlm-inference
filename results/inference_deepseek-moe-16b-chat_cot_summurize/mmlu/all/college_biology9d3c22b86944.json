Linkage disequilibrium is more likely to occur in populations with inbreeding, such as asexual reproduction or coadapted gene complexes, as these populations have a higher chance of having closely related individuals. Epistasis, which refers to the interaction between genes, can also lead to linkage disequilibrium, as it can alter the recombination rate between genes. Random mating, on the other hand, can help to reduce linkage disequilibrium by spreading genes throughout the population, making it less likely for closely related individuals to have the same genotype.",
