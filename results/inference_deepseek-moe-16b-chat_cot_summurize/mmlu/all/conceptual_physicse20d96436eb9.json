A lever arm is the perpendicular distance between the point where a force is applied and the point around which the force is applied. This is why torque is also known as the moment of force.\n\nTorque is a measure of the turning effect of a force. It is equal to the force multiplied by the lever arm. The unit of torque is the newton-meter (Nm).\n\nTorque is important in many areas of physics and engineering, such as in the rotation of engines, the suspension of vehicles, and the behavior of rotating machines.\n\nIn summary, torque is a force that is multiplied by a lever arm, and it is important in many areas of physics and engineering.",
