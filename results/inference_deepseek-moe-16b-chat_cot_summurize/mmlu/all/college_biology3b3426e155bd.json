This process occurs during the formation of the female gametophyte, where two sperm cells are produced, one from the male gamete and the other from the female gamete. These two sperm cells then fuse together, forming a diploid cell called the zygote. This zygote will then develop into the embryo, while the other sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form the endosperm, which provides nourishment for the developing embryo. This process is essential for the formation of the seed and the development of the embryo.",
