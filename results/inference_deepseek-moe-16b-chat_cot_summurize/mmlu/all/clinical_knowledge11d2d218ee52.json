The root value of the biceps reflex is C5, C6: This is not true. The root value of the biceps reflex is actually T12, L1.\n\nB. If no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon, it is documented as absent: This is true. The assessment of arm reflexes includes tapping the tendon to elicit a reflex. If no reflex is elicited, it is documented as absent.\n\nC. The triceps tendon is struck in the antecubital fossa: This is not true. The triceps tendon is struck at the back of the elbow, not in the antecubital fossa.\n\nD. Brisk finger jerks confirm a lower motor neurone lesion: This is not true. Brisk finger jerks are not a reliable indicator of a lower motor neurone lesion.",
