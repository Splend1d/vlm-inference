The other properties, such as velocity, intensity, and frequency, can all be affected by the change in medium. For example, the velocity of the wave will increase in a denser medium because the particles in the denser medium are closer together and the wave can travel through them more easily. The intensity of the wave will also be affected by the density of the medium, as the particles in the denser medium will absorb and re-emit the wave more strongly. The frequency of the wave will not change, as the wave is still the same frequency, but the wavelength will change as the wave moves from one medium to another.",
