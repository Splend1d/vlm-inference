Two's complement only.\n\nIn two's complement representation, an overflow occurs when the sum of two numbers exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by the number of bits used. In this case, the maximum value that can be represented by a six-bit two's complement number is 63 (011111 in binary). Adding 011000 and 011000 results in a sum of 110000, which is equal to 64, which is greater than 63. Therefore, there is overflow, and the result should be represented as 000000 (100000 in binary).",
