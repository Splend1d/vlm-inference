It is made up of two strands that coil around each other to form a double helix. The DNA contains the instructions for making all the proteins that are needed to build and maintain the body.\n\nB. ribonucleic acid (RNA) is also a genetic material, but it is not as common as DNA. RNA is involved in the synthesis of proteins and in the transfer of genetic information from DNA to proteins.\n\nC. dinitronucleic acid (DNA) is not a correct answer, as it is simply a misspelling of DNA.\n\nD. protein is not a genetic material, but rather a building block of life. Proteins are made up of amino acids and are responsible for many functions in the body, such as building and repairing tissues, transporting substances, and helping the body to grow and develop.",
