This means that for every element a in A, there exists an element g(f(a)) in B such that g(f(a)) = a. This does not necessarily mean that g is injective, as g could be surjective but not injective. Therefore, the first statement is not necessarily true. Statement 2: The function g must necessarily be surjective. The function g is defined as g(f(a)) = a for all a \\in A. This means that for every element a in A, there exists an element g(f(a)) in B such that g(f(a)) = a. This means that g is surjective, as every element in B is the image of some element in A under g. Therefore, the second statement is necessarily true.\nThe answer is D.",
