Associativity: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) for all a, b, c in the set.\n2. Identity element: There exists an element 1 in the set such that for every element a in the set, the equation 1 * a = a * 1 = a holds.\n3. Inverse element: For every element a in the set, there exists an element b in the set such that a * b = b * a = 1.\n\nStatement 1 is false because the set {1,2, ..., n-1} is not a group under multiplication modulo n for any n > 1.\n\nStatement 2: There is an integer x such that 63x mod 100 = 1.\n\nTo check this statement, we can simply substitute x = 1 into the equation and see if it holds true:\n\n63 * 1 mod 100 = 63 mod 100 = 1\n\nSince the equation holds true, statement 2 is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
