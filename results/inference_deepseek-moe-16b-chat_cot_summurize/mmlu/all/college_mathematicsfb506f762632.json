Since x and y are real numbers, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, there are no critical points in the usual sense.\n\nHowever, we can still analyze the function at the endpoints of the domain. When x = 0, we have f(0, y) = y^3 + 3y. This function is increasing for y > 0 and decreasing for y < 0. Therefore, f(0, y) has a local maximum at y = 0.\n\nWhen y = 0, we have f(x, 0) = x^3 + 3x. This function is increasing for x > 0 and decreasing for x < 0. Therefore, f(x, 0) has a local maximum at x = 0.\n\nSince there are no critical points in the interior of the domain, we cannot determine if there exist distinct points P and Q such that f has a local maximum at P and at Q, a saddle point at P and at Q, a local maximum at P and a saddle point at Q, or a local minimum at P and a saddle point at Q.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
