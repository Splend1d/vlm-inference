While some protists are eukaryotic, not all of them are. For example, some protists, like the cyanobacteria, are prokaryotic.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true for all protists. While some protists are heterotrophic, others are autotrophic, and some protists do have cell walls, others do not. Therefore, the correct answer is B. They include the cyanobacteria.",
