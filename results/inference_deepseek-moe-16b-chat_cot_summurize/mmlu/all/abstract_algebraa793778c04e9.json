The unity of a ring is the identity element with respect to multiplication. Therefore, the unity of a subring is the identity element with respect to the ring operations defined in the subring. Since the unity of a ring is always the same, the statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Every field is an integral domain.\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two non-zero elements is always non-zero. A field is an integral domain in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Therefore, every field is an integral domain. This statement is also true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
