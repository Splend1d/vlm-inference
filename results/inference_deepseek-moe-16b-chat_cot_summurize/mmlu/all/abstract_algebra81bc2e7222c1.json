            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: If a finite group has order n then the group contains a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n.\n\nProof: Let G be a finite group of order n. By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element a in G divides n. Therefore, the divisors of n are 1 and n. By the definition of a subgroup, a subgroup H of G must have order dividing n. Thus, for every positive divisor d of n, there exists a subgroup of order d in G.\n\nStatement 2: If a belongs to a finite group then |a| divides |G|.\n\nProof: Let a be an element of a finite group G. By definition, the order of a, denoted |a|, is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of G. Since G is a finite group, the order of G is also a positive integer n. Therefore, |a| divides |G|.\n\nSince both statements are true, the answer is A.",
