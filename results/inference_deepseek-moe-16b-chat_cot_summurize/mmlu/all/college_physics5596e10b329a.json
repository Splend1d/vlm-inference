            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of linear polarizers and the interference of light.\n\nWhen unpolarized light is incident on a pair of linear polarizers, the intensity of the transmitted light is reduced by a factor of 1/2 due to the blocking of half of the light waves. This is because the transmission axis of each polarizer is perpendicular to the plane of the light waves, and the electric field vector of the light waves is perpendicular to the transmission axis.\n\nIn this problem, the transmission axes of the polarizers make an angle of 45\u00b0 with each other. This means that the electric field vector of the light waves is rotated by 45\u00b0 relative to the transmission axis of each polarizer. This rotation causes the electric field vector of the light waves to be partially blocked by each polarizer, reducing the intensity of the transmitted light.\n\nTo find the percentage of the incident intensity that is transmitted through both polarizers, we need to find the intensity of the transmitted light and divide it by the incident intensity.\n\nThe intensity of the transmitted light is reduced by a factor of 1/2, so the intensity of the transmitted light is 1/2 of the incident intensity. Therefore, the percentage of the incident intensity that is transmitted through both polarizers is 1/2 * 100% = 50%.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 50%.",
