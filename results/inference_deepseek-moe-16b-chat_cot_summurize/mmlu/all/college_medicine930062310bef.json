            "content": " The correct answer is C. Negative feedback loop of cortisol.\n\nThe hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the brain work together to regulate the body's stress response. When the hypothalamus detects a stressful situation, it releases corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) into the bloodstream. CRF travels to the pituitary gland, which then releases another hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH travels to the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys.\n\nIn the adrenal glands, ACTH stimulates the production and release of cortisol, the body's main stress hormone. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress by increasing blood sugar, suppressing the immune system, and reducing inflammation.\n\nHowever, if the body is exposed to stress for a prolonged period, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland can become fatigued. This can lead to a decrease in the release of CRF and ACTH, which in turn can lead to a decrease in cortisol production. This is known as the negative feedback loop of cortisol.\n\nSo, the negative feedback loop of cortisol is the mechanism that eventually suppresses the body's stress response by regulating the production and release of cortisol.",
