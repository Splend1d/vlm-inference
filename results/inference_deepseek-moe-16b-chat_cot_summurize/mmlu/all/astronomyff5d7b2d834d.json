This is because the human eye can resolve details up to a certain angular separation, known as the angular resolution. If the angular separation between two stars is smaller than this resolution, the stars will appear as a single point of light, as if they are touching. This is similar to how two points on a distant horizon appear to merge into a single point of light when viewed from a higher vantage point.",
