A convex 10-gon is a shape with 10 sides that are all pointing in the same direction.\n\nIn a convex 10-gon, there are 10 acute angles. An acute angle is an angle that measures less than 90 degrees. In a convex 10-gon, each interior angle measures less than 180 degrees, which is equivalent to 90 degrees. Therefore, each interior angle in a convex 10-gon is acute.\n\nSince there are 10 interior angles in a convex 10-gon, the maximum number of acute angles in a convex 10-gon is 10.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4.",
