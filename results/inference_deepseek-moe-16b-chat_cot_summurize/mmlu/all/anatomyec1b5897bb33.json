Pupillary constriction.\n\nExplanation: The cervical sympathetic chain is a bundle of nerves that run from the base of the skull down to the upper chest. Damage to this chain can cause a condition called Horner's syndrome, which affects the autonomic nervous system. The symptoms of Horner's syndrome include pupillary constriction, which is the narrowing of the pupil in response to light. Pupillary constriction is the only symptom listed that is specific to Horner's syndrome and is caused by damage to the cervical sympathetic chain.",
