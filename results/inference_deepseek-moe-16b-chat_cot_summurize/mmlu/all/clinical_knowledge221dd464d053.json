Testosterone is a hormone that is produced naturally in the human body, primarily in males, and plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testes and prostate, as well as in the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle mass, body hair, and a deeper voice.\n\nSynthetic steroids are man-made versions of testosterone that are designed to have similar effects on the body. They are often used by athletes and bodybuilders to increase muscle mass, strength, and endurance, as well as to improve recovery time after workouts. However, the use of synthetic steroids is banned in many sports and can have serious side effects, including liver damage, heart problems, and aggression.",
