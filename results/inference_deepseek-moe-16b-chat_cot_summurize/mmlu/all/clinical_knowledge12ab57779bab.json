            "content": " The correct answer is C. Vitamin D is secreted by the parathyroid glands.\n\nCalcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that helps regulate calcium levels in the body. It does not cause a rise in plasma calcium.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), which can lead to high levels of calcium in the blood. This can cause symptoms such as bone pain, kidney stones, and fatigue.\n\nOliguria is a condition where there is a decreased amount of urine produced, usually less than 400 mL per day. It can be a symptom of many conditions, including kidney disease, dehydration, and certain medications. It is not a symptom of hypercalcaemia.\n\nVitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. It is produced in the skin in response to sunlight and is then metabolized in the liver and kidneys to produce active forms that help regulate calcium and phosphorus levels in the body. The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps regulate calcium levels in the body.",
