            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the number of neutrons to reach half a billion.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\nInitial number of neutrons: 1 billion\nNumber of neutrons doubling each minute: 2\nTime it takes for the number of neutrons to reach half a billion: t minutes\n\nWe can set up the equation as follows:\n\nInitial number of neutrons * (2^(t/10)) = Half a billion\n\nLet's substitute the given values into the equation:\n\n1 billion * (2^(t/10)) = 0.5 billion\n\nTo solve for t, we can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n\nlog(1 billion * (2^(t/10))) = log(0.5 billion)\n\nUsing the logarithm property, we can bring the 1 billion outside of the logarithm:\n\nlog(1 billion) + log(2^(t/10)) = log(0.5 billion)\n\nNow, we can use the logarithm property again to bring the 1 billion inside of the logarithm:\n\nlog(1 billion) + (t/10) * log(2) = log(0.5 billion)\n\nNow, we can solve for t:\n\nt/10 = log(0.5 billion) / log(2)\n\nt = 10 * log(0.5 billion) / log(2)\n\nt \u2248 10 * log(0.5) / log(2)\n\nt \u2248 10 * 0.69897 / 0.30103\n\nt \u2248 20.0001 minutes\n\nSo, the number of neutrons reached half a billion after 20 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 2 minutes.",
