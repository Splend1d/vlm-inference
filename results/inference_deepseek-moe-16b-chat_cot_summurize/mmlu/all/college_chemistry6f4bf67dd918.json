            "content": " Planck's quantum theory was able to explain the blackbody radiation curves and the emission spectra of diatomic molecules. The theory proposed that energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete, quantized amounts, which is now known as photons. This explains why the intensity of radiation at different frequencies follows a specific pattern, as observed in blackbody radiation curves. Additionally, the emission spectra of diatomic molecules can be explained by the quantization of energy levels within the molecule, which is also a consequence of Planck's theory.\n\nHowever, Planck's theory did not explain electron diffraction patterns or temperature dependence of reaction rates. Electron diffraction patterns are a result of the wave-like nature of electrons, which is not directly related to Planck's theory. Similarly, the temperature dependence of reaction rates is a result of the kinetic theory of gases, which is not directly related to Planck's theory either.",
