            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: If a and b are elements of a group and a is not equal to b, then a^2 is not equal to b^2.\n\nIn a group, the operation is closed, meaning that for every element a in the group, there exists an element b in the group such that a * b = b * a = e, where e is the identity element. The operation is also associative, meaning that for every elements a, b, and c in the group, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).\n\nNow, let's consider a and b, which are elements of a group. If a is not equal to b, then a * b = b * a = e. Therefore, a^2 = (a * b) * b = b * b = e, and b^2 = (b * a) * a = a * a = e. So, a^2 is equal to b^2, and statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: The set of rotations in a dihedral group forms a cyclic subgroup.\n\nA dihedral group is a group of symmetries of a polygon, which includes rotations and reflections. The set of rotations in a dihedral group forms a subgroup, but it is not necessarily a cyclic subgroup. For example, consider a regular octagon. The set of rotations in the dihedral group of an octagon forms a subgroup, but it is not a cyclic subgroup because it does not contain an element of order 8.\n\nTherefore, statement 2 is also false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
