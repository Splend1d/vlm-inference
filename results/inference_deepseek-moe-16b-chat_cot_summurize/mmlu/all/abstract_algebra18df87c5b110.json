            "content": " Let's analyze these statements one by one.\n\nStatement 1: A homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone.\n\nA homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation. A kernel of a homomorphism is the set of elements in the domain that are mapped to the identity element in the codomain. If a homomorphism is one to one, then the kernel must consist of the identity element alone. This is because if there were any other elements in the kernel, the homomorphism would not be one to one.\n\nStatement 2: The image of a group of 6 elements under some homomorphism may have 4 elements.\n\nThe image of a group under a homomorphism is the set of all elements in the codomain that are mapped to by the elements in the domain. If a group has 6 elements, then the image of the group under a homomorphism could have 4 elements if the homomorphism maps 2 of the 6 elements in the domain to the identity element in the codomain.\n\nSo, both statements are true.\nThe answer is A.",
