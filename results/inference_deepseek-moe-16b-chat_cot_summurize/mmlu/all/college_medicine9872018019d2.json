            "content": " The expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring of an affected male and a normal female with MERRF can be predicted by considering the inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited, meaning that it is passed down from the mother to her offspring. Since the mother is normal, the mtDNA she passes on to her offspring will be normal.\n\nThe affected male, however, has a mutation in his mtDNA. This mutation impairs protein synthesis, oxygen consumption, and energy production. Since the mutation is only present in the mtDNA of the affected male, the mtDNA passed on to his offspring will also be affected.\n\nWhen the affected male and a normal female reproduce, the offspring will inherit one set of mtDNA from the mother and one set of mtDNA from the affected father. Since the mtDNA from the father is affected, the offspring will also have the mutation and will be affected by MERRF.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring will be:\n\n* Half of the offspring will be affected (since the mutation is present in one set of mtDNA)\n* Half of the affected offspring will be males (since the mutation is present in one set of mtDNA)\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Half of males and half of females will be affected.",
