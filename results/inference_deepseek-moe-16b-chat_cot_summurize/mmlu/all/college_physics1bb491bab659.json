            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the interference between the light reflected from the oil-water interface and the light transmitted through the oil-water interface.\n\nWhen light is incident on the interface between two media with different indices of refraction, it can be partially transmitted and partially reflected. The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, which is known as the law of reflection.\n\nIn this case, the light is incident on the interface between air (index of refraction 1) and the oil-water interface (index of refraction 1.33). The angle of incidence is 48.78 degrees. According to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection is also 48.78 degrees.\n\nThe light is then transmitted through the oil-water interface. The index of refraction of the oil is 1.5, and the thickness of the oil layer is 500 nm. The angle of refraction is given by Snell's Law:\n\nn1 * sin(i1) = n2 * sin(r)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the indices of refraction of the two media, i1 is the angle of incidence, and r is the angle of refraction.\n\nn1 = 1, n2 = 1.5, i1 = 48.78 degrees\n\nr = sin(48.78) = 0.791\n\nThe light is then transmitted through the oil layer with an angle of refraction of 0.791 degrees.\n\nThe light is then incident on the oil-water interface again. The angle of incidence is 48.78 degrees, and the angle of reflection is 48.78 degrees. The light is partially transmitted and partially reflected.\n\nThe interference between the transmitted light and the reflected light creates a series of constructive and destructive interference patterns. The most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that is most strongly reflected back into the air, which is the wavelength that creates the most destructive interference with the transmitted light.\n\nThe most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that creates the most destructive interference with the transmitted light. The destructive interference occurs when the path difference between the transmitted light and the reflected light is an integer multiple of the wavelength.\n\nThe destructive interference occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength. The path difference is given by:\n\npath difference = (n2 - n1) * d\n\nwhere d is the thickness of the oil layer.\n\npath difference = (1.5 - 1) * 0.5 = 0.5\n\nThe most strongly reflected wavelength is the one that creates the most destructive interference with the transmitted light. The destructive interference occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength.
