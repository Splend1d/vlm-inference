A keloid is a firm mass of scar tissue. Keloids are raised, firm, and rubbery scars that can grow beyond the original wound or incision site. They are more common in people with dark skin, such as those of African, Hispanic, or Asian descent. Keloids can be itchy and uncomfortable, and they can also be cosmetically unappealing. Treatment options for keloids include corticosteroid injections, cryotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical removal.",
