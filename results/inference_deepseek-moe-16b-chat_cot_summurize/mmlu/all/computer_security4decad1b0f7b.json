An integer overflow occurs when an integer expression's result \"wraps around\"; instead of creating a very large number, a very small (or negative) number ends up getting created.\n\nWhen an integer overflow occurs, the result of the expression is not a large number, but rather a small or negative number. This is because the maximum value that can be represented by an integer is determined by the number of bits used to store the integer. For example, an 8-bit integer can represent values from 0 to 255, but if you try to add 256 to a value that is less than 256, the result will be negative.\n\nOption B is incorrect because an integer is not used as a pointer in most programming languages. Option C is also incorrect because an integer is not used to access a buffer outside of the buffer's bounds. Option D is incorrect because there is always enough space to hold integers in a program, as long as the program is designed to handle large numbers.",
