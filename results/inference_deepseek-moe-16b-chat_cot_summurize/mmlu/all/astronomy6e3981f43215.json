When an object is taken to the moon, its weight is reduced to one-sixth of its weight on Earth because the moon's gravity is much weaker than Earth's.\n\nSo, if you have five pounds of bricks on Earth, it will weigh only one pound on the moon. However, if you have a kilogram of feathers on Earth, it will weigh the same on the moon, as the weight is determined by the mass, not the weight.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Five pounds of bricks as measured on Earth.",
