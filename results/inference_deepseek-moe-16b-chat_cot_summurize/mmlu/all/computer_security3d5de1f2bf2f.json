It works by making small mutations to the target program to induce faults.\n\nMutation-based fuzzing is a technique used in software testing to find bugs in a program by generating random inputs and applying small changes to them. The changes are called mutations, and they are made to the input data, control flow, or data structures of the program. The goal is to induce faults in the program, which can then be identified and fixed.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. This option is incorrect because mutation-based fuzzing does not generate each different input by modifying a prior input. Instead, it generates random inputs and applies small mutations to them.\n\nC. This option is incorrect because mutation-based fuzzing does not require each input to be a mutation that follows a given grammar. Instead, it generates random inputs and applies small mutations to them.\n\nD. This option is incorrect because mutation-based fuzzing can be used for both file-based and network-based fuzzing.",
