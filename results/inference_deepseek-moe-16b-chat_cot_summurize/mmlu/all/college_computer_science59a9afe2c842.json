Its purpose is to map an IP address to a hardware (MAC) address on a local network. This is necessary because IP addresses are used for routing network traffic, while MAC addresses are used for communication between devices on the same network.\n\nWhen a device on a local network wants to send a packet of data to another device, it needs to know the MAC address of the destination device. The ARP protocol is used to find this MAC address by sending a broadcast message to the network asking for the MAC address associated with a given IP address.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. To determine the hardware address of a given host name.",
