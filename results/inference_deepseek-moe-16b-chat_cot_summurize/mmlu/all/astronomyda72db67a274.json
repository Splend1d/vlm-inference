            "content": " The correct answer is B. The atmosphere absorbs mostly blue light.\n\nThe color of the sky is due to the absorption and scattering of light by the atmosphere. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it is scattered in all directions by air molecules. The blue light is scattered more than other colors because it is smaller and has a shorter wavelength than other colors. This is why the sky appears blue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Sun mainly emits white light, which contains all colors of the visible spectrum. The color of the Sun's light depends on the temperature of the Sun's surface, not the color it emits.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the scattering of light by molecules is not related to the color of the light. The scattering of light is determined by the size and shape of the molecules and the wavelength of the light.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the scattering of light is not related to the color of the light. The scattering of light is determined by the size and shape of the molecules and the wavelength of the light.",
