            "content": " De Broglie hypothesized that the linear momentum and wavelength of a free massive particle are related by the Planck's constant. This relationship is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, and it states that for a free massive particle, the product of its momentum and wavelength is equal to a constant value, which is Planck's constant (h) divided by 2\u03c0.\n\nThe other options are not related to the de Broglie hypothesis. Planck's constant is the constant that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency, Boltzmann's constant is related to the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas, and the Rydberg constant is related to the energy of an electron transitioning between energy levels in an atom. The speed of light is a constant that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency, but it is not related to the de Broglie hypothesis.",
