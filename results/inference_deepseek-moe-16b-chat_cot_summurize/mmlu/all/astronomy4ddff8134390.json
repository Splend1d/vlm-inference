Methane does not condense into ice in the warmer atmospheric temperatures of Jupiter and Saturn.\nB. Methane did not exist in the solar nebula at the radii of Jupiter and Saturn when the planets formed.\nC. The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\nD. Methane reacts with the abundant ammonia clouds in Jupiter and Saturn and is removed from the atmosphere.\n",

The relatively slow rotation of Uranus and Neptune allows methane to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere and condense into clouds.\n\nUranus and Neptune have blue methane clouds because they have slower rotation rates compared to Jupiter and Saturn. This slower rotation allows the methane gas to migrate to higher levels in the atmosphere, where it can condense into clouds. The methane gas is more likely to remain in the lower atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn due to the faster rotation rates, which prevents the methane from reaching the higher levels where it can condense into clouds.",
