            "content": " The correct answer is B. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla.\n\nThe maxilla is the largest of the four bones that make up the upper jaw, and it plays a crucial role in the formation of the face. The growth and development of the maxilla is a complex process that involves several factors, including genetics, nutrition, and hormonal influences.\n\nA. Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty: This statement is incorrect. Pneumatisation is the process by which air-filled spaces develop within bones, and it is a normal part of postnatal growth in the maxilla. The maxillary sinus is the largest of these air-filled spaces, and it continues to enlarge throughout life.\n\nB. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity: This statement is also incorrect. The maxillary tuberosity is a small bump on the upper jaw that serves as an attachment site for certain muscles. It does not play a role in the eruption of permanent molars.\n\nC. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla: This statement is correct. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures are the fibrous joints between the maxilla and the zygoma (one of the bones of the cheek). These sutures contribute to the growth and development of the maxilla by allowing the two bones to move relative to each other. This movement creates space for the eruption of the permanent teeth and contributes to the overall height and length of the maxilla.\n\nD. The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally: This statement is incorrect. The intermaxillary suture is the fibrous joint between the maxilla and the palatine bone (one of the bones of the palate). It does not close postnatally. In fact, it continues to grow and change throughout life, as the maxilla and the palate continue to grow and develop.",
