            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, given the information provided.\n\nLet's break down the information given:\n\n- The size of each data packet is 1,000 bytes.\n- The network can carry 1,000 packets per second.\n- The CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total data that can be sent per second:\n\n1,000 packets/second * 1,000 bytes/packet = 1,000,000 bytes/second\n\nNext, let's calculate the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another:\n\n1,000,000 bytes/second / 1,000 packets/second = 1,000 bytes/packet\n\nSince the CPU time required to execute the network protocol to send one packet is 10 milliseconds, we need to convert this to seconds:\n\n10 milliseconds * (1 second / 1,000 milliseconds) = 0.001 seconds\n\nNow, let's calculate the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another, accounting for the CPU time:\n\n1,000 bytes/packet / 0.001 seconds/packet = 10,000 bytes/second\n\nTherefore, the maximum rate at which one computer can send data to another is approximately 10,000 bytes/second.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nA. 10,000 bytes/second",
