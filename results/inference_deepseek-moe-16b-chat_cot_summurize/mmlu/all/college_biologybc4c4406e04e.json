            "content": " A plant that grows along a trellis exhibits positive phototropism. Phototropism is the growth of a plant in response to the direction and intensity of light. When a plant is exposed to light, it will grow towards the source of light, which is typically upwards. This is because the plant's stem contains a hormone called auxin, which is responsible for the growth and development of the plant. Auxin is concentrated at the tip of the plant and causes the cells in the stem to divide and elongate, causing the plant to grow upwards.\n\nNegative phototropism is the opposite of positive phototropism, where a plant grows away from the light source. This can occur when a plant is exposed to a light source that is too intense, causing the auxin to be concentrated at the shaded side of the plant, causing the plant to grow away from the light source.\n\nThigmotropism is the growth of a plant in response to touch or contact with a surface. Gravitropism is the growth of a plant in response to gravity. Neither of these responses are exhibited by a plant that grows along a trellis.",
