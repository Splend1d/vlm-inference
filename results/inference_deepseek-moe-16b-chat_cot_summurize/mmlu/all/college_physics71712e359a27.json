            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of energy principle. When an object rolls down an inclined plane without slipping, the total mechanical energy is conserved. The initial kinetic energy is converted into both rotational and translational kinetic energy.\n\nLet's denote the initial kinetic energy of the disk as KE_initial, the rotational kinetic energy as KE_rot, and the translational kinetic energy as KE_trans. Since the disk starts from rest, the initial translational kinetic energy is 0.\n\nKE_initial = KE_rot + KE_trans\n\nAfter some time, the rotational kinetic energy is given by:\n\nKE_rot = I * w^2 / 2\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia of the disk and w is the angular velocity.\n\nThe moment of inertia of a solid disk is given by:\n\nI = (1/2) * M * R^2\n\nwhere M is the mass of the disk and R is the radius of the disk.\n\nThe angular velocity can be calculated as:\n\nw = (v / R)\n\nwhere v is the linear velocity of the disk.\n\nThe linear velocity of the disk can be calculated as:\n\nv = R * w\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions into the equation for the rotational kinetic energy:\n\nKE_rot = (1/2) * M * R^2 * (R * w)^2 / 2\n\nSince the total mechanical energy is conserved, we can write:\n\nKE_initial = KE_rot + KE_trans\n\nSubstituting the expressions for KE_rot and KE_trans, we get:\n\n(1/2) * M * R^2 * (R * w)^2 / 2 + KE_trans = (1/2) * M * R^2 * (v^2 / R^2)\n\nSince the disk starts from rest, the initial translational kinetic energy is 0, so KE_trans = 0. Therefore, we have:\n\n(1/2) * M * R^2 * (R * w)^2 / 2 = (1/2) * M * R^2 * (v^2 / R^2)\n\nDividing both sides by (1/2) * M * R^2, we get:\n\n(R * w)^2 = v^2\n\nThis equation tells us that the square of the angular velocity is equal to the square of the linear velocity. Since the angular velocity is the ratio of the linear velocity to the radius of the disk, we can write:\n\nw = v / R\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for the square of the angular velocity, we get:\n\n(v / R)^2 = v^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nv / R = \u00b1 sqrt(v^2 / R^2)\n\nSince v is the linear velocity of the disk, it must be positive. Therefore, we have:\n\nv / R = sqrt(v^2 / R^2)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nv^2 / R^2 = v^2 / R^2\n\nThis equation tells us that the square of the linear velocity is equal to the square of the radius. Since the linear velocity is the product of the angular velocity and the radius, we can write:\n\nv = R * w\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for the square of the linear velocity, we get:\n\nR^2 * w^2 = v^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nR * w = sqrt(v^2)\n\nSubstituting the expression for the square of the angular velocity, we get:\n\nR * w = sqrt(v^2 / R^2)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nR^2 * w^2 = v^2 / R^2\n\nThis equation tells us that the square of the angular velocity is equal to the square of the linear velocity divided by the square of the radius. Since the square of the angular velocity is equal to the square of the linear velocity divided by the square of the radius, we can write:\n\nw^2 = v^2 / R^2\n\nSubstituting the expression for the square of the linear velocity, we get:\n\nw^2 = (v / R)^2\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\nw = v / R\n\nSubstituting the expression for the square of the angular velocity, we get:\n\nw = sqrt(v^2 / R^2)\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n(v / R)^2 = (v^2 / R^",
