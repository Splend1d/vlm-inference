            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of work done in physics. Work done is defined as the force applied multiplied by the distance over which the force is applied. In this case, the spring is stretched a certain distance, and the work done to stretch it is equal to the force constant of the spring multiplied by the distance.\n\nLet's denote the force constant of the first spring as k, and the distance it is stretched as x. The work done to stretch the first spring is then kx.\n\nThe problem states that it takes twice as much work to stretch a second spring by half this distance. This means that the force constant of the second spring is 2k, and the distance it is stretched is x/2. The work done to stretch the second spring is then 2k(x/2) = kx.\n\nSince the work done to stretch both springs is equal, we can set up the equation:\n\nkx = kx/2\n\nTo solve for k, we can divide both sides of the equation by x:\n\nk = k/2\n\nSince k cannot be equal to 0 (otherwise the spring would not be able to stretch), we can divide both sides of the equation by k:\n\n1 = 1/2\n\nThis is not true, so the only possible solution is that k = 2k. Therefore, the force constant of the second spring is 2k, which corresponds to option B.",
