It is a very large group of galaxies that is centered on the Great Attractor, which is a region in space where a lot of matter is attracting other matter. The Milky Way is one of about 100 galaxies that are part of Laniakea.\n\nThe other options, A. Virgo, C. Sculptor, and D. Boetle, are not the names of superclusters.
