The terminal velocity of a falling object is the highest velocity it can achieve before air resistance becomes significant enough to balance the gravitational force acting upon it.\n\nIn this case, the flying squirrel is falling vertically at its terminal velocity, which is 0.8 N. Therefore, the air drag on the flying squirrel is 0.8 N.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 0.8 N.",
