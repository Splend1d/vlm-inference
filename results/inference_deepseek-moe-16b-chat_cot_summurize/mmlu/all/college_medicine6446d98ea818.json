In this case, the mutation is changing a \"C\" to a \"T\". The resulting DNA sequence would be 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATTCCATG \u2013 3\u2019.\n\nA deletion occurs when one or more nucleotides in the DNA sequence are removed. In this case, the deletion is removing the nucleotides \"CT\" from the original sequence. The resulting DNA sequence would be 5\u2019 \u2013 GGATCCATG \u2013 3\u2019.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 5\u2019 \u2013 GCATCCTCATG \u2013 3\u2019.",
