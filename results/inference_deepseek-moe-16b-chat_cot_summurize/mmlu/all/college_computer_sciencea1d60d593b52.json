The access matrix approach is a simple and straightforward method for managing access control, but it is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. For example, it cannot handle situations where multiple resources need to be accessed simultaneously, or where different users have different levels of access to different resources.\n\nC. deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable. The access matrix approach relies on a set of rules that determine whether a process has access to a resource. However, these rules can be complex and difficult to understand, and it is not always clear whether a particular process has access to a particular resource. In some cases, it may be impossible to determine whether a process has access to a resource, making the access matrix approach unworkable in these situations.\n\nD. there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself. The access matrix approach relies on a fixed access matrix that is used to determine access rights for all processes. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to change the access matrix in order to reflect changes in the system. Unfortunately, the access matrix approach does not provide a mechanism for changing the access matrix, making it difficult to adapt to changing system requirements.",
