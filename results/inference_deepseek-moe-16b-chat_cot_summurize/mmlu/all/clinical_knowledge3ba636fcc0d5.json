Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis.\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease that affects some people with psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches. The disease can affect any joint in the body, including the spine, and can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true:\n\nA. The absence of plaques of psoriasis does not exclude the diagnosis. Psoriatic arthritis can occur in people who do not have visible plaques of psoriasis.\n\nB. There is no specific blood marker for psoriatic arthritis. The diagnosis is usually made based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, as well as the results of physical examination and imaging tests.\n\nC. Tophi, which are chalky deposits of uric acid, can sometimes be seen over affected joints in people with psoriatic arthritis, but they are not always present.",
