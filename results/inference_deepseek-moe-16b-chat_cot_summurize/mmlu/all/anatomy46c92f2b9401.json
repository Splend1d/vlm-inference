All of the above.\n\nThe supraorbital foramen, infraorbital foramen, and mental foramen are all bony structures that can be palpated in a live patient.\n\nThe supraorbital foramen is located in the frontal bone, just above the eye. It is the largest foramen in the skull and allows the supraorbital artery and nerve to pass through.\n\nThe infraorbital foramen is located in the maxillary bone, just below the eye. It is smaller than the supraorbital foramen and allows the infraorbital artery and nerve to pass through.\n\nThe mental foramen is located in the mandible, just in front of the ear. It is the largest foramen in the jaw and allows the mental nerve to pass through.\n\nTherefore, all of these bony structures can be palpated in a live patient.",
