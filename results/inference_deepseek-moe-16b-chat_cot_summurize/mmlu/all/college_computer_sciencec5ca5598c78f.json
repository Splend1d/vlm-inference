In this case, the language is generated by the grammar ww, where w and w are strings of 0's and 1's. This is a context-free language because it can be generated by a context-free grammar.\n\nHowever, a language is considered regular if it can be recognized by a finite state automaton (such as a pushdown automaton). In this case, the language is not regular because it cannot be recognized by any pushdown automaton.\n\nTherefore, the language {ww | w in (0 + 1)*} is context-free, but not regular.",
