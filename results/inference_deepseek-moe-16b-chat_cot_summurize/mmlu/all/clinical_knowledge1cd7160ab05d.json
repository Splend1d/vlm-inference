This can happen when the allele is present in the presence of another allele that masks its expression. For example, in the case of the ABO blood group system, the A allele is dominant to the O allele, but the A allele is masked by the presence of the B allele, which is also present in the ABO blood group system. The B allele is not expressed in the phenotype of the organism, but the A allele is expressed. Therefore, the B allele is a masked allele.",
