Their rapid rotation flings the mass near the equator outward.\n\nJovian planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, have a \"squashed\" appearance due to their rapid rotation. This is because the rotation of the planet causes the mass near the equator to be flung outward, creating a bulge. This is in contrast to terrestrial planets, which do not have this effect because they do not rotate as rapidly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the presence of moons and rings does not affect the mass distribution around the equator of a planet.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the mass of a planet does not necessarily correlate with the appearance of its equator.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the internal heat sources of a planet do not affect its equatorial bulge.",
