Moderate sexual size dimorphism: This refers to the difference in size between males and females of the same species. However, this characteristic is not directly related to the litter size of rodents.\n\nB. High parental investment: This refers to the amount of resources and energy that parents invest in their offspring. While this can affect the litter size, it is not directly related to the species of pine that the rodents eat.\n\nC. Precocial young: This refers to young animals that are born with well-developed senses and mobility, allowing them to leave the nest soon after birth. This characteristic is not directly related to the litter size of rodents.\n\nD. Frequent extrapair matings: This refers to instances where an individual mates with a partner outside of their pair-bond. This characteristic is not directly related to the litter size of rodents.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most likely characteristic that is exhibited by the rodents is option B. High parental investment, as the litter size is small, which could be due to the parents investing more resources in each offspring to ensure their survival.",
