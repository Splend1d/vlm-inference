An intravenous cannula should never be used for both drug and fluid administration.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. IV administration of a drug will not delay its action. The time it takes for a drug to take effect depends on the drug itself, not the method of administration.\n\nB. IV administration carries a low risk of bacteraemia. This is not true. While the risk of bacteraemia is low with proper technique, it is not negligible.\n\nC. IV administration allows titration of a drug with its desired effect. This is true. IV administration allows for precise control of drug administration, allowing for titration of the drug to achieve the desired effect.",
