Consider a cycle graph with 4 vertices (C4). The sum of the degrees of all vertices in this graph is 2 * 4 = 8, which is not even. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nII. |E| \u2265 |V| \u2212 1\nThis statement is true for all connected, undirected graphs. In a connected graph, there must be at least one edge between every pair of vertices. Therefore, the number of edges (|E|) must be at least equal to the number of vertices (|V|).\n\nIII. G has at least one vertex with degree 1.\nThis statement is true for all connected, undirected graphs. In a connected graph, there must be at least one vertex with a degree of 1, as each vertex must be connected to at least one other vertex.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II.",
