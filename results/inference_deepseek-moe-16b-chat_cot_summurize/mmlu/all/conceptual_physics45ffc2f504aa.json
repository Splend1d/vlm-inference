Ejected neutrons.\n\nIn a fission reactor, when a heavy nucleus like uranium-235 or plutonium-239 absorbs a neutron, it undergoes fission, which means it splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat, light, and radiation. This process also produces more neutrons, which can then be absorbed by other nuclei, causing more fission reactions and a chain reaction. The ejected neutrons are what cause the chain reactions in a fission reactor.",
