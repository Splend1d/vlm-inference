            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for work, which is W = F * d, where W is the work done, F is the force applied, and d is the distance traveled.\n\nIn this case, the elevator falls 100 m starting from rest, and the emergency brakes stop it. The force applied by the brakes is the weight of the elevator, which is 1,000 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 9,810 N (Newtons).\n\nThe heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is equal to the work done by the brakes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nW = F * d\n\n9,810 N * 100 m = Q\n\nQ = 981,000 J\n\nTherefore, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is 981,000 J, which corresponds to option D.",
