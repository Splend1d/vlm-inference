The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, and it provides sensory innervation to the skin and mucous membranes of the upper lip, the upper teeth, and the nasal cavity.\n\nWhen the infraorbital nerve block is performed successfully, the patient will experience numbness or loss of sensation in the areas mentioned above. This can be useful in a variety of dental procedures, such as tooth extractions, root canals, and other procedures that require local anaesthesia.\n\nIt is important to note that the infraorbital nerve block does not provide anaesthesia to the anterior hard palate, which is the front part of the roof of the mouth. This is because the infraorbital nerve does not supply the hard palate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. maxillary anterior teeth, their labial gingivae, the upper lip and anterior hard palate.",
