It is responsible for producing saliva that aids in digestion. An enlarged submandibular salivary gland can be felt intraorally, as it is located in the floor of the mouth, and extraorally, as it can be felt in front of the angle of the jaw. Therefore, the correct answer is C. The submandibular salivary gland can be palpable both intra- and extraorally.",
