Determine who the user is.\n\nAuthorization is a process that determines who or what entity is allowed to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. It aims to accomplish the task of identifying the user or entity that is requesting access to the resource or attempting to perform the action.\n\nOption A, Restricting what operations/data the user can access, is a part of the authorization process, but it is not the main goal. The main goal is to determine who the user is.\n\nOption B, Determining if the user is an attacker, is not the main goal of authorization. While it is important to prevent unauthorized access, the main goal of authorization is to identify the user, not to determine if they are an attacker.\n\nOption C, Flagging the user if he/she misbehaves, is not the main goal of authorization. While it is important to enforce security policies, the main goal of authorization is to identify the user, not to flag them if they misbehave.",
