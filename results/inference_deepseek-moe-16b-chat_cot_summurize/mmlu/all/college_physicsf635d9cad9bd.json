            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect, which states that the frequency of a wave (or in this case, light) is shifted depending on the relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. In this case, the quasar 3C9 is moving towards us (or we are moving away from it), causing the light to be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum.\n\nThe formula for the Doppler effect is:\n\nv = f_observed * (c - f_observed) / (2 * c)\n\nwhere v is the relative velocity between the source and the observer, f_observed is the observed frequency, and c is the speed of light.\n\nWe are given that the observed wavelength of the hydrogen lines in the quasar's spectrum is three times as long as that in a laboratory on Earth. This means that the observed frequency of the hydrogen lines in the quasar's spectrum is three times lower than that in a laboratory on Earth.\n\nLet's denote the observed frequency in the laboratory on Earth as f_lab, and the observed frequency in the quasar's spectrum as f_quasar. Then, we have:\n\nf_quasar = 3 * f_lab\n\nNow, we can use the Doppler effect formula to find the relative velocity between the quasar and the Earth:\n\nv = f_quasar * (c - f_quasar) / (2 * c)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (c - (3 * f_lab)) / (2 * c)\n\nWe can simplify this equation by canceling out the common factor of c:\n\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 - 3 * f_lab) / (2)\nv = (3 * f_lab) * (1 -",
