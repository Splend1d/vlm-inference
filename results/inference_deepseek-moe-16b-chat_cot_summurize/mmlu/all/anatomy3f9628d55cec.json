It is located in the dorsal (back) region of the vertebral column, which is why it is also referred to as the vertebral canal. The spinal canal is formed by the vertebral bodies of the spinal column, which are the bony structures that make up the spinal column. The spinal canal is surrounded by a series of bony structures called the vertebral arches, which help to protect the spinal cord and the spinal canal. The spinal canal is also surrounded by a series of ligaments, which help to provide stability to the spinal column.",
