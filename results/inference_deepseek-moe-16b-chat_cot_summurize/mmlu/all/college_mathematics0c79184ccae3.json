We can rewrite this as x + y > 1/2.\n\nNext, let's consider the region described by the inequality |x| + |y| < 1. We can rewrite this as -1/2 < x + y < 1/2.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1, given that the point (x, y) is chosen randomly within the region described by the inequality |x| + |y| < 1.\n\nWe can see that the region described by the inequality x + y > 1/2 is a subset of the region described by the inequality |x| + |y| < 1. Therefore, the probability that 2(x + y) > 1 is the same as the probability that x + y > 1/2.\n\nSince the region described by the inequality x + y > 1/2 is a subset of the region described by the inequality |x| + |y| < 1, the probability that 2(x + y) > 1 is greater than or equal to the probability that x + y > 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the probability that 2(x + y) > 1 is greater than or equal to 1/2.\n\nSince the probability cannot be greater than 1, the probability that 2(x + y) > 1 is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
