The equation \u0394H = \u0394U + P\u0394V expresses the change in enthalpy (H) of a system undergoing a constant pressure process.\n\nThe enthalpy of a system is the sum of its internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. When the pressure and volume change, the change in enthalpy is equal to the change in internal energy plus the product of the change in pressure and volume.\n\nTherefore, the equation \u0394H = \u0394U + P\u0394V is applicable for constant pressure processes.",
