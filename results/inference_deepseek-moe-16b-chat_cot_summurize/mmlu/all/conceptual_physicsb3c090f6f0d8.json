            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the process of alpha decay and beta decay in nuclear physics.\n\nAlpha decay is a process in which a heavy nucleus emits an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. This process changes the atomic number of the nucleus by 2, as two protons are added to the nucleus.\n\nBeta decay is a process in which a nucleus emits an electron or a positron. This process does not change the atomic number of the nucleus.\n\nIn this problem, an element emits 1 alpha particle and its products emit 2 beta particles. This means that the original element must have undergone alpha decay, which changed its atomic number by 2. Therefore, the resulting element must have an atomic number that is 2 less than the original element.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. minus 2.",
