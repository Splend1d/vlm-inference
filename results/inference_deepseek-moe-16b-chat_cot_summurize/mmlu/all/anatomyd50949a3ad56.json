The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity. It plays a crucial role in respiration by contracting and expanding to facilitate the exchange of air between the two cavities. The phrenic nerves are responsible for the contraction of the diaphragm during inhalation.\n\nThe diaphragm, parietal pleura, and pericardium are the structures that the phrenic nerves innervate. The parietal pleura is the outer layer of the pleural membrane that lines the thoracic cavity, while the pericardium is a double-layered sac that surrounds and protects the heart. The phrenic nerves do not innervate the intercostals muscles, as they are responsible for the movement of the ribcage during respiration, not the diaphragm.",
