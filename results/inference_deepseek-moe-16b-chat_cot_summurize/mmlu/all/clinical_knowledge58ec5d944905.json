            "content": " The hormone primarily responsible for fluid regulation is Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. ADH is produced in the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. It helps to regulate the balance of water in the body by controlling the amount of water reabsorbed by the kidneys. When ADH levels are high, the kidneys retain more water, leading to increased blood volume and blood pressure. Conversely, when ADH levels are low, the kidneys excrete more water, leading to decreased blood volume and blood pressure. This process helps to maintain proper fluid balance in the body.",
