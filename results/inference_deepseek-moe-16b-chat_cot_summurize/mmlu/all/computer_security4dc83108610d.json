It does this by verifying that the message has not been tampered with during transmission. This is done by using a hash function to create a message digest, which is then included in the message. The recipient can then use the same hash function to verify the message digest and confirm that the message has not been tampered with.\n\nMessage confidentiality, on the other hand, is a service that ensures that the contents of a message are not disclosed to unauthorized parties. This is typically achieved through the use of encryption.\n\nMessage splashing, also known as message flooding, is a technique used to overwhelm a target with a large number of messages in an attempt to disrupt their operations.\n\nMessage sending is simply the act of transmitting a message from one party to another.",
