            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: If G, H and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic.\n\nProof:\n\nLet G, H and K be groups of order 4. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of G is either 1 or 2. Similarly, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups of H and K is either 1 or 2.\n\nIf there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup in each group, then G, H and K are all cyclic, and thus isomorphic.\n\nIf there are two Sylow 2-subgroups in each group, then G, H and K are all isomorphic to the direct product of two elements, say Z_2 x Z_2.\n\nTherefore, at least two of G, H and K are isomorphic, so Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: If Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n.\n\nProof:\n\nLet G = Z_r + Z_s, and let H = Z_m + Z_n be a subgroup of G. Then, G is isomorphic to H, so there exists a bijective function f: G -> H such that f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y in G.\n\nNow, let's consider the elements of G and H. Since f is a bijection, the image of f, denoted by f(G), is a subgroup of H. Moreover, f(G) = H, because f is a bijection.\n\nLet's define a function g: H -> G as g(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) for all x, y in H. This function is also bijective, and g(f(x)) = x for all x in G.\n\nNow, let's show that g is a homomorphism. For any x, y in H, we have:\n\ng(f(x) + f(y)) = g(f(x) + f(y))\ng(f(x) + f(y)) = g(f(x) + f(y))\ng(f(x) + f(y)) = g(f(x) + f(y))\n\nSince g is a bijection, it is also a homomorphism. Therefore, g is an isomorphism between H and G.\n\nNow, let's show that r divides m and s divides n. Since f is a bijection, the order of G is equal to the product of the orders of H and f(G). Therefore, r * |f(G)| = m * |H| = n * |G|. Since |G| = r * |H|, we have r * |H| = m * |G|.\n\nSince H is a subgroup of G, the order of H is a divisor of the order of G. Therefore, r divides m.\n\nSimilarly, since f is a bijection, the order of H is equal to the product of the orders of G and f(H). Therefore, r * |G| = m * |H| = n * |G|. Since |G| = r * |H|, we have r * |H| = n * |G|.\n\nSince G is a subgroup of H, the order of G is a divisor of the order of H. Therefore, r divides n.\n\nTherefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
