            "content": " The correct answer is C. Leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin.\n\nPeristomal skin excoriation, also known as peristomal dermatitis, is a common skin condition that affects individuals who have a stoma. It occurs when the effluent from the stoma leaks onto the skin around the stoma, causing irritation, redness, and sometimes even open sores.\n\nThe other options listed are not common causes of skin excoriation:\n\nA. A well-fitting pouch: A well-fitting pouch should not cause skin excoriation. In fact, a poorly fitting pouch can cause leaks, which can lead to skin irritation.\n\nB. Changing the pouch every day: Changing the pouch every day is not necessary for preventing skin excoriation. In fact, changing the pouch too frequently can lead to skin irritation from the adhesive.\n\nD. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin: Using unscented soap to cleanse the skin is not a common cause of skin excoriation. In fact, using mild, fragrance-free soap to cleanse the skin can help prevent skin irritation.",
