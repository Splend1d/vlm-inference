This is because electricity flows from high voltage to low voltage, and if there is a difference in voltage across your body, it means that there is a path for the current to flow, which can cause an electric shock.\n\nThe other options are not necessary for receiving an electric shock:\n\nA. Current in one direction: While it is true that electricity flows in one direction through a circuit, it is not a requirement for receiving an electric shock.\n\nB. Presence of moisture: While moisture can increase the risk of receiving an electric shock, it is not a requirement for receiving an electric shock.\n\nC. High voltage and low body resistance: While high voltage and low body resistance can increase the risk of receiving an electric shock, it is not a requirement for receiving an electric shock.",
