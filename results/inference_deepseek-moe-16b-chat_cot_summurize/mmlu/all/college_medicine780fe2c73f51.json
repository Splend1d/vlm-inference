Intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility.\n\nThe son of a bricklayer goes to college and becomes a teacher at a medical school, which is an upward mobility. He then gets promoted to tenured professor, which is another upward mobility.

Intergenerational mobility refers to a change in social status or economic position that occurs across generations, not within the same generation.\nD.
