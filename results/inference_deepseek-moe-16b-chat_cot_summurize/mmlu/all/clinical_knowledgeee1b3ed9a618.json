            "content": " The correct answer is A. Extravasation.\n\nExtravasation occurs when a vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid leaks from an intravenous (IV) line into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage. This can happen when a medication or fluid is injected too quickly or if the IV line is not properly inserted. The vesicant can cause inflammation, pain, and tissue damage, and can even lead to tissue death (necrosis) if not treated promptly.\n\nPhlebitis, or inflammation of a vein, is a common complication of IV therapy that can cause pain, redness, and swelling in the affected vein. It is usually caused by a blood clot or by an infection and can be treated with antibiotics or anticoagulants.\n\nInflammation is a general term used to describe the body's response to injury or infection. It can occur as a result of many different factors, including infection, trauma, or autoimmune disorders. Inflammation can cause redness, swelling, pain, and heat in the affected area.\n\nInfiltration, or extravasation, is a term used to describe the leakage of medication or fluid into surrounding tissues. It can occur when a medication or fluid is injected too quickly or if the IV line is not properly inserted. Infiltration can cause tissue damage, pain, and inflammation.",
