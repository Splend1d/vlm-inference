            "content": " To solve this problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let's denote the number of subsets of X that contain exactly k elements as S(k). We are given that S(3) = 14 + S(2), and we want to find S(4).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:\n\nS(3) + S(2) = |X|\n14 + S(2) = |X|\nS(2) = |X| - 14\n\nNow, we want to find S(4):\n\nS(3) + S(4) = |X|\nS(3) + S(2) + S(4) = |X|\n14 + S(2) + S(4) = |X|\nS(2) + S(4) = |X| - 14\n\nSubstituting the value of S(2) from the previous equation:\n\nS(2) + S(4) = (|X| - 14) + S(4)\nS(4) = |X| - 14 + S(4)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of S(4). We can do this by finding the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements and subtracting it from the total number of subsets of X.\n\nLet's denote the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements as S(4). We know that S(4) = |X| - 14 + S(4). Solving for S(4), we get:\n\nS(4) = |X| - 14\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of subsets of X. We know that the total number of subsets of X is 2^|X|. So, the total number of subsets of X is:\n\n2^|X| = |X| + 1\n\nNow, we can find the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements:\n\nS(4) = |X| - 14\n2^|X| = |X| + 1 - 14\n2^|X| = |X| - 13\n\nSince 2^|X| is always a positive integer, we can conclude that there are no subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. 35.",
