            "content": " The correct answer is C. A raised TSH level.\n\nHypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including weight gain, fatigue, and cold intolerance. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which causes the immune system to attack and damage the thyroid gland.\n\nA raised TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is a common sign of hypothyroidism. TSH is a hormone that is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormones, so the pituitary gland produces more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones.\n\nWeight loss is not a common symptom of hypothyroidism, and pre-tibial myxoedema is a skin condition that is not related to hypothyroidism. An aversion to warm places is also not a symptom of hypothyroidism.",
