Therefore, the net force acting on each particle is zero.\n\nSince the net force acting on each particle is zero, the acceleration of each particle is also zero.\n\nHowever, as the particles are released from rest, they will start to increase in acceleration. The sign of the charge of the particles determines the direction of the force acting on each particle, and therefore the direction of the acceleration.\n\nIf the charge of the particles is positive, the force acting on each particle will be in the same direction, causing the acceleration to increase in the same direction.\n\nIf the charge of the particles is negative, the force acting on each particle will be in the opposite direction, causing the acceleration to increase in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, the sign of the charge of the particles is the same.",
