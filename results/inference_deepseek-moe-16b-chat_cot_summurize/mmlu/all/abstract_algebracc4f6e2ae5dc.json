            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to understand the definitions of permutations and cycles.\n\nA permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. For example, the numbers 1, 2, 3 can be arranged in 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 different ways: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1).\n\nA cycle is an operation that moves an element from one position to another in a sequence. For example, the operation (1, 2, 3) moves the element 1 to the position of 3, and the element 2 to the position of 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\nStatement 1: Every permutation is a cycle. This statement is true. A permutation is a specific arrangement of objects, and a cycle is an operation that moves an element from one position to another. Therefore, every permutation is a cycle because every permutation can be obtained by applying a cycle operation to the elements.\n\nStatement 2: Every cycle is a permutation. This statement is false. A cycle is an operation that moves an element from one position to another, but it does not necessarily mean that the elements are arranged in a specific order. For example, the operation (1, 2, 3) moves the element 1 to the position of 3, but it does not mean that the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are arranged in a specific order.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
