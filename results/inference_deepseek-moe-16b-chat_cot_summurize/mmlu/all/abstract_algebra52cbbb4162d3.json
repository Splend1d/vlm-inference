However, we don't have any information about the relationship between f(a) and f(b) in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that f is injective. So, Statement 1 is false. Statement 2: The function f must necessarily be surjective. In other words, for every b \\in B, there exists an a \\in A such that f(a) = b. Again, we don't have any information about the relationship between f(a) and b in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that f is surjective. So, Statement 2 is false.\nThe answer is D.",
