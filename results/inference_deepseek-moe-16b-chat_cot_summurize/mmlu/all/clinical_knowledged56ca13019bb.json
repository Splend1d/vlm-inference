Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.\n\nIIIrd cranial nerve palsy, also known as IIIrd nerve palsy or oculomotor nerve palsy, is a condition in which the muscles that control eye movement on one side of the face are affected. This can occur due to various reasons, such as stroke, brain tumor, or trauma.\n\nA. Unilateral constricted pupil: This is a symptom of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy, but it is not a neurosurgical emergency.\nB. Bilateral constricted pupils: This is also a symptom of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy, but it is not a neurosurgical emergency.\nC. Unilateral fixed dilated pupil: This is a sign of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and is a neurosurgical emergency. A fixed dilated pupil (also known as a \"fixed and dilated pupil\") indicates that the nerve that controls the pupil (the IIIrd cranial nerve) is severely damaged and is not able to constrict the pupil properly. This can lead to increased sensitivity to light and potential damage to the eye if not treated promptly.\nD. Oval shaped pupils: This is not a symptom of a IIIrd cranial nerve palsy and is not a neurosurgical emergency.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Unilateral fixed dilated pupil.",
