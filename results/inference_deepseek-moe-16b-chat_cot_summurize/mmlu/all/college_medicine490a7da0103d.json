Lymphoid progenitor.\n\nAcute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the myeloid line of blood cells, which includes the white blood cells called granulocytes, monocytes, and erythrocytes. The myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow become rapidly dividing and retain their semi-stem cell state, leading to an overproduction of immature myeloid cells.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the cell type that would arise from the stem cell under normal circumstances. The stem cell is a type of cell that has the ability to differentiate into various types of blood cells, including lymphoid progenitor cells.\n\nLymphoid progenitor cells are a type of stem cell that gives rise to cells of the immune system, including B and T lymphocytes, which are responsible for producing antibodies and fighting infections, respectively. These cells are essential for the proper functioning of the immune system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Lymphoid progenitor.",
