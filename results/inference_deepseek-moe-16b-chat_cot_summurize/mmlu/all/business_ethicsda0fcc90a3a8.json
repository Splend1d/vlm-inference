The correct answer is option D.\n\nCaveat emptor, which means \"let the buyer beware,\" is a principle that has been traditionally used to describe the responsibility of the consumer to avoid subpar products. This principle is based on the idea that the consumer is responsible for researching and understanding the product before making a purchase.\n\nHowever, this concept has gradually eroded due to increased regulation at a national and international level. This regulation is often implemented through informal codes and international agreements, such as those set forth by the EU and UN.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.
