This is because the hydrogen gas absorbs some of the star's light, causing the absorption lines to appear in the spectrum. The emission lines characteristic of the star's composition and the emission lines characteristic of the star's composition are not observed in this case, as the hydrogen gas absorbs most of the star's light.",
