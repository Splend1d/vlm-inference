Tl\n\nTo answer this question, we need to compare the stability of the +1 and +3 oxidation states for each of the group 13 elements (B, Al, In, and Tl).\n\nFor B (Boron), the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state. In boron compounds, boron usually has a +3 oxidation state, but in some cases, it can have a +1 oxidation state.\n\nFor Al (Aluminum), the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state. Aluminum usually has a +3 oxidation state, but in some compounds, it can have a +1 oxidation state.\n\nFor In (Indium), the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state. In indium compounds, indium usually has a +3 oxidation state, but in some cases, it can have a +1 oxidation state.\n\nFor Tl (Thallium), the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state. In thallium compounds, thallium usually has a +1 oxidation state, but in some cases, it can have a +3 oxidation state.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. B (Boron)\nB. Al (Aluminum)\nC. In (Indium)\nD. Tl (Thallium)",
