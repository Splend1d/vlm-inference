This condition is also known as cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis or NSIP (nonspecific interstitial pneumonia). It is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the lung that can lead to scarring and fibrosis of the lung tissue, causing the trachea to deviate towards the affected side.\n\nIdiopathic fibrosing alveolitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other causes of lung fibrosis must be ruled out before making the diagnosis. The other options listed may also cause lung fibrosis, but idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis is the most likely to cause deviation of the trachea.",
