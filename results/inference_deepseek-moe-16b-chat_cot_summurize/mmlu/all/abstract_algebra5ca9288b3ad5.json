In this case, we have the ring Z_3 x 3Z, which is the direct product of the ring of integers Z_3 and the ring of integers 3Z.\n\nZ_3 is the ring of integers modulo 3, which means that the elements are {0, 1, 2}. The characteristic of Z_3 is 3, since the highest power of 3 that is not equal to zero is 3^1 = 3.\n\n3Z is the ring of integers modulo 3, which means that the elements are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The characteristic of 3Z is 3, since the highest power of 3 that is not equal to zero is 3^1 = 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the characteristic of the direct product Z_3 x 3Z. Since the direct product of two rings is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of Z_3 and b is an element of 3Z, we can see that the elements of Z_3 x 3Z are {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)}.\n\nThe highest power of 3 that is not equal to zero in any of these elements is 3^1 = 3. Therefore, the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x 3Z is 3.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 3.",
