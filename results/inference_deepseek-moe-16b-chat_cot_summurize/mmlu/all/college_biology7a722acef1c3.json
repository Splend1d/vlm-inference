This is because the nucleotides in the original strand are complementary to each other. The 'C' in the original strand is complementary to the 'G' in the complementary strand, and the 'T' in the original strand is complementary to the 'A' in the complementary strand. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 5\u2032 CAA TCG 3\u2032.",
