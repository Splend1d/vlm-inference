Reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines\n\nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that is responsible for the reliable delivery of packets between directly connected machines. It does this by establishing a connection between the two machines, and then sending packets over that connection. The receiving machine then acknowledges the receipt of each packet, and if any packets are lost or corrupted, the sending machine retransmits them. This process ensures that the packets are delivered reliably and in the correct order.\n\nTCP is often used in conjunction with other protocols, such as IP (Internet Protocol), to form the basis of the internet's communication system. It is also responsible for other tasks, such as flow control and congestion control, but its primary function is to ensure reliable delivery of packets between machines.",
