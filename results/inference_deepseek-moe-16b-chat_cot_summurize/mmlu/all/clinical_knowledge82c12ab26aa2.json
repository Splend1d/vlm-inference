The supra-orbital ridge pressure, pressure on the little finger pulp, and sternal rub are all examples of central painful stimuli, as they involve direct pressure on or manipulation of the central nervous system. The trapezius squeeze, on the other hand, is a peripheral nerve block technique that is used to anesthetize the upper trapezius muscle and is not a central painful stimulus.",
