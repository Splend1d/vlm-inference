These craters contain the only permanently shadowed regions on Mercury.\n\nThe reason we look for water-ice in craters at Mercury's pole is because these craters contain the only permanently shadowed regions on Mercury. The permanently shadowed regions are the coldest and driest areas on Mercury, which makes them the most likely places to find water-ice. The other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Water-ice is not just on Mercury's poles, but also on its surface.\nB. Comet impacts happen all over Mercury, not just at the poles.\nC. Radar from Earth can see Mercury's entire surface, not just the poles.",
