            "content": " The correct answer is D. A moon face and a buffalo hump are characteristic of Cushing's Syndrome.\n\nCushing's Syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels of the hormone cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands. This excessive cortisol production can be due to a tumor in the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease), adrenal gland (adrenocortical carcinoma), or due to long-term use of corticosteroid medications.\n\nThe symptoms of Cushing's Syndrome can vary depending on the cause and the duration of the disease. However, some common symptoms include:\n\n1. Enlarged extremities: This is a common symptom of Cushing's Syndrome, as the increased cortisol levels can lead to an increase in body fat, particularly around the face, neck, and trunk.\n2. Osteoporosis: This is not a feature of Cushing's Syndrome, as the disease is caused by an excess of cortisol, which can actually help to increase bone density.\n3. A moon face and a buffalo hump: These are characteristic features of Cushing's Syndrome, as the increased cortisol levels can lead to a round face, a fat deposit at the top of the back, and a fatty deposit between the shoulders.\n4. Fatigue: This is a common symptom of Cushing's Syndrome, as the increased cortisol levels can lead to a decrease in energy levels.\n5. Mood changes: This is a common symptom of Cushing's Syndrome, as the increased cortisol levels can lead to mood changes, such as irritability, anxiety, and depression.\n6. High blood pressure: This is a common symptom of Cushing's Syndrome, as the increased cortisol levels can lead to high blood pressure.\n7. Slow wound healing: This is a common symptom of Cushing's Syndrome, as the increased cortisol levels can lead to slow wound healing.\n\nIt is important to note that Cushing's Syndrome can be a life-threatening condition if left untreated, so it is important to seek medical attention if you suspect that you may have the disease.",
