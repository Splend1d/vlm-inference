            "content": " A \"dished face\" profile is often associated with a protruding mandible due to reactivation of the condylar cartilage by acromegaly. Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that results from the overproduction of growth hormone by the pituitary gland. This excess growth hormone can cause enlargement of the jawbones, leading to a \"dished face\" profile.\n\nB. A recessive maxilla due to failure of elongation of the cranial base is not a common cause of a \"dished face\" profile. The cranial base is the part of the skull that connects the skull base to the spine, and it does not directly affect the maxilla or jawline.\n\nC. An enlarged frontal bone due to hydrocephalus is not a common cause of a \"dished face\" profile. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, which can cause the head to enlarge. This would not specifically cause a \"dished face\" profile.\n\nD. Defective development of the maxillary air sinus is not a common cause of a \"dished face\" profile. The maxillary air sinus is a part of the nasal cavity, and it is not related to the jawline or facial profile.",
