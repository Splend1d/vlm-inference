In public key cryptography, a pair of keys are used for encryption and decryption. One key is kept private (private key) and the other is made publicly available (public key). This allows for secure communication between two parties without the need for a pre-existing relationship or shared secret. In contrast, symmetric key cryptography uses a single key for both encryption and decryption, which can be a security risk if the key is compromised.",
