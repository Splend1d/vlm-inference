This is because the apparent brightness of an object is affected by its distance from you and its size. The further away an object is, the less light it appears to emit, and the smaller it appears. Therefore, if you know the actual brightness of an object and its apparent brightness, you can use the inverse square law to calculate its distance from you, and then use that distance to estimate its size.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the brightness of an object. Knowing the speed of an object relative to you would require information about the object's velocity, not its brightness. Knowing the composition of an object would require information about the object's chemical makeup, not its brightness. And knowing the distance of an object from you would require information about the object's position relative to you, not its brightness.",
