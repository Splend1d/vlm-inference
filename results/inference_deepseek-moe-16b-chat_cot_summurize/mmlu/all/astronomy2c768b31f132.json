The most common feature of all fresh impact craters is that they have raised rims, which are the result of the impact that created the crater. The raised rims are formed when the impact energy causes the rock around the crater to be ejected, forming a raised edge around the crater.\n\nA and B are both common features of fresh impact craters. A is short for \"ejecta,\" which refers to the material that is thrown out of the crater during the impact. This material can include rock fragments, dust, and other debris. B is short for \"central peaks,\" which are small hills that form in the center of some impact craters. These central peaks are formed when the impact energy causes the rock around the crater to be ejected, forming a peak in the center of the crater.\n\nOption C, \"central peaks,\" is not a common feature of all fresh impact craters. While some impact craters do have central peaks, not all of them do. The presence of central peaks depends on the size and composition of the meteoroid or asteroid that created the crater, as well as the properties of the rock in the area.",
