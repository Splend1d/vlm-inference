            "content": " The correct answer is D. Pancreas.\n\nThe pancreas is an accessory organ of the gastrointestinal system that is responsible for secreting insulin. The pancreas is an elongated, flat, and irregularly shaped gland that is located in the upper abdomen, behind the stomach. It is divided into two main parts: the head, which is connected to the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), the body, which is connected to the stomach, and the tail, which is connected to the spleen.\n\nThe pancreas has two main functions: exocrine function and endocrine function. The exocrine function involves the secretion of enzymes that help in the digestion of food in the small intestine. The endocrine function involves the secretion of hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, which help regulate blood sugar levels in the body.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that is produced by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It helps regulate the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly in the liver, muscle, and fat tissues. When blood sugar levels are high, insulin is released to help the cells absorb glucose and store it as glycogen for later use. When blood sugar levels are low, insulin is released to help the cells release glycogen and convert it back into glucose to maintain blood sugar levels.\n\nIn summary, the pancreas is an accessory organ of the gastrointestinal system that is responsible for secreting insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels in the body.",
