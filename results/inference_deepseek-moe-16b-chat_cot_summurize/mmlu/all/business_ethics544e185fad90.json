The higher the complexity, the more difficult it is to understand and apply the theory. The complexity of the theory is measured on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being the simplest and 4 being the most complex.\n\nThe theory in question is the theory of relativity, which is a theory of physics that describes the behavior of objects in the universe. The theory of relativity is considered to be a very complex theory, with a complexity level of 4. This means that it is very difficult to understand and apply the theory, and it requires a great deal of knowledge and understanding to do so.\n\nThe other options are not correct because they do not accurately reflect the complexity of the theory of relativity. The theory of relativity is not a simple theory, and it is not a theory that can be easily understood and applied. It requires a great deal of knowledge and understanding to understand and apply the theory, and it is considered to be a very complex theory.",
