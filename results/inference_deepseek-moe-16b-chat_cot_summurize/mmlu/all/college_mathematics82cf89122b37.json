In this case, the constraint equation becomes:\n\nx^2 = 2\n\nSo, x = \u00b1\u221a2.\n\nNow, we can find the minimum value of the expression x + 4z:\n\nMinimum value = min(x + 4z) = min(\u00b1\u221a2 + 4z) = min(\u00b1\u221a2 + 4z) for z = 0\n\nSince x = \u00b1\u221a2, we have:\n\nMinimum value = \u00b1\u221a2 + 4z = \u00b1\u221a2 + 4(0) = \u00b1\u221a2\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of the expression x + 4z is \u00b1\u221a2, which corresponds to option D.",
