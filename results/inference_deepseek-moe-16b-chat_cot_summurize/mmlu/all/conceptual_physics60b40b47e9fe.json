When two sound waves of slightly different frequencies meet, they can interfere with each other, causing a periodic variation in the sound intensity. This variation is called beats, and it can be heard as a pulsating or throbbing sound. The frequency of the beats is determined by the difference between the frequencies of the two sound waves, and the amplitude of the beats is proportional to the difference in their amplitudes. Beats are often used in musical instruments, such as the theremin, where the pitch of the sound is controlled by the position of the player's hands relative to the instrument.",
