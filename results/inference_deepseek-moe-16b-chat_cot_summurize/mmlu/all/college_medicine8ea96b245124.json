Oligarchic.\n\nRational choice theory is a framework in political science, sociology, and economics that attempts to explain and predict human behavior in terms of the best available choice, given the available information and the individual's preferences. The theory is based on the assumption that individuals make rational decisions, meaning they choose the option that provides the most benefit to themselves.\n\nThe three main assumptions of rational choice theory are:\n\n1. Completeness: This assumption states that all possible actions and their consequences are known to the individual.\n2. Transitivity: This assumption states that if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C.\n3. Independence of variables: This assumption states that the probability of an individual choosing a particular action is not affected by the presence or absence of other actions.\n\nThese assumptions are most accurately described as those of an oligarchic system. An oligarchic system is characterized by a small group of individuals or families who hold a disproportionate amount of power and control over resources and decision-making. In this system, the decisions and actions of the elite are often guided by their self-interest, which aligns with the assumptions of rational choice theory.",
