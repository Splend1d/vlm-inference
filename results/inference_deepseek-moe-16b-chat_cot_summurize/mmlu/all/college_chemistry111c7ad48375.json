            "content": " The correct answer is B. Boiling point.\n\nFor argon, the boiling point is lower than for neon. The boiling point of a gas is the temperature at which the gas changes to a vapor. Argon is a noble gas, which means it is not reactive and does not form compounds easily. Because of this, it takes more energy to change argon from a gas to a liquid and then to a vapor. This is why the boiling point of argon is lower than that of neon, which is also a noble gas.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Melting point: The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from a solid to a liquid. The melting point of argon is -189.2\u00b0C, which is lower than the melting point of neon (-246\u00b0C).\n\nC. Polarizability: Polarizability is a measure of how much a substance can be polarized when it is subjected to an electric field. The polarizability of argon is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
