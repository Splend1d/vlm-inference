This is the definition of a subgroup, which is a subset H of a group G that is closed under the group operation and has the identity element of G as an element of H.\n\nB is not a necessary condition for a subset to be a group. While it is true that if a is in H, then a^-1 is also in H, this is not a sufficient condition for H to be a group. For example, consider the set of integers under addition.

While it is true that if a and b are in H, then a * b is also in H, this is not a sufficient condition for H to be a group. For example, consider the set of integers under addition.
