            "content": " Thermal convection involves mainly fluids. In thermal convection, heat transfer occurs due to the movement of fluids (liquids and gases) from one place to another. This movement is caused by a temperature difference between the two places, which creates a pressure difference. The hotter fluid expands and becomes less dense, causing it to rise, while the cooler fluid contracts and becomes denser, causing it to sink. This process continues until the temperature difference is equalized, and the fluid returns to its original state.",
