According to the theory, the solar system formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust (the nebula) that eventually collapsed and flattened into a disk. Planets then formed by gravitational attraction in this disk, leading to the prediction that planets orbit around the Sun in nearly circular orbits in a flattened disk. The theory also predicts the equal number of terrestrial and jovian planets, the craters on the Moon, and the existence of asteroids, Kuiper belt comets, and the Oort cloud. However, option B is not predicted by the nebular theory, as it does not specify the number of terrestrial and jovian planets.",
