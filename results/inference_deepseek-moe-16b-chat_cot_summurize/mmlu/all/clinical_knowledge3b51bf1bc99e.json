            "content": " The correct answer is C. Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease.\n\nSystemic Sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and internal organs. It is characterized by the thickening and hardening of the skin, as well as the formation of scar tissue in the blood vessels, muscles, and organs.\n\nA. It affects males more than females: This is not true. Systemic Sclerosis affects both males and females equally.\n\nB. If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis: Telangiectasia are small, spider-like blood vessels that can be seen on the skin. While they can be a feature of Systemic Sclerosis, they are not the only indicator of the disease. Therefore, this statement is not always true.\n\nC. Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease: Arachnodactyly refers to long, thin fingers and toes, and it is a common feature of Systemic Sclerosis. The skin on the fingers and toes can become thick and tight, causing the fingers to appear long and thin.\n\nD. Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin: This statement is not true. While some patients may have a beaked shaped nose, it is not a common feature of Systemic Sclerosis. Additionally, waxy skin is not a symptom of the disease.",
