Since V and W are 2-dimensional subspaces of R^4, the dimension of V and W is 2.\n\nNow, let's consider the intersection of V and W. The intersection of two subspaces is also a subspace. Therefore, the intersection of V and W is a subspace of R^4.\n\nThe dimension of a subspace is the maximum number of vectors that can be added to each other to form a new vector in the subspace. In this case, the maximum number of vectors that can be added to each other to form a new vector in the intersection of V and W is 2.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the intersection of V and W is 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 2 only.",
