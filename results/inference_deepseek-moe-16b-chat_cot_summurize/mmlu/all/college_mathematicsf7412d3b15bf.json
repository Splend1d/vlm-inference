            "content": " To find the equation of the torus, we need to find the coordinates of the center and the radius of the torus. The center of the torus is the point where the circle C intersects the xy-plane. Since the circle C is in the yz-plane, it intersects the xy-plane at the point (0, 3, 0).\n\nThe radius of the torus is the distance from the center of the circle C to the point where the circle intersects the xy-plane. This distance is equal to the radius of the torus.\n\nLet's find the equation of the torus by finding the coordinates of the center and the radius.\n\n1. Find the equation of the circle C in the yz-plane.\n(y - 3)^2 + z^2 = 1\n\n2. Find the intersection point of the circle C and the xy-plane.\n(0, 3, 0)\n\n3. Find the distance from the center of the circle C to the intersection point.\nThe distance is equal to the radius of the torus.\n\n4. Find the equation of the torus.\nThe equation of the torus is given by:\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + a)^2 = 4a(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + b)\n\nwhere a and b are the parameters of the torus.\n\nIn this case, the center of the torus is at (0, 3, 0) and the radius is equal to the distance from the center to the intersection point, which is 3. Therefore, the equation of the torus is:\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 3)^2 = 4(3)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 3)^2 = 12(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\n\nComparing this equation with the given options, we find that the equation of the torus is:\n\n(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 3)^2 = 12(x^2 + z^2)\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
