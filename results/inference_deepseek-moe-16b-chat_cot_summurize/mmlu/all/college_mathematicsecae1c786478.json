Closure: If a and b are elements of G, then a*b is also an element of G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, and c in G, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the equations e*a = a*e = a hold.\n4. Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a*b = b*a = e, where e is the identity element.\n\nA subgroup H of G is a subset of G that is itself a group under the operation of G.\n\nNow, let's consider the given problem. The group G contains a subgroup of order seven, which means that the order of G is a multiple of seven. The only possibilities for the order of G are 7, 21, 49, 147, and so on.\n\nHowever, the problem states that no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse. This means that the group G cannot be a cyclic group, as all elements in a cyclic group would have an inverse.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility for the order of G is 21, which corresponds to option B.",
