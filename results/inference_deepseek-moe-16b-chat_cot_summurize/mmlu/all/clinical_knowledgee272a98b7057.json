Small, soft toothbrush.\n\nThe small, soft toothbrush is the first choice for cleaning the mouth because it is specifically designed for this purpose. It has soft bristles that can reach and clean all areas of the mouth, including the back of the teeth and the tongue. It is also easy to use and can be used by people of all ages.\n\nB. Gloved finger wrapped in gauze is not a good choice because it can be difficult to clean the entire mouth with just one finger, and it may not be as effective as a toothbrush.\n\nC. Forceps wrapped in gauze is not a good choice because forceps are designed for medical procedures and are not meant for cleaning the mouth.\n\nD. Foam stick is not a good choice because it is not specifically designed for cleaning the mouth and may not be as effective as a toothbrush.",
