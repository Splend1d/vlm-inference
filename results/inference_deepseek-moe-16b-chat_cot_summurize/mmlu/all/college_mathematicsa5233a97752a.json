We can do this by taking the derivative of the function y = x + e^x with respect to x and then evaluating it at x = 0.\n\nThe derivative of y = x + e^x with respect to x is:\n\ndy/dx = 1 + e^x\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at x = 0:\n\ndy/dx (0) = 1 + e^0 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is 2. Now, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line:\n\ny - y1 = m(x - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point on the line (in this case, (0, 1)), and m is the slope of the line. Plugging in the values, we get:\n\ny - 1 = 2(x - 0)\ny - 1 = 2x\n\nSo, the equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 is:\n\ny = 2x + 1",
