In this technique, a protein of interest is incubated with a labeled DNA probe that specifically binds to the protein. The mixture is then loaded onto a gel and run under an electric field, causing the proteins and DNA to migrate at different rates based on their size and charge. The resulting gel can be visualized and analyzed to determine if the protein has bound to the DNA.",
