An r-selected species is a species that reproduces rapidly and has a high number of offspring, but with a lower survival rate. This means that they have a high reproductive rate, but they also occupy unstable environments and have a high competitive ability. However, they do not have a small body size. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
