            "content": " The correct answer is A. Dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte.\n\nIn ferns, the life cycle consists of two distinct phases: the sporophyte phase and the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase is dominant and produces spores, while the gametophyte phase is subordinate and produces gametes. The alternation of generations refers to the transition between these two phases.\n\nDuring the sporophyte phase, the fern produces spores that develop into new sporophytes. The sporophyte is the dominant phase, as it produces spores and is the visible part of the plant.\n\nDuring the gametophyte phase, the fern produces gametes that fuse to form a zygote, which develops into a new gametophyte. The gametophyte is the subordinate phase, as it is smaller and less visible than the sporophyte.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Dominant sporophyte alternates with an independent gametophyte.",
