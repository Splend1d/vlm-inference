The polynomial 4x - 2 is irreducible over the integers (Z) because it cannot be factored into two lower-degree polynomials that share no common factors.\n\nStatement 2: 4x - 2 is irreducible over Q.\n\nThis statement is also true. The polynomial 4x - 2 is irreducible over the rational numbers (Q) because it cannot be factored into two lower-degree polynomials that share no common factors.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA.
