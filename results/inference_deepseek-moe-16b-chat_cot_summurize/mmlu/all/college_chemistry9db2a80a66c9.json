The number of equivalent sites can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of equivalent sites = (number of equivalent sites per unpaired electron) x (number of unpaired electrons)\n\nNumber of equivalent sites per unpaired electron = 1\n\nNumber of unpaired electrons = 1\n\nNumber of equivalent sites = 1 x 1 = 1\n\nTherefore, the number of lines in the EPR spectrum of a solution of dimethylnitroxide (CH3)2NO\u2022 is:\n\nNumber of lines = 1 x 1 = 1\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 24.",
