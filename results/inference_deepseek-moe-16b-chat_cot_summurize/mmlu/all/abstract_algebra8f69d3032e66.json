            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: Every group of order 159 is cyclic.\n\nA group of order 159 is a prime number (159 = 3 * 3 * 37), so it must be cyclic. This is because any prime number has a unique factorization into prime numbers, and the only way to express 159 as a product of prime numbers is 3 * 3 * 37. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup.\n\nA group of order 102 has a prime factorization of 2 * 3 * 17. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (n_2) must divide 3 and be congruent to 1 mod 2, so n_2 can be 1 or 3. Similarly, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups (n_3) must divide 17 and be congruent to 1 mod 3, so n_3 can be 1 or 17. If n_2 = n_3 = 1, then the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are normal. If n_2 = 3 and n_3 = 17, then the group is not a direct product, but it still has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup. If n_2 = 1 and n_3 = 17, then the group is a direct product of its Sylow subgroups, which are normal. Therefore, this statement is also true.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
