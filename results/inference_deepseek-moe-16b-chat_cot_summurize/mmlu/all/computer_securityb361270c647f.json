No, there are no ciphers with perfect secrecy.\n\nA stream cipher is a type of encryption method that generates a keystream (a sequence of random bits) to encrypt the plaintext. The keystream is generated by a pseudorandom generator (PRG), which is a function that takes a seed and produces a sequence of random bits.\n\nThe security of a stream cipher depends on the security of the PRG. If the PRG is truly random and unpredictable, then an attacker cannot predict the keystream and break the cipher. However, if the PRG is not truly random, then an attacker can potentially predict the keystream and break the cipher.\n\nTherefore, if the PRG is really \u201csecure\u201d, then a stream cipher can have perfect secrecy. However, this does not mean that every stream cipher has perfect secrecy. The security of a stream cipher depends on the security of the PRG, and there is no guarantee that a PRG will always be secure.",
