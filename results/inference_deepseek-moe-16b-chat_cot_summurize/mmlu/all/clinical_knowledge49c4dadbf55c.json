It is regulated by the genetic material, which provides the instructions for the synthesis of proteins. These proteins, in turn, carry out the various functions necessary for life, such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance of the organism's internal environment.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. The size of proteins in the cell does not determine metabolism.\nB. The availability of amino acids is important for protein synthesis, but it is not the primary determinant of metabolism.\nD. The amino acid composition of the ribonucleic acids is important for protein synthesis, but it is not the primary determinant of metabolism.",
