A group of prime-power order has a normal series with cyclic subgroups of prime order. The order of the group is the product of the orders of these cyclic subgroups, which is a power of a prime number. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of prime-power order is solvable.\n\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A group of prime-power order can be non-solvable. For example, consider the dihedral group D_4, which has order 8 (2^3). It is not solvable, as it has no normal series with cyclic subgroups of prime order. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
