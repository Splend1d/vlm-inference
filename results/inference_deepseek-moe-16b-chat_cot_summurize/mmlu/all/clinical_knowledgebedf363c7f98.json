            "content": " The correct answer is D. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint.\n\nIn diplopia, also known as double vision, the visual system perceives two images of a single object, one for each eye. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle or nerve problems, eye muscle imbalance, or problems with the eye itself.\n\nA. Diplopia can never occur if one eye is covered: This is not true. Diplopia can occur even if one eye is covered, as the brain can still perceive double vision when both eyes are open.\n\nB. The outer image is always the false image: This is not necessarily true. The false image can be in either the nasal or temporal field, depending on the specific muscle or nerve involved.\n\nC. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards: This is not true. A fourth nerve palsy can cause a variety of symptoms, including double vision, but it does not always occur when looking upwards.\n\nD. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint: This is true. A sixth nerve palsy, which affects the muscles that control eye movement, can cause a divergence of the eyes, leading to double vision.",
