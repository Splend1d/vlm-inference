This is a well-known result in group theory, and it is true that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if its Betti number equals the number of elements in some generating set.\n\nThe Betti number of a group is a topological concept that measures the complexity of the group. It is not directly related to the rank of the group. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. False, False.",
