The rise in intracellular free calcium in the sea urchin oocyte causes the release of proteolytic enzymes, which act to prevent polyspermy. This is a crucial step in the fertilization process, as it ensures that only one sperm is able to penetrate the egg and initiate fertilization. The other options (zona reaction, acrosomal reaction, and cortical reaction) are all specific to different stages of the fertilization process and are not the overall process that the question is describing.",
