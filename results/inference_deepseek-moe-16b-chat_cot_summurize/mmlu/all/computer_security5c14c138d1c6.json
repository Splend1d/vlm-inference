It does not have any security features, and it is the first layer in the OSI model. This makes it vulnerable to attacks such as brute-force attacks on access credentials.\n\nThe other layers, Data-link layer, Session layer, and Presentation layer, are responsible for providing additional security features and do not directly expose access credentials to attacks.",
