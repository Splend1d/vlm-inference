When you add 1 to this number, you get 10000000 (256 in decimal), which is outside the range of an 8-bit number. Therefore, adding 11111111 and 00000001 will result in an overflow.\n\nThe other options are not correct because the maximum value of the first number is less than the maximum value of the second number, so there is no possibility of an overflow.",
