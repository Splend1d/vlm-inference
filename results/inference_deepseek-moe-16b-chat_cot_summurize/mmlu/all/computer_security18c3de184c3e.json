This is the address of the next instruction to be executed after the function call. If the return address is overwritten with the address of the attacker-injected code, then the function will return to that code instead of continuing with the next instruction. This allows the attacker to execute their own code instead of the intended function's code.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the instruction pointer register (EIP) is not writable and cannot be directly modified. Option C is incorrect because %eax is a general-purpose register and cannot be used to store the address of the code. Option D is incorrect because the name of the running executable is not stored on the stack and cannot be overwritten.",
