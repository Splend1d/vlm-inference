The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points on a wave, and it determines the pitch of the sound. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the pitch, and vice versa. The other options, amplitude, period, and natural frequency, are not directly related to the sound produced by tapping a piece of wood.",
