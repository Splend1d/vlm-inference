Temperature: Enzymes are proteins that function best within a specific temperature range. If the temperature is too high or too low, the enzyme's structure can be denatured, which can affect its ability to function properly.\n\nB. pH: The pH of the environment can also affect enzyme activity. Most enzymes function best within a narrow pH range, and if the pH is too high or too low, the enzyme's structure can be denatured, which can affect its ability to function properly.\n\nC. The presence of certain metal ions: Some metal ions, such as magnesium and calcium, are essential for enzyme function. If the concentration of these ions is too high or too low, it can affect the enzyme's ability to function properly.\n\nSo, all of the above factors can affect enzyme activity.",
