            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the conservation of mechanical energy principle. The total mechanical energy of the system is the sum of the potential energy at the highest point and the kinetic energy at the lowest point.\n\n1. Calculate the potential energy at the highest point:\nPE_max = 0.30 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 * 0.030 m = 0.0297 J\n\n2. Calculate the kinetic energy at the lowest point:\nKE_min = 0.30 kg * (0.040 m/s)^2 = 0.0048 J\n\n3. Add the potential and kinetic energies to find the total mechanical energy:\nTotal mechanical energy = PE_max + KE_min = 0.0297 J + 0.0048 J = 0.0345 J\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 0.48 mJ.",
