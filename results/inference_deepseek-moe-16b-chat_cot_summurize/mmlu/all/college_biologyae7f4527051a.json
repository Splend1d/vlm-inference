            "content": " The correct answer is B. An inactivated X chromosome. In normal somatic cells of a human male, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated, meaning that only one copy of the X chromosome is expressed. This is due to the presence of the SRY gene, which is located on the Y chromosome and is responsible for the development of male genitalia. The SRY gene triggers the development of male genitalia by turning on the expression of other genes that are necessary for male development.\n\nThe other options are typically found in normal somatic cells of a human male:\n\nA. The entire genetic information possessed by the original zygote - This is true. The original zygote contains all the genetic information needed to develop into a complete human being.\n\nC. Forty-four autosomes - This is also true. An autosome is a non-sex chromosome, and humans have 46 chromosomes in total, 22 pairs of autosomes and one sex chromosome (either an X or a Y).\n\nD. A diploid nucleus - This is also true. A diploid nucleus contains two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. In normal somatic cells of a human male, there is a diploid nucleus.",
