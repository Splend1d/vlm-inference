            "content": " To determine the number of electrons with a given quantum number l, we need to use the Aufbau principle and the Pauli's exclusion principle. The Aufbau principle states that electrons fill the orbitals in order of increasing energy, starting from the lowest energy level (n = 1). The Pauli's exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.\n\nFor gold (Au), we are given that l = 2. The electron configuration for gold is [Xe] 4f14 5d9 6s1. This means that the 4f subshell is filled with 14 electrons, the 5d subshell is filled with 9 electrons, and the 6s subshell is filled with 1 electron.\n\nSince l = 2, the 4f subshell is the only subshell with l = 2. Therefore, there is only 1 electron in the 4f subshell with a quantum number l = 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 9 electrons.",
