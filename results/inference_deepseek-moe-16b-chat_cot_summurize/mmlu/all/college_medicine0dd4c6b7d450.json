            "content": " The correct answer is A. Sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance by elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.\n\nSodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is a common sports supplement that is used to improve athletic performance. When ingested, it dissociates into sodium ions, bicarbonate ions, and water, increasing the concentration of bicarbonate ions in the blood. These bicarbonate ions then bind with hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood, forming water and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is exhaled, and the water is reabsorbed by the kidneys.\n\nThe increased concentration of bicarbonate ions in the blood buffers the hydrogen ions, which helps to maintain the pH of the extracellular fluid within a narrow range. This buffering capacity allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle cells during exercise, which can help to reduce muscle fatigue and improve endurance.\n\nOption B is incorrect because reducing the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid would not improve middle distance running performance. In fact, it would likely have the opposite effect.\n\nOption C is incorrect because elevating the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid would not allow for a faster influx of hydrogen ions into muscle. The rate of hydrogen ion efflux from muscle cells is determined by the rate of hydrogen ion binding to bicarbonate ions, not the rate of hydrogen ion influx.\n\nOption D is incorrect because elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH would not improve middle distance running performance. In fact, it could have the opposite effect, as muscle fatigue is often caused by an accumulation of hydrogen ions in the muscle cells.",
