            "content": " The correct answer is B. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids.\n\nHaemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swollen veins in the lower rectum and anus. They can be internal or external, and can range from first to fourth degree.\n\nA. Bleeding haemorrhoids do not necessarily lead to melaena per rectum (PR). Melaena is a black, tar-like stool that occurs due to bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract. While bleeding haemorrhoids can cause bright red blood on toilet paper or in the toilet bowl, they do not typically cause melaena.\n\nB. Pregnancy is a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids. This is because the growing fetus puts pressure on the pelvic veins, which can lead to increased blood flow to the pelvic area and the development of haemorrhoids.\n\nC. Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is not necessarily associated with pain. First degree haemorrhoids are internal and do not protrude from the anus. They may cause bleeding, but this is usually painless.\n\nD. Second degree haemorrhoids can be returned to the anal canal. This is because they protrude from the anus but can be pushed back inside. However, they can become irritated and cause symptoms such as pain and itching.",
