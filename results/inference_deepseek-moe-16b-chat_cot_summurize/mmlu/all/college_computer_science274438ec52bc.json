            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the graphs with 10 nodes and 6 edges.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimum number of connected components, m. Since there are at most one edge between any pair of nodes, the graph must be a tree. A tree with 10 nodes can have at most 9 edges, but since we have 6 edges, the tree must have a leaf node. Therefore, the minimum number of connected components is 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the maximum number of connected components, M. Since there are no self-loops and at most one edge between any pair of nodes, the graph must be a complete graph. A complete graph with 10 nodes can have at most 9 edges, but since we have 6 edges, the complete graph must have a pair of nodes that are not connected by an edge. Therefore, the maximum number of connected components is 8.\n\nSo, the correct answer is M = 8, m = 1.\nThe answer is: 1",
