Pith is a soft, spongy tissue found in the center of many plant stems, roots, and leaves. It is composed of parenchyma cells, which are unspecialized cells that perform various functions such as photosynthesis, storage, and support. Parenchyma cells are characterized by their ability to divide and differentiate into other cell types, and they make up the bulk of the plant's body.\n\nSclerenchyma cells, on the other hand, are found in the secondary tissues of plants and provide support and structure. Vascular cambium is a layer of cells found in the cambia of vascular plants, which is responsible for secondary growth and the formation of new xylem and phloem. Vascular bundles are groups of vascular tissues, including xylem and phloem, found in the stems and roots of vascular plants.",
