It was developed by Icek Ajzen and has been widely used in the field of social psychology and marketing. The theory suggests that an individual's behaviour is determined by their attitudes towards the behaviour, their subjective norms (i.e., the perceived social pressure to perform the behaviour), and their perceived behavioural control (i.e., the belief that they have the ability to perform the behaviour).\n\nHowever, the Theory of Planned Behaviour has been criticized for oversimplifying the complexity of human behaviour and for overestimating the role of individual rationality. Critics argue that the theory does not adequately account for factors such as emotions, social influence, and situational factors that can influence behaviour. Additionally, the theory assumes that individuals have a clear understanding of their attitudes and beliefs, which may not always be the case.\n\nIn the context of consumer behaviour, the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be useful in understanding how individuals make decisions about what to buy and why. However, it is important to recognize that individual behaviour is influenced by a wide range of factors, and that cognitive models may not always provide a complete explanation for consumer behaviour.",
