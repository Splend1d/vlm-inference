Refrigerate the blood unit for a minimum of 12 hours and then administer it.\n\nThe accepted time limit for a blood unit to be out of refrigeration varies depending on the type of blood product and the specific circumstances. However, it is generally accepted that blood units should not be out of refrigeration for longer than 24 hours. If a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than this time limit, it should be refrigerated for a minimum of 12 hours before being administered. This allows the blood to return to its normal temperature and ensures that it is safe for transfusion.\n\nIf a blood unit has been out of refrigeration for longer than the accepted time limit, it is important to follow the correct procedures to ensure patient safety. This may include discarding the blood unit if it is no longer suitable for transfusion, or returning it to the blood bank for further testing and analysis. It is not appropriate to administer the blood unit to a patient, as this could put their health at risk.",
