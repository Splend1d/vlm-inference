            "content": " The kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula: KE = (1/2) * m * v^2, where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity of the object.\n\nSince the uncertainty in the measured speed of the ball is 10 percent, we can assume that the measured speed is v = 0.9 * v_measured, where v_measured is the measured speed of the ball.\n\nSubstituting this into the kinetic energy formula, we get: KE = (1/2) * m * (0.9 * v_measured)^2.\n\nThe uncertainty in the kinetic energy is then given by the uncertainty in the measured speed squared, multiplied by the mass of the ball, and then multiplied by the uncertainty in the measured speed.\n\nUncertainty in KE = (0.9^2) * (10%) * (1/2) * (m * (10%)^2)\n\nUncertainty in KE = (0.81) * (10%) * (1/2) * (m * (0.1)^2)\n\nUncertainty in KE = (0.81) * (10%) * (1/2) * (m * 0.01)\n\nUncertainty in KE = (0.81) * (10%) * (0.01)\n\nUncertainty in KE = 0.081 * 0.01\n\nUncertainty in KE = 0.0081\n\nTherefore, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 8.1%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
