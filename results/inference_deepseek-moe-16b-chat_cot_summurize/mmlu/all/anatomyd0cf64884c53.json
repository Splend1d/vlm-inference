They are responsible for supplying blood to the upper limb, the thoracic and abdominal walls, and the head and neck region.\n\nThe subclavian arteries supply the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and cerebellum, but not the hypothalamus. The frontal lobe is supplied by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, the parietal lobe is supplied by the middle cerebral artery, and the cerebellum is supplied by the vertebral and basilar arteries. The hypothalamus is supplied by the internal carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. The frontal lobe\nB. The parietal lobe\nC. The hypothalamus\nD.
