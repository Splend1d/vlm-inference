Eccrine glands are more numerous and found all over the body, while apocrine glands are concentrated in areas such as the armpits and groin, and are more active during puberty. Salivary glands produce saliva, chemoreceptors are specialized cells that detect chemical changes in the environment, and tear ducts produce tears to lubricate and protect the eyes.",
