Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere\n\nTitan has the most extensive atmosphere among the outer solar system moons. It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and methane, which gives it a hazy orange appearance. This atmosphere also contains trace amounts of other gases, such as ethane and propane.\n\nB. Titan is the only outer solar system moon with evidence for recent geologic activity\n\nTitan has evidence of recent geological activity, including the presence of liquid hydrocarbons on its surface, which suggests that it has a complex geological history. Other moons, like Enceladus and Europa, also have geological activity, but Titan is the only one with a thick atmosphere.\n\nC. Titan's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrocarbons\n\nTitan's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and methane, which are hydrocarbons. Methane is the second most abundant molecule in Titan's atmosphere, and it is believed to be the result of the interaction between the atmosphere and the surface.\n\nD. A and D\n\nStatement A is true, as Titan is the only outer solar system moon with a thick atmosphere. Statement D is also true, as both A and C are true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.",
