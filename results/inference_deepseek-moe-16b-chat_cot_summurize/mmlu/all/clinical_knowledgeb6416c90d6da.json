The delivery of medication straight into the bloodstream.\n\nCoring is a process in which a needle is used to extract a cylindrical sample of tissue or material from a larger sample. In the context of medicine, coring is often used to obtain a sample of tissue for diagnostic purposes, such as a biopsy. The sample is then analyzed to determine the presence of any abnormalities or diseases.\n\nIn the case of drug delivery, coring refers to the process of extracting a small sample of medication from a larger vial or container. This is often done to ensure that the correct amount of medication is being administered, and to prevent contamination of the medication. The process of coring is typically performed using a specialized needle and a syringe.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. The delivery of medication straight into the bloodstream.",
