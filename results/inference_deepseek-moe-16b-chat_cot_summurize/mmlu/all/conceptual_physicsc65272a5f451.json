This is because gamma radiation has the highest energy among the three types of radiation, and it can penetrate through the Earth's atmosphere. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Alpha radiation is relatively heavy and cannot travel far distances, making it unlikely to be present in the atmosphere of commercial airplanes.\nB. Beta radiation is also relatively heavy and can be stopped by a sheet of paper, making it unlikely to be present in the atmosphere of commercial airplanes.\nD. None of these options are correct because gamma radiation is the correct answer.",
