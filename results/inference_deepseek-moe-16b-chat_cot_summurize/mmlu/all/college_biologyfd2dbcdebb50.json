            "content": " The question is asking about the descendants of a plant with a double chromosome number, which is the result of a spontaneous doubling of the chromosome number. The question then suggests that this doubling of the chromosome number is somehow beneficial for the plant.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The plant with the double chromosome number would be genetically defective and have no descendants. This option suggests that the plant with the double chromosome number is defective and cannot reproduce. However, the question states that the plant is sterile, not defective. So, this option is not correct.\n\nB. The descendants would be at a selective advantage because of the increased ability to introgress. This option suggests that the descendants would be better adapted to their environment because of their increased ability to introgress. However, the question does not provide any information about the descendants' ability to introgress. So, this option is not correct.\n\nC. The descendants would be reproductively successful because they could backcross with the parental species. This option suggests that the descendants would be able to reproduce sexually with the parental species. However, the question states that the plant is a hybrid and is sterile, not reproductively successful. So, this option is not correct.\n\nD. The descendants would regain the ability to reproduce sexually because chromosomes could pair normally. This option suggests that the doubling of the chromosome number would allow the plant to reproduce sexually again. This is consistent with the information given in the question, which states that the plant is a hybrid and is sterile, not reproductively successful. So, this option is correct.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
