A larger planet will have more gravitational force, which can lead to more intense volcanic and tectonic activity. The presence of an atmosphere is also important, as it can affect the way heat is transferred and can influence the formation of mountains and other landforms. The distance from the sun is not as important, as the amount of solar radiation received is not directly related to volcanism and tectonism. The rotation period is also not as important, as the rotation period is related to the length of a day, not volcanism and tectonism.",
