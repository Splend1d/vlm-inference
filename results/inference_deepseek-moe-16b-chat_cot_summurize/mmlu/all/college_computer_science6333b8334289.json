            "content": " To compute the product of three matrices, we need to consider the number of operations required for each matrix multiplication. The time complexity for multiplying two matrices A and B of sizes m x n and n x p respectively is O(mnp). Therefore, the time complexity for multiplying three matrices A, B, and C of sizes m x n, n x p, and p x r respectively is O(mnp).\n\nNow, let's consider the condition for which it takes less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3).\n\nLet's denote the number of rows of the matrices as w, x, y, and z, and the number of columns as w, x, y, and z respectively.\n\nIf we multiply the first two matrices first, we get (N_1N_2), and then multiply this result with the third matrix N_3. The number of operations required for this process is O(w^2x + wx^2 + xy^2).\n\nIf we multiply the first two matrices separately and then multiply the result with the third matrix, we get N_1(N_2 N_3). The number of operations required for this process is O(w^2x + wx^2 + xy^2).\n\nSince both processes have the same number of operations, the time taken for both processes will be the same. Therefore, there is no condition under which it will take less time to compute the product as (N_1N_2)N_3 than to compute it as N_1(N_2 N_3).\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. There is no such condition; i.e., they will always take the same time.",
