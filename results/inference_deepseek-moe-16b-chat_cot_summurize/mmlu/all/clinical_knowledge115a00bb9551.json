While it is true that oxygen is essential for the production of energy during exercise, the marathon race is more dependent on the ability to maintain a steady pace and endure for a prolonged period of time. This is where the other physiological characteristics come into play, such as the ability to regulate body temperature, the availability of body stores of carbohydrate, and the muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content. These factors all contribute to the overall efficiency and endurance of the body during the marathon race.",
