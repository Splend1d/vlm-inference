            "content": " The correct answer is D. Tyrosine kinase.\n\nThe src oncogene encodes a protein tyrosine kinase, which is an enzyme that adds a phosphate group to certain cellular proteins, particularly those involved in cell growth and division. This addition of phosphate groups can activate or inhibit various cellular processes, depending on the specific protein and the location of the phosphate group.\n\nProtein phosphatase is the enzyme that removes phosphate groups from proteins, not adds them. Adenylate cyclase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP, but it does not add phosphate groups to proteins. G protein-linked receptors are a class of membrane proteins that transmit signals from outside the cell to the inside, but they do not add phosphate groups to proteins.",
