The degree of the sum of two polynomials is the maximum of their degrees. This can be proven by considering the highest degree term in the sum, which must be one of the highest degree terms in the original polynomials.\n\nStatement 2: If F is a field then every ideal of F[x] is principal.\n\nThis statement is also true. An ideal I of a ring R is said to be principal if there exists an element a in R such that I = {ra | r in R}. In the case of the ring F[x] of polynomials with coefficients in a field F, every ideal is generated by a single polynomial. This is because every polynomial can be written as a linear combination of its lower degree terms, and these lower degree terms generate the ideal.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.
