The flowers are also often pendant or hanging, which allows the hummingbirds to reach the nectar without touching the flower. This adaptation promotes pollination by hummingbirds, as they are the only pollinators that can reach the nectar in this way.\n\nPattern of ultraviolet color on the petals (A) and modified petals to provide a landing space (B) are adaptations that would promote pollination by bees, not hummingbirds. Nectar with high sugar concentration produced in limited amounts (D) would not promote pollination by any pollinator, as bees and hummingbirds are more attracted to high-sugar nectar.",
