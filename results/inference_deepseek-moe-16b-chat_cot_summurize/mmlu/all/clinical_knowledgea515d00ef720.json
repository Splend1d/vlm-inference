The risk of pressure damage is highest in the first 24 hours, and it decreases over time. After 24 hours, the risk of pressure damage is relatively low, and it continues to decrease over time. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that after 12 hours, the risk of pressure damage is low enough that it would not be visible.",
