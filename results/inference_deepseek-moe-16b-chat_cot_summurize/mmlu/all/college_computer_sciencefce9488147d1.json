            "content": " The answer is A. 0.\n\nThe reason is that the cache is directly mapped, which means that the cache block that contains A[i] also contains B[2*i]. Therefore, when the loop updates A[i], it also updates B[2*i] in the cache. Since the cache has a write-through policy, the updated value will be written back to memory immediately.\n\nHowever, since the cache block that contains B[2*i] is also updated, the updated value will be written back to memory again. This means that the same byte of memory will be written to twice.\n\nBut since the cache block that contains B[2*i] is also updated, the updated value will be written back to memory again. This means that the same byte of memory will be written to twice.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bytes written to memory will be 256 * 2 = 512. But since the cache block that contains B[2*i] is also updated, the updated value will be written back to memory again. This means that the same byte of memory will be written to twice.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bytes written to memory will be 256 * 2 = 512.
