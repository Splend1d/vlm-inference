II and III.\n\nTriacylglycerides, also known as triglycerides, are a type of lipid molecule that consists of three fatty acid chains esterified to a glycerol backbone. The structure of a triacylglyceride can be represented as follows:\n\n1. A ribose backbone: This is the sugar backbone of the molecule, which provides the structural framework for the molecule.\n2. A glycerol backbone: This is a three-carbon alcohol that serves as the backbone for the molecule. It is attached to the ribose backbone through an ester linkage.\n3. Three phosphodiester linkages: These linkages connect the glycerol backbone to the fatty acid chains. They are formed by the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to the glycerol backbone.\n4. Three ester linkages: These linkages connect the fatty acid chains to the glycerol backbone. They are formed by the transfer of a carboxyl group from a fatty acid to the glycerol backbone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. II and III, which refer to the phosphodiester and ester linkages that connect the glycerol backbone to the fatty acid chains.",
