            "content": " To find the work required to accelerate a particle to a speed of 0.6c, we can use the formula:\n\nW = \u0394Ek\n\nwhere W is the work done, \u0394Ek is the change in kinetic energy, and m is the mass of the particle.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the speed from c (the speed of light) to m/s:\n\n0.6c = 0.6 * 186,282 miles/s = 111,769 m/s\n\nNow, we can find the change in kinetic energy:\n\n\u0394Ek = (1/2)mv^2 - (1/2)m(0)^2\n\u0394Ek = (1/2)mv^2\n\nSince the particle starts at rest, its initial kinetic energy is 0. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is:\n\n\u0394Ek = (1/2)mv^2\n\nNow, we can plug in the values for m and v:\n\n\u0394Ek = (1/2)(111,769 kg)(111,769 m/s)^2\n\u0394Ek = 6.08 x 10^16 J\n\nFinally, we can find the work done:\n\nW = \u0394Ek\nW = 6.08 x 10^16 J\n\nSo, the answer is B. 0.60mc^2.",
