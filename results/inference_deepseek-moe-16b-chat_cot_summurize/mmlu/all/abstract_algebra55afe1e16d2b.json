In other words, the permutation must be one-to-one.\n\nLet's consider the element a = (1 2 3 ... n). This element is not one-to-one, as it maps the same element to two different positions. For example, when a is applied to the set (1 2 3 ... n), it maps (1 2 3) to (1 2 3), (2 3 1) to (1 2 3), and (3 1 2) to (1 2 3).\n\nNow let's consider the element a = (1 2)(3 4)(5 6)...(n-1 n). This element is also not one-to-one, as it maps the same element to two different positions. For example, when a is applied to the set (1 2 3 ... n), it maps (1 2 3) to (1 2 3), (2 3 1) to (1 2 3), and (3 1 2) to (1 2 3).\n\nFinally, let's consider the element a = (1 2 3 ... n-1)(n). This element is one-to-one, as it maps each element in the set to a unique element in the set. For example, when a is applied to the set (1 2 3 ... n), it maps (1 2 3) to (1 2 3), (2 3 1) to (2 3 1), and (3 1 2) to (3 1 2).\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible order for an element of S_n is 10, which corresponds to the element (1 2 3 ... 10).",
