This was set to varying levels of power. At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. Which of the following power levels corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell?\n\nA. 80%\nB. 70%\nC. 60%\nD. Not enough information given.\n",

            "content": " The question is asking for the power level that corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell. The absolute threshold is the minimum level of sound that a person or animal can hear.\n\nTo find the answer, we need to look at the number of mice that pressed the lever at each power level. At 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever.\n\nTo find the power level that corresponds to the absolute threshold, we need to find the power level at which the number of mice pressing the lever is 0. This would be the minimum level of sound that a person or animal can hear.\n\nLet's assume that the number of mice that pressed the lever at 80% power is x. Then, the number of mice that pressed the lever at 70% power is (x-15) and the number of mice that pressed the lever at 60% power is (x-20).\n\nSo, we have the equation:\n\nx + (x-15) + (x-20) = 30\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n3x - 35 = 30\n\nAdding 35 to both sides of the equation, we get:\n\n3x = 65\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get:\n\nx = 21.67\n\nSince the number of mice that pressed the lever is an integer, we can round x to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the power level that corresponds to the absolute threshold for hearing the decibels produced by the bell is 22%.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
