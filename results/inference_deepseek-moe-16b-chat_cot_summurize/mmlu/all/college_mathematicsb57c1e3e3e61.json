The Ratio Test states that if the limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of a series is less than 1, then the series converges.\n\n(I) [\u22121, 3): The limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of the series is 1, which is greater than 1. Therefore, this interval is not a valid interval of convergence.\n\n(II) (\u2212\u221e, 0]: The limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of the series is 1, which is greater than 1. Therefore, this interval is not a valid interval of convergence.\n\n(III) [2, 2] \u222a [3, 3]: The limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of the series is 1, which is greater than 1. Therefore, this interval is not a valid interval of convergence.\n\n(IV) (\u2212\u221e,\u221e): The limit as n approaches infinity of the absolute value of the ratio of consecutive terms of the series is 1, which is less than 1. Therefore, this interval is a valid interval of convergence.\n\nSo, the correct answer is (D) (II) and (III).",
