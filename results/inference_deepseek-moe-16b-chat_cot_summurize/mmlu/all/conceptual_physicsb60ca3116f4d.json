            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the kinetic theory of gases, which states that the average kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to the temperature. The average kinetic energy of a molecule is given by the formula:\n\nKE = (1/2) * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the molecule, and v is the velocity of the molecule.\n\nFor a diatomic gas like hydrogen, the mass of a molecule is given by:\n\nm = (2 * m_H) / 3\n\nwhere m_H is the mass of a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe mass of a hydrogen molecule is approximately 2.178 x 10^-26 kg. Therefore, the mass of a diatomic hydrogen molecule is:\n\nm = (2 * 1.6726219 x 10^-27 kg) / 3 = 1.1137893 x 10^-27 kg\n\nThe mass of a diatomic nitrogen molecule is approximately 2.888 x 10^-26 kg. Therefore, the mass of a diatomic nitrogen molecule is:\n\nm = (2 * 28.0134003 x 10^-27 kg) / 3 = 1.9341867 x 10^-26 kg\n\nNow, let's compare the average velocities of the three gases at a given temperature. The average velocity of a molecule is given by the formula:\n\nv = sqrt( (8 * k * T) / (\u03c0 * m) )\n\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and m is the mass of the molecule.\n\nFor hydrogen, the average velocity is:\n\nv_H = sqrt( (8 * 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K * 300 K) / (\u03c0 * 1.1137893 x 10^-27 kg) ) \u2248 1.000 x 10^4 m/s\n\nFor oxygen, the average velocity is:\n\nv_O = sqrt( (8 * 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K * 300 K) / (\u03c0 * 1.1137893 x 10^-26 kg) ) \u2248 1.000 x 10^4 m/s\n\nFor nitrogen, the average velocity is:\n\nv_N = sqrt( (8 * 1.380649 x 10^-23 J/K * 300 K) / (\u03c0 * 1.1137893 x 10^-26 kg) ) \u2248 1.000 x 10^4 m/s\n\nSince the mass of the molecules is different, the average velocities are the same for all three gases. Therefore, the fastest molecules on average are those of nitrogen.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nC. nitrogen",
