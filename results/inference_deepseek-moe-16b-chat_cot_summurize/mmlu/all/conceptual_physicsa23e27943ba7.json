            "content": " When an object is set vibrating by a wave that has a matching frequency, the object will undergo resonance. Resonance occurs when the frequency of an external force, such as a sound wave, matches the natural frequency of an object. This causes the object to vibrate with greater amplitude and intensity, amplifying the external force.\n\nIn contrast, forced vibration occurs when an external force is applied to an object to make it vibrate at a specific frequency, regardless of whether the frequency matches the natural frequency of the object. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another, and amplitude reduction refers to a decrease in the amplitude of a wave.",
