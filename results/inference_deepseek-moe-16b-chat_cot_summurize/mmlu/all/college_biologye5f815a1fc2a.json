            "content": " The process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport in plants is not passive, as it requires active transport of the sugars against their concentration gradient. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nThe process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport does not depend on DNA, as it is a cellular process that occurs in plant cells, not at the level of the DNA. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\nThe process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport does require ATP, as it is an active transport process that consumes energy in the form of ATP. Therefore, option C is correct.\n\nThe process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport does not translocate starch, as it is a process that involves the loading of sugars, not starches, into the phloem. Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
