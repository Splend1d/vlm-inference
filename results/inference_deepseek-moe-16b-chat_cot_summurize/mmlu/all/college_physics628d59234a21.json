            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation in special relativity. Time dilation is the phenomenon where time appears to pass slower for an observer in motion relative to a stationary observer.\n\nIn this case, the observer is at rest, and the meter stick is moving past them with a speed of 0.8c (where c is the speed of light).\n\nThe time dilation factor is given by the formula:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / c^2))\n\nwhere v is the speed of the moving object (0.8c) and c is the speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s).\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.8^2 / (3 x 10^8)^2))\n\u03b3 \u2248 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.64)\n\u03b3 \u2248 1 / sqrt(0.36)\n\u03b3 \u2248 1 / 0.6\n\u03b3 \u2248 1.6667\n\nNow, we can use the time dilation factor to calculate the time it takes for the meter stick to pass the observer. The time dilation factor is the same for both the moving meter stick and the stationary observer, so we can use the following formula:\n\nt = t' / \u03b3\n\nwhere t' is the time as measured by the stationary observer and t is the time as measured by the moving observer.\n\nt' = t / \u03b3\n\nt' = t / 1.6667\n\nt = t'\n\nt = t / 1.6667\n\nt \u2248 0.6 s\n\nSo, it takes approximately 0.6 seconds for the meter stick to pass the observer.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6.9 ns.",
