The surfactants in shampoo can strip away the natural oils from the skin, leading to dryness and irritation. In contrast, soaps and emollients are designed to be gentle on the skin and can help to maintain its natural moisture balance. Therefore, it is recommended to use soap or emollients for washing the skin when showering or bathing.",
