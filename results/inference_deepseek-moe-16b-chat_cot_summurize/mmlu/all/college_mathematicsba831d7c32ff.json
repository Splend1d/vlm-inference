            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that neither of the two integers chosen by Sofia and Tess will be the square of the other.\n\nFirst, let's find the total number of possible outcomes. There are 10 integers from 1 to 10, so there are 10 choices for each of Sofia and Tess. Therefore, there are a total of 10 * 10 = 100 possible outcomes.\n\nNow, let's find the number of outcomes where both integers chosen are the square of the other. There are two cases to consider:\n\n1. Sofia chooses the square of the other integer chosen by Tess, and Tess chooses the square of the other integer chosen by Sofia. In this case, there are 4 possible outcomes: (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), and (4, 16).\n\n2. Sofia chooses the square of the other integer chosen by Tess, and Tess chooses the square of the other integer chosen by Sofia. In this case, there are also 4 possible outcomes: (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), and (4, 16).\n\nSo, there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 outcomes where both integers chosen are the square of the other.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither of the two integers chosen will be the square of the other is:\n\nP(neither integer is the square of the other) = 1 - P(both integers are the square of the other)\nP(neither integer is the square of the other) = 1 - (8 / 100)\nP(neither integer is the square of the other) = 1 - 0.08\nP(neither integer is the square of the other) = 0.92\n\nSo, the probability that neither integer chosen will be the square of the other is 0.92, which is not among the given options. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem statement or the options provided.",
