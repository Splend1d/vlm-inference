            "content": " The degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 1.\n\nTo understand this, we need to know that the degree of a field extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial of the element in the extension. In this case, the element is sqrt(2).\n\nThe minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2. This polynomial has degree 2, because it takes the form (x - a)(x - b), where a and b are the roots of the polynomial. In this case, a = sqrt(2) and b = -sqrt(2).\n\nSince the degree of the minimal polynomial is 2, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is also 2. However, the question asks for the degree of the extension, not the polynomial. Therefore, the degree of the extension is 1, as it is the degree of the extension generated by the single root sqrt(2) of the minimal polynomial.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 1.",
