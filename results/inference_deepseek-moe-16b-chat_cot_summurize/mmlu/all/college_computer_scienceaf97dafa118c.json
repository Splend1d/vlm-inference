It is a sound proof system in the sense that there does not exist a proof of the unsatisfiability of a satisfiable formula of propositional logic. This means that if a formula is satisfiable, then it cannot be proven unsatisfiable using resolution theorem proving.\n\nII. It is a complete proof system in the sense that there is a proof of unsatisfiability for every unsatisfiable formula of propositional logic. This means that for every unsatisfiable formula, there exists a proof using resolution theorem proving.\n\nIII. It is not necessarily a succinct proof system in the sense that whenever an unsatisfiable formula F of propositional logic has a resolution proof, F also has a proof whose length is polynomial in the length of F. The length of the proof depends on the complexity of the unsatisfiable formula, not just its length.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. I and II only.",
