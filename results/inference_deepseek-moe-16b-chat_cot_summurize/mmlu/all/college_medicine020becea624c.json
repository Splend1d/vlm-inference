The mitochondria are the energy-producing centers of the cell, where the process of cellular respiration occurs. During this process, oxygen is used to produce ATP, which is the cell's primary source of energy. Phosphocreatine helps to regenerate ATP during periods of high energy demand, such as during intense physical activity.",
