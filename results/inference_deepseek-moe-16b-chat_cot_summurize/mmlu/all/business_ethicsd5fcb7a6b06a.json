Moral imagination.\n\nMoral imagination refers to the ability to creatively consider the consequences of, resolutions to, and issues associated with moral decision making. It involves the ability to think beyond the immediate situation and consider the broader implications of one's actions. This includes the ability to empathize with others, to consider the perspectives of different stakeholders, and to imagine alternative outcomes.\n\nB. Ethical reflexivity is not the correct answer because it refers to the ability to reflect on one's own ethical beliefs and values, rather than on the moral issues themselves.\n\nC. Moral originality is not the correct answer because it refers to the ability to come up with new and innovative solutions to moral problems, rather than to creatively consider the consequences of, resolutions to, and issues associated with moral decision making.\n\nD. Moral reflexivity is not the correct answer because it refers to the ability to reflect on one's own moral beliefs and values, rather than on the moral issues themselves.",
