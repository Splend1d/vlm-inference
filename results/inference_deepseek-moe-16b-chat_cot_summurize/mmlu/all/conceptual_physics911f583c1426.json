However, the string is also applying a force on the books, which will cause them to accelerate at a rate less than g. This is because the string is acting as a tension force, which opposes the force of gravity. Therefore, the acceleration of the books is less than g.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. a value between zero and g.",
