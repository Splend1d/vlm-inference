This theory is supported by the fact that the Earth's oceans contain a vast amount of organic compounds, which are the building blocks of life. Additionally, the Earth's oceans provide a suitable environment for the development of life, with the right temperature, pressure, and chemical composition.\n\nA. We don't know for sure: This answer is not accurate. The most widely accepted theory is that life on Earth originated from the Earth's oceans.\n\nB. Aliens (panspermia): This theory is not widely accepted. It suggests that life on Earth originated from space, with the building blocks of life being delivered by comets or meteorites. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this theory.\n\nC. Comets: This theory is not widely accepted. Comets are believed to have delivered some of the building blocks of life to Earth, but they are not thought to be the sole source of life on our planet.\n\nD. The Earth's oceans: This answer is not accurate. While the Earth's oceans are a source of organic compounds, they are not the sole source of life on Earth.",
