Closure: The product of any two elements in G must also be in G. This is true because the product of two non-singular matrices is also a non-singular matrix.\n\n2. Identity: There must exist an element e in G such that for every element a in G, the equation a * e = e * a = a holds. In this case, the identity matrix I is the identity element in G.\n\n3. Inverse: For every element a in G, there must exist an element a^(-1) in G such that a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = I. In this case, the inverse of a non-singular matrix exists and is also a non-singular matrix.\n\nSince G satisfies all three conditions, we can conclude that G is a subgroup of the group of all n x n matrices with rational numbers as entries.
