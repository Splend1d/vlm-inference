            "content": " The correct answer is C. Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine.\n\nThe spine, also known as the backbone or vertebral column, is a column of 33 bones called vertebrae that run from the base of the skull to the pelvis. It provides support, protection, and mobility to the body. The spine is made up of several parts, including the cervical spine (neck), thoracic spine (upper back), lumbar spine (lower back), and sacrum (a triangular bone at the base of the spine).\n\nBack pain is a common complaint, but it is not an uncommon complaint. It is estimated that up to 80% of people will experience back pain at some point in their lives.\n\nSchober's test is a test used to quantify the flexibility of the lumbar spine. It involves measuring the distance between two points on the abdomen and comparing it to the distance between the same two points on the lower back.\n\nPregnancy is not a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine. In fact, during pregnancy, the body produces hormones that cause the ligaments to relax, which can lead to an increase in lordosis (curvature) of the lumbar spine.\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. It is characterized by the fusion of the vertebrae and the sacroiliac joints, which can lead to stiffness and loss of mobility in the spine. This condition can cause hypermobility of the spine, as well as pain and stiffness in the back and hips.",
