In this case, the moment of inertia for both satellites is the same, so the ratio of the angular momentum of A to the angular momentum of B is simply the ratio of their radii.\n\nSince the orbital radius of A is twice that of B, the ratio of their radii is 2:1. Therefore, the ratio of their angular momenta is also 2:1, or sqrt(2).\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. sqrt(2).",
