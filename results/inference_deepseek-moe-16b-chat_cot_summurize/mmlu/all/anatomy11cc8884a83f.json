Carbon dioxide.\n\nExhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than any other substance because when we breathe, we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration, where oxygen is used to produce energy in the form of ATP. The body needs oxygen to continue the process of cellular respiration, so it is important to breathe in fresh oxygen-rich air.",
