It is produced by the choroid plexus in the ventricles of the brain and is absorbed by the arachnoid granulations. The CSF then flows through the subarachnoid space, which is a thin layer of tissue that separates the arachnoid mater from the pia mater, and is eventually absorbed by the bloodstream. The correct answer is C. arachnoid and pia maters.",
