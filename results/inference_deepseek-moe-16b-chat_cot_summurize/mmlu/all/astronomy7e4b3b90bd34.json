Kepler's laws are three scientific laws that describe the motion of planets around the Sun.\n\nA. As a planet moves around its orbit it sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This is a direct consequence of Kepler's first law, also known as the law of elliptical orbits.\n\nB. The orbit of each planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. This is a direct consequence of Kepler's second law, also known as the law of equal areas.\n\nC. The force of attraction between any two objects decreases with the square of the distance between their centers. This is a direct consequence of Kepler's third law, also known as the law of harmonic motion.\n\nD. A planet travels faster when it is nearer to the Sun and slower when it is farther from the Sun. This is not a direct consequence of any of Kepler's laws. While it may be observed in the motion of planets, it does not describe the shape of their orbits or the distribution of their velocities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
