Black is not just two or more appropriate colors. It is the absence of light, and therefore, it is not a color in the traditional sense.\n\nC. Black is not produced by holding a prism upside down. A prism is used to separate light into its constituent colors, not to produce black.\n\nD. This option is not correct because black is a color, and it can be produced by combining all the colors together.",
