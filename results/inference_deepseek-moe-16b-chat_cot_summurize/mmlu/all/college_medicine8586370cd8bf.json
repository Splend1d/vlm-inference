Active immunity occurs when the body's immune system produces its own defense mechanisms, such as antibodies, to fight off an infection or disease. In this case, the horse-grown antibodies are introduced into the patient's body to help fight off the rabies virus. Passive immunity, on the other hand, involves the transfer of pre-existing antibodies from another source, such as a mother's milk or a serum, to the patient. Natural immunity occurs when the body's immune system responds to an infection or disease without any outside intervention. Artificial immunity involves the use of vaccines or other immunological agents to stimulate the body's immune system to produce its own defense mechanisms.",
