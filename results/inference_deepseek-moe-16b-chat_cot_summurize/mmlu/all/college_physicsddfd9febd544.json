            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the Lorentz force equation, which is given by:\n\nF = q(E + v x B)\n\nwhere F is the force on the proton, q is the charge on the proton, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the proton, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nSince the magnetic field is in the +y-direction, the x component of the Lorentz force will be:\n\nF_x = qE_x\n\nwhere E_x is the x component of the electric field.\n\nWe are given that the proton is not affected by the electric field and magnetic field, so the x component of the Lorentz force must be zero:\n\n0 = qE_x\n\nThis implies that the electric field E_x is zero. Therefore, the proton will not be deflected in the +x-direction.\n\nNow, let's consider the y-component of the Lorentz force equation:\n\nF_y = q(v x B)\n\nSince the magnetic field is in the +y-direction, the y component of the Lorentz force will be:\n\nF_y = qvB_y\n\nSince the proton is moving in the +z-direction after being accelerated from rest through a potential difference V, its velocity in the x-direction is zero. Therefore, the y component of the Lorentz force will also be zero:\n\n0 = qvB_y\n\nThis implies that the magnetic field B_y is also zero.\n\nSince the magnetic field is zero, the proton's trajectory will not be affected, and it will not be deflected in any direction. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. deflected in the -x-direction",
