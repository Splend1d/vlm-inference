This process is similar to the citric acid cycle, where citrate is converted to oxaloacetate, which is then converted to citrate. Both processes involve the conversion of an initial citrate-like molecule to a final product.\n\nA, Succinate, is a product of the citric acid cycle, not a participant.\nB, Fumarate, is a product of the citric acid cycle, not a participant.\nC, Oxaloacetate, is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, not a participant.",
