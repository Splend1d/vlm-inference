The magnetic field strength is 20.0 T. The reduced Planck constant is approximately 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^(-34) Js.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the NMR frequency:\n\nf = (28.09 \u00d7 10^9 Hz/T) (20.0 T) / (2\u03c0 \u00d7 1.0545718 \u00d7 10^(-34) Js)\nf \u2248 2167 MHz\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 2167 MHz.",
