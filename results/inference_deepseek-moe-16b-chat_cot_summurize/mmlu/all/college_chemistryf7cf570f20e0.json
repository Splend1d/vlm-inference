This means that the process is not exothermic (releasing heat to the surroundings) or endothermic (absorbing heat from the surroundings). The process does not involve any work, as work is defined as the force applied over a distance, and in a spontaneous process, the system moves in the direction of lower potential energy. The entropy of the system increases, as the system becomes more disordered over time. Therefore, the total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases, as the surroundings also become more disordered.",
