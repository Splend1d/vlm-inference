We need to find the day of the week 10^(10^(10)) days from now.\n\nTo find the day of the week 10^(10^(10)) days from now, we can use the formula:\n\nDay of the week = (Today's day of the week + (10^(10^(10)) % 7)) % 7\n\nLet's calculate the day of the week 10^(10^(10)) days from now:\n\n1. Calculate the remainder when 10^(10^(10)) is divided by 7:\n10^(10^(10)) % 7 = 3\n\n2. Add the remainder to the current day of the week (Wednesday):\nWednesday + 3 = Saturday\n\nSo, 10^(10^(10)) days from now, it will be Saturday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Wednesday.",
