The neural tube: This is the precursor to the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord.\n\n2. Ectomesenchymal cells: These are cells that are derived from the ectoderm and give rise to a variety of structures, including the teeth, hair, nails, and glands.\n\n3. Dental enamel: This is the hard, protective outer layer of the teeth, which is derived from the ectoderm.\n\nSo, the ectoderm gives rise to the neural tube, ectomesenchymal cells, and dental enamel.",
