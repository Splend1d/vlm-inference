Microfilaments, also known as actin filaments, are made up of actin subunits and are involved in the process of muscle contraction, cell movement, and cell division. Phalloidin binds to actin subunits, which are found in microfilaments, and disrupts their function. Therefore, the use of phalloidin would directly affect the structure of microfilaments.\n\nintermediate filaments, collagen fibers, and microtubules are not directly affected by phalloidin, as they are made up of different proteins and structures. Intermediate filaments are made up of intermediate filaments proteins, collagen fibers are made up of collagen proteins, and microtubules are made up of tubulin proteins. Phalloidin does not bind to these proteins, so it would not directly affect their structure.",
