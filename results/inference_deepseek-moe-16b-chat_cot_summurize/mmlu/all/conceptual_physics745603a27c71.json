This curvature affects the motion of objects and the passage of light.\n\nA. Light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity. This is known as gravitational redshift, and it occurs because the light is traveling through a stronger gravitational field as it moves away from the Sun. The redshift is a result of the fact that the light is blueshifted as it moves towards the observer, due to the same gravitational field.\n\nB. Light passing the Sun is deflected. This is known as the gravitational redshift, and it occurs because the light is traveling through a stronger gravitational field as it moves towards the Sun. The deflection is a result of the fact that the light is blueshifted as it moves away from the observer, due to the same gravitational field.\n\nC. A clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth. This is known as the gravitational redshift, and it occurs because the clock is moving through a stronger gravitational field as it moves away from the Sun. The redshift is a result of the fact that the clock is blueshifted as it moves towards the observer, due to the same gravitational field.\n\nSo, all of these predictions of general relativity are supported by experimental evidence.",
