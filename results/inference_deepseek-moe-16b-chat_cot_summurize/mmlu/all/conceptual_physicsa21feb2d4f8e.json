When a big brother and little sister are on opposite ends of the seesaw, they create a balanced force on the seesaw. The seesaw will remain balanced as long as the forces acting on it are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThe forces acting on the seesaw are the weight of the brother and the weight of the sister. The weight of the brother is acting downward on the seesaw, while the weight of the sister is acting upward on the seesaw. When the brother sits on one end of the seesaw and the sister sits on the other end, the weight of the brother and the weight of the sister will be balanced by the weight of the seesaw itself.\n\nThe seesaw is designed to distribute the weight of the brother and the sister evenly across the length of the seesaw. This ensures that the seesaw remains balanced and does not tip over.\n\nIn summary, the seesaw works on the principle of balanced forces, and the forces acting on the seesaw are the weight of the brother and the weight of the sister. The seesaw is designed to distribute the weight of the brother and the sister evenly across the length of the seesaw, ensuring that the seesaw remains balanced.",
