P has an execution path where it does not call itself.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A procedure can be recursive without calling itself on every execution path. For example, a procedure that calls itself to compute a factorial can do so on some execution paths and not on others.\n\nIII. P either refers to a global variable or has at least one parameter.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A procedure can be recursive without referring to a global variable or having any parameters. For example, a procedure that calls itself to compute a factorial can do so without referring to any global variables or having any parameters.\n\nSo, none of the statements must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.",
