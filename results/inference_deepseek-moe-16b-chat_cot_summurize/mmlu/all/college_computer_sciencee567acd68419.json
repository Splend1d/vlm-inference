This means that the inherently parallel part of the computation takes 100 - 40 = 60 seconds.\n\nNow, let's consider the 2-processor case. Since the inherently parallel part of the computation is 60 seconds, and there are 2 processors, each processor will have to execute 60 / 2 = 30 seconds of the computation.\n\nNow, let's consider the 4-processor case. Since the inherently parallel part of the computation is 60 seconds, and there are 4 processors, each processor will have to execute 60 / 4 = 15 seconds of the computation.\n\nTherefore, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running with 2 and 4 processors, respectively, are 30 and 15 seconds.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B.",
