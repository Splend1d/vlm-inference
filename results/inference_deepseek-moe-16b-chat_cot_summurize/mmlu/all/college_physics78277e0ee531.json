            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of wave interference. When two waves of the same frequency interfere, they produce bright fringes. The distance between the bright fringes is given by the formula:\n\nd = (m + 0.5)\u03bb\n\nwhere d is the distance between the bright fringes, m is an integer, \u03bb is the wavelength of the light, and m is the order of the fringe.\n\nIn the given problem, the separation of the bright fringes is 1.0 mm, and the frequency of the laser light is doubled. Therefore, the new frequency is 2 times the original frequency.\n\nLet's first find the original wavelength of the laser light. We can use the formula:\n\n\u03bb = v / f\n\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength, v is the speed of light in a vacuum (approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s), and f is the frequency of the light.\n\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (2f)\n\nNow, let's find the new wavelength of the laser light. We can use the same formula:\n\n\u03bb = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4f)\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the distance between the bright fringes to find the new separation:\n\nd = (m + 0.5)\u03bb\n\nd = (m + 0.5) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4f)\n\nSince the distance between the bright fringes is the same, we can equate the new distance to the original distance:\n\n(m + 0.5) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4f) = 1.0 mm\n\nNow, we can solve for m:\n\nm + 0.5 = (1.0 mm * 4f) / (3 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nm = (1.0 mm * 4f) / (3 x 10^8 m/s) - 0.5\n\nm = (4f) / (3 x 10^8 m/s) - 0.5\n\nSince the order of the fringe (m) is an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer:\n\nm = 1\n\nTherefore, the new separation of the bright fringes is:\n\nd = (1 + 0.5) * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4f)\n\nd = 1.5 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4f)\n\nd = 1.5 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (4 * 2f)\n\nd = 1.5 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (8f)\n\nd = 1.5 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (8 * 2f)\n\nd = 1.5 * (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (16f)\n\nd = 0.009375 mm\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
