Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid state to a gas state, typically on the surface of a liquid. Condensation is the process by which water changes from a gas state back to a liquid state, typically on a solid surface.\n\nIn this case, the water in the saucer will evaporate into the air, and the surrounding air will become more humid. As the air cools, the water vapor will condense back into liquid water on the surface of the saucer, creating a small puddle.\n\nSo, both evaporation and condensation can occur when you put a saucer of water on your table.",
