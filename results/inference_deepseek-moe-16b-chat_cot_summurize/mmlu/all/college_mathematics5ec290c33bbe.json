Since the die is known to be counterfeit, the probability of rolling an odd number is twice the probability of rolling an even number. Let's denote the probability of rolling an even number as x. Then, the probability of rolling an odd number is 2x.\n\nThe probability of rolling an odd number on the first roll is 2x.\n\nNow, let's find the probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll. The probability of rolling a 5 is 1/6, since there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 5) and six possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nNow, let's find the probability of rolling a 6 on the second roll. The probability of rolling a 6 is also 1/6, since there is one favorable outcome (rolling a 6) and six possible outcomes (rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).\n\nTo find the probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll, we multiply the probabilities of each event:\n\n(1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36\n\nNow, we need to find the probability of rolling a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll, given that the die is counterfeit.
