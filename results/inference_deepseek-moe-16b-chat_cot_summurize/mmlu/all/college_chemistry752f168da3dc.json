            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the solubility product constant (K_sp) for a sparingly soluble salt:\n\nK_sp = [Pb^2+] \u00d7 [I^-]^2\n\nwhere [Pb^2+] and [I^-] are the concentrations of lead(II) ions and iodide ions, respectively.\n\nWe are given that the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol. Since the solubility of PbI2 is very low, we can assume that all of the PbI2 will dissolve. Therefore, the concentration of lead(II) ions is equal to the molar concentration of the solution.\n\nWe are also given that the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol. Therefore, the molar concentration of the solution is 1.0 mmol/L.\n\nNow we can calculate the solubility product constant:\n\nK_sp = [Pb^2+] \u00d7 [I^-]^2\nK_sp = (1.0 mmol/L) \u00d7 (1.0 mmol/L)^2\nK_sp = 1.0 \u00d7 10^(-3)\n\nTherefore, the solubility product constant for lead iodide at 25\u00b0C is 1.0 \u00d7 10^(-3).\n\nSo, the correct answer is A.",
