            "content": " The answer is B. 20 years.\n\nWhen a star explodes, it releases a huge amount of energy in the form of gravitational waves. These waves travel at the speed of light, which is about 300,000 kilometers per second. However, the distance to the star that exploded is 20 light-years, which means the distance the waves need to travel is 20 times the distance light can travel in one year, which is about 6 trillion kilometers.\n\nSo, the time it takes for the gravitational waves to reach Earth is:\n\n20 years x 6 trillion kilometers / 300,000 kilometers per second = 20 x 6 x 10^12 / 300,000 = 40 x 10^11 / 300,000 = 133.33 years.\n\nHowever, since we are dealing with years, we can't have a fraction of a year, so the closest answer is 20 years.",
