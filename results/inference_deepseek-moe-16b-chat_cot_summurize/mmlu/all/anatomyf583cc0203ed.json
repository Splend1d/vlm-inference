Pupillary constriction and a medial strabismus.\n\nInjury to the third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, can cause damage to the muscles that control eye movement. This can result in a medial strabismus, where the eye deviates towards the midline. Additionally, the pupil may constrict in response to the injury.\n\nOption B is incorrect because pupillary dilatation is not a sign of damage to the third cranial nerve. Dilatation of the pupil can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications, neurological conditions, and trauma.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a lateral strabismus would be caused by damage to the fourth cranial nerve, also known as the trochlear nerve.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a lateral strabismus would be caused by damage to the fourth cranial nerve, also known as the trochlear nerve.",
