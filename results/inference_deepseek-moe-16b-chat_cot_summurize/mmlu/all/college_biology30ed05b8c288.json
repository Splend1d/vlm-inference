Sexual dimorphism refers to the difference in physical characteristics between males and females of the same species. In many primate species, males are larger and more physically robust than females, and they also have larger canine teeth, which are often used in aggressive encounters. This physical difference can lead to competition for mates, as the larger and more physically imposing males are more likely to be successful in attracting a mate. In contrast, competition for individual food resources is usually less intense, as the availability of food resources is not as limited as it is for mates.",
