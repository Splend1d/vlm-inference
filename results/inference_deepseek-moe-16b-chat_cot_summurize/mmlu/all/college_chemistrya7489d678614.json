Zn(s) + 2 Ag(NO3)(aq) \u2192 2 Ag(s) + Zn(NO3)2(aq).\n\nIn this reaction, zinc metal (Zn) is oxidized, losing two electrons to form Zn^2+ ions and releasing two electrons. Silver metal (Ag) is reduced, gaining two electrons to form Ag^2+ ions. The overall reaction is a reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Al(s) + 3 NaNO3(aq) \u2192 3 Na(s) + Al(NO3)3(aq) - This is a redox reaction, but it is not balanced. The oxidation and reduction half-reactions are not equal.\n\nC. Pb(s) + Ca(NO3)2(aq) \u2192 Ca(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) - This is a redox reaction, but it is not balanced. The oxidation and reduction half-reactions are not equal.\n\nD. Pb(s) + 2 LiNO3(aq) \u2192 2 Li(s) + Pb(NO3)2(aq) - This is a redox reaction, but it is not balanced. The oxidation and reduction half-reactions are not equal.",
