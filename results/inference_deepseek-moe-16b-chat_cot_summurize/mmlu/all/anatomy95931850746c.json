            "content": " The correct answer is B. The posterior fragment of the mandible is displaced anteriorly by the action of the lateral pterygoid muscle.\n\nThe mandible is a unique bone in the human body, as it is the only movable bone in the skull. It is held in place by a combination of muscles, ligaments, and bony attachments. The lateral pterygoid muscle is one of the primary muscles responsible for the movement of the mandible.\n\nWhen a patient suffers an unfavourable fracture of the body of the mandible, it is often due to the force of an impact that causes the bone to break in a way that is difficult to reduce and stabilize. This can lead to a malunion or nonunion of the fracture, which can result in a deformity of the jaw and difficulty with chewing, speaking, and swallowing.\n\nThe posterior fragment of the mandible is the part of the bone that is closest to the ear. It is held in place by the lateral pterygoid muscle, which attaches to the coronoid process of the temporal bone and the lateral surface of the mandible. When the lateral pterygoid muscle contracts, it pulls the mandible anteriorly, which can cause the posterior fragment to be displaced anteriorly as well.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The anterior fragment of the mandible is not affected by the action of the digastric muscle, which is a muscle that attaches to the mandible and pulls it downwards.\n\nC. The temporalis muscle, which is responsible for the elevation of the mandible, does not cause the posterior fragment to be displaced backwards.\n\nD. The medial pterygoid muscle, which is responsible for the movement of the mandible towards the midline, does not cause the posterior fragment to be displaced medially.",
