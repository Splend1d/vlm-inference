            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the average rate of disintegration of the radioactive isotope. The average rate of disintegration is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements.\n\nThe average rate of disintegration is:\n\n(3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5) / 10 = 18 / 10 = 1.8 disintegrations per second\n\nNow, we need to find the uncertainty in the rate. The uncertainty in the rate is given by the formula:\n\nUncertainty = (1 / 2) * (1 / 10) * (1.8) = 0.009 disintegrations per second\n\nTo find the time to establish the rate to an uncertainty of 1 percent, we need to find the time it takes for the uncertainty to be less than 1 percent of the average rate.\n\nt = (1 / 0.01) * (1 / 0.009) = 1000 / 0.009 = 111,111.11 seconds\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a second, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the student should count for 111,111.11 seconds, which is approximately 111,112 seconds.\n\nHowever, since we cannot have a fraction of a second, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the student should count for 111,112 seconds, which is approximately 111,112 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 2,000 s.",
