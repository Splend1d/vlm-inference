The HCH angle is 115\u00b0, which is close to the ideal angle of 120\u00b0 for a linear molecule. This suggests that the radical is flat, and the HCH bond is not significantly strained.\n\nThe nuclear spin of the carbon atom is I = 1, and the electron density around it is given by the shielding constant S. The \u03b2-hyperfine coupling constant is given by the formula:\n\nA = -2.303 x 10^(-6) x S x I\n\nFor a flat molecule, the electron density is relatively uniform, and the shielding constant S is approximately equal to the shielding constant of the carbon atom in the gas phase, which is S = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
