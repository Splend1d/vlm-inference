T-shaped.\n\nIn the molecule SOCl2, the sulfur atom is bonded to two chlorine atoms and one oxygen atom. The oxygen atom is bonded to the sulfur atom through a double bond, while the two chlorine atoms are bonded to the sulfur atom through single bonds. The molecular geometry of SOCl2 is best described as T-shaped because the three atoms are arranged in a way that forms a T-shape, with the sulfur atom at the top of the T and the two chlorine atoms at the bottom of the T.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. Trigonal planar - This geometry would require the three atoms to be arranged in a plane, which is not the case in SOCl2.\n\nC. Tetrahedral - This geometry would require the four atoms to be arranged in a tetrahedron, which is not the case in SOCl2.\n\nD. Trigonal pyramidal - This geometry would require the three atoms to be arranged in a pyramid, which is not the case in SOCl2.",
