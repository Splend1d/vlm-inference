            "content": " The correct answer is C. Linear complexes can display optical isomerism when both ligands are different.\n\nOptical isomerism is a phenomenon in which two or more compounds with the same molecular formula and chemical structure but different spatial arrangement of atoms can have different physical and chemical properties. In the case of complexes containing achiral ligands, optical isomerism can occur when the ligands are linear and the metal center is in a high-energy state. In this case, the ligands can be arranged in two different ways, resulting in two different compounds with the same molecular formula and chemical structure.\n\nOption A is incorrect because square planar complexes can display optical isomerism even if all four ligands are not identical.\n\nOption B is incorrect because tetrahedral complexes can display optical isomerism.\n\nOption D is incorrect because octahedral complexes of monodentate ligands can display optical isomerism even when they have only two different ligands.",
