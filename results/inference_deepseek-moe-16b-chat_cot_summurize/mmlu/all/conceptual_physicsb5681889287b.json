            "content": " A completely submerged object always displaces its own weight of fluid.\n\nThe weight of the object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. This is because the object is fully submerged in the fluid, so the force of gravity acting on the object is balanced by the force of the fluid pushing up on the object. The weight of the fluid is equal to the weight of the object, so the object displaces its own weight of fluid.\n\nThe volume of the object is also equal to the volume of the fluid it displaces. This is because the object is fully submerged in the fluid, so the volume of the object is equal to the volume of the fluid it displaces.\n\nThe density of the fluid is not necessarily equal to the density of the object. The density of the fluid is the mass of the fluid per unit volume, while the density of the object is the mass of the object per unit volume. The density of the fluid may be different from the density of the object, depending on the properties of the fluid and the object.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. All of these.",
