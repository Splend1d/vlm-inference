However, red fox populations are sometimes attacked by a fatal parasite, the mange mite. As mite population sizes increase at a given site, how are hare and fox populations most likely to respond at the same site? (Assume that hares have no major predators at this site other than foxes.)\n\nA. Both fox and hare populations will decrease.\nB. Both fox and hare populations will increase.\nC.

Fox populations will decrease and hare populations will increase.\n\nWhen the mange mite population increases at a given site, it weakens the red foxes, making them less able to hunt and catch hares. As a result, the hare population is likely to increase, as they have fewer predators to compete with for food. On the other hand, the fox population will decrease, as they are the primary predator of hares and are now less able to hunt and catch them.",
