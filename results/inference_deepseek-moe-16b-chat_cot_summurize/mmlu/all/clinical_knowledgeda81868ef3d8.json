The pulse can be palpated when a vein is close to the surface of the skin. This is because the pulse is the result of blood flowing through the veins and arteries, and the rate and strength of the pulse can be felt when the veins are close to the surface of the skin. The other answers are incorrect because the pulse is not felt every time the atria contract (A), every time the left ventricle contracts (C), or when an artery is close to the surface of the skin (D).",
