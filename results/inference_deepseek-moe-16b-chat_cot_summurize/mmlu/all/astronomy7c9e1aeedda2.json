Type-Ia supernovae are a type of supernova that occurs in binary systems, where a white dwarf accretes mass from a companion star until it reaches a critical mass, causing a thermonuclear explosion. This explosion is consistent in brightness and can be used as a standard candle to measure distances in the universe.",
