He used the principle of shadows to make this estimation. He knew that at the same time, the Sun's rays were perpendicular to the ground at Syene (now Aswan, Egypt) and the Sun's rays were parallel to the ground at Alexandria (Egypt). Therefore, the Sun's rays were shorter at Syene than at Alexandria. By measuring the difference in the Sun's altitude at these two locations, Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's circumference to be approximately 250,000 stades, which is about 40,000 kilometers. This method is known as the method of intertial rotation.",
