            "content": " To solve this problem, we will use the Mean Value Theorem (MVT). The MVT states that if a function is continuous on the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval (a, b), then there exists at least one point c in the interval (a, b) such that the derivative of the function at c is equal to the average rate of change of the function over the interval [a, b].\n\nIn this case, we have a function f(x) defined on the open interval (-1, 4) and continuous on the closed interval [-1, 4]. We are also given that f'(x) \u2265 -1 for all x in the interval (-1, 4).\n\nLet's consider the function g(x) = f(x) - 3. Since f(3) = 5, we have g(3) = 5 - 3 = 2. Now, g(x) is a continuous function on the closed interval [-1, 4] and differentiable on the open interval (-1, 4). Moreover, g'(x) = f'(x) - 3 for all x in the interval (-1, 4).\n\nBy the MVT, there exists a point c in the interval (-1, 4) such that g'(c) = (g(4) - g(3)) / (4 - 3) = 2 / 1 = 2. This means that g(4) = g(3) + 2 = 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the function h(x) = f(x) - 5. Since g(4) = 5, we have h(4) = f(4) - 5 = 0. Similarly, we can show that h(x) is a continuous function on the closed interval [-1, 4] and differentiable on the open interval (-1, 4). Moreover, h'(x) = f'(x) - 5 for all x in the interval (-1, 4).\n\nBy the MVT, there exists a point c in the interval (-1, 4) such that h'(c) = (h(4) - h(3)) / (4 - 3) = 0 / 1 = 0. This means that h(4) = h(3) = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the function k(x) = f(x) - 0. Since h(4) = 0, we have k(4) = f(4) - 0 = 0. Similarly, we can show that k(x) is a continuous function on the closed interval [-1, 4] and differentiable on the open interval (-1, 4). Moreover, k'(x) = f'(x) for all x in the interval (-1, 4).\n\nBy the MVT, there exists a point c in the interval (-1, 4) such that k'(c) = (k(4) - k(3)) / (4 - 3) = 0 / 1 = 0. This means that k(4) = k(3) = 0.\n\nFinally, let's consider the function l(x) = f(x) - 0. Since k(4) = 0, we have l(4) = f(4) - 0 = 0. Similarly, we can show that l(x) is a continuous function on the closed interval [-1, 4] and differentiable on the open interval (-1, 4). Moreover, l'(x) = f'(x) for all x in the interval (-1, 4).\n\nBy the MVT, there exists a point c in the interval (-1, 4) such that l'(c) = (l(4) - l(3)) / (4 - 3) = 0 / 1 = 0. This means that l(4) = l(3) = 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the function m(x) = f(x) - 0. Since l(4) = 0, we have m(4) = f(4) - 0 = 0. Similarly, we can show that m(x) is a continuous function on the closed interval [-1, 4] and differentiable on the open interval (-1, 4). Moreover, m'(x) = f'(x) for all x in the interval (-1, 4).\n\nBy the MVT, there exists a point c in the interval (-1, 4) such that m'(c) = (m(4) - m(3)) / (4 -",
