This is because the size of a two-dimensional array is not known at compile time, and it can vary dynamically. Therefore, the memory for a two-dimensional array must be allocated on the stack as needed during runtime, rather than being statically allocated in a fixed block of memory.\n\nRecursive procedures, goto statements, and integer-valued functions do not require stack-based storage allocation. Recursive procedures and goto statements are control flow mechanisms that do not affect memory allocation, and integer-valued functions are mathematical operations that do not require dynamic memory allocation.",
