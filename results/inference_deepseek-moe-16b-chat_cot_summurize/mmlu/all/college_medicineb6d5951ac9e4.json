            "content": " The correct answer is B. Maintains alveoli in an open state.\n\nSurfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that is produced by the type II pneumocytes in the lungs of mammals. Its primary function is to reduce surface tension in the alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. By maintaining a low surface tension, surfactant allows the alveoli to remain open, allowing for efficient gas exchange.\n\nWhen surfactant is not produced in sufficient quantities or is not properly distributed, the alveoli collapse, leading to a condition known as atelectasis. This can make it difficult for oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream, leading to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS).\n\nIn NRDS, the surfactant deficiency is often caused by premature birth, which results in underdeveloped lungs and a reduced ability to produce surfactant. Treatment for NRDS typically involves the administration of surfactant or surfactant-like substances to supplement the deficient surfactant. This can help to prevent further alveolar collapse and improve oxygenation in the infant.",
