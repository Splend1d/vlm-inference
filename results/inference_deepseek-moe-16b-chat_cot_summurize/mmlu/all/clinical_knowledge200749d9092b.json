The rate of chest compressions is critical, as it can affect the effectiveness of the CPR.\n\nAccording to the American Heart Association (AHA), the recommended rate for chest compressions during CPR is at least 100 compressions per minute. This rate is faster than the rate of 30 compressions per minute that was previously recommended.\n\nChest compressions should be delivered with a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute to ensure that blood continues to circulate to the brain and other vital organs. The rate of chest compressions should be adjusted based on the individual patient's needs and the skill level of the person performing CPR.",
