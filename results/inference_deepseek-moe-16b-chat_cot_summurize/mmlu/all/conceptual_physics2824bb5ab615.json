This phenomenon is known as the \"magnetic deflection\" of electrons in an electric field. When a beam of electrons is exposed to a magnetic field, the electrons experience a force that causes them to change direction. This force is known as the Lorentz force, and it is given by the equation F = q(E + v x B), where F is the force, q is the charge of the electron, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the electron, and B is the magnetic field.\n\nIn addition to changing the direction of the electrons, the magnetic force can also change their energy. When an electron moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force that causes it to lose energy. This energy loss is known as the \"cyclotron frequency,\" and it is given by the equation f = (qB)/2\u03c0m, where f is the cyclotron frequency, q is the charge of the electron, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the electron.\n\nTherefore, a magnetic force acting on a beam of electrons can change both its direction and energy.",
