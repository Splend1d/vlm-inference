The ingredients of the solar nebula are listed in order of their percentage of mass in the nebula.\n\nOption A lists the ingredients in order of their percentage of mass in the nebula: hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), light gases (H, He), and metals and rocks.\n\nOption B lists the ingredients in order of their percentage of mass in the nebula: hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), light gases (H, He), and metals and rocks. However, it reverses the order of metals and rocks, which is incorrect.\n\nOption C lists the ingredients in order of their percentage of mass in the nebula: light gases (H, He), hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), and metals and rocks. This is incorrect because metals and rocks are listed before light gases.\n\nOption D lists the ingredients in order of their percentage of mass in the nebula: light gases (H, He), hydrogen compounds (H2O, CH4, NH3), and metals and rocks. This is incorrect because metals and rocks are listed before light gases.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.",
