            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of weight and mass. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, while mass is the amount of matter in an object. The weight of an object is directly proportional to the force of gravity acting on it.\n\nIn this case, the planet is shrinking, but its mass remains the same. This means that the force of gravity acting on an object on the surface of the planet remains the same.\n\nLet's consider the three options:\n\nA. 1/100 as much: If the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, the force of gravity acting on an object on the surface of the planet would also be one-tenth of its original value. Therefore, the weight of an object would be 1/100 as much.\n\nB. 10 times as much: If the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, the force of gravity acting on an object on the surface of the planet would also be one-tenth of its original value. Therefore, the weight of an object would be 10 times as much.\n\nC. 100 times as much: If the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, the force of gravity acting on an object on the surface of the planet would also be one-tenth of its original value. Therefore, the weight of an object would be 100 times as much.\n\nD. 1000 times as much: If the planet shrinks to one-tenth its original diameter, the force of gravity acting on an object on the surface of the planet would also be one-tenth of its original value. Therefore, the weight of an object would be 1000 times as much.\n\nNone of the options A, B, C, or D are correct. The weight of an object on the surface of a shrinking planet would not change, as the force of gravity acting on it remains the same.",
