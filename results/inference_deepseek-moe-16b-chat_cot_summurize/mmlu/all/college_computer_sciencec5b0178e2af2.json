Increasing the clock cycle rate: Increasing the clock cycle rate would decrease the time between each instruction being processed, which would improve the execution time of a typical program.\n\nII. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline: Forwarding in the pipeline refers to the ability to start processing the next instruction in the pipeline before the current instruction is finished. Disallowing this would decrease the efficiency of the pipeline, but it would not necessarily improve the execution time of a typical program.\n\nIII. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time: Doubling the sizes of the cache would allow for more data to be stored, which could improve the execution time of a typical program.\n\nTherefore, the actions that would improve the execution time of a typical program in a pipelined RISC computer are increasing the clock cycle rate and doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. I and III.",
