Social accountability standard, SA 8000.\n\nThe Social Accountability 8000 (SA 8000) is a voluntary standard for decent work, which was launched in 1997. It covers key labor rights such as working hours, forced labor, and discrimination, with compliance being certified by independent auditors. The SA 8000 standard is recognized globally and is widely used by companies to ensure that they are meeting their social accountability obligations.\n\nThe SA 8000 standard is not the same as the SA 9000 standard, which is a quality management system standard for organizations in the manufacturing and service industries. The SA 9000 standard is not related to social accountability.",
