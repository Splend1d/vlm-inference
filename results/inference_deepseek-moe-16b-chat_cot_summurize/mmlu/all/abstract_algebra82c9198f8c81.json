This means that R is a field that contains all the roots of some polynomial with coefficients in Q.\n\nStatement 2: There is a field with 60 elements.\nA field with 60 elements is a field that contains 60 elements. This is a well-known fact in abstract algebra, and it is known as the field with 60 elements.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
