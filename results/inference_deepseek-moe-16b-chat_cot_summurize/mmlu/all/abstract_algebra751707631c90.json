In this case, we have the group Z (the integers under addition) and the group Z_2 (the integers under addition modulo 2).\n\nTo find a homomorphism, we need to find a function f: Z -> Z_2 such that f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) mod 2 for all a, b in Z.\n\nFor example, one possible homomorphism is f(n) = n mod 2 for all n in Z. This function preserves the group operation, since for any two integers a and b, we have:\n\nf(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) mod 2\nf(a) + f(b) mod 2 = (f(a) + f(b)) mod 2\n\nSo, there are infinitely many homomorphisms of Z into Z_2.",
