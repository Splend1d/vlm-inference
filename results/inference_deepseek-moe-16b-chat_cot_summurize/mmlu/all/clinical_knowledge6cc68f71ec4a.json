            "content": " The correct answer is C. Women have started training at an earlier age. This is because, as children, boys and girls tend to participate in the same sports and activities. However, as they grow older, girls tend to drop out of sports at a higher rate than boys. This is due to societal pressures and stereotypes that discourage girls from participating in sports. As a result, girls tend to start training at a later age than boys, which can affect their physical development and performance.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a concerted effort to encourage girls to participate in sports and to provide them with the same opportunities as boys. This has led to a significant improvement in women's world record performances. Girls are now training at an earlier age and are able to develop their physical abilities to a greater extent than in the past. This has resulted in improved performance and faster times in various sports.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because muscle mass is not the primary factor that determines athletic performance. Answer B is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that women can now run faster than men. Answer D is incorrect because the number of women participating in sports is not the primary factor that has led to improved performance.",
