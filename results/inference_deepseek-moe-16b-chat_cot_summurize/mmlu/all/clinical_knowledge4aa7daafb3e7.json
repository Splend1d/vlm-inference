The length of time that a cannula can remain in situ depends on several factors, including the type of cannula used, the location of the insertion site, and the individual patient's medical history.\n\nIn general, a cannula can remain in place for up to 24 hours. However, some healthcare providers may choose to remove the cannula after 12 hours if there are no complications or concerns about the insertion site. It is important to follow the instructions of your healthcare provider regarding the care and removal of your cannula.\n\nIf you have any concerns about your cannula or are experiencing any pain, redness, or swelling at the insertion site, it is important to contact your healthcare provider right away.",
