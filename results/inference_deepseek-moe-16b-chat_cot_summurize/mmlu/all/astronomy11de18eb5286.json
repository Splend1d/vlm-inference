This is because the Moon's orbit is tilted by about 5 degrees with respect to the ecliptic plane, which means that it does not always pass directly between the Earth and the Sun, and therefore solar eclipses do not occur as often as they would if the Moon's orbit were perfectly aligned with the ecliptic plane.",
