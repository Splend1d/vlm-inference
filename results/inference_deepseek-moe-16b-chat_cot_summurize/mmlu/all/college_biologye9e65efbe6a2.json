Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; secondary phloem; primary phloem; cortex.\n\nAs the larvae eat their way toward the outside of the twig, they would first encounter the pith, which is the soft, spongy tissue found at the center of the twig. Next, they would come across the primary xylem, which is responsible for transporting water and nutrients up the stem. Then, they would reach the secondary xylem, which is similar to the primary xylem but has already matured. After that, they would encounter the vascular cambium, which is a thin layer of cells that allows the stem to increase in diameter by producing new xylem and phloem tissue.\n\nNext, the larvae would come across the secondary phloem, which is similar to the primary phloem but has already matured. Then, they would reach the primary phloem, which is responsible for transporting sugars and other organic compounds down the stem. Finally, they would reach the cortex, which is the outermost layer of tissue in the stem and is composed of a series of thin-walled cells that provide protection and support.",
