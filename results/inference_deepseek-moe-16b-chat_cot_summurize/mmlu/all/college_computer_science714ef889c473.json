A DFA is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a string based on the combination of states it is in. The language L is defined as the set of strings that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The number of 0's in x is divisible by k.\n2. The number of 1's in x is odd.\n\nNow, let's consider the states of the DFA. We can have a state for each possible combination of 0's and 1's in the string. Since the number of 0's must be divisible by k, we can have k states for each possible number of 0's. Similarly, since the number of 1's must be odd, we can have 1 state for each possible number of 1's.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of states in the DFA is k * (k + 1) = k^2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.",
