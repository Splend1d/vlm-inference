This is a series of chemical reactions that take place in the mitochondria of cells, where acetyl CoA, which is produced from fatty acids or glucose, is converted into carbon dioxide and water. The cycle generates a molecule of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and a molecule of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), which can be used to produce more ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.",
