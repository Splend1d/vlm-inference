Globalisation.\n\nGlobalisation is a key driving force shaping the current and future state of business ethics, particularly regarding cultural, legal, and accountability issues.\n\nGlobalisation refers to the increasing interdependence of national economies, driven by the growth of international trade, investment, and cultural exchange. This process has led to a number of ethical challenges for businesses, including:\n\n1. Cultural issues: As businesses operate in a global market, they must navigate cultural differences and ensure that their operations are respectful of local customs and values. This can be challenging, as businesses may be unfamiliar with the cultural norms of the countries in which they operate, and may inadvertently offend local populations.\n2. Legal issues: Globalisation has also led to an increase in legal complexity, as businesses must comply with a variety of national and international laws and regulations. This can be challenging, as businesses may be unfamiliar with the legal requirements of the countries in which they operate, and may inadvertently violate local laws.\n3. Accountability issues: Globalisation has also led to an increase in accountability challenges, as businesses must be held accountable for their actions in multiple jurisdictions. This can be challenging, as businesses may be unfamiliar with the legal and regulatory frameworks of the countries in which they operate, and may be subject to multiple sets of laws and regulations.\n\nTherefore, globalisation is a key driving force shaping the current and future state of business ethics, particularly regarding cultural, legal, and accountability issues.",
