The selection rules state that the change in the orbital angular momentum (\u0394l) must be \u00b11.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. n = 3, l = 2: This transition is allowed because \u0394l = 1.\n\nB. n = 3, l = 1: This transition is allowed because \u0394l = 0.\n\nC. n = 3, l = 0: This transition is allowed because \u0394l = 0.\n\nD. n = 2, l = 0: This transition is NOT allowed because \u0394l = 0. The electron cannot change its orbital angular momentum to zero, which means that it cannot transition from the n = 4, l = 1 state to the n = 2, l = 0 state.\n\nTherefore, the final state that can NOT be reached by an allowed transition is n = 2, l = 0.",
