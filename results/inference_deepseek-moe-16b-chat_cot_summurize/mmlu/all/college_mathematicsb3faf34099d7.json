A group is a set equipped with a binary operation that combines any two elements to form another element in the set. The operation must satisfy certain properties, including closure, associativity, and the existence of an identity element and inverse elements.\n\nIn this case, we are given that for all a, b in G, (ab)^2 = a^2b^2. This property is known as the property of squares in groups.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nA. finite: A group can be finite or infinite. The property of squares does not provide any information about the size of the group.\n\nB. cyclic: A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. The property of squares does not provide any information about the structure of the group.\n\nC. of order two: A group of order two has only two elements, and the group operation is commutative. The property of squares does not provide any information about the order of the group.\n\nD. abelian: A group is abelian (or commutative) if the group operation is commutative, meaning that for all a, b in G, ab = ba. The property of squares is a property of commutative groups.\n\nTherefore, the group G in which (ab)^2 = a^2b^2 is necessarily abelian.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. abelian.",
