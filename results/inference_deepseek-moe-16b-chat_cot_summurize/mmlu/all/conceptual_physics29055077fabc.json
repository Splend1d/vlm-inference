            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conservation of energy. When a cannonball is fired horizontally, it has both kinetic energy and potential energy. The potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the cannonball moves upward and then falls back down.\n\nThe initial speed of the cannonball is 10 m/s, and it is fired from a height of 10 m. The height is the potential energy of the cannonball, which is converted into kinetic energy as the cannonball falls back down.\n\nThe potential energy of an object is given by the formula:\n\nPE = m * g * h\n\nwhere PE is the potential energy, m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s^2), and h is the height.\n\nThe kinetic energy of an object is given by the formula:\n\nKE = 0.5 * m * v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the object, and v is the velocity.\n\nSince the cannonball is fired horizontally, its initial velocity is 10 m/s. The height is 10 m, and the mass of the cannonball is constant. Therefore, we can use the conservation of energy to find the speed of the cannonball one second after being fired.\n\nThe potential energy of the cannonball at the top of its trajectory is 0, since it has fallen back down to the same height. Therefore, the potential energy is equal to the initial potential energy:\n\n0 = m * g * 10\n\nSolving for m, we get:\n\nm = 10 kg\n\nNow, we can use the conservation of energy to find the speed of the cannonball one second after being fired:\n\nKE = PE\n\n0.5 * 10 * v^2 = 10 * g * 10\n\n0.5 * 10 * v^2 = 100\n\nv^2 = 20\n\nv = \u221a20\n\nv \u2248 4.47 m/s\n\nSince the speed is given in m/s, the answer is A.",
