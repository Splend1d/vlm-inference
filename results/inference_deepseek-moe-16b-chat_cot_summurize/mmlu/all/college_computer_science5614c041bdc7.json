This is a well-known result in computer science and mathematics, known as the halting problem. The proof is based on the fact that the halting problem is undecidable, and the fact that the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is a computable sequence, but not a recursive one.\n\nII. The problem of determining whether a given program and input result in the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is undecidable. This is because the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is a computable sequence, but not a recursive one. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether a given program and input will produce the decimal expansion of \u03c0.\n\nIII. The problem of determining whether a given program that takes as input a prefix of the decimal expansion of \u03c0 always produces the same output for every prefix is undecidable. This is because the decimal expansion of \u03c0 is a computable sequence, but not a recursive one. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether a given program will produce the same output for every prefix.",
