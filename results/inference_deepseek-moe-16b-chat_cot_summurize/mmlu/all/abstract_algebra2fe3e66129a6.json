Reflexive: A relation is reflexive if (a, a) is in the relation for every element a in the set. In this case, (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) are all in the relation ~, so the relation is reflexive.\n\n2. Symmetric: A relation is symmetric if (a, b) is in the relation if and only if (b, a) is also in the relation. In this case, (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) are all in the relation ~, so the relation is symmetric.\n\n3. Anti-symmetric: A relation is anti-symmetric if (a, b) is in the relation and (b, a) is also in the relation only if a = b. In this case, there are no pairs (a, b) and (b, a) in the relation ~, so the relation is anti-symmetric.\n\n4. Transitive: A relation is transitive if (a, b) is in the relation and (b, c) is in the relation implies (a, c) is also in the relation. In this case, there are no pairs (a, b), (b, c), and (a, c) in the relation ~, so the relation is transitive.\n\nTherefore, the relation ~ is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, but not anti-symmetric.\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$.",
