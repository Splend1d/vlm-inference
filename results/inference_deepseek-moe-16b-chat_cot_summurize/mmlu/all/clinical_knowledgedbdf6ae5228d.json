An opening in the anterior wall of the trachea above the cricoid cartilage.\n\nA tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that creates an opening in the anterior wall of the trachea, above the cricoid cartilage. This opening allows for an airway to be established, either as a temporary or permanent measure, in cases where the patient's airway is obstructed or cannot be maintained through other means. The cricoid cartilage is a ring-shaped structure at the base of the neck that helps to protect the trachea. The opening created during a tracheostomy is typically called a tracheostomy tube or stoma, which is inserted through the opening and secured in place to maintain the airway.",
