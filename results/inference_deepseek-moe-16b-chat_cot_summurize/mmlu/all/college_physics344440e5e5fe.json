The electron configuration of an atom is a way of organizing the electrons in the atom into different energy levels or orbitals.\n\nFor the first energy level (n = 1), an atom can have 2 electrons. For the second energy level (n = 2), an atom can have a maximum of 8 electrons.\n\nIn this case, the atom has filled both the n = 1 and n = 2 levels. Therefore, the atom has a total of 2 + 8 = 10 electrons.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 10.",
