            "content": " The correct answer is C. atrophy.\n\nWhen a peripheral motor nerve is cut, the muscle fibers it normally innervates will not receive the electrical signals from the nerve to contract. Over time, the muscle fibers will begin to waste away or atrophy due to a lack of use. This is because the body will not need to maintain the muscle mass if it is not being used.\n\nA, B, and D are not correct because they are not the result of a peripheral motor nerve not regenerating. Spastic paralysis is a result of damage to the central nervous system, not a peripheral nerve. Flaccid paralysis is a result of damage to the spinal cord or brain, not a peripheral nerve. Contracture is a result of damage to the muscles themselves, not a peripheral nerve.",
