            "content": " The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny is best explained by independent assortment.\n\nIndependent assortment is a principle in genetics that states that the two copies of a gene (one from each parent) segregate independently during gamete formation, resulting in the possibility of different combinations of alleles in the offspring. In this case, the gray-bodied and normal-winged genes are linked on the same chromosome, and the black-bodied and vestigial-winged genes are also linked on the same chromosome. When the female fruit fly mates with the male fruit fly, the genes for the gray body and normal wings are inherited together, while the genes for the black body and vestigial wings are inherited together. The independent assortment of these genes results in the possibility of different combinations of alleles in the offspring, including the presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies.",
