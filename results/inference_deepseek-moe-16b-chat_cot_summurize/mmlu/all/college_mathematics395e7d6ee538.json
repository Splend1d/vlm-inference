This means that every compact space is indeed complete, as every Cauchy sequence in a compact space converges to a point in the space.\n\nThe statement \"Every complete space is compact\" is false. A counterexample is the real numbers with the standard topology, which is complete but not compact.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Both (a) and (b) are true.",
