            "content": " The best explanation for why net primary productivity (NPP) in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics is C. The availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics fosters photosynthesis.\n\nThe tropics, which include regions near the equator, have higher temperatures and more abundant rainfall compared to higher latitudes. These conditions create a favorable environment for photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into energy in the form of glucose. As a result, plants in the tropics are able to grow and photosynthesize more efficiently than those in cooler or drier regions.\n\nOption A, which suggests that higher species diversity in the tropics leads to increased plant growth, is not the primary reason for the increased NPP in the tropics. While diversity can certainly contribute to overall productivity, it is not the driving factor behind the higher NPP in the tropics.\n\nOption B, which suggests that there are lower metabolic costs to plant growth in the tropics, is not a direct explanation for the increased NPP. While it is true that plants in the tropics may have lower metabolic costs due to the favorable conditions, this is not the primary reason for the higher NPP.\n\nOption D, which suggests that the tropics have more predators that minimize herbivory, is not a direct explanation for the increased NPP. While herbivory can certainly impact plant growth, it is not the primary factor driving the higher NPP in the tropics.\n\nIn summary, the best explanation for why net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems tends to increase toward the tropics is the availability of water and warm temperatures in the tropics, which fosters photosynthesis and allows plants to grow and photosynthesize more efficiently.",
