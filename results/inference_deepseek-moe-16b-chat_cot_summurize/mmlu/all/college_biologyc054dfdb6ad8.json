            "content": " The question is asking about the reason why the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped into rearing the cuckoo fledglings to the detriment of their own offspring remain in the gene pool of the population.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. The host birds' response allows them to rear their own young efficiently by feeding only those who indicate they are hungry. This option suggests that the host birds are efficient in rearing their own young, but it does not explain why the genes that allow them to be duped by the cuckoo remain in the gene pool.\n\nB. The maximum fitness of the duped bird is not compromised when the bird rears an interloper of another species. This option suggests that the bird's fitness is not affected by rearing an interloper, but it does not explain why the genes that allow the bird to be duped remain in the gene pool.\n\nC. On average, little energy is spent on rearing a fledgling bird, whether it is an interloper or one's own. This option suggests that the energy spent on rearing a fledgling bird is not significantly different whether it is an interloper or one's own, but it does not explain why the genes that allow the bird to be duped remain in the gene pool.\n\nD. The maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced. This option suggests that if the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped by the cuckoo were removed from the gene pool, the cuckoo would be less successful in duping the host birds, and therefore its fitness would be reduced. This would lead to a decrease in the frequency of these genes in the population, which would eventually lead to the genes being removed from the gene pool.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option D. The maximum fitness of the cuckoo would then be reduced if the genes that allow the host bird species to be duped by the cuckoo were removed from the gene pool.",
