            "content": " To factor the polynomial x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x], we need to find the roots of the polynomial in Z_5. Since 4 is a perfect square in Z_5, the polynomial will have a root in Z_5. We can check the roots of the polynomial in Z_5 by substituting each element of Z_5 into the polynomial and checking if the result is 0.\n\n1. For x = 0, we have 0^4 + 4 = 4, which is not 0 in Z_5.\n2. For x = 1, we have 1^4 + 4 = 5, which is not 0 in Z_5.\n3. For x = 2, we have 2^4 + 4 = 16 \u2261 1 (mod 5), which is not 0 in Z_5.\n4. For x = 3, we have 3^4 + 4 = 85 \u2261 1 (mod 5), which is not 0 in Z_5.\n5. For x = 4, we have 4^4 + 4 = 257 \u2261 2 (mod 5), which is not 0 in Z_5.\n\nSince none of the elements in Z_5 are roots of the polynomial, we need to find a root in Z_5 by considering the polynomial as a polynomial in Z_5[x]. We can rewrite the polynomial as (x \u2212 2)(x + 2)(x \u2212 1)(x + 1). This is because (x \u2212 2)(x + 2) = (x \u2212 1)(x + 1) in Z_5, and (x \u2212 1)(x + 1) = (x \u2212 2)(x + 2) in Z_5. Therefore, the polynomial x^4 + 4 can be factored into linear factors in Z_5[x] as (x \u2212 2)(x + 2)(x \u2212 1)(x + 1).\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. (x \u2212 2)(x + 2)(x \u2212 1)(x + 1).",
