            "content": " The correct formula to calculate the second cosmic velocity is option A: v = sqrt(GM/R). This formula calculates the escape velocity from a celestial body with mass M and radius R. The gravitational constant G is used to convert the mass of the celestial body into a gravitational force.\n\nThe escape velocity is the minimum speed an object must have to escape the gravitational pull of a celestial body. It is the speed at which the sum of the object's kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy is equal to the work done against gravity in bringing the object from infinity to its current position.\n\nIn the formula, G is the gravitational constant, which is approximately 6.674 x 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2. M is the mass of the celestial body, and R is its radius.\n\nThe second cosmic velocity is the highest velocity an object can have to remain in orbit around a celestial body. It is higher than the first cosmic velocity, which is the minimum speed required to reach the celestial body from infinity. The first cosmic velocity is calculated using the formula v = sqrt(GM/R), which is the same as the second cosmic velocity formula.",
