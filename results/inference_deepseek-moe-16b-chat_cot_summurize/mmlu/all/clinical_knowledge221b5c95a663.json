            "content": " The Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon. It plays a crucial role in regulating muscle tension and preventing overuse injuries by detecting changes in muscle length and stiffness. When the Golgi tendon organ detects a sudden increase in muscle tension, it sends a signal to the spinal cord and brain, which then inhibits further muscle contraction to prevent injury.",
