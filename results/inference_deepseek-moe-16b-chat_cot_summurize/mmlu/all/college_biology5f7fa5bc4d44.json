If r is high, the probability of the recipient being related to the donor is also high, which increases the likelihood of the altruistic behavior being selected for evolution.\n\nHamilton's rule states that an altruistic trait can evolve if c < b*r, where c is the fitness cost of the altruistic behavior to the donor, b is the fitness benefit to the recipient, and r is the coefficient of relatedness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. coefficient of relatedness.",
