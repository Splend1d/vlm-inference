This is accomplished by a positive gradient of H+ ions that are formed outside the membrane which then pass back through a specialized channel known as ATP synthase. The energy created from this phosphorylates an ATP to an ATP, known as oxidative phosphorylation. The mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is known as what?\n\nA.

This is because the H+ ions are actively pumped back into the mitochondria against their concentration gradient, using the energy generated from the electron transport chain. This process is essential for maintaining the proper pH balance within the mitochondria and for generating new molecules of ATP.",
