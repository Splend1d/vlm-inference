            "content": " The correct answer is A. High niche divergence among co-occurring species.\n\nAn early-successional plant community is a type of plant community that is characterized by a high degree of environmental heterogeneity, such as open spaces, bare ground, and a diverse array of plant species. This type of community is typically found in areas that have recently undergone disturbance, such as logging, fire, or other forms of disturbance.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of an early-successional plant community is high niche divergence among co-occurring species. This means that each species in the community has a unique set of environmental requirements and is adapted to a specific set of conditions. This high degree of niche differentiation allows each species to occupy a specific niche in the community, which in turn allows the community to be more resilient to environmental changes.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily true for an early-successional plant community. High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass (B) and high frequency of K-selected species (C) are more characteristic of late-successional plant communities, while high detrital biomass (D) is not a characteristic of any type of plant community.",
