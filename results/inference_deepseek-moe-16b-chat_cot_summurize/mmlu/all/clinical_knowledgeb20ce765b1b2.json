            "content": " The correct answer is D. Tension headaches is a common cause of headache.\n\nTension headaches are the most common type of headache, accounting for about 4 out of 5 headaches. They are characterized by a feeling of tightness or pressure around the forehead, temples, or the back of the neck. Tension headaches are not usually severe and do not cause any neurological symptoms.\n\nA. When associated with neck stiffness is always due to meningitis: This statement is not true. While neck stiffness can be a symptom of meningitis, it is not always due to meningitis. Other causes of neck stiffness, such as a viral infection, can also occur.\n\nB. Severe pain usually indicates a life-threatening cause: This statement is not always true. While severe pain can be a sign of a serious medical condition, it is not always the case. Many conditions, such as tension headaches, can cause severe pain without being life-threatening.\n\nC. Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis: This statement is not true. Temporal arteritis is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the head and can cause headaches, but it is not strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis.",
