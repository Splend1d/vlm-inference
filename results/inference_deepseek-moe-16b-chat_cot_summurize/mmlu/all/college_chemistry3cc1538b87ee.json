            "content": " The Larmor frequency is given by the formula:\n\nf_L = (\u03b3 * B) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton (2.7928 * 10^10 Hz/T), B is the magnetic field strength (1 T), and \u03c0 is the mathematical constant \u03c0 (approximately 3.14159).\n\nf_L = (2.7928 * 10^10 Hz/T * 1 T) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nf_L = (2.7928 * 10^10 Hz) / (6.28318530718)\n\nf_L \u2248 4.471 * 10^9 Hz\n\nTo convert Hz to GHz, we divide by 1,000,000,000:\n\nf_L \u2248 4.471 * 10^9 Hz / 1,000,000,000\n\nf_L \u2248 4.471 * 10^-7 GHz\n\nTherefore, the Larmor frequency for a proton in a magnetic field of 1 T is approximately 4.471 * 10^-7 GHz, which is not listed in the given options. It is possible that the question is asking for the Larmor frequency of an electron instead of a proton, as the gyromagnetic ratio for an electron is different (\u03b3_e = 4.772136814 * 10^10 Hz/T). In that case, the Larmor frequency for an electron in a magnetic field of 1 T would be:\n\nf_L = (4.772136814 * 10^10 Hz/T * 1 T) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nf_L = (4.772136814 * 10^10 Hz) / (6.28318530718)\n\nf_L \u2248 7.683 * 10^8 Hz\n\nTo convert Hz to MHz, we divide by 1,000,000:\n\nf_L \u2248 7.683 * 10^8 Hz / 1,000,000\n\nf_L \u2248 7.683 * 10^-5 MHz\n\nTherefore, the Larmor frequency for an electron in a magnetic field of 1 T is approximately 7.683 * 10^-5 MHz, which is not listed in the given options. It is possible that the question is asking for the Larmor frequency of a neutron instead of an electron or proton, as the gyromagnetic ratio for a neutron is different (\u03b3_n = 1.008664915 * 10^10 Hz/T). In that case, the Larmor frequency for a neutron in a magnetic field of 1 T would be:\n\nf_L = (1.008664915 * 10^10 Hz/T * 1 T) / (2 * \u03c0)\n\nf_L = (1.008664915 * 10^10 Hz) / (6.28318530718)\n\nf_L \u2248 1.597 * 10^8 Hz\n\nTo convert Hz to MHz, we divide by 1,000,000:\n\nf_L \u2248 1.597 * 10^8 Hz / 1,000,000\n\nf_L \u2248 1.597 * 10^-6 MHz\n\nTherefore, the Larmor frequency for a neutron in a magnetic field of 1 T is approximately 1.597 * 10^-6 MHz, which is not listed in the given options. It is possible that the question is asking for the Larmor frequency of a hydrogen atom instead of a proton, as the gyromagnetic ratio for a hydrogen atom is different (\u03b3_H = 4.772136814 * 10^10 Hz/T). In that case, the Larmor frequency for a hydrogen atom in a magnetic field of 1 T would be:\n\nf_L = (4.772136814 * 10^10 Hz/",
