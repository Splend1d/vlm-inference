The speed of sound is affected by the frequency of the sound wave, the wavelength of the sound wave, and the temperature of the air. The relationship between the speed of sound, frequency, and wavelength is given by the equation:\n\nv = f \\* \u03bb\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound, f is the frequency of the sound wave, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave. The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the air, as the speed of sound is directly proportional to the temperature of the air. The equation for the speed of sound in air is:\n\nv = 331.5 + 0.606 \\* T\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound, T is the temperature of the air in degrees Celsius, and the constant 0.606 is the temperature coefficient for the speed of sound in air.",
