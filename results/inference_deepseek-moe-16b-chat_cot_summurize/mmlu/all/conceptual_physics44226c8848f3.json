Nucleons include protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. The mass of an atom is determined by the number of nucleons it contains.\n\nThe volume of an atom is mainly determined by its electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that surround the nucleus and occupy a specific volume around it. The volume of an atom is determined by the distribution and movement of its electrons.\n\nTherefore, the mass of an atom comes mostly from its nucleons, and its volume from its electrons.",
