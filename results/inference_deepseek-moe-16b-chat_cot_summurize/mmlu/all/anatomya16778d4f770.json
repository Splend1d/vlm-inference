Damage to this nerve can result in loss of somatic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII) supplies sensation to the posterior one-third of the tongue, while the lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) supplies sensation to the posterior one-third of the tongue and the tonsillar area. The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) supplies motor innervation to the muscles of the tongue.",
