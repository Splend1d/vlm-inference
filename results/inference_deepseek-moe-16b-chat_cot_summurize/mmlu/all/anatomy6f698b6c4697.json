The epigastric region is located in the upper central part of the abdomen, just below the xiphoid process of the sternum. It is bounded by the lower margin of the xiphoid process anteriorly, the linea alba laterally, and the costal cartilages of the fifth to seventh ribs posteriorly. The epigastric region contains the umbilicus and is the site of several important structures, including the stomach, liver, and pancreas.",
