            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the following formula:\n\nm = E / c^2\n\nwhere m is the rest mass of the particle, E is the total energy, and c is the speed of light (approximately 3.0 x 10^8 m/s).\n\nWe are given the total energy (E) as 5.0 GeV and the momentum (p) as 4.9 GeV/c. The momentum is related to the rest mass by the equation:\n\np = m * c\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the rest mass:\n\nm = p / c\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the equation:\n\nm = (4.9 GeV/c) / (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)\n\nm = 0.001667 GeV/c^2\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the rest mass:\n\nm = E / c^2\n\nm = (5.0 GeV) / (3.0 x 10^8 m/s)^2\n\nm = 0.001667 GeV/c^2\n\nThe rest mass of the particle is approximately 0.001667 GeV/c^2, which is equivalent to 0.1 GeV/c^2. Therefore, the answer is A.",
