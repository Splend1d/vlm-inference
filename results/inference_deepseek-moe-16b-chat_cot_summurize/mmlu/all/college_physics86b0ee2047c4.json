            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the energy conservation principle. When the first capacitor is disconnected from the battery, it will discharge through the other two capacitors in series. The total capacitance of the two capacitors is C_total = C1 + C2.\n\nThe energy stored in the first capacitor is given by:\n\nE_initial = 0.5 * C_initial * V_0^2\n\nWhen the first capacitor is disconnected, the energy is distributed between the other two capacitors. The energy stored in the second capacitor is:\n\nE_second = 0.5 * C_total * V_0^2\n\nThe energy stored in the first capacitor is:\n\nE_first = E_initial - E_second\n\nSince the energy stored in the first capacitor is conserved, we have:\n\n0.5 * C_initial * V_0^2 = 0.5 * C_total * V_0^2 - 0.5 * C_total * V_0^2\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\nC_initial = 0.5 * C_total\n\nNow, we can find the final voltage on the first capacitor by dividing the initial voltage by the final capacitance:\n\nV_final = V_0 / sqrt(C_initial)\n\nSubstituting the value of C_initial, we get:\n\nV_final = V_0 / sqrt(0.5 * C_total)\n\nSince the total capacitance is C1 + C2, we can write:\n\nC_total = C1 + C2 = 2 * C1\n\nSubstituting this value, we get:\n\nV_final = V_0 / sqrt(0.5 * 2 * C1)\n\nV_final = V_0 / sqrt(C1)\n\nSince the final voltage on the first capacitor is the same as the final voltage on the second capacitor, which is V_0/2, the answer is:\n\nC.
