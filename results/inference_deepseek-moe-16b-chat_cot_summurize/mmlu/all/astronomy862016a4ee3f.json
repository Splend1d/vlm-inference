            "content": " The rotation of a solid disk is an example of rotational motion, which is a type of motion where an object rotates around an axis. The velocity of an object in rotational motion is not the same at every point on the object. Instead, it varies depending on the distance from the axis of rotation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the velocity is not the same on every point on the disk. The velocity of an object in rotational motion is not constant and varies depending on the distance from the axis of rotation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the part closer to the axis does not have a longer period. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the object to complete one full rotation around the axis. The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the period of rotation is not the same on every point on the disk. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the object to complete one full rotation around the axis. The period of rotation is the same on every point on the disk.\n\nOption D is correct because the part closer to the axis has a shorter period. The period of rotation is the time it takes for the object to complete one full rotation around the axis. The part closer to the axis has a shorter distance to travel before completing one full rotation, so it has a shorter period.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.",
