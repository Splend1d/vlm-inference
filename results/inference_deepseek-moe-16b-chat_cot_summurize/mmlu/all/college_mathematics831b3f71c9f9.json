This is a well-known result in topology. The compactness of X implies that every open cover of X has a finite subcover. Therefore, any open cover of the range of f, say U, can be refined to a finite subcover of U. This means that f is uniformly continuous on X.\n\nStatement 2: If f(x), g(x) : R \u2192 R are everywhere differentiable f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable.\n\nProof:\n\nLet f(x) and g(x) be differentiable functions on R. Then, their derivatives exist and are continuous functions. Therefore, f(g(x)) is also differentiable.\n\nSo, both statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. True, True.",
