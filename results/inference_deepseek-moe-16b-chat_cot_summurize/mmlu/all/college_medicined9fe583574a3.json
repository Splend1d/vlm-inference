            "content": " The correct answer is C. A diversified and developed economy.\n\nThe World Systems Theory is a sociological model that explains the global economic and political relationships between different regions of the world. It divides the world into three subcategories: core countries, periphery countries, and semi-periphery countries.\n\nCore countries are the most economically developed and powerful nations, such as the United States, China, and the European Union. Periphery countries are less developed and economically dependent on the core countries, such as many African and Asian countries. Semi-periphery countries are in a transitional state between the core and periphery, with a more diversified and developed economy than the periphery but still economically dependent on the core countries.\n\nOption A, a strong central government, is not a defining characteristic of semi-periphery countries. Option B, an economy centered around one natural resource, is more applicable to periphery countries, which often rely on a single resource for their economy. Option D, a small percentage of very high-class individuals, is not a defining characteristic of semi-periphery countries.\n\nOption C, a diversified and developed economy, is the best answer for semi-periphery countries. These countries have a mix of industries and economic activities, and their economies are more developed than those of periphery countries but still rely on the core countries for certain goods and services.",
