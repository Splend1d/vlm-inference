Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBosons and fermions are two types of particles that follow different rules regarding the arrangement of their wave functions.\n\nBosons are particles that follow the Bose-Einstein statistics. These particles have symmetric wave functions, which means that the wave function is the same for particles in the same quantum state. Because of this symmetry, bosons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously without violating the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state.\n\nOn the other hand, fermions follow the Fermi-Dirac statistics. These particles have antisymmetric wave functions, which means that the wave function is different for particles in the same quantum state. Because of this asymmetry, fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Bosons have symmetric wave functions and obey the Pauli exclusion principle.",
