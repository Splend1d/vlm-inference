            "content": " The Giant Impact Hypothesis is the leading theory for the formation of the Moon. It suggests that a celestial object, approximately the size of Mars, collided with the early Earth, causing a massive impact and the ejection of debris into orbit. This debris eventually coalesced to form the Moon.\n\nA. The relative size of the Moon to the size of Earth is large compared to most planets and their moon. This is a result of the Giant Impact Hypothesis, as it explains why the Moon is so much larger than most other moons in the solar system.\n\nB. Most rocks on the Moon\u2019s surface are older than those on the Earth\u2019s surface. This is also a result of the Giant Impact Hypothesis, as it suggests that the Moon was formed from material that was older than the material that formed the Earth.\n\nC. The Moon has a much smaller iron core than the Earth even considering its size. This is a result of the Giant Impact Hypothesis, as it suggests that the impact that formed the Moon caused the Earth's core to be larger than the Moon's core.\n\nD. The Moon was once entirely molten. This is not a result of the Giant Impact Hypothesis, but rather a result of the Moon's formation. The Giant Impact Hypothesis suggests that the Moon was formed from material that was already solid, rather than being entirely molten.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The Moon was once entirely molten.",
