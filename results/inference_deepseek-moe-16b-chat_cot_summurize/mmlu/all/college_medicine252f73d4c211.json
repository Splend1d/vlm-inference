When oxygen is available, the final step of cellular respiration is the conversion of pyruvate to carbon dioxide and water through a process called aerobic respiration. This process releases a significant amount of energy in the form of ATP.\n\nHowever, if oxygen is not available, such as in a process called anaerobic respiration, pyruvate is converted to lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide and water. This process is less efficient at producing ATP and can lead to muscle fatigue and other negative effects.\n\nTherefore, when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, pyruvate will be the first molecule to stop being produced.",
