            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors.\n\nFirst, let's find the magnitude of the particle's velocity vector. The magnitude of a vector is the length of the vector, which can be found using the formula:\n\nMagnitude = \u221a(x^2 + y^2)\n\nIn this case, the x-component of the velocity vector is 10 m/s, and the y-component is 0 m/s (since the particle is moving in a circle). Therefore, the magnitude of the velocity vector is:\n\nMagnitude = \u221a(10^2 + 0^2) = \u221a(100) = 10 m/s\n\nNext, let's find the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors. The angle can be found using the formula:\n\nAngle = arctan(y/x)\n\nIn this case, the x-component of the acceleration vector is 10 m/s/s (since the acceleration is increasing at a rate of 10 m/s/s), and the y-component of the acceleration vector is 10 m/s/s (since the acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity). Therefore, the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is:\n\nAngle = arctan(10/10) = arctan(1) = 45\u00b0\n\nSo, the angle between the particle's velocity and acceleration vectors is 45\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 45\u00b0.",
