            "content": " To answer this question, we need to analyze each statement and compare it with the characteristics of horizontal and vertical microarchitectures.\n\nI. Programs for horizontal architectures require more time steps than those for vertical architectures.\nThis statement is false. In a horizontal architecture, instructions are fetched and decoded in parallel, which means that the time required to execute a program is directly proportional to the number of instructions. In a vertical architecture, instructions are fetched and decoded sequentially, which means that the time required to execute a program is directly proportional to the number of clock cycles. Therefore, programs for horizontal architectures require fewer time steps than those for vertical architectures.\n\nII. Horizontal microinstructions are unencoded.\nThis statement is false. In a horizontal microarchitecture, microinstructions are typically encoded in a way that allows for parallel execution of multiple instructions. This is in contrast to vertical microarchitectures, where microinstructions are typically encoded in a way that allows for sequential execution of instructions.\n\nIII. Horizontal microinstructions usually have a single opcode and multiple operand specifiers.\nThis statement is true. In a horizontal microarchitecture, microinstructions are typically encoded in a way that allows for parallel execution of multiple instructions. This is achieved by having a single opcode that specifies the operation to be performed, and multiple operand specifiers that specify the operands for that operation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III only.",
