            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of eigenvectors and invertible matrices.\n\nAn eigenvector v of a matrix A is a vector such that Av = \u03bbv for some scalar \u03bb. The matrix A is invertible if and only if the columns of A are linearly independent, which means that no column is a linear combination of the others.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\nI. v is also an eigenvector of 2A.\nThis is not necessarily true. Consider the matrix A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] and the eigenvector v = [1, 1]. Then, 2A = [[2, 0], [0, 2]], but v is not an eigenvector of 2A.\n\nII. v is also an eigenvector of A^2.\nThis is not necessarily true. Consider the matrix A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] and the eigenvector v = [1, 1]. Then, A^2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], but v is not an eigenvector of A^2.\n\nIII. v is also an eigenvector of A^(-1).\nThis is not necessarily true. Consider the matrix A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] and the eigenvector v = [1, 1]. Then, A^(-1) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], but v is not an eigenvector of A^(-1).\n\nTherefore, none of the statements I, II, and III are necessarily true.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$.",
