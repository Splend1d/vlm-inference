The alveoli, which are tiny air sacs in the lungs, are where the gas exchange takes place. The oxygen from the air we breathe diffuses across the thin walls of the alveoli and into the blood, while the carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses across the walls of the capillaries and into the alveoli. The capillaries then carry the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body, where it is used to produce energy and the carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs to be exhaled.",
