Each octahedron is surrounded by six other octahedra to form a three-dimensional network of atoms.\n\n2. \u03b2-Boron (or black boron): This is a soft, dark, and amorphous solid that is made up of B4 tetrahedra. Each tetrahedron is surrounded by four other tetrahedra to form a three-dimensional network of atoms.\n\n3. \u03b3-Boron (or pink boron): This is a soft, dark, and amorphous solid that is made up of B8 cubes. Each cube is surrounded by six other cubes to form a three-dimensional network of atoms.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. B6 octahedra.",
