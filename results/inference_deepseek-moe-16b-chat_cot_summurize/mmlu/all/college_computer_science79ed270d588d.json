This means that the key is as long as the message, and each bit of the key is used only once. This makes it impossible for an attacker to guess the key, as there are 2^n possible keys, where n is the length of the key.\n\nThe Caesar Cipher, a substitution cipher, is not secure because it uses a fixed shift, which can be easily broken. DES, a symmetric-key algorithm, is also not secure because it uses a fixed key that is the same for both encryption and decryption. Enigma, a transposition cipher, is also not secure because it uses a fixed rotor system that can be easily broken.\n\nTherefore, the One-time pad is the most secure encryption scheme.",
