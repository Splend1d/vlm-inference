            "content": " The correct answer is D. Roughly half ices and half rocky materials.\n\nPluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy objects beyond Neptune's orbit. Its surface temperature is extremely low, around -40\u00b0C, due to its distance from the Sun.\n\nThe surface of Pluto is primarily composed of ices, which are frozen mixtures of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. These ices can be found in various forms, such as water ice, methane ice, and carbon monoxide ice. The surface also contains rocky materials, which are thought to be composed of various minerals and rocks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the surface of Pluto is not mainly composed of water ice. While there is water ice on Pluto, it is not the dominant component.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the surface of Pluto is not mainly composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices. These ices sublimate (change from a solid to a gas) into an atmosphere near perihelion (the point in its orbit where it is closest to the Sun).\n\nOption C is incorrect because the surface of Pluto is not mainly composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices. These ices sublimate into an atmosphere near perihelion.\n\nOption D is correct because the surface of Pluto is roughly half composed of ices and half composed of rocky materials. The ices are primarily composed of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, while the rocky materials are thought to be composed of various minerals and rocks.",
