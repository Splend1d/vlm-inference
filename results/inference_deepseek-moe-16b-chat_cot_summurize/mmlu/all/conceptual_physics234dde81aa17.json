This energy travels through space and reaches the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed and then re-emitted as heat. This process is known as thermal radiation.\n\nConduction and convection are both heat transfer mechanisms that occur within a material, while radiation is the transfer of heat through space. While conduction and convection can also play a role in the transfer of heat from the Sun to the Earth, radiation is the primary mechanism by which heat is transferred.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Radiation.",
