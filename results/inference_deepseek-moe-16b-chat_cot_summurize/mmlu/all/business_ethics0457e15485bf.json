Social Mission: The primary goal of a social enterprise is to address social, cultural, or environmental issues. This mission is often aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n2. Market-Based Approach: Social enterprises operate in a market-based environment, generating revenue through the sale of goods or services. This revenue is then used to fund the social mission.\n\n3. Financial Sustainability: Social enterprises must be financially sustainable to ensure long-term success. This can be achieved through a variety of means, such as generating revenue through the sale of goods or services, securing grants or donations, or leveraging partnerships.\n\n4. Impact Measurement: To ensure that the social mission is being effectively addressed, social enterprises must measure and report on their impact. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as surveys, data analysis, or third-party evaluations.\n\nBy combining these four components, social enterprises can effectively address social, cultural, or environmental issues while also generating revenue and achieving financial sustainability.",
