Saturn has a larger proportion of hydrogen and helium than Jupiter and is therefore less dense.\n\nJupiter is composed of heavier elements such as rock and metal, which are denser than the lighter elements found in Saturn, such as hydrogen and helium. As a result, Jupiter is more compressed and has a higher density than Saturn. This is why Saturn, despite having a smaller mass, can be almost as big as Jupiter.",
