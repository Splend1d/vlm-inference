Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control\nB. High self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control\nC.

This is not indicative of low self-esteem, but rather a strong desire to excel. Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of David.\n\nOption A is incorrect because David's perfectionism and self-criticism do not indicate low self-esteem. He is not comparing himself to others and feeling inadequate, but rather striving to be the best he can be.\n\nOption C is incorrect because David's perfectionism and self-criticism do not indicate an external locus of control. He is not blaming external factors for his inability to master a section of his music, but rather taking responsibility for his own performance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because David's perfectionism and self-criticism do not indicate low self-efficacy. He is not lacking confidence in his ability to master his music, but rather is pushing himself to improve.",
