When palmitic acid is completely oxidised in the body, it releases a lot of energy. This is because the bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms are strong, so the energy released when the bonds are broken is high.\n\nA, C, and D are all amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. When they are completely oxidised in the body, they release less energy than palmitic acid. This is because the bonds between the carbon and hydrogen atoms in amino acids are not as strong as the bonds in palmitic acid, so the energy released when the bonds are broken is lower.",
