Testosterone is a male sex hormone that plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testes and prostate, as well as in the development of secondary male sexual characteristics, such as increased muscle mass and body hair. Progesterone is a female sex hormone that plays a key role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and the development of the placenta.\n\nTriglycerides are a type of lipid molecule that are composed of three fatty acid molecules bonded to a glycerol molecule. They are the main form of energy storage in the body and are used as a source of energy when glucose is not available.\n\nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that contains the genetic information required to develop and maintain an organism. It is made up of two strands that are coiled together in a double helix. The information in DNA is stored in the form of a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). This code is used by cells to produce proteins, which are essential for the proper functioning of the body.",
