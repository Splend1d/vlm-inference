When the head is lowered, blood flows from the veins in the head and neck into the heart. If the heart is not pumping efficiently, the blood can pool in the veins, causing them to become congested. This can be seen as a pulsation in the neck.\n\nA. A waggling earlobe is not specific to arterial pulsation and can be seen in other conditions as well.\n\nB. Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse is not specific to arterial pulsation and can be seen in other conditions as well.\n\nD. No variation with posture is not specific to arterial pulsation and can be seen in other conditions as well.",
