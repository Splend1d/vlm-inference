            "content": " To solve this problem, we can use the disk method of integration. The disk method involves integrating the area of the region over the interval of integration. In this case, we are rotating the region bounded by the curves y = x and y = x^2 about the y-axis.\n\nFirst, we need to find the limits of integration. Since the region is bounded by the y-axis, we will integrate from 0 to 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the area of each disk. The area of a disk is given by A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the disk. In this case, the radius is the x-coordinate of the points where the curves intersect, which is 1 for the curve y = x and 1 for the curve y = x^2.\n\nSo, the area of each disk is A = \u03c0(1)^2 = \u03c0.\n\nFinally, we need to integrate the area of the disks over the interval of integration. The volume of the resulting solid of revolution is given by the integral:\n\nV = \u222b[0, 1] A(x) dx\n\n= \u222b[0, 1] \u03c0 dx\n\n= \u03c0[x] evaluated from 0 to 1\n\n= \u03c0(1 - 0)\n\n= \u03c0\n\nSo, the volume of the resulting solid of revolution is \u03c0.
