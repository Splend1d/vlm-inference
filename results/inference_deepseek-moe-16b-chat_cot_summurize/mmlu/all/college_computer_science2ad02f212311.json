It divides memory into units of equal size.\nThis statement is not necessarily true for a purely segmented memory system. In a segmented memory system, memory is divided into segments, but the size of these segments can vary.\n\nII. It permits implementation of virtual memory.\nThis statement is true. A purely segmented memory system can support virtual memory, which allows a process to use more memory than is physically available.\n\nIII. It suffers from internal fragmentation.\nThis statement is also true. In a purely segmented memory system, internal fragmentation occurs when the available memory is divided into small, non-contiguous segments, which can reduce the efficiency of the memory system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and III.",
