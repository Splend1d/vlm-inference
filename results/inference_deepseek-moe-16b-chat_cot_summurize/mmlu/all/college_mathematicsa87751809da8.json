            "content": " To solve the equation cos(97x) = x, we can use the double angle formula for cosine, which states that cos(2x) = 2cos^2(x) - 1.\n\nSubstituting x = 97x/2, we get cos(97x/2) = 2cos^2(97x/2) - 1.\n\nSince cos(97x) = cos(97x/2), we can equate the two expressions:\n\ncos(97x) = 2cos^2(97x/2) - 1.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n2cos^2(97x/2) = cos(97x) + 1.\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\ncos^2(97x/2) = (cos(97x) + 1)/2.\n\nUsing the identity cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\n1 - sin^2(97x/2) = (cos(97x) + 1)/2.\n\nRearranging the equation, we get:\n\nsin^2(97x/2) = cos(97x) + 1 - 2.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n\nsin^2(97x/2) = 1 - 2.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^2(97x/2) = -1.\n\nSince sin^2(x) is always non-negative, we have a contradiction. Therefore, there are no positive solutions for x that satisfy the equation cos(97x) = x.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{None}}$.",
