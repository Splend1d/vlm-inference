The set of polynomials with coefficients in R, R[x], forms a ring under the operations of addition and multiplication. Since R is an integral domain, the set of polynomials with coefficients in R is also an integral domain. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: If R is a ring and f(x) and g(x) are in R[x], then deg (f(x)g(x)) = deg f(x) + deg g(x).\n\nThe degree of a polynomial f(x) in R[x] is the highest power of x that appears in f(x). The degree of the product of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) is the maximum of the degrees of f(x) and g(x). Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nSo, both statements are true, which means the answer is A. True, True.",
