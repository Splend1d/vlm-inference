It is not associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face, so option B is incorrect. The Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with glycosylation of certain secretory proteins, so option D is incorrect. The Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, so option A is incorrect. The Golgi apparatus is not typically associated with small secretory vesicles located near its cis face, so option B is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, which states that the composite flattened cisternae of the Golgi apparatus are continuous with one another.",
