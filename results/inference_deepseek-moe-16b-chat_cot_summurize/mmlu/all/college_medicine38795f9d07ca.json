To coat the proteins with a large positive charge, since amino acid side chains may have positive, negative, or neutral charges, and a large uniform charge is necessary to get good separation in the gel.\nB. To allow the electrophoresis to separate the proteins solely on the basis of the length of the primary sequence.\nC. To prevent the protein from denaturing so that the electrophoresis can accurately resolve the proteins on the basis of tertiary structure.\nD. To break the intramolecular bonds holding the tertiary and primary structure of the protein together, thereby generating linear fragments that may be sorted on size.\n",

            "content": " The SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) serves as a detergent in SDS-PAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) by breaking the hydrophobic interactions between the protein molecules, which helps to solubilize the proteins and denature them. This allows the proteins to be separated based on their size and charge, rather than their tertiary structure. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
