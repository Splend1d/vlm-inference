When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This correlation demonstrates:\n\nA. the value of cultural capital.\nB. a meritocracy. \nC. he value of social capital.\nD. a false association.\n",

            "content": " The correct answer is C. The value of social capital.\n\nThe study found that students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were more likely to be admitted. This suggests that having a strong social network, or social capital, can be beneficial in gaining admission to highly selective colleges. The correlation between social network and alumni network was +0.61, which is a strong positive correlation.\n\nA, B, and D are not correct because they do not accurately describe the findings of the study. A, the value of cultural capital, is not directly related to the admissions process at selective colleges. B, a meritocracy, suggests that admissions are based solely on merit, which is not the case at highly selective colleges. D, a false association, is not accurate because the correlation between social network and alumni network was positive and statistically significant.",
