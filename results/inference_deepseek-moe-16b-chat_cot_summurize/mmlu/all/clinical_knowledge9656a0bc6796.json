            "content": " The correct answer is C. Itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice.\n\nJaundice is a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes caused by a buildup of bilirubin, a yellow pigment that is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin is not used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells. Instead, it is processed by the liver and excreted in the bile, which is then released into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of fats.\n\nThe other options are not true:\n\nA. Pale stools and dark urine are not characteristic of the jaundice of haemolytic anaemia. Instead, these symptoms are more commonly associated with liver disease.\n\nB. Bilirubin is not used by the liver in the synthesis of red blood cells.\n\nD. Putting a danger of infection sticker on blood samples from an intravenous drug user with jaundice is not optional. It is important to take precautions to prevent the spread of infection, and stickers can help identify samples that may pose a risk.",
