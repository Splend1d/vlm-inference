If the kernel is empty, it means that every element in the domain gets mapped to a non-identity element in the codomain, which is not possible for a homomorphism. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: It is not possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of some finite group into some infinite group.\nA nontrivial homomorphism is a homomorphism that is not the trivial homomorphism (i.e., the identity homomorphism). The statement is true. There are indeed groups that are infinite, such as the group of integers under addition, and there are also groups that are finite, such as the group of integers under multiplication. Therefore, it is possible to have a nontrivial homomorphism of a finite group into some infinite group.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
