It was introduced as a way to simplify the process of connecting devices to a network, as it eliminates the need for entering a password. WPS works by allowing devices to communicate with each other and establish a secure connection without the need for a password. This makes it easier for users to connect their devices to a network, but it also means that the network is less secure, as the password is not required for authentication.",
