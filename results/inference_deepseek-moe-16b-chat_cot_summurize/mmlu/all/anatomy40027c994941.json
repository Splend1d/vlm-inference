The palatal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors.\n\nDental plaque is a sticky film of bacteria that forms on the teeth, especially in areas where food particles can get stuck. It is the primary cause of dental cavities and gum disease. The surfaces of the teeth where dental plaque is most likely to accumulate are:\n\n1. The palatal surfaces of the upper molars: These are the back teeth at the top of the mouth. They are difficult to clean properly, and food particles can easily get stuck in the grooves and crevices.\n\n2. The lingual surfaces of the lower incisors: These are the lower front teeth, which are in close proximity to the tongue. The tongue can easily transfer bacteria from the mouth to these teeth, leading to plaque accumulation.\n\nIn contrast, the buccal surfaces of the upper molars and labial surfaces of the lower incisors are less likely to accumulate plaque because they are more easily accessible for cleaning with a toothbrush.",
