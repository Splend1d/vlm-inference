The amount of bending or refraction of each color depends on its wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the more it is bent.\n\nIn this case, green light has a slightly longer wavelength than blue light. When white light enters a prism, the prism bends the light so that the blue light is refracted more than the green light. This is because the prism is more effective at bending the shorter wavelengths, which are blue and violet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. violet light.",
