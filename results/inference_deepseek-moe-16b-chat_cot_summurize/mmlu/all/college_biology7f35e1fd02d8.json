In a cross between a tall violet plant, with the genotype DDWw, and a dwarf white plant, what phenotypic ratio of the progeny would be expected from this cross?\n\nA.

            "content": " In this cross, the tall violet plant has the genotype DDWw, which means it has two dominant alleles for tallness (D) and one dominant allele for violet flower color (W) and one dominant allele for white flower color (w). The dwarf white plant has the genotype ddWW, which means it has two recessive alleles for dwarfness (d) and one dominant allele for violet flower color (W) and one dominant allele for white flower color (w).\n\nWhen these two plants are crossed, the tall violet plant will pass on its dominant alleles for tallness and violet flower color to its offspring. The dwarf white plant will pass on its dominant alleles for dwarfness and violet flower color to its offspring.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio of the progeny can be calculated using the Punnett square method. The tall violet plant has a 100% chance of passing on the dominant allele for tallness (D) to its offspring, and a 50% chance of passing on the dominant allele for violet flower color (W) and a 50% chance of passing on the dominant allele for white flower color (w). The dwarf white plant has a 100% chance of passing on the dominant allele for dwarfness (d) to its offspring, and a 50% chance of passing on the dominant allele for violet flower color (W) and a 50% chance of passing on the dominant allele for white flower color (w).\n\nUsing the Punnett square method, we can calculate the probability of each possible genotype in the offspring. The tall violet plant will pass on its dominant alleles for tallness and violet flower color to its offspring, so the offspring will have a genotype of DDWw. The dwarf white plant will pass on its dominant alleles for dwarfness and violet flower color to its offspring, so the offspring will have a genotype of ddWW.\n\nThe phenotypic ratio of the offspring can be calculated by multiplying the probability of each genotype by the total number of offspring. The probability of each genotype is as follows:\n\n* DDWw: 100% (1/1)\n* ddWW: 50% (1/2)\n* DdwWw: 0% (0/1)\n* ddWwW: 0% (0/1)\n* DdWWW: 0% (0/1)\n\nThe total number of offspring is 100%, so the phenotypic ratio of the offspring is:\n\n* DDWw: 100%\n* ddWW: 50%\n* DdwWw: 0%\n* ddWwW: 0%\n* DdWWW: 0%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio of the progeny from this cross is 1 tall violet: 1 tall white: 1 dwarf violet: 1 dwarf white.",
