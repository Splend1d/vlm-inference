In this stage, which occurs between the ages of 1-3, a child's primary focus is on controlling their bowel and bladder movements. If a child experiences any difficulties or discomfort during this stage, it can lead to a fixation on cleanliness and orderliness. The young man's difficulty with productivity and organization may be a manifestation of this fixation.",
