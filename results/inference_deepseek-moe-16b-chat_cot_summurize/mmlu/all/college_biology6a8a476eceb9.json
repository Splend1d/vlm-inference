This includes animals such as fish, whales, and other marine creatures, as well as some protists, which are single-celled organisms that can move independently.\n\nA. Whale: Whales are marine mammals and not nektonic organisms. They are not capable of independent movement and rely on their large size and strength to move through the water.\n\nB. Barnacle: Barnacles are marine crustaceans that attach themselves to surfaces and do not have the ability to swim or move independently. They are not nektonic organisms.\n\nC. Cyanobacterium: Cyanobacteria are a type of bacteria that can photosynthesize and are commonly found in aquatic environments. While some species of cyanobacteria can move using flagella, they are not nektonic organisms.\n\nD. Protist: Protists are a diverse group of single-celled eukaryotes that can move independently. They include organisms such as amoebae, paramecia, and ciliates, which are capable of locomotion through the use of flagella, cilia, or pseudopodia. Protists are nektonic organisms.",
