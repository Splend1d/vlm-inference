The recommendations provided by the task force are based on the self-esteem hypothesis, the contact hypothesis, and the hypothesis.\n\nThe self-esteem hypothesis suggests that people with high self-esteem are less likely to engage in prejudice and hate crimes. The contact hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that people who interact with those from different groups are less likely to hold prejudiced attitudes. The hypothesis refers to the idea that laws and regulations can play a role in reducing prejudice and hate crimes.\n\nOption B, II, III, and IV, is incorrect because it does not include the self-esteem hypothesis, which is a key component of the task force's recommendations. Option C, I, III, and IV, is also incorrect because it does not include the contact hypothesis, which is another key component of the task force's recommendations. Option D, I, II, and IV, is incorrect because it does not include the legal hypothesis, which is a third key component of the task force's recommendations.",
