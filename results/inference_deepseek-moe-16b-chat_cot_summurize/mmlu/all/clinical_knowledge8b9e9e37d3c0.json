This is because health care staff may not be aware of the patient's pain experience, or they may not fully understand the patient's pain level. They may also be influenced by their own biases or assumptions about the patient's pain. Therefore, it is important for the patient to communicate their pain level accurately so that the healthcare staff can provide appropriate care.",
