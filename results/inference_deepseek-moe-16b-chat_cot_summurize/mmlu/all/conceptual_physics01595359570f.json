All of these\n\nTo solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between a magnetic field and a current in a closed loop of wire. According to Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction, when a closed loop of wire is moved through a changing magnetic field, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced in the loop. This EMF creates a current in the loop.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. current",
