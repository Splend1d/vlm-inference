Relativistic speeds.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, describes the behavior of objects moving at high speeds relative to an observer. The theory states that time and space are relative, and that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.\n\nThe equations that describe the behavior of objects moving at relativistic speeds are:\n\n1. Time dilation: t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n2. Length contraction: L' = L / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n3. Mass-energy equivalence: E = mc^2\n\nThese equations describe the effects of time dilation, length contraction, and mass-energy equivalence on objects moving at relativistic speeds. They are not applicable to everyday low speeds, as the effects of relativity are only noticeable at speeds close to the speed of light.",
