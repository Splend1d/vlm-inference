            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the principle of conservation of momentum. When the karate chop is delivered, the force exerted by the hand on the board is equal to the force exerted by the board on the hand.\n\nLet's assume that the force exerted by the hand on the board is F1, and the force exerted by the board on the hand is F2. According to the principle of conservation of momentum, we have:\n\nF1 * time_hand = F2 * time_board\n\nSince the board breaks, we can assume that the force exerted by the hand is equal to the force exerted by the board, which is 3000 N. Therefore, we have:\n\nF1 = 3000 N\n\nNow, let's consider the force exerted by the board on the hand. Since the board breaks, the force exerted by the board on the hand is greater than 3000 N. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. greater than 3000 N",
