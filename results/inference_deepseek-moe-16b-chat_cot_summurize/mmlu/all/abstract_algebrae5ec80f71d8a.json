By definition, an element of order 10 generates a cyclic subgroup of order 10, which contains elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.\n\nStatement 2: If a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it has an element of order 6.\n\nThis statement is false. While it is true that an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 generate a cyclic subgroup of order 6, this does not guarantee the existence of an element of order 6 in the group. For example, consider the group of integers under addition. The element 0 has order 1, the element 1 has order 2, and the element 2 has order 3. However, there is no element of order 6 in this group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
