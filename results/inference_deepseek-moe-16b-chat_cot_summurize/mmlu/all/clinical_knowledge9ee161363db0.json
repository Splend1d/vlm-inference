This is achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including increasing the number and size of mitochondria in muscle cells, improving the efficiency of the aerobic energy system, and increasing the number of capillaries in muscle tissue. These changes allow the body to sustain prolonged periods of activity without relying heavily on anaerobic energy production, which is more limited in terms of energy output and produces more byproducts that must be removed from the body.",
