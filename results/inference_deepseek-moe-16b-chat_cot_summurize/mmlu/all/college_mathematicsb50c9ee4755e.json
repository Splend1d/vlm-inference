The distance formula is given by:\n\nd = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nIn this case, we want to find the distance from the origin to the curve xy = 8. So, we can set x = 0 and y = 0, and then solve for the other variable.\n\n0 = 8 - 0\n0 = 8\n\nSince this equation has no solution, the curve xy = 8 does not intersect the origin. Therefore, the shortest distance from the curve to the origin is 0, which is not one of the given options.",
