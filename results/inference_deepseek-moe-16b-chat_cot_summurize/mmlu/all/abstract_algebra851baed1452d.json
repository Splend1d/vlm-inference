The order of a group is the number of elements in the group. So, if there is a positive integer n, then there must be a group of order n, and this group is cyclic. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group.\nA cyclic group of order n has an element of order n. If n is not a prime number, then n has divisors other than 1 and n. Therefore, there must be an element of order d, where d is a divisor of n. So, this statement is also true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A. True, True.",
