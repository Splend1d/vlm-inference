            "content": " To find the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D, we need to analyze the action of D on a basis of P.\n\nLet's consider the basis {1, x, x^2, ..., x^7} of P. The derivative of each basis element is:\n\n1(x^0) = 1\nx(x^1) = x\nx^2(x^2) = x^2\n...\nx^7(x^7) = x^7\n\nSo, the action of D on each basis element is linear and can be represented as a matrix:\n\n| 1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 |\n| 0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0 |\n| 0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0 |\n| 0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0 |\n| 0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0 |\n| 0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0 |\n| 0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0 |\n| 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1 |\n\nNow, we can find the null space n and range r of D by analyzing the rows of this matrix.\n\n1. The first row represents the derivative of the constant term, which is 0. This means that the null space n contains the constant polynomial 1.\n\n2. The second row represents the derivative of the linear term, which is x. This means that the null space n contains the linear polynomial x.\n\n3. The third row represents the derivative of the quadratic term, which is 2x. This means that the null space n contains the quadratic polynomial 2x.\n\n4. The fourth row represents the derivative of the cubic term, which is 3x^2. This means that the null space n contains the cubic polynomial 3x^2.\n\n5. The fifth row represents the derivative of the quartic term, which is 4x^3. This means that the null space n contains the quartic polynomial 4x^3.\n\n6. The sixth row represents the derivative of the quintic term, which is 5x^4. This means that the null space n contains the quintic polynomial 5x^4.\n\n7. The seventh row represents the derivative of the sextic term, which is 6x^5. This means that the null space n contains the sextic polynomial 6x^5.\n\n8. The eighth row represents the derivative of the septimal term, which is 7x^6. This means that the null space n contains the septimal polynomial 7x^6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the range r of D. The range of D is the set of all polynomials in P that can be obtained by applying the derivative operator to some polynomial in P. In other words, r = P.\n\nSince P has 7 elements, the range r has 7 elements.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the null space n and range r of D are:\n\nn = 1 (constant polynomial)\nr = 7 (polynomial space)\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.",
