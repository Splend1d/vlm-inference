When the buffer is doubled in volume, the concentration of the weak acid remains the same, but the concentration of the conjugate base is also doubled. This means that the ratio of acid to conjugate base remains the same, and therefore the pH of the buffer remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. It has little effect.",
