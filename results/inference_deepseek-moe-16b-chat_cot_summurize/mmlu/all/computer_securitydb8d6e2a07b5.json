The following are some common methods of authentication:\n\nA. Secret question: This method involves the user providing a personal question and answer that only they would know. This can be used in conjunction with other methods to provide an additional layer of security.\n\nB. Biometric: This method involves using a user's unique physical or behavioral characteristic to verify their identity. Examples of biometric methods include fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, and voice recognition.\n\nC. SMS code: This method involves sending a unique code to the user's mobile phone via SMS. The user must then enter this code into the system in order to complete the authentication process. This method is often used in conjunction with other methods, such as a password or biometric scan.\n\nBy using multiple authentication methods, it is much more difficult for an unauthorized user to gain access to a system or account.",
