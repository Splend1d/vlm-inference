Ethernets use buses with multiple masters.\n\nEthernet networks use a bus topology, which means that all devices are connected to a single cable. However, this does not mean that there are multiple masters on the bus. In fact, Ethernet networks use a \"carrier sense multiple access with collision detection\" (CSMA/CD) protocol, which allows multiple devices to share the same bus. The first device to send a message on the bus is the \"master\" and the other devices are \"slaves.\" When a collision occurs, all devices on the bus stop transmitting and wait for a random amount of time before trying again. This prevents multiple devices from transmitting at the same time and ensures that messages are transmitted properly.",
