By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups (subgroups of order 7) divides 6 and is congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 7-subgroup, say H. Since H is the unique Sylow 7-subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nStatement 2: Every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 8.\n\nProof: Let G be a group of order 42. By the Sylow theorems, the number of Sylow 2-subgroups (subgroups of order 2) divides 21 and is congruent to 1 modulo 2. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 2-subgroup, say K. Since K is the unique Sylow 2-subgroup, it is normal in G.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, and the correct answer is A. True, True.",
