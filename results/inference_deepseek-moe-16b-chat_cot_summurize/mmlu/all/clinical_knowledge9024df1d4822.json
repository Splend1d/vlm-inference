This community is known as the oral microbiome. The number of different types of microorganisms that can colonize the mouth is estimated to be around 350.\n\nThe oral microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health. It helps to prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria and supports the immune system. However, an imbalance in the oral microbiome can lead to various oral health issues, such as tooth decay, gum disease, and bad breath.\n\nTo maintain a healthy oral microbiome, it is essential to practice good oral hygiene, such as brushing and flossing regularly, and visiting the dentist for regular checkups. Additionally, consuming a balanced diet, staying hydrated, and avoiding smoking can also help to support a healthy oral microbiome.",
