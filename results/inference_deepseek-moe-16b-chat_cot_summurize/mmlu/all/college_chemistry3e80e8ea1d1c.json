The nuclei of heavy elements have more neutrons than protons in order to provide sufficient binding energy to hold the nuclei together.\n",

The nuclei of heavy elements do not have more neutrons than protons in order to provide sufficient binding energy to hold the nuclei together. The binding energy per nucleon actually decreases as the mass number of the nucleus increases, so adding neutrons to a nucleus does not necessarily increase its binding energy. In fact, adding neutrons can actually decrease the binding energy, as they introduce additional electrostatic repulsion between the protons in the nucleus.",
