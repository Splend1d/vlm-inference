            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of power, which is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is dissipated. The power dissipated by a resistor is directly proportional to the square of the voltage across it.\n\nLet's denote the original power dissipated (1 W) as P1 and the original voltage across the resistor as V1. We are given that the new voltage across the resistor is doubled, so the new voltage is 2V1.\n\nAccording to the given information, the new power dissipated is P2, and we need to find the value of P2.\n\nUsing the formula for power, we have:\n\nP2 = (V2)^2 / R\n\nwhere V2 is the new voltage and R is the resistance of the resistor.\n\nSince the power dissipated is directly proportional to the square of the voltage, we can write:\n\nP2 = k * P1\n\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values of P1 and V2 into the equation:\n\nP2 = k * P1 = k * (V1)^2\n\nWe know that the original power dissipated is 1 W, so P1 = 1 W. We also know that the new voltage is 2V1, so V2 = 2V1.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we get:\n\nP2 = k * (1)^2 = k\n\nSince the power dissipated is directly proportional to the square of the voltage, the constant of proportionality k is equal to 1. Therefore, the new power dissipated is:\n\nP2 = 1 * (2V1)^2 = 1 * 4V1^2 = 4V1^2\n\nSo, the new rate of energy dissipation is 4 W.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 4 W.",
