The period is the time it takes for the pendulum to complete one full cycle, from one high point to the next. It is a measure of the frequency of the pendulum's oscillations and is inversely proportional to the amplitude of the oscillations. The period is usually expressed in seconds, minutes, or hours, depending on the application.",
