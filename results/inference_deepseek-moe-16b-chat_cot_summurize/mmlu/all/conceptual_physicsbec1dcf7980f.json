This is because the satellite is at a higher altitude, and the gravitational force decreases with altitude. The gravitational force on the satellite is balanced by the centripetal force required to maintain its circular orbit. The centripetal force is provided by the satellite's engines, and it is equal to the gravitational force acting on the satellite. Therefore, the satellite's speed is constant, and it remains in orbit.",
