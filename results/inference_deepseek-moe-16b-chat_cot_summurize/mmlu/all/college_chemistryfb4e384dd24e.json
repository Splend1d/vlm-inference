This is not a characteristic of mass spectrometry, but rather a process that occurs during mass spectrometry.\n\nII. The ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio. This is a characteristic of mass spectrometry.\n\nIII. In addition to compound identification, mass spectra can be utilized to determine precise isotopic masses and isotopic ratios. This is not a characteristic of mass spectrometry, but rather a potential application of mass spectrometry.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. I and II only.",
