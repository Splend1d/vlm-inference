It arises from the external carotid artery just above the zygomatic arch (the bony prominence on each side of the face just in front of the ear).\n\nThe facial artery passes through the parotid gland and then divides into two branches: the superficial temporal artery and the angular artery. The superficial temporal artery passes behind the tragus of the ear and then ascends along the side of the face, crossing the zygomatic arch just below the level of the mandible (option A).\n\nThe facial artery also gives off the anterior auricular artery, which passes behind the ear and supplies the skin of the front of the ear and the side of the face.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. facial artery crosses the mandible.",
