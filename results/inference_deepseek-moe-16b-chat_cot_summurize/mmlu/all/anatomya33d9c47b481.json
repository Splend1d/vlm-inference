            "content": " The correct answer is B. Glomerulus.\n\nThe glomerulus is the cluster of blood capillaries found in each nephron in the kidney. It is responsible for filtering waste and excess substances from the blood. The glomerulus is made up of a network of capillaries called the capillary tuft, which is surrounded by a cup-shaped structure called the Bowman's capsule. The Bowman's capsule is the starting point of the nephron, and it is responsible for reabsorbing water and electrolytes back into the bloodstream.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Afferent arteriole: This is the artery that supplies blood to the glomerulus.\n\nC. Loop of Henle: This is a part of the nephron that helps regulate the concentration of the urine.\n\nD. Renal pelvis: This is the part of the nephron that collects urine before it is excreted from the body.",
