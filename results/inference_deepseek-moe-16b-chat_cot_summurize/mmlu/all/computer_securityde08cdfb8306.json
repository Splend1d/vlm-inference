Comparing the TTL values of the actual and spoofed addresses.\n\nIP address spoofing is the act of forging the IP address of a host in a communication. This is often done to hide the identity of the sender, or to make it appear as if the message came from a trusted source.\n\nOne way to detect IP address spoofing is to compare the TTL (Time To Live) values of the actual and spoofed IP addresses. The TTL value is a field in the IP header that specifies the number of hops that a packet can make before it is discarded. If a packet has a TTL value that is significantly lower than the TTL value of the actual IP address, it is likely that the packet has been spoofed.\n\nOther methods of detecting IP address spoofing include analyzing the IP header for anomalies, using network monitoring tools to detect unusual traffic patterns, and implementing security policies that restrict the use of certain IP addresses.",
