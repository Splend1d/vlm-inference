            "content": " The correct answer is B. The ammonia produced during the deamination of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in muscle is mostly converted into alanine and glutamine and released from the muscle.\n\nWhen BCAAs are deaminated in muscle, the resulting ammonia is toxic to the muscle cells. However, the ammonia can be converted into alanine and glutamine, which are then released from the muscle cells. These amino acids can be used by other cells in the body for various purposes, such as energy production or protein synthesis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ammonia produced during BCAAs deamination is not converted into arginine and released from the muscle. Instead, it is converted into alanine and glutamine.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the ammonia produced during BCAAs deamination is not converted into urea and released from the muscle. Instead, it is converted into alanine and glutamine.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the ammonia produced during BCAAs deamination is not used to synthesise purines and pyrimidines in the muscle. Instead, it is converted into alanine and glutamine.",
