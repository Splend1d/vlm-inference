The warm solution helps to increase blood flow to the area and can also help to reduce any discomfort or pain that may be experienced during the procedure.\n\nIt is important to note that the temperature of the solution should not be too hot, as this could cause burns or other injuries. The solution should be warm, but not hot, to the touch.\n\nThe other options (cold, refrigerated, and room temperature) are not appropriate for bladder washout solutions, as they could cause discomfort or other negative effects.",
