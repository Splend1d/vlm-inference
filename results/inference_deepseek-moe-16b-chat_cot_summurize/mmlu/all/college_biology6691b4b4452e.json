            "content": " The correct answer is D. They lower the activation energy, thereby speeding up the conversion of reactants to products.\n\nEnzymes are biological molecules that act as catalysts, speeding up the rate of chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. They do this by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur. Activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that reactant molecules must have in order to react with each other. If the activation energy is too high, the reaction will not occur at all.\n\nEnzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules and forming an enzyme-substrate complex. This complex has a lower activation energy than the individual reactant molecules, so the reaction is more likely to occur. Once the reaction is underway, the enzyme releases the products and returns to its original state, ready to catalyze the next reaction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because enzymes do not raise the temperature of the reaction mixture. In fact, they work best at a specific temperature, which is often close to body temperature.\n\nOption B is incorrect because enzymes do not alter the equilibrium constant (K_eq) of a reaction. They only affect the rate of the forward reaction, not the equilibrium.\n\nOption C is incorrect because enzymes do not increase the maximal rate of the chemical reaction (V_max). They simply make the reaction occur more quickly by lowering the activation energy.",
