This is correct. The suspensor is a specialized region of the embryo sac that is derived from the basal cell of the suspensor cell.\n\nB. Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell. This is also correct. The cotyledons are derived from the apical cell of the suspensor.\n\nC. Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation. This is incorrect. The shoot apical meristem forms during embryogenesis, before seed formation.\n\nD. Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis. This is correct. During embryogenesis, the three primary plant tissue systems (meristematic, ground, and vascular) are formed.",
