When microscopic slush is added to water, it does not change the density of the water. In fact, the slush will likely float on the surface of the water, as it is less dense than water.\n\nB. less dense: This statement is also incorrect. When microscopic slush is added to water, it does not change the density of the water. In fact, the slush will likely float on the surface of the water, as it is less dense than water.\n\nC. more slippery: This statement is incorrect. When microscopic slush is added to water, it does not make the water more slippery. In fact, the slush may make the water more difficult to walk on, as it can create a thin layer of ice.\n\nD. warmer: This statement is correct. When microscopic slush is added to water, it can cause the water to become warmer. This is because the slush will absorb heat from the surrounding environment, which can cause the water to heat up. Additionally, the slush can create a barrier between the water and the cold air, which can also cause the water to become warmer.",
