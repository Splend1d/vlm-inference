            "content": " When 10.0 mL of 0.1 M HCl is added to the saturated Mg(OH)2 solution, the HCl reacts with the Mg(OH)2 to form H2O and MgCl2. The reaction is as follows:\n\nMg(OH)2(s) + 2HCl(aq) \u2192 MgCl2(aq) + 2H2O(l)\n\nSince the reaction is an acid-base reaction, it consumes H2O from the solution, which decreases the total amount of water in the solution. Therefore, the solubility of Mg(OH)2 decreases, which means that the Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Ksp for Mg(OH)2 increases.",
