            "content": " The quantum efficiency of a photon detector is the probability that a photon will be detected when it is present. In this case, the quantum efficiency is 0.1, which means that the detector is only 10% efficient in detecting photons.\n\nIf 100 photons are sent into the detector, one after the other, the total number of photons that will be detected is 100 * 0.1 = 10. However, since the detector is only 10% efficient, the actual number of photons that will be detected is 10 / 0.1 = 100.\n\nThe average number of photons detected is 100, and the standard deviation of the number of photons detected is 0.1. Therefore, the answer is D. The detector will detect photons an average of 10 times, with an rms deviation of about 0.1.",
