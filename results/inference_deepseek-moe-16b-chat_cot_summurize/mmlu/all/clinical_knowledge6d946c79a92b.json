Lipoproteins are complex molecules that consist of a lipid (fat) core surrounded by protein. They play a crucial role in the transport of lipids, including FFAs, throughout the body.\n\nFFAs are produced by the liver from stored triglycerides through a process called lipolysis. These FFAs are then released into the bloodstream and can be transported to other tissues, such as muscles and adipose tissue, for energy production or storage.\n\nThere are several types of lipoproteins that transport FFAs, including very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). These lipoproteins are composed of a core of triglycerides surrounded by a layer of protein, including apolipoproteins and albumin.\n\nIn summary, most of the free fatty acids in the blood are transported as lipoproteins, which are complex molecules that consist of a lipid core surrounded by protein and play a crucial role in the transport of lipids throughout the body.",
