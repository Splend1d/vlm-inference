The kidneys of saltwater fishes produce urine that is hypoosmotic to their tissues. This is because the kidneys of saltwater fishes have a high concentration of ions, which makes the urine hypoosmotic.\n\nB. The kidneys of desert mammals produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the urine of freshwater fishes. This is because the kidneys of desert mammals have a low concentration of ions, which makes the urine hyperosmotic.\n\nD. Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney do not allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine. The kidneys of mammals, including humans, produce urine that is hypoosmotic to their tissues.",
