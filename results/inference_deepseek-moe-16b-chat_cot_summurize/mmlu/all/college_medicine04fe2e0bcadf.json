This is an example of olfactory adaptation, which is a type of sensory adaptation that occurs when the brain becomes less sensitive to a particular stimulus over time.\n\nA, B, and C are all examples of neural adaptation as well. A is an example of tactile adaptation, which is a type of sensory adaptation that occurs when the brain becomes less sensitive to a particular stimulus over time.
