So, we need to find the product (2,3)(3,5) in Z_5 x Z_9.\n\n(2,3)(3,5) = (2*3 + 5*2, 3*3 + 5*5) = (11, 25)\n\nNow, we need to find the elements (a,b) and (c,d) in Z_5 x Z_9 such that (11, 25) = (1*a + 5*b, 1*c + 5*d).\n\nFrom the given elements (2,3) and (3,5), we can see that (a,b) = (2,3) and (c,d) = (3,5).\n\nSo, (11, 25) = (2*3 + 5*2, 3*3 + 5*5) = (11, 25)\n\nTherefore, the product in the given ring is (11, 25) = (1,1).\n\nSo, the correct answer is A.
