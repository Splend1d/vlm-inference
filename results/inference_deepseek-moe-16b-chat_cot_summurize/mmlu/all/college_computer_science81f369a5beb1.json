The paging system is a memory management technique used by computer systems to manage the memory.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nI. An advantage of larger pages is that they lead to smaller page tables. This is true because larger pages mean fewer page table entries, which leads to smaller page tables.\n\nII. An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation. This is true because smaller pages lead to more fragmentation, which can be wasteful.\n\nIII. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously. This is true because the dominant factor in disk access time is the rotational speed of the disk, which is not affected by the page length.\n\nSo, all three options (I, II, and III) apply to choosing the page size in a paging system.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and III.",
