ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP is the primary energy source for muscle contraction, as it provides the energy needed for muscle fibers to contract and relax. When ATP is broken down, it releases energy that is used to power muscle contractions.\n\nADP (Adenosine Diphosphate) and phosphocreatine are also involved in energy production, but they are not the primary source of energy for muscle contraction. Oxidative phosphorylation is a process that occurs in the mitochondria and is involved in generating ATP from nutrients, but it is not the direct source of energy for muscle contraction.",
