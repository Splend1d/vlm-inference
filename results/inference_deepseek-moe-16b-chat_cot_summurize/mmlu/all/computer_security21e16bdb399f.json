Transport Layer Security Protocol.\n\nThe Transport Layer Security (TLS) or its predecessor, the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is a protocol used to establish secure communication over a network. It is used to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that only the sender and the intended recipient can read the information.\n\nThe Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is a protocol used in the TLS and SSL protocols to provide confidentiality, data origin authentication, and data integrity. It is used to protect the entire payload of a packet, including the IP header, TCP header, and the data itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Transport Layer Security Protocol, as it is the protocol that encapsulates the ESP.",
