In R^2, any two vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of each other. If we have two vectors v1 and v2, we can write v1 = a1*v2 and v2 = a2*v1 for some scalars a1 and a2. This means that v1 and v2 are linearly dependent, and thus not linearly independent. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\nStatement 2: If V = span(v1, ... , vk) and {v1, ... , vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.\n\nThis statement is also true. The dimension of a vector space is the number of linearly independent vectors that span the space. If we have k linearly independent vectors in V, then they span the entire space, and thus dim(V) = k.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. True, True.",
