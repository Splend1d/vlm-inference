            "content": " Paget's Disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by the excessive growth of bone tissue, leading to weakened bones that are more prone to fractures. The disease primarily affects the bones of the pelvis, skull, spine, and legs, but it can also affect other bones in the body.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Bowing of a long bone is a characteristic feature: This is not true. While Paget's Disease can cause bone deformities, bowing of a long bone is not a characteristic feature of the disease.\n\nB. Spinal cord compression is a common complication: This is not true. While Paget's Disease can cause compression of the spinal cord in some cases, it is not a common complication.\n\nC. Heart failure is not a recognized complication: This is not true. Heart failure can be a complication of Paget's Disease, particularly in older patients.\n\nD. Pathological fractures are not a feature: This is true. Pathological fractures are not a feature of Paget's Disease.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. Pathological fractures are not a feature of Paget's Disease.",
