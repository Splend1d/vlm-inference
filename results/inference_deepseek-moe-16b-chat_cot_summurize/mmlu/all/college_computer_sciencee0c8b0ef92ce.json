This policy ensures that the job with the shortest execution time is always executed first, preventing any job from waiting indefinitely for service.\n\nRound-robin, priority queuing, and youngest job first are not starvation-free policies. In Round-robin, jobs are executed in a round-robin fashion, and if a job has a longer execution time than others, it may wait indefinitely for service. Priority queuing assigns priorities to jobs, but it does not guarantee that any job will be executed. Youngest job first does not guarantee that any job will be executed, as it only considers the job's age and not the execution time.",
