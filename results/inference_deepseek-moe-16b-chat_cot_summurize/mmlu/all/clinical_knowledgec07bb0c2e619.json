This sound is more prominent in expiration because the movement of the chest wall and the lung during expiration causes the pleural surfaces to rub against each other. The other options do not specifically suggest a pleural friction rub. Option B, altering with coughing, could suggest a pneumothorax, while options C and D are not specific to a pleural friction rub.",
