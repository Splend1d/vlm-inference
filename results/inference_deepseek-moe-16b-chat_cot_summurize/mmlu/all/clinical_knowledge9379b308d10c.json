            "content": " The correct answer is A. Glutamine.\n\nWhen the rate of glycolysis is high, the production of lactic acid increases. This lactic acid can lower the pH of the cell, which can be harmful to the cell. To prevent this, the cell uses glutamine as an intracellular buffer. Glutamine can be converted to glutamic acid and ammonium, which can help to neutralize the lactic acid and maintain the pH of the cell.\n\nB. Glucose is a source of energy for the cell, but it does not act as a buffer to limit pH changes.\nC. Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of two amino acids, histidine and alanine, and it is found in high concentrations in muscle tissue. It can help to buffer pH changes, but it is not specific to glycolysis.\nD. Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simple sugars, such as glucose. It does not act as a buffer to limit pH changes.",
