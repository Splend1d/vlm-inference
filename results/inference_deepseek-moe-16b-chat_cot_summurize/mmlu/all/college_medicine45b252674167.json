The gunshot came from an actor inside a car traveling 108 km/h, and it was recorded by a camera on a platform 200 meters away traveling at 72 km/h in the same direction. If the frequency of the gunshot is normally 800Hz, what is the perceived frequency which the camera picks up the gunshot at?\n\nA. 941 Hz\nB. 787 Hz\nC. 924 Hz\nD. 912 Hz\n",

            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the Doppler effect, which is the change in frequency of a wave (such as light, sound, or radio waves) when the source of the wave and the observer are moving relative to each other. In this case, the source of the wave is the gunshot, and the observer is the camera.\n\nThe Doppler effect formula is given by:\n\nf = f0 \u00b1 (v/c) * (f0 - f)\n\nwhere f is the frequency of the observed wave, f0 is the frequency of the source wave, v is the relative velocity between the source and the observer, and c is the speed of light.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the following values:\n\nf0 = 800 Hz (the normal frequency of the gunshot)\nv = 108 km/h (the speed of the car)\nv = 72 km/h (the speed of the camera)\nc = 3 x 10^8 m/s (the speed of light)\n\nWe need to find the perceived frequency (f) that the camera picks up the gunshot at.\n\nFirst, we need to convert the speeds from km/h to m/s:\n\nv = 108 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 30 m/s\nv = 72 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 20 m/s\n\nNow, we can plug these values into the Doppler effect formula:\n\nf = 800 Hz \u00b1 (30 m/s / (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (800 Hz - f)\n\nf = 800 Hz \u00b1 (30 m/s / (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (800 Hz - 800 Hz)\n\nf = 800 Hz \u00b1 (30 m/s / (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * 0\n\nSince the observer (the camera) is moving in the same direction as the car, the frequency of the gunshot is shifted towards the higher frequency (higher pitch). Therefore, the perceived frequency is:\n\nf = 800 Hz + (30 m/s / (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * (800 Hz - 800 Hz)\n\nf = 800 Hz + (30 m/s / (3 x 10^8 m/s)) * 0\n\nf = 800 Hz\n\nSo, the answer is A. 941 Hz.",
