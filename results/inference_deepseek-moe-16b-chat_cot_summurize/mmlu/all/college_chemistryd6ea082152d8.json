CH3F: The 1H resonance frequency of CH3F is approximately 4.00 kHz.\nB. CH3Cl: The 1H resonance frequency of CH3Cl is approximately 3.20 kHz.\nC. CH3Br: The 1H resonance frequency of CH3Br is approximately 2.90 kHz.\nD. CH3I: The 1H resonance frequency of CH3I is approximately 2.50 kHz.\n\nComparing the resonance frequencies of the compounds, we can see that the 1H resonance frequency of CH3I is closest to the given frequency of 1.55 kHz. Therefore, the correct answer is D. CH3I.",
