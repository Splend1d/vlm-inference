A reentrant program is one that can be interrupted and reentered without loss of data or integrity. This is important in a multiprogrammed system because multiple users may need to access the program simultaneously.\n\nOption I, \"The program is a macro,\" is not relevant to the sharing of a single copy of a program among several users. A macro is a sequence of commands that can be recorded and played back, but it does not affect the sharing of a program among multiple users.\n\nOption II, \"The program is recursive,\" is also not relevant to the sharing of a single copy of a program among several users. Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself. It does not affect the sharing of a program among multiple users.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, \"II and III only.\"",
