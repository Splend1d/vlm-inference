Instead, the cache holds onto the data until the cache is flushed or the cache is replaced. In this case, the cache will only write back the data if the cache is replaced or flushed.\n\nSince the loop only adds the elements of arrays A and B, the only writes to memory will be the initial write of the first element of array A at physical address 4,096, and the subsequent writes to array B at physical address 8,192. These writes will be written back to memory when the cache is replaced or flushed.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bytes written to memory will be 2, as the initial write of the first element of array A and the subsequent writes of the elements of array B will be written back to memory.",
