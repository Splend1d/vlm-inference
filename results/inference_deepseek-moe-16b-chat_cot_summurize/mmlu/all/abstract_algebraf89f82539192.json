In a finite dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to a basis for the space. This is because every linearly independent set of vectors has a finite number of elements, and by adding more vectors to the set, we can always ensure that the new vectors are linearly independent as well. Therefore, every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis.\n\nStatement 2: If B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.\n\nThis statement is also true. In a finite dimensional vector space, the number of vectors in any two bases for the same vector space is equal. This is because every vector in the space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors, and the number of basis vectors in a basis is equal to the dimension of the space. Therefore, if B_1 and B_2 are bases for the same vector space, then |B_1| = |B_2|.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A. True, True.",
