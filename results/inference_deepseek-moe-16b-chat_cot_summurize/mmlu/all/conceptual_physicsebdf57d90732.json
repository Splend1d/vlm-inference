            "content": " The specific heat capacity of sand is higher than that of vegetation. This is because sand has a higher density and a lower moisture content, which means it can store more heat energy before it starts to cool off. In contrast, vegetation has a lower density and a higher moisture content, which means it can store less heat energy before it starts to cool off. Therefore, compared to vegetation, sand cools off faster at night.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. lower.",
