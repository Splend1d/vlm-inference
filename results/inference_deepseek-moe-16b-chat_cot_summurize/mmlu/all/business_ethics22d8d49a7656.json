            "content": " The correct answer is D. The UK Public Services (Social Value) Act 2013 requires those procuring public services to consider how they can secure wider social, economic, and environmental benefits. The act aims to encourage public authorities to think about the social, cultural, and environmental impact of their procurement decisions, and to seek to secure benefits that go beyond the direct provision of the service.\n\nThe act defines social value as the wider economic, social, environmental, and cultural well-being of the area in which the service is provided. It requires public authorities to consider how they can secure these benefits when procuring services, and to report on how they have done so.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the act specifically refers to public services, not private services. Option B is incorrect because the act does not specifically mention cultural benefits. Option C is incorrect because the act does not specifically mention economic benefits.",
