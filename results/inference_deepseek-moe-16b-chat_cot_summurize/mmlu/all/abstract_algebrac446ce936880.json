In this case, the order of (Z_11 x Z_15) is |Z_11| * |Z_15| = 11 * 15 = 165.\n\nNow, we need to find the order of the subgroup (<1, 1>). The order of a subgroup is the smallest positive integer n such that (a^n) = (b^n) for all elements a and b in the subgroup. In this case, the subgroup is generated by the element (1, 1), so the order of the subgroup is the smallest positive integer n such that (1, 1)^n = (1, 1).\n\nSince (1, 1)^2 = (1, 1), the order of the subgroup is 2.\n\nFinally, we divide the order of (Z_11 x Z_15) by the order of the subgroup (<1, 1>):\n\n165 / 2 = 82.5\n\nSince the order of a group must be an integer, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) is 82.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 11.",
