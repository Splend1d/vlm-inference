            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: Every integral domain with characteristic 0 is infinite.\nAn integral domain is a commutative ring with unity in which the product of any two nonzero elements is always nonzero. The characteristic of a ring is the highest power of the unity that appears in any element of the ring. If the characteristic of an integral domain is 0, then the unity does not appear in any nonzero element of the ring. This means that every nonzero element in the ring has a multiplicative inverse, and thus the ring is infinite.\n\nStatement 2: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.\nA prime characteristic is a characteristic that is a prime number. In an integral domain, a prime characteristic means that the unity is a prime element. If the unity is a prime element, then the only possible divisors of the unity are 1 and the unity itself. This means that the only possible units in the ring are 1 and the unity itself, and thus the ring is finite.\n\nSince both statements are true, the correct answer is:\n\nA. True, True",
