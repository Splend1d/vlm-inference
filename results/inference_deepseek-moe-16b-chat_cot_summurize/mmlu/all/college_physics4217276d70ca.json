            "content": " The wavelength at which a blackbody emits or absorbs the most energy is known as its peak wavelength. For a body with a surface temperature close to 300 K, the peak wavelength can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates the total energy radiated by a blackbody to its surface area and temperature.\n\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann law is given by:\n\nB = \u03c3T^4\n\nwhere B is the total energy radiated by the blackbody per unit time, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W/m^2 K^4), T is the temperature of the blackbody, and B is the total energy radiated by the blackbody per unit time.\n\nTo find the peak wavelength, we need to find the value of T for which B is maximum. This can be done by taking the derivative of B with respect to T and setting it equal to zero.\n\nd(B)/dT = 4 * \u03c3T^3 = 0\n\nSolving for T, we get:\n\nT = 0 K\n\nHowever, this is not a physically meaningful solution, as it corresponds to a blackbody at absolute zero temperature. Instead, we can use the fact that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. Therefore, we can write:\n\nT = k * \u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb is the peak wavelength and k is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo find k, we can use the fact that the peak wavelength of a blackbody at 300 K is 500 nm:\n\n500 nm = k * 300 K\n\nSolving for k, we get:\n\nk = 500 nm / 300 K = 1.67 x 10^-7 m/K\n\nNow, we can use this value of k to find the peak wavelength for a body with a surface temperature of 300 K:\n\n\u03bb = 300 K / k = 300 K / (1.67 x 10^-7 m/K) = 1800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
