This is because a three component mixture can form two immiscible phases (e.g. oil and water) and one miscible phase (e.g. oil in water). The two immiscible phases can be in equilibrium with each other, but the miscible phase cannot be in equilibrium with both immiscible phases at the same time. Therefore, the maximum number of phases that can be at equilibrium with each other is 2 immiscible phases + 1 miscible phase = 3.",
