            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of impulse and momentum. Impulse is the product of force and time, and it is equal to the change in momentum. Momentum is the product of mass and velocity.\n\nLet's break down the problem into two parts: when the force is applied and when the force is removed.\n\n1. When the force is applied:\nThe box starts with a speed of 1 m/s and accelerates to a speed of 2 m/s in 5 seconds. The force applied is constant, so the acceleration is constant as well. Therefore, the change in momentum during this time is:\n\n\u0394p = m * v1 - m * v2\n\u0394p = 10 kg * 1 m/s - 10 kg * 2 m/s\n\u0394p = -10 kg m/s\n\nSince the force is applied in the direction of motion, the impulse (change in momentum) is equal to the force applied multiplied by the time it is applied:\n\nImpulse = F * t\nImpulse = -10 kg m/s * 5 s\nImpulse = -50 Ns\n\n2. When the force is removed:\nThe box is already moving with a speed of 2 m/s. The force is removed, and the box continues to move with the same speed. The change in momentum during this time is:\n\n\u0394p = m * v2\n\u0394p = 10 kg * 2 m/s\n\u0394p = 20 kg m/s\n\nSince the force is removed, the impulse is equal to the change in momentum:\n\nImpulse = F * t\nImpulse = 20 kg m/s / 5 s\nImpulse = 4 Ns\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 4 N.",
