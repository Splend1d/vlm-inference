            "content": " To find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) about the x-axis, we can use the disk method. The disk method involves integrating the square of the function's radius (which is the x-coordinate) with respect to the x-coordinate.\n\nThe volume V of the solid generated is given by:\n\nV = \u222b[0,1] \u03c0[f(x)]^2 dx\n\nSince f(x) = x/(1 + x^3), we can rewrite the integral as:\n\nV = \u222b[0,1] \u03c0[x/(1 + x^3)]^2 dx\n\nTo simplify the integrand, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\nV = \u222b[0,1] \u03c0[x(1 + x^3)]/(1 + x^6) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to x:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u222b[0,1] (1 + x^3) dx / (1 + x^6)\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the substitution method. Let u = 1 + x^3, so du = 3x^2 dx. The integral becomes:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u222b[1,4] du / u^2\n\nNow, we can integrate with respect to u:\n\nV = \u03c0 \u222b[1,4] 1/u^2 du\n\nV = \u03c0 [1/u] | [1,4]\n\nV = \u03c0 [1/4 - 1/1]\n\nV = \u03c0/4\n\nSo, the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region bounded by the function f(x) = x/(1 + x^3) about the x-axis is \u03c0/4.
