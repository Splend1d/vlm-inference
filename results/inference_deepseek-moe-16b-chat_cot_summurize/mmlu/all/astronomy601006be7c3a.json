The Phoenix Mars Lander, which was launched on August 4, 2007, and landed on May 25, 2008, was designed to study the polar ice-rich soil of Mars. Its main objectives were to determine if the planet's surface has conditions favorable for microbial life, and to study the composition of the soil and ice. The Phoenix Mars Lander was equipped with a robotic arm that was used to dig trenches in the soil, which was then analyzed by a variety of instruments on board the lander. Unfortunately, the Phoenix Mars Lander's mission was cut short when it encountered a dust storm in June 2008, which prevented it from communicating with Earth.",
