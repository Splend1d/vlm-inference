These transporters are activated by insulin, which helps the glucose to enter the cell. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nB. Insulin is not the only factor that influences glucose transport into the muscle cell. Other factors, such as exercise and hormonal changes, can also affect glucose uptake.\n\nC. Hexokinase is an enzyme that converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate, but it does not transport glucose into the cell.\n\nD. Monocarbylic acid transporters are involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the cell, not glucose.",
