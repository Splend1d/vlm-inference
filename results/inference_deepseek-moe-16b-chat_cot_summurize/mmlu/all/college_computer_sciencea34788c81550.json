            "content": " The height-balanced binary search tree is a type of binary search tree where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. This type of tree is also known as an AVL tree.\n\nI. The worst-case search time in a height-balanced binary search tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because in a height-balanced binary search tree, the tree is always approximately balanced, and the search operation requires traversing at most log(n) nodes, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nII. The average-case search time in a height-balanced binary search tree is also logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because the average case is determined by the worst-case scenario, and since the worst-case search time is logarithmic, the average-case search time is also logarithmic.\n\nIII. The best-case search time in a height-balanced binary search tree is proportional to the height of the tree. This is because in the best-case scenario, the search operation requires traversing only a single node, which is the node containing the target value. The height of the tree is the maximum path length from the root to a leaf, so the best-case search time is proportional to the height of the tree.\n\nIV. The height of the tree is logarithmic in the number of nodes. This is because in a height-balanced binary search tree, the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. Therefore, the height of the tree is always at most log(n) + 1, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and IV are all true of a height-balanced binary search tree.",
