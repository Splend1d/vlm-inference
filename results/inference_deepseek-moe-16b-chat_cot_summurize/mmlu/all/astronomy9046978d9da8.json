Earth.\n\nPlate tectonics is the theory that the Earth's outer shell is divided into several plates that move around on the mantle, which is the layer of hot rock beneath the Earth's crust. These plates interact with each other in various ways, such as colliding, sliding past each other, or moving apart. This movement causes earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountains and ocean trenches.\n\nMars and Earth are the only planets in the solar system with active plate tectonics. Venus, on the other hand, does not have active plate tectonics. Its crust is not broken up into plates, and its surface is dominated by volcanic activity and a few large impact craters.",
