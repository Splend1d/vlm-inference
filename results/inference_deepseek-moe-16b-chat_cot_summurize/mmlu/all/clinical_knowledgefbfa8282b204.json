Closed pouches are typically applied in the immediate post-operative period to allow for the healing of the surgical site and to prevent leakage of output. Closed pouches are also used in patients who have a colostomy or urostomy, but these situations are not specific to the immediate post-operative period. Closed pouches are not typically used for patients with a semi-formed or liquid output, as this would not provide the necessary protection for the surgical site.",
