Ethics of duty, Utilitarianism, Consequentialist\n\nIn this question, we are asked to identify the correct relationship between three concepts: ethics of duty, utilitarianism, and consequentialism.\n\n1. Ethics of duty: This is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's moral obligations and duties. It is based on the idea that individuals have a moral obligation to act in a way that is consistent with their moral duties, regardless of the potential consequences of their actions.\n\n2. Utilitarianism: This is a consequentialist moral theory that holds that the morally right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure. In other words, the morally right action is the one that produces the most good for the most people.\n\n3. Consequentialism: This is a moral theory that holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the most good or happiness. Consequentialism is a type of consequentialist theory that focuses on the consequences of actions, rather than the intentions or motivations behind them.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is C. Ethics of duty, Utilitarianism, Consequentialist. The ethics of duty is a type of consequentialist theory that focuses on the consequences of actions, and utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure. Consequentialism is a broader category that includes both ethics of duty and utilitarianism.",
