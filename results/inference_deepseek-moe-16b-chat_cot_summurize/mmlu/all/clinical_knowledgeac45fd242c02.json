A low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features in a patient with haematemesis, as they may indicate internal bleeding or other serious conditions.\n\nB is incorrect because a pulse rate of 80/min in a patient taking Bisoprolol is not necessarily reassuring, as pulse rate can be affected by many factors other than medication.\n\nC is incorrect because abdominal pain is not always present in a patient with haematemesis. In some cases, there may be no abdominal pain at all.\n\nD is incorrect because an alcohol history is not essential to diagnose haematemesis. Haematemesis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including gastrointestinal bleeding, liver disease, and bleeding disorders.",
