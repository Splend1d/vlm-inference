The number of elements in the product of two subgroups H and K of a group G can be expressed as the product of the orders of the subgroups, divided by the order of the intersection of the subgroups.\n\nStatement 2: A group of order 2p where p is an odd prime is cyclic or isomorphic to D_p.\n\nThis statement is also true. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, a group of order 2p (where p is an odd prime) is either cyclic or isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is:\n\nA.
