Reducing inorganic substances such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen.\n\nChemosynthetic bacteria are a group of microorganisms that can produce their own food by using inorganic compounds as a source of energy and reducing power. These bacteria are found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and other environments where there is a lack of sunlight.\n\nIn these environments, the bacteria obtain their energy by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as ammonia, sulfur, or hydrogen. They use these compounds as a source of electrons, which they obtain from the reduction of inorganic compounds. The bacteria then use these electrons to produce energy-rich molecules such as ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).\n\nThe process of reducing inorganic compounds is called chemosynthesis. The bacteria use the energy stored in these molecules to produce organic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These organic compounds are then used by the bacteria to grow and reproduce.\n\nIn contrast, the other options are not correct. Option A is incorrect because the bacteria do not oxidize inorganic substances to produce energy. Option C is incorrect because the bacteria do not use organic compounds as a source of energy. Option D is incorrect because the bacteria do not use light energy to produce chemical energy.",
