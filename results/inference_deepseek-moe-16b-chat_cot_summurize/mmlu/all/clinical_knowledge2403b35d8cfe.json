The stoma is the opening through which the ileal pouch is connected to the small intestine, and it is typically located in the lower abdominal area. The location of the stoma is determined by the surgeon based on the individual's anatomy and the type of surgery performed. The stoma should be sited in a location that allows for easy access for pouch emptying and cleaning, while also minimizing the risk of leakage and infection.",
