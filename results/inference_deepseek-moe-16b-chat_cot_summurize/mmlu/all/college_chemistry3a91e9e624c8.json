            "content": " The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that for a quantum mechanical particle, the product of the uncertainties in position (\u0394x) and momentum (\u0394p) cannot be smaller than a certain constant, \u0127/2, where \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant. This means that the more precisely one property is known, the less precisely the other can be known.\n\nIn the case of a particle in a one-dimensional box, the particle can only have certain discrete energy levels. The lowest energy level is at x = 0, and the particle can only have integer values of x in this level. The momentum of the particle is related to its energy by the equation p = \u0127k/2, where k is the wave number of the particle. The wave number is related to the momentum by the equation k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength of the particle.\n\nWhen the particle is in the lowest energy level, its momentum is zero, and the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at its maximum, \u0127/2. This means that the position of the particle can be known exactly, and no information about its momentum can be known.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. Position is known exactly, but no information about momentum can be known.",
