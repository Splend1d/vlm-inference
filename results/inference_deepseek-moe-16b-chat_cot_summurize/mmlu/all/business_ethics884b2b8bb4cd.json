Normative, Moral and Instrumental\nC. Political, Descriptive and Instrumental\n\nD. Normative, Descriptive and Instrumental.\n\nThe three types of stakeholder theory are:\n\n1. Normative: This type of stakeholder theory focuses on the moral and ethical obligations of organizations towards their stakeholders. It suggests that organizations have a responsibility to act in the best interests of their stakeholders, and that this responsibility should be reflected in their decision-making processes.\n2. Descriptive: This type of stakeholder theory focuses on the current practices and behaviors of organizations towards their stakeholders. It suggests that organizations should analyze their current practices and behaviors towards stakeholders and identify areas for improvement.\n3. Economic: This type of stakeholder theory focuses on the economic benefits that organizations can derive from engaging with their stakeholders. It suggests that organizations can benefit from building strong relationships with their stakeholders, as this can lead to increased profitability and long-term sustainability.\n\nAll three types of stakeholder theory are important for organizations to consider when developing their stakeholder management strategies. By taking a holistic approach that incorporates all three types of stakeholder theory, organizations can ensure that they are meeting the needs of all their stakeholders, while also achieving their own goals and objectives.",
