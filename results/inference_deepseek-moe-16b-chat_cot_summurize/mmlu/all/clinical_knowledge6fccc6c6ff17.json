A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, either by a clot (ischemic stroke) or by a bleed (hemorrhagic stroke). This interruption can cause brain cells to die, leading to cognitive decline and dementia.\n\nOther causes of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, and HIV infection, are less common in the UK. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, but it is not the most common cause of dementia overall. Lewy body dementia is a less common type of dementia that is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies, which are abnormal protein deposits in the brain. HIV infection can cause dementia, but this is more common in people with HIV who do not have access to treatment.",
