Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration.\n\nBronchial breathing is a type of breathing pattern that is characterized by a longer and louder inspiratory phase, followed by a longer and louder expiratory phase, with a gap or pause between the two phases. This pattern is often seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory conditions.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the expiratory component is not louder and longer than the inspiratory component. Option C is incorrect because the inspiratory component is not louder and longer than the expiratory component. Option D is incorrect because the expiratory phase is not longer and louder than the inspiratory phase.",
