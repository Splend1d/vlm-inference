These outcomes are interrelated and contribute to the overall success of a company's CSR initiatives.\n\nSocial policies refer to the guidelines and standards that a company sets for its operations and behavior. These policies can cover a wide range of topics, including environmental protection, labor standards, and human rights. By establishing clear social policies, a company can demonstrate its commitment to responsible business practices and build trust with stakeholders.\n\nSocial programs are the specific initiatives that a company implements to address social issues. These programs can take many forms, such as community outreach, employee volunteer programs, or donations to charitable organizations. By investing in social programs, a company can make a positive impact on the communities in which it operates and demonstrate its commitment to social responsibility.\n\nSocial impacts refer to the outcomes of a company's CSR initiatives. These impacts can be measured in a variety of ways, such as increased employee engagement, improved community relations, or reduced environmental impacts. By tracking and measuring social impacts, a company can demonstrate the effectiveness of its CSR efforts and make adjustments as needed to maximize its impact.\n\nIn summary, the three outcomes of CSR identified by Wood (1991) are social policies, social programs, and social impacts. These outcomes are interrelated and contribute to the overall success of a company's CSR initiatives.",
