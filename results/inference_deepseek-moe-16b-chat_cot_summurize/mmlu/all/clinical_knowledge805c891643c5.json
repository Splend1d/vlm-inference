            "content": " The correct answer is C. It is best to test vibration sense with a 256 Hz tuning fork.\n\nIn a sensory assessment of the arm, various sensory modalities are tested, including light touch, pain, temperature, and vibration. The correct answer is C because vibration sense is best tested using a 256 Hz tuning fork. This frequency is within the range of human vibration perception and is widely used in clinical practice to assess vibration sense.\n\nA is incorrect because it is not acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle. Venepuncture needles are used for blood sampling and are not designed for sensory testing.\n\nB is incorrect because proprioception is appreciated via different tracts than light touch. Proprioception is the sense of body position and movement, which is mediated by the proprioceptive system. This system is separate from the somatosensory system that is responsible for light touch sensation.\n\nD is incorrect because impulses for pain do not primarily travel up the dorsal columns. The dorsal columns are responsible for transmitting touch, pressure, and proprioception sensations. The primary pathway for pain transmission is the spinothalamic tract, which runs through the ventral columns.",
