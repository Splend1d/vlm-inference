In this case, we can use the polynomial basis {1, x, x^2, x^3} to represent the vectors in V. Since the degree of the polynomials in this basis is at most 3, the dimension of V is 4.\n\nNow, let's find the dimension of W. We can use the same basis to represent the polynomials in W. Since a polynomial of degree 3 is of the form ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, we can set the coefficients a, b, c, and d to 0 to satisfy the given conditions. This means that any polynomial in W can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors {1, x, x^2, x^3} with coefficients all equal to 0. Therefore, the dimension of W is also 4.\n\nFinally, we can find the sum of the dimensions of V and W: 4 + 4 = 8. However, this is not one of the given options. The problem may have a mistake, or the options may be incorrect.",
