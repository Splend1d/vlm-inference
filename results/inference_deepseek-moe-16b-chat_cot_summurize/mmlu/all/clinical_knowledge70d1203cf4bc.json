Since the drug is prescribed every 12 hours, we will divide the daily dose by 2.\n\n1.92 g/12 hours = 1.92 g/24 hours\n\nTo convert the daily dose to grams, we will divide the daily dose by 24 hours.\n\n1.92 g/24 hours = 0.08 g/hour\n\nNow, we will multiply the hourly dose by 24 hours to get the daily dose.\n\n0.08 g/hour * 24 hours = 1.92 g\n\nSo, the daily dose of the drug is 1.92 grams. The correct answer is B.",
