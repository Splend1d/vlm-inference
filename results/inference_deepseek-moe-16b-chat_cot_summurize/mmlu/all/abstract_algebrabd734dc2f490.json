By the Sylow theorems, we know that the number of Sylow 5-subgroups (subgroups of order 5) in an abelian group of order 45 must divide 9 (the index of 5 in the group's order) and be congruent to 1 modulo 5. The only possibility is that there is exactly one Sylow 5-subgroup, which must be normal since it is the only one. Therefore, the group of order 45 has a subgroup of order 10.\n\nStatement 2: A subgroup H of a group G is a normal subgroup if and only if the number of left cosets of H is equal to the number of right cosets of H.\n\nThis statement is also true. A subgroup H of a group G is normal if and only if the left cosets of H and the right cosets of H coincide. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the left cosets and right cosets of a subgroup form a partition of the group, and the fact that the left cosets and right cosets of a normal subgroup coincide.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A.",
