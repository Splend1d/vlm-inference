            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in time between the transmission of the siren by the police car and the reflection of the siren from the wall. We can then use this difference to calculate the frequency of the echo.\n\nFirst, let's find the time difference between the transmission of the siren and the reflection of the siren from the wall.\n\nThe speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the speed of the police car is 3.5 m/s. Therefore, the time difference between the transmission of the siren and the reflection of the siren is:\n\ntime difference = distance / (speed of sound - speed of car)\ntime difference = 350 m / (350 m/s - 3.5 m/s)\ntime difference = 350 m / 346.5 m/s\ntime difference \u2248 1.01 ms\n\nNow, let's find the frequency of the echo. The frequency of the siren is 600 Hz. The frequency of the echo will be the same as the frequency of the siren if the echo is a perfect reflection of the siren.\n\nThe frequency of the echo is given by the formula:\n\nfrequency of echo = frequency of siren / 2\nfrequency of echo = 600 Hz / 2\nfrequency of echo = 300 Hz\n\nTherefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 300 Hz. The closest option is C. 612 Hz, but since the question asks for the nearest option, the answer is C. 612 Hz.",
