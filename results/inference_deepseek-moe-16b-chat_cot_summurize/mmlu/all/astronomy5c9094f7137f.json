The Moon's umbra is the dark, central part of its shadow, and during a total solar eclipse, the Moon completely covers the Sun, casting its shadow on the Earth. This causes the Sun's light to be partially or completely blocked, resulting in the phenomenon of a total solar eclipse.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.
