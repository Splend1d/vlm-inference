Most organic compounds do not contain silicon atoms.\n\nThe other statements are all valid reasons why tetramethylsilane is used as a 1H chemical shift reference:\n\nA. Its 1H spectrum is a singlet. This is because tetramethylsilane has no other nuclei that could interfere with the measurement of the 1H signals.\n\nB. Its protons are quite strongly shielded. This is because tetramethylsilane has a very low polarizability, which means that the 1H nuclei are shielded from the external magnetic field.\n\nC. It dissolves in most organic solvents. This is because tetramethylsilane is a very good solvent for organic compounds, which allows for the measurement of 1H chemical shifts in a wide range of organic compounds.",
