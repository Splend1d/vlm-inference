A graph has an Euler circuit if and only if it is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with an odd degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).\n\nI. A complete graph with 12 vertices: A complete graph with n vertices is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In this case, the graph is complete, so all vertices have an odd degree. Therefore, it does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nII. A complete graph with 13 vertices: A complete graph with 13 vertices is a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge. In this case, the graph is complete, so all vertices have an odd degree. Therefore, it does not have an Euler circuit.\n\nIII. A tree with 13 vertices: A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. In this case, the graph is a tree, so it has no cycles. Therefore, it has an Euler circuit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. III only.",
