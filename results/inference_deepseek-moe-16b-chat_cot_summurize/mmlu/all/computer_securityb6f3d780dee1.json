Spammers run their spam-advertised web sites on compromised user machines that are part of a botnet.\n- This statement is true. The paper mentions that spammers often use compromised user machines to host their spam-advertised web sites, which are part of a larger botnet.\n\nB. Spammers need to register domain names in order for their spam-based advertisements to be effective.\n- This statement is also true. The paper states that registering domain names is a crucial part of the spam value chain, as it allows spammers to create and host their spam-based advertisements.\n\nC. There is a high cost for spammers to switch acquiring banks.\n- This statement is not explicitly mentioned in the paper. While the paper does discuss the challenges of switching acquiring banks, it does not provide specific information about the cost of such a switch.\n\nD. B and C\n- This statement is true. Both statements A and C are true based on the information provided in the paper.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.",
