            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: The external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\n\nProof: Let G be a cyclic group of order n and H be a cyclic group of order m. The external direct product of G and H, denoted as G x H, is the set of all ordered pairs (g, h) where g is an element of G and h is an element of H. Since G and H are both cyclic, they can be generated by a single element, say g_G and h_H. Then, the set G x H can be generated by the ordered pair (g_G, h_H). Therefore, G x H is a cyclic group of order nm.\n\nStatement 2: The external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is isomorphic to D_12.\n\nProof: The dihedral group D_n consists of the symmetries of a regular n-gon, including rotations and reflections. D_3 is the dihedral group of order 6, and D_4 is the dihedral group of order 4. The external direct product of D_3 and D_4, denoted as D_3 x D_4, is the set of all ordered pairs (r, s) where r is an element of D_3 and s is an element of D_4. The elements of D_3 x D_4 can be represented as (r, s) where r is a rotation of order 3 and s is a reflection.\n\nNow, let's consider the dihedral group D_12, which is the external direct product of D_3 and D_4. We can represent the elements of D_12 as (r, s) where r is a rotation of order 3 and s is a reflection. Since D_3 and D_4 are both cyclic groups of order 3 and 4, respectively, and their external direct product is isomorphic to D_12, we can conclude that the external direct product of cyclic groups is cyclic.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
