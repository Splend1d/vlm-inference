They are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.\n\nThe Solar Nebular theory, also known as the Nebular Hypothesis, is a model that explains the formation of the Solar System, including the Sun and planets. According to this theory, asteroids and comets are chunks of rock or ice that condensed long after the planets and moons had formed. This is because the Solar Nebular theory suggests that the planets and other celestial bodies in the Solar System formed from a rotating cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. As the nebula contracted, it flattened into a spinning disk, and the materials in the disk began to clump together due to gravity. The heavier materials, such as rock and metal, sank towards the center of the disk, while the lighter materials, such as ice and gas, remained in the outer regions. Over time, these clumps of material grew larger and eventually became the planets and moons of the Solar System. Asteroids and comets are thought to have formed from the leftover materials in the outer regions of the solar nebula, which condensed long after the planets and moons had formed.",
