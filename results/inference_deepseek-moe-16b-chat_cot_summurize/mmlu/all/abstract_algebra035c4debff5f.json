We can factor this polynomial as:\n\nf(x) = (x - sqrt(2) - sqrt(3))*(x - sqrt(2) + sqrt(3))\n\nSince the coefficients of the polynomial are rational numbers, the factorization is unique. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over Q is f(x).\n\nNow, let's find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q. The degree of the field extension is the degree of the minimal polynomial, which is 2.\n\nTherefore, the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is 2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. 2.",
