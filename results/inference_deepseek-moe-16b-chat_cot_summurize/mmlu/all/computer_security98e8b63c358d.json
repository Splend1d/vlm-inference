Poor handling of unexpected input can lead to the execution of arbitrary instructions: This is an example of a presentation layer issue because it involves the handling of input data, which is the responsibility of the presentation layer.\n\nB. Unintentional or ill-directed use of superficially supplied input: This is also an example of a presentation layer issue because it involves the use of input data, which is the responsibility of the presentation layer.\n\nC. Cryptographic flaws in the system may get exploited to evade privacy: This is an example of a presentation layer issue because it involves the use of cryptographic mechanisms, which are the responsibility of the presentation layer.\n\nD. Weak or non-existent authentication mechanisms: This is an example of a presentation layer issue because it involves the use of authentication mechanisms, which are the responsibility of the presentation layer.\n\nTherefore, all the given options are examples of presentation layer issues. The question seems to be flawed as all the options provided are examples of presentation layer issues.",
