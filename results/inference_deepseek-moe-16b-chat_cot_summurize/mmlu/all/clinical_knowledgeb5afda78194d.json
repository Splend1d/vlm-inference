The respiratory quotient is the ratio of the amount of carbon dioxide produced to the amount of oxygen consumed during the process of metabolism.\n\nThe formula for the rate of energy expenditure is:\n\nRate of energy expenditure = Mean rate of oxygen consumption \u00d7 Respiratory quotient\n\nGiven that the mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 l/min, we can calculate the rate of energy expenditure as follows:\n\nRate of energy expenditure = 2 l/min \u00d7 1 (since the respiratory quotient is 1)\n\nRate of energy expenditure = 2 kJ/min\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. 80 kJ/min.",
