The function is defined as f(x) = e^x + x - 2.\n\nThe bisection method starts with an interval [a, b] and finds the midpoint c = (a + b) / 2. If f(c) = 0, then the method stops and returns c as the root. If f(c) * f(a) < 0, then the method continues with the interval [a, c], and if f(c) * f(b) < 0, then the method continues with the interval [c, b].\n\nWe can apply the bisection method iteratively until the absolute difference between consecutive approximations is less than 10^(-6).\n\nAfter applying the bisection method, we get the following approximations:\n\na = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
