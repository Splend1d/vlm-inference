The APOE gene has three common alleles: \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54. Individuals who have one or two copies of the \u03b54 allele are at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The \u03b54 allele is associated with a higher rate of amyloid beta plaque formation in the brain, which is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease.",
