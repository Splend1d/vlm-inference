Beta particles.\n\nCobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt that is used in the treatment of cancer. It is produced by bombarding cobalt-59 with beta particles. Beta particles are high-energy electrons or positrons that are emitted by certain radioactive isotopes, such as cobalt-59. When beta particles are emitted by cobalt-59, they collide with the nucleus of the cobalt-59 atom and cause it to emit a gamma ray, which then decays into a cobalt-60 nucleus.\n\nThe process of producing cobalt-60 in this way is known as neutron activation. In this process, a neutron is fired at a target of cobalt-59, which causes the neutron to be absorbed by the cobalt-59 nucleus. This results in the formation of a cobalt-60 nucleus, which is then emitted as a beta particle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Beta particles.",
