            "content": " The correct answer is C. An ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone.\n\nThyroid swelling, also known as a goiter, can be caused by various factors such as iodine deficiency, Graves' disease, or nodular thyroid disease. A thyroid swelling can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, and cough.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a thyroid swelling does not always elevate on swallowing. The swelling may not be visible or palpable, or it may be small and not noticeable.\n\nOption B is incorrect because lymph node enlargement is not necessarily a good prognostic sign. It can be a sign of infection, inflammation, or other conditions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a functioning nodule on isotope scanning is not unlikely to be due to cancer. In fact, a functioning nodule is more likely to be cancerous than a non-functioning nodule.\n\nOption C is correct because an ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. An ultrasound can help to differentiate between a solid and a cystic nodule, and can also help to determine whether the nodule is functioning. If the nodule is found to be actively secreting hormone, it may be treated with medication or surgery.",
