The percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle would be higher.\n\nA ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a congenital heart defect where there is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles of the heart. This defect allows oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle, leading to an increase in the percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would not be affected by a VSD, as it is not involved in the circulation of blood.\nB. The percentage of CO2 in the right ventricle would not be affected by a VSD, as it is not involved in the circulation of blood.\nC. The percentage of oxygen in the right atrium would not be affected by a VSD, as it is not involved in the circulation of blood.",
