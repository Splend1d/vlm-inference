            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: The image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.\n\nThis statement is true. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation. If we have a group of 6 elements, and we apply a homomorphism to it, the image of the group under the homomorphism will also be a group. The order (number of elements) of the image group will be equal to the order of the original group raised to the power of the homomorphism's degree. In this case, the order of the image group will be 6^n, where n is the degree of the homomorphism. Therefore, the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism may have 12 elements.\n\nStatement 2: There is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\n\nThis statement is also true. For any group G, there exists a homomorphism from G to the group of permutations of the elements of G. This homomorphism maps each element of G to a permutation of the elements of G, and it preserves the group operation. Therefore, there is a homomorphism of some group of 6 elements into some group of 12 elements.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A. True, True.",
