If x or y is rational, then (x, y) is not in S because it lies in the unit square [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1]. If both x and y are irrational, then (x, y) is in S because it lies in the unit square.\n\nNow, let's consider the boundary of S, which is the set of points (x, y) in S that have a rational coordinate. If (x, y) is in the boundary, then it must have a rational coordinate. Since x and y are both irrational, the rational coordinate must be 0. Therefore, (x, y) is in the unit square, but it is not in S because it does not have an irrational coordinate.\n\nSince the boundary of S is the set of points (x, y) in S that have a rational coordinate, and the boundary is a subset of S, we can conclude that S is closed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. S is closed.",
