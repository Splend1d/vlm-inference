            "content": " The correct answer is B. Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.\n\nMorphine is a potent opioid analgesic that is commonly used to manage pain. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, which helps to reduce the perception of pain. However, it also has a number of other effects on the body, including sedation, which is the feeling of drowsiness or lethargy.\n\nMorphine can also cause constipation, which is a common side effect of opioid use. Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression, which can be dangerous or even life-threatening in some cases.\n\nIt's important to note that the effects of morphine can vary depending on the dose, the route of administration, and the individual's response to the medication. It's also important to follow the dosage instructions provided by a healthcare professional and to seek medical attention if any adverse effects occur.",
