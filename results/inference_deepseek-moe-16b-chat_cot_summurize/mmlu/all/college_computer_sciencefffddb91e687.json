For example, if we substitute x = 1, the expression becomes f(1,1), which is lexically identical to the original expression.\n\nIII. f(y,g(z))\nThis expression is unifiable because there is a substitution for y that makes the expression lexically identical to itself. For example, if we substitute y = 1, the expression becomes f(1,g(z)), which is lexically identical to the original expression.\n\nTherefore, the pairs of expressions that are unifiable are (II, III).\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
