The energy of a wave is related to its amplitude, frequency, and wavelength. The amplitude is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position, the frequency is the number of waves that pass a given point in a given time, and the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points on a wave.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the wave transfer, which is the transfer of energy from one point to another. The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points on a wave, and it is the key factor in determining the energy transfer of a wave. Therefore, the correct answer is B. wavelength.",
