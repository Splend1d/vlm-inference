In other words, if we apply the homomorphism to any two elements of the group, we should get the same result as if we applied the group operation directly.\n\nA one-to-one map, also known as an injective function, is a function that maps distinct elements of one set to distinct elements of another set.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given statements:\n\nStatement 1: For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'. This statement is true. By definition, every group has a trivial homomorphism, which maps every element of the group to the identity element. Therefore, for any two groups, there exists a homomorphism.\n\nStatement 2: Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map. This statement is false. A homomorphism is a function that preserves the group operation, but it does not have to be a one-to-one map. For example, consider the group of integers under addition. The function that maps every integer to its square is a homomorphism, but it is not a one-to-one map.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
