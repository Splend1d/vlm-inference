Hubble Space Telescope images that resolved Pluto's disk.\n\nIn 1991, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of Pluto that allowed scientists to measure its diameter accurately. These images allowed them to resolve Pluto's disk, which helped them determine its size. The other options are not accurate methods for measuring Pluto's diameter.",
