Civil, Relations, Outcomes: This option is incorrect because the regulation is not only about the relations between CSOs and businesses, but also about the outcomes.\n\nD. Environmental, Relations, Mechanics: This option is incorrect because the regulation is not only about the mechanics of the interactions, but also about the outcomes and the relations between CSOs and businesses.",
