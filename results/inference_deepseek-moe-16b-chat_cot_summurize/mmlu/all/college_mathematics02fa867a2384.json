In this case, the identity element is 0, as 0 \u2022 n = n \u2022 0 = n for all n in Z.\n\nStatement III: This structure is not a group since not all elements have an inverse.\n\nFor an element a in Z, its inverse is -a, since a + (-a) = 0. All integers have an inverse, so this statement is false.\n\nStatement IV: This structure is a group.\n\nA group is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies the following conditions:\n1. Closure: For all a, b in G, a \u2022 b is also in G.\n2. Associativity: For all a, b, c in G, (a \u2022 b) \u2022 c = a \u2022 (b \u2022 c).\n3. Identity element: There exists an element e in G such that, for all a in G, a \u2022 e = e \u2022 a = a.\n4. Inverse element: For each a in G, there exists an element b in G such that a \u2022 b = b \u2022 a = e.\n\nThe operation defined on Z satisfies all these conditions, so the structure is a group.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.",
