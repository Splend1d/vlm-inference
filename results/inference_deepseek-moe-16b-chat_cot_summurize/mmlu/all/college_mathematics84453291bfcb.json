            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrix A. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation det(A - \u03bbI) = 0.\n\nGiven that det(A - \u03bbI) = -\u03bb^3 + 3\u03bb^2 + \u03bb - 3, we can see that the characteristic equation is a cubic equation. The roots of a cubic equation can be found using the following formula:\n\n\u03bb = [r1 + r2 + r3 \u00b1 sqrt((r1 + r2 + r3)^2 - 4 * r1 * r2 * r3)] / (2 * r1)\n\nwhere r1, r2, and r3 are the roots of the equation.\n\nWe can rewrite the given equation as:\n\n\u03bb^3 - 3\u03bb^2 - \u03bb + 3 = 0\n\nComparing this with the characteristic equation, we can see that the roots are \u03bb = 1, \u03bb = 3, and \u03bb = -1.\n\nNow, let's check which of the given statements are true:\n\nI. The trace of A is 3.\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements. In this case, the trace of A is 1 + 3 + (-1) = 3. So, statement I is true.\n\nII. The determinant of A is -3.\nThe determinant of a matrix is the product of the eigenvalues. In this case, the determinant of A is (-1) * 3 * (-1) = 3. So, statement II is false.\n\nIII. The matrix A has eigenvalues -3 and 1.\nThe eigenvalues of A are 1, 3, and -1. So, statement III is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. I only.",
