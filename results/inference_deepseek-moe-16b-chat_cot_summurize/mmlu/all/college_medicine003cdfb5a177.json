            "content": " The correct answer is C. The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.\n\nThis process allows for the production of multiple proteins from a single gene. During alternative RNA splicing, the primary transcript is processed to remove non-coding regions and join together the coding regions to form a mature mRNA molecule. However, the specific regions that are spliced out and which are joined together can vary, resulting in different mRNAs that can be translated into different proteins.\n\nOption A is incorrect because selective transcription of different parts of the DNA in the gene does not result in the production of multiple proteins. Instead, it allows for the production of different RNA molecules from the same gene.\n\nOption B is incorrect because doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule produced from the primary transcript does not result in the production of multiple proteins. Instead, it can result in the production of longer proteins, but the same protein can be produced from a shorter mRNA molecule.\n\nOption D is incorrect because splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript does not result in the production of multiple proteins. Instead, it can result in the removal of non-coding regions, but the same protein can be produced from a shorter mRNA molecule.",
