Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Body temperature: Mammals are homeostatic for body temperature, which is maintained within a narrow range (around 36.5-37.5\u00b0C or 97.7-99.5\u00b0F) to support various physiological processes.\n\nB. Blood glucose concentration: Mammals are homeostatic for blood glucose concentration, which is maintained within a narrow range (around 4-7 mmol/L or 72-126 mg/dL) to provide energy for cells and prevent hypoglycemia.\n\nC. Blood pH: Mammals are homeostatic for blood pH, which is maintained within a narrow range (around 7.35-7.45) to support various physiological processes, such as enzyme function and the transport of ions.\n\nD. Metabolic rate: Mammals are not homeostatic for metabolic rate, which can vary depending on factors such as the animal's size, activity level, and environmental conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Metabolic rate.",
