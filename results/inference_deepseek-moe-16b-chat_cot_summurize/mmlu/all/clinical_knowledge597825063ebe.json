If a transfusion reaction is suspected, you should turn off the transfusion, inform medical staff immediately, and follow transfusion policy advice on dealing with acute transfusion reactions. This is because a transfusion reaction can be a serious medical emergency that requires immediate attention from medical staff. Disconnecting and disposing of the blood bag immediately (Option C) could lead to further complications, and leaving the transfusion running and recording observations on the patient (Option D) may not be sufficient to address the reaction.",
