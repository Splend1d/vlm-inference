            "content": " The correct answer is B. External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm.\n\nDuring quiet inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, while the external and internal intercostal muscles contract and pull the rib cage upward and outward. This increases the volume of the chest cavity, allowing air to enter the lungs. The external intercostal muscles are responsible for elevating the rib cage, while the internal intercostal muscles are responsible for widening the intercostal spaces between the ribs. The diaphragm, being a dome-shaped muscle that covers the entire bottom of the thoracic cavity, also contracts and flattens during inspiration, contributing to the overall expansion of the chest cavity.",
