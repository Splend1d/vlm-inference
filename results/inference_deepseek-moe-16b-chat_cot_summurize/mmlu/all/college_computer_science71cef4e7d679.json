The superclass is the class from which the object's class inherits properties.\n\nThe instance link is the link between an object and its class. It is established when the object is created and represents the fact that the object is an instance of its class.\n\nThe subclass links are the links between a class and its superclass. They are established when the class inherits properties from its superclass.\n\nSo, when a message is sent to an object requesting execution of one of its methods, the method is located by following the instance link to the object's class, and then following the subclass links to the superclass of the object's class.",
