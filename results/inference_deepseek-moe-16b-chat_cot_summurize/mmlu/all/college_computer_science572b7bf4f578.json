            "content": " To solve this question, we need to compare the pipeline stages and clock cycle times of the two processors.\n\nI. M-7\u2019s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5\u2019s pipeline.\nThe maximum throughput of a pipeline is determined by the number of stages in the pipeline. A pipeline with more stages can process more instructions per cycle, resulting in a higher maximum throughput. Therefore, M-7's pipeline has a better maximum throughput than M-5's pipeline.\n\nII. The latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\nThe latency of a pipeline is the time it takes for a single instruction to be processed from start to finish. A shorter clock cycle time means that the processor can complete more instructions per cycle, which in turn results in a shorter latency. Therefore, the latency of a single instruction is shorter on M-7\u2019s pipeline than on M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n\nIII. Programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\nWhile a shorter latency can result in faster execution times, it is not the only factor that determines program execution speed. Other factors, such as the number of instructions in a program and the efficiency of the pipeline, also play a role. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that programs executing on M-7 will always run faster than programs executing on M-5.\n\nSo, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{I and II}}$.",
