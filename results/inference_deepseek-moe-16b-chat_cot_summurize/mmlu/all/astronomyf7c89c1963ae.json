After you've repeated your experiment many times.\n\nTheories, including scientific ones, are not proven correct or incorrect through a single experiment or observation. They are based on a collection of evidence and consistent results over time. In the case of the Force, it is a concept that has been explored in various forms of media, including books, movies, and television shows. However, it is important to note that the Force is a fictional concept and not a scientific theory.\n\nIn the context of scientific theories, repeating experiments and observations is crucial to confirm or refute the hypothesis. This is because the scientific method relies on the ability to replicate results and observe consistent patterns. If you were to repeat the experiment with different Jedi and Yoda, and the results were consistent, then your theory would be more likely to be accepted as a scientific theory.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that even after repeating the experiment many times, there is always the possibility of new evidence or observations that could challenge the theory. This is the nature of scientific inquiry, and it is why theories are never considered proven correct, but rather, they are \"yet to be proven wrong.\"",
