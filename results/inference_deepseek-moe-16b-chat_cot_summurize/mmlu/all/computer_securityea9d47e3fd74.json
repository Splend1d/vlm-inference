            "content": " To determine if EE is semantically secure under CPA, we need to analyze the security of the underlying PRF F. A PRF is considered secure if it is indistinguishable from a random function for all possible polynomial-time adversaries.\n\nIn the case of EE, we have F(k, r) as the underlying PRF, and the encryption function E(k, m) = (r, F(k, r) \u2295 m). The adversary can query the encryption function with any key k and any random value r.\n\nNow, let's consider the CPA game. In this game, the adversary can query the encryption function with any key k and any random value r, and the goal is to distinguish the case where the output is (r, F(k, r) \u2295 m) from the case where the output is (r', F(k, r') \u2295 m) for some other random value r'.\n\nTo analyze the security of EE under CPA, we need to show that the probability of distinguishing the two cases is negligible. This means that the probability of the adversary distinguishing the two cases should be very small, even if the adversary has access to the underlying PRF F.\n\nSince F is a secure PRF, it is indistinguishable from a random function for all possible polynomial-time adversaries. Therefore, the probability of distinguishing the two cases should be negligible for any secure PRF F.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nA. Yes, whenever F is a secure PRF",
