The change in frequency is due to the fact that the surface is not perfectly smooth, and there are small imperfections that cause the light to be scattered in different directions. The change in wavelength is due to the fact that the surface is reflecting the light in all directions, and the light is being refracted as it passes from the air into the surface and back into the air again. This causes the light to be bent, and the change in wavelength is proportional to the amount of bending.",
