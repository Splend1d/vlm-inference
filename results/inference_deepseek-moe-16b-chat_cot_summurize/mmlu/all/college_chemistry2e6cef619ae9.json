            "content": " To balance the equation, we need to make sure that the number of each type of atom on both sides of the equation is the same.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of each type of atom on the left side of the equation:\n- MnO4-: 1 atom of Mn, 1 atom of O, 4 atoms of O2-.\n- I-: 1 atom of I.\n- H+: 1 atom of H.\n\nSo, the left side of the equation has a total of 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 atoms.\n\nNext, let's count the number of each type of atom on the right side of the equation:\n- Mn2+: 1 atom of Mn, 2 atoms of O.\n- IO3-: 1 atom of I, 1 atom of O, 3 atoms of O3-.\n- H2O: 2 atoms of H, 1 atom of O.\n\nSo, the right side of the equation has a total of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 atoms.\n\nTo balance the equation, we need to add H+ ions to the left side to make the total number of atoms equal. We can add 5 H+ ions to the left side, which will give us a total of 6 + 5 = 11 atoms.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each type of atom on the left side of the balanced equation:\n- MnO4-: 1 atom of Mn, 1 atom of O, 4 atoms of O2-.\n- I-: 1 atom of I.\n- H+: 5 atoms of H.\n\nSo, the left side of the balanced equation has a total of 1 + 1 + 5 = 7 atoms.\n\nNext, let's count the number of each type of atom on the right side of the balanced equation:\n- Mn2+: 1 atom of Mn, 2 atoms of O.\n- IO3-: 1 atom of I, 1 atom of O, 3 atoms of O3-.\n- H2O: 2 atoms of H, 1 atom of O.\n\nSo, the right side of the balanced equation has a total of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 atoms.\n\nSince the number of atoms on both sides of the balanced equation is the same, the equation is balanced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The I\u2212 : IO3\u2212 ratio is 3:1.",
