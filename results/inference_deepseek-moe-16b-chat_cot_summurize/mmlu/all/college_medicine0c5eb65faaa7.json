            "content": " The correct answer is A. Osmosis.\n\nOsmosis is the movement of water molecules from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration through a partially permeable membrane, driven by the concentration gradient. This process does not require any energy input from the cell, and it is the only process listed that solely relies on the gradient of material to control the direction of movement.\n\nPassive Transport, Active Transport, and Endocytosis all require energy input from the cell to move materials across the cell membrane. Passive Transport involves the movement of materials down their concentration gradient, but it requires no energy input. Active Transport requires energy input and moves materials up their concentration gradient. Endocytosis involves the engulfing of materials into the cell, and it also requires energy input.",
