            "content": " The correct answer is B. It is caused by Parkinson's Disease.\n\nAn intention tremor is a type of tremor that occurs when a person tries to move a body part. It is characterized by a rhythmic, back-and-forth movement that occurs when the person tries to perform a task, such as picking up an object.\n\nAn intention tremor is often associated with Parkinson's Disease, a neurological disorder that affects movement and coordination. Parkinson's Disease is caused by the loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain, which can lead to problems with movement, muscle stiffness, and tremors.\n\nWhile it is true that an intention tremor can be worse at rest, it is not a definitive sign of Parkinson's Disease. Other conditions, such as essential tremor and multiple sclerosis, can also cause intention tremors.\n\nAn intention tremor is not indicative of a cerebellar lesion, and dyscalculia is not a common association with intention tremors.",
