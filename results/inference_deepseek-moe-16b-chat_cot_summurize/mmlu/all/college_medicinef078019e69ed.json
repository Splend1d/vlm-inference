This is because the loop of Henle is part of the nephron, which is responsible for filtering waste products from the blood and reabsorbing necessary substances back into the bloodstream. The loop of Henle consists of two sections: the ascending limb and the descending limb.\n\nThe ascending limb is permeable to H2O (water) and Cl- (chloride ions), as these substances are actively transported out of the blood into the filtrate in the renal cortex. The H2O and Cl- are then reabsorbed back into the blood in the medulla of the kidney.\n\nThe descending limb, on the other hand, is permeable to Na+ (sodium ions). This is because the concentration of Na+ in the filtrate is higher than in the blood. As a result, Na+ is actively transported out of the filtrate and into the blood in the renal medulla. This helps to maintain the balance of electrolytes in the body.\n\nSo, the descending loop of Henle of the nephron of the kidney is permeable to Na+ (sodium ions).",
