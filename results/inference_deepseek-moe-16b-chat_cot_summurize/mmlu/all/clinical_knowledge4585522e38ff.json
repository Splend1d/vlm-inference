This occurs in the muscles during intense physical activity, when the oxygen supply is insufficient to meet the energy demands of the cells. The pyruvate molecules are converted to lactate, which is then transported back to the muscles that have consumed all their oxygen, where it is converted back to pyruvate and oxygen is used to regenerate ATP.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Glycogen becomes depleted during fasting or starvation, not when cells are using ATP.\nB. Phosphocreatine breakdown occurs during intense physical activity, but it does not produce hydrogen ions.\nD. Glycolysis is a process that occurs in the cytoplasm of cells and is not a major means of resynthesising ATP.",
