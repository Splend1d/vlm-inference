Buffer-overflow attacks are a common vulnerability in older operating systems like UNIX, which were vulnerable to this type of attack due to their design and implementation. Windows NT-based systems, such as Windows XP and Windows 2000, are also known to have been vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. Windows 7 and newer versions of Windows have improved security features that make them less vulnerable to this type of attack. IOS 12 is a mobile operating system and is not typically vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. Chrome is a web browser and is not an operating system.",
