The highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth.\n\nPeak flow meters are devices used to measure a person's maximum expiratory flow rate, which is the fastest speed at which air can be expelled from the lungs. This measurement is typically recorded in liters per minute (L/min) or liters per second (L/s). The peak flow meter measures the highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth, which is typically the maximum flow rate that can be achieved during a forced expiration.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. The lowest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth is typically not measured by peak flow meters, as they are designed to measure the highest rate of air expelled from the lungs.\n\nB. Forced expiratory volume is the total amount of air that can be exhaled in a specific period of time, typically 1 second or 200 milliliters.\n\nC. Forced vital capacity is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible, typically 3-4 seconds.",
