This is because the set satisfies the four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. The identity matrix serves as the identity element, and each matrix has an inverse that can be found by taking the inverse of the determinant and negating the trace.\n\nStatement 2 is false. The set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is not a group under matrix multiplication. This is because the set does not satisfy the group axioms. The set does not satisfy the invertibility axiom because not all 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 have an inverse. For example, the matrix A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] has a determinant of 1, but its inverse is not a 2 x 2 matrix with integer entries. Therefore, the set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 is not a group under matrix multiplication.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. False, True.",
