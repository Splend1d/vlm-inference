Start with the start symbol A.\n2. Replace B with x (B -> x) to get A(x).\n3. Replace C with B (C -> B) to get A(x)B.\n4. Replace B with Bx (B -> Bx) to get A(x)Bx.\n5. Replace D with y (D -> y) to get A(x)Bxy.\n6. Replace E with z (E -> z) to get A(x)Bxyz.\n\nSo, the sentence xxzy is generated by the grammar.\n\nHowever, the sentence xxzy is not generated by the production rules for B -> x|Bx, C -> B|D, D -> y|Ey, and E -> z. Therefore, the sentence xxzy is not generated by the given grammar.\n\nHence, the correct answer is C. xxzy.",
