            "content": " The dissociation energy for a hydrogen-bromine bond is defined as the change in enthalpy, DH, for the reaction HBr(g) \u2192 H(g) + Br(g).\n\nThe dissociation energy for a hydrogen-bromine bond is the energy required to break the bond between a hydrogen atom and a bromine atom in the gas phase. In this reaction, the hydrogen atom and the bromine atom are converted into gaseous hydrogen ions and bromide ions, respectively. The change in enthalpy for this reaction is the enthalpy change for the formation of the gaseous ions from the reactants in the gas phase.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the reaction HBr(g) \u2192 H2(g) + Br2(l) involves the formation of two hydrogen atoms and one bromine molecule, not the dissociation of a single hydrogen-bromine bond.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the reaction HBr(g) \u2192 H+(g) + Br\u2212(g) involves the formation of a hydrogen ion and a bromide ion, not the dissociation of a single hydrogen-bromine bond.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the reaction H(g) + Br(g) \u2192 HBr(g) involves the formation of a hydrogen bromide molecule, not the dissociation of a single hydrogen-bromine bond.\n\nOption D is correct because the reaction HBr(g) \u2192 H(g) + Br(g) involves the dissociation of a single hydrogen-bromine bond into a hydrogen atom and a bromine atom in the gas phase, with no other products or reactants involved. The change in enthalpy for this reaction is the dissociation energy for a hydrogen-bromine bond.",
