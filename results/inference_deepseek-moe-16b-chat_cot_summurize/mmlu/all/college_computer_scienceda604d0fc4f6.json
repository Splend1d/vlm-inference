Mary can ask \"yes/no\" questions to narrow down the possible answers. If Mary asks a question that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\", then the number of questions will be at most 1. If Mary asks a question that requires more than one answer, then the number of questions will be at most 2.\n\nHowever, Mary knows that Bob always tells the truth. This means that if Mary asks a question that can be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\", Bob will always give a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. Therefore, the number of questions will be at most 1.\n\nIf Mary asks a question that requires more than one answer, then Bob will always give a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. However, Mary can ask a follow-up question to narrow down the possible answers. For example, if Mary asks \"Is the number greater than 500?\", Bob can answer \"yes\" or \"no\". If Bob answers \"yes\", Mary can ask \"Is the number greater than 250?\", and so on.\n\nIn the worst case, Mary will need to ask a total of 1,000 questions to determine the answer. This is because there are 1,000 possible answers, and Mary needs to ask a question for each one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 1,000.",
