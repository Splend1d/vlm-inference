            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of time dilation, which is one of the key predictions of special relativity. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light relative to an observer. The faster an object moves, the slower time appears to pass for the object compared to an observer at rest.\n\nAccording to the problem, an observer O at rest midway between two sources of light observes the two sources to flash simultaneously. This means that the time difference between the two flashes is 0. However, a second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, observes one source of light to flash 13 nanoseconds (ns) before the other.\n\nThis time difference indicates that time is passing more slowly for O' compared to O. The time difference is 13 ns, which is equivalent to 0.000013 seconds. This means that time is passing 0.000013 seconds more slowly for O' compared to O for every second that passes.\n\nTo find the speed of O' relative to O, we can use the following equation:\n\nv = (time difference) / (time dilation factor)\n\nwhere v is the speed of O' and time difference is 0.000013 seconds. The time dilation factor is given by:\n\ntime dilation factor = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / (c^2)))\n\nwhere v is the speed of O' and c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.\n\nUsing the equation, we can solve for v:\n\nv = 0.000013 / sqrt(1 - (v^2 / (299,792,458^2)))\n\nv \u2248 0.53c\n\nTherefore, the speed of O' relative to O is approximately 0.53 times the speed of light, or 0.53c.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. 0.53c.",
