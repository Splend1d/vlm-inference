We can check each element to see if it is a generator:\n\n1. 1^1 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n2. 1^2 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n3. 1^3 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n4. 1^4 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n5. 1^5 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n6. 1^6 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n\nNow, let's check 2:\n\n2^1 = 2 (not a generator, as 2 is not in Z_7)\n2^2 = 4 (not a generator, as 4 is not in Z_7)\n2^3 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n2^4 = 2 (not a generator, as 2 is not in Z_7)\n2^5 = 4 (not a generator, as 4 is not in Z_7)\n2^6 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n\nNow, let's check 3:\n\n3^1 = 3 (not a generator, as 3 is not in Z_7)\n3^2 = 2 (not a generator, as 2 is not in Z_7)\n3^3 = 6 (not a generator, as 6 is not in Z_7)\n3^4 = 5 (not a generator, as 5 is not in Z_7)\n3^5 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n3^6 = 2 (not a generator, as 2 is not in Z_7)\n\nNow, let's check 4:\n\n4^1 = 4 (not a generator, as 4 is not in Z_7)\n4^2 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n4^3 = 6 (not a generator, as 6 is not in Z_7)\n4^4 = 5 (not a generator, as 5 is not in Z_7)\n4^5 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n4^6 = 4 (not a generator, as 4 is not in Z_7)\n\nNow, let's check 5:\n\n5^1 = 5 (not a generator, as 5 is not in Z_7)\n5^2 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n5^3 = 6 (not a generator, as 6 is not in Z_7)\n5^4 = 2 (not a generator, as 2 is not in Z_7)\n5^5 = 4 (not a generator, as 4 is not in Z_7)\n5^6 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n\nFinally, let's check 6:\n\n6^1 = 6 (not a generator, as 6 is not in Z_7)\n6^2 = 1 (not a generator, as 1 is not in Z_7)\n6^3 = 2 (not a generator, as 2 is not in Z_7)\n6^4 = 4 (not a generator, as 4 is not in Z_7)\n6^5 = 5 (not a generator, as 5 is not in Z_7)\n6^6 = 6 (not a generator, as 6 is not in Z_7)\n\nSo, the generator for the finite field Z_7 is 6.",
