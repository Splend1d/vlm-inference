            "content": " The question is asking which of the given options would NOT be a strategy that Karen's therapist would ask her to employ to raise her sense of self-efficacy. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Seeking positive feedback from friends: This is a strategy that can help Karen build her self-esteem and self-efficacy. By seeking positive feedback, she is acknowledging her strengths and accomplishments, which can boost her confidence.\n\nB. Putting in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on: This is also a strategy that can help Karen raise her sense of self-efficacy. By practicing regularly, she can gain more experience and confidence in her abilities.\n\nC. Finding others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in: This is another strategy that can help Karen raise her sense of self-efficacy. By observing and learning from others who are successful in her areas of interest, she can gain insights and strategies that can help her improve her own abilities.\n\nD. Avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in: This is NOT a strategy that Karen's therapist would likely ask her to employ. While it's important to be realistic about one's abilities and avoid taking on tasks that are beyond one's capabilities, avoiding challenges altogether can actually lower self-efficacy. It's important to challenge oneself and take on tasks that are slightly beyond one's current abilities, as this can help build confidence and self-efficacy over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. Avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.",
