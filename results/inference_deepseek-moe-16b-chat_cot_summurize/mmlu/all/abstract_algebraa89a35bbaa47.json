            "content": " To find the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, a^p \u2261 a (mod p). In other words, a^p - a is divisible by p.\n\nIn this case, p = 23 (which is a prime number) and a = 3. According to Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n3^23 \u2261 3 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we want to find the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23. We can rewrite 3^47 as (3^23)^2 * 3^2. Using the result from Fermat's Little Theorem, we have:\n\n(3^23)^2 * 3^2 \u2261 3^2 * 3^2 (mod 23)\n\n3^47 \u2261 9 * 9 (mod 23)\n\n3^47 \u2261 81 (mod 23)\n\nNow, we can find the remainder of 81 when divided by 23:\n\n81  23 = 3 with a remainder of 16\n\nSo, the remainder of 3^47 when it is divided by 23 is 1. Therefore, the answer is A.",
