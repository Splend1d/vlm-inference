The preganglionic axons of the parasympathetic nervous system originate in the brain and the brainstem, and they travel through the cranial and spinal nerves to reach their target organs.\n\nThe parasympathetic preganglionic axons leave the CNS with the:\n\nA. cervical spinal nerves.\nB. thoracic spinal nerves.\nC. lumbar spinal nerves.\nD. sacral spinal nerves.\n\nThe correct answer is A. cervical spinal nerves.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is divided into two branches: the craniosacral and the thoracolumbar. The craniosacral branch consists of the preganglionic axons that originate in the brain and the brainstem, and they travel through the cranial nerves to reach their target organs. The thoracolumbar branch consists of the preganglionic axons that originate in the brainstem and travel through the spinal nerves to reach their target organs.\n\nThe parasympathetic preganglionic axons that originate in the brain and the brainstem travel through the cranial nerves to reach their target organs. The cranial nerves are divided into 12 pairs, and each pair is associated with a specific region of the head and neck. The parasympathetic preganglionic axons that originate in the brainstem travel through the spinal nerves to reach their target organs. The spinal nerves are divided into 31 pairs, and each pair is associated with a specific region of the body.\n\nIn summary, the parasympathetic preganglionic axons that originate in the brain and the brainstem leave the CNS with the cervical spinal nerves, while the parasympathetic preganglionic axons that originate in the brainstem leave the CNS with the thoracic spinal nerves.",
