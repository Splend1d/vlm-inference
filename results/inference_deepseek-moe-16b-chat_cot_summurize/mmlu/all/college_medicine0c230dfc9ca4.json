The endoderm is the innermost layer of the three germ layers, and it gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract, the respiratory tract, and other internal organs. The mesoderm, which is the middle layer, gives rise to the muscles, bones, and connective tissue, while the ectoderm, which is the outermost layer, gives rise to the skin and nervous system.
