            "content": " The Schrdinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of a quantum mechanical system. It is a non-linear equation, which means that it cannot be solved exactly for most physical systems.\n\nA. Simple harmonic oscillator: The Schrdinger equation for a simple harmonic oscillator can be solved exactly using the Mathieu functions. The solutions are given by:\n\n\u03c8(x) = A sin(kx) exp(-\u03b2x^2)\n\nwhere A is a normalization constant, k is the wave number, and \u03b2 is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the energy of the system.\n\nB. Particle in a one-dimensional box: The Schrdinger equation for a particle in a one-dimensional box can be solved exactly using the wave functions:\n\n\u03c8(x) = sqrt(2/L) sin(n\u03c0x/L)\n\nwhere L is the length of the box, n is an integer, and the wave number k is given by:\n\nk = (2n + 1)\u03c0/2L\n\nC. Rigid rotor: The Schrdinger equation for a rigid rotor can be solved exactly using the wave functions:\n\n\u03c8(\u03b8) = sqrt(2/I\u03c9) sin(I\u03c9\u03b8)\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia, \u03c9 is the angular frequency, and the wave number k is given by:\n\nk = I\u03c9\n\nD. Helium atom: The Schrdinger equation for the helium atom can be solved exactly using the wave functions:\n\n\u03c8(r) = sqrt(2/a_0^3) (1 + (Z/n_e)r^2) exp(-Zr/n_e)\n\nwhere r is the distance from the nucleus, a_0 is the Bohr radius, Z is the atomic number, and n_e is the principal quantum number. The wave number k is given by:\n\nk = (2Z/n_e)\n\nIn all of these cases, the Schrdinger equation can be solved exactly, and the solutions are given by the wave functions described above.",
