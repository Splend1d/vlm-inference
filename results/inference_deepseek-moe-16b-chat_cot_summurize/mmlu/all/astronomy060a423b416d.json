It was first proposed by astronomer Frank Drake in 1961 during the course of the Green Bank Interstellar Message Project. The equation is:\n\nN = R* \u00d7 fP \u00d7 nE \u00d7 fL \u00d7 fi \u00d7 fc \u00d7 L\n\nWhere:\n\n* N is the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy.\n* R* is the average rate of star formation in the galaxy.\n* fP is the fraction of those stars that have planets.\n* nE is the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets.\n* fL is the fraction of those planets that actually develop life.\n* fi is the fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent beings.\n* fc is the fraction of civilizations that develop technology that can release detectable signs of their existence into space.\n* L is the length of time for which such civilizations release such signals into space.\n\nThe equation is used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy, but it does not provide a definitive answer to any of the questions you listed.",
