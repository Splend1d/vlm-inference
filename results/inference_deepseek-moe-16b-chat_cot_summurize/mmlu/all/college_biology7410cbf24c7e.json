            "content": " The correct answer is C. A moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee. This is an example of Batesian mimicry, where a harmless species mimics a more dangerous species in order to avoid predation. The moth is not harmful to predators, but its coloration and pattern resemble that of a stinging bee, which is dangerous to predators. This allows the moth to avoid predation while remaining unharmed.\n\nB is not a form of mimicry because it is not a harmless species mimicking a more dangerous species. Instead, it is a defensive strategy used by the moth to disorient predators.\n\nD is not a form of mimicry because it is not a harmless species mimicking a more dangerous species. Instead, it is a form of crypsis, where the gull chick blends in with its surroundings to avoid predation.\n\nA is not a form of mimicry because it is not a harmless species mimicking a more dangerous species. Instead, it is an example of aposematism, where a toxic species advertises its toxicity to predators in order to avoid predation.",
