We can do this using the formula:\n\nn = PV / RT\n\nPlugging in the given values, we get:\n\nn = (0.1 L * 1 atm) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * T1)\n\nNow, we need to find the temperature (T2) at which the gas will occupy 0.1L at 1atm. We can use the ideal gas equation to do this:\n\nPV = nRT\n\nPlugging in the values for P, V, n, and R, we get:\n\n0.1 L * 1 atm = n * 0.0821 L atm/mol K * T2\n\nNow, we can solve for T2:\n\nT2 = (0.1 L * 1 atm) / (0.0821 L atm/mol K * n)\n\nSince we don't have the value of n, we cannot find the exact value of T2. However, we can use the fact that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its pressure at constant temperature. This means that if the pressure is halved, the volume will be doubled.\n\nSo, if the pressure is halved from 200atm to 1atm, the volume will be doubled from 0.1L to 20L. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 20L",
