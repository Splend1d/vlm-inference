It can occur at the site of an IV catheter or cannula, and can cause pain, erythema (redness), and swelling. The phlebitis scale is a way to classify the severity of the inflammation.\n\nStage 0 is the least severe, and involves only erythema and mild pain. Stage 1 involves erythema and pain, but no swelling. Stage 2 involves erythema, pain, and swelling, but no skin breakdown. Stage 3 involves all of the above, as well as skin breakdown or ulceration.\n\nSince the patient is experiencing pain, erythema, and swelling, this indicates that the phlebitis is at stage 3. At this stage, the IV catheter or cannula should be re-sited, and the patient should be treated with antibiotics and/or pain medication.",
