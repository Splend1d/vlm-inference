This technique is used to identify and quantify the presence of various molecules in a sample. The absorbance of a substance is directly proportional to the concentration of the molecule in the sample.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (A) is a technique used to study the structure and dynamics of molecules. Infrared (B) is a technique used to measure the absorption of infrared light by molecules. Raman (C) is a technique used to measure the scattering of light by molecules.",
