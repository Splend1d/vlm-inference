The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Since 4 is a divisor of 12, the order of 4 in Z_12 is 4.\n\nNow, let's find the order of the element 2 in the group Z_8. The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. Since 2 is a divisor of 8, the order of 2 in Z_8 is 2.\n\nSince the orders of 4 and 2 in their respective groups are relatively prime, their product has order 12 in Z_12 x Z_8. Therefore, the answer is C.",
