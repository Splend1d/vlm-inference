            "content": " Let's analyze each statement separately:\n\nStatement 1: Every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.\n\nThis statement is true. If R is a commutative ring, then the quotient ring R/I (where I is an ideal of R) is also a commutative ring. This is because the addition and multiplication operations in the quotient ring are defined in the same way as in R, and the ring structure is preserved.\n\nStatement 2: An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 in N.\n\nThis statement is also true. If N is an ideal of R such that 1 is in N, then N is indeed all of R. This is because the definition of an ideal is that it is a subset of R that is closed under addition and multiplication. If 1 is in N, then every element of R can be written as a sum of an element of N and an element of R not in N. Therefore, N is all of R.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
