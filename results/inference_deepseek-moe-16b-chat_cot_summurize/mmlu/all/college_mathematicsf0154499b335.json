            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement separately and then compare them to determine if they are true or false.\n\nStatement 1: If A is connected, the closure of A must be connected.\n\nThe closure of a set A, denoted by cl(A), is the union of A and its boundary, which is the set of points that are both in A and in the complement of A. If A is connected, it means that there is a continuous path between any two points in A. If we take the closure of A, we are adding the boundary points to A. If the boundary points are all connected to each other, then the closure of A will also be connected. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: Every continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) has a fixed point.\n\nA fixed point of a function f is a point x in the domain of f such that f(x) = x. In this case, the domain is (0, 1) and the codomain is (0, 1). A continuous function f : (0, 1) \u2192 (0, 1) is a function that has a continuous inverse. However, the function f itself may not have a fixed point. For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. This function is continuous and has no fixed points, as f(x) \u2260 x for any x in (0, 1). Therefore, this statement is false.\n\nComparing the two statements, we can see that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is D. False, False.",
