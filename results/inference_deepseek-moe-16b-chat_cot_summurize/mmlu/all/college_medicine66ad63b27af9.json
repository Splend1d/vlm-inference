Although the city itself has characteristics, there are several smaller areas, usually congregations of people from the same nationality, who adhere to customs from their prior country of inhabitance. For example, in Little Italy, a small town in the city, it is still customary to greet people with cheek kisses. This is an example of what kind of phenomenon?\n\nA. Subculture\nB. Counterculture\nC.

            "content": " The correct answer is A. Subculture.\n\nA subculture is a group of people within a larger culture, who differ from the parent culture in at least one significant way. In the case of Little Italy, the people living there have a distinct culture from the larger culture of New York City, and they have maintained their customs and traditions from their prior country of inhabitance. This is an example of a subculture.\n\nB. Counterculture is not the correct answer because it refers to a group of people who reject or oppose the dominant culture. Little Italy is not rejecting the larger culture of New York City, but rather preserving their own.\n\nC. Microculture is not the correct answer because it refers to a small-scale culture within a larger culture. Little Italy is a distinct community within New York City, not a small-scale culture within a larger culture.\n\nD. Culture lag is not the correct answer because it refers to the time lag between the adoption of new technology or cultural practices and the adaptation of these changes by a society. Little Italy is not experiencing a time lag, but rather preserving their own culture.",
