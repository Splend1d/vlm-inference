In this case, the mean result is 0.110 M, and the actual value is 0.100 M. Therefore, the mean result is not accurate.\n\nPrecision, on the other hand, refers to how close the results are to each other. In this case, the standard deviation is 0.001 M, which indicates that the results are relatively close to each other. Therefore, the results are precise.\n\nBased on the information given, we can conclude that the titration results are precise but not accurate.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Precise but not accurate.",
