            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to consider the kinetic theory of gases, which states that the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to its temperature. According to this theory, the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is given by the formula:\n\nKE = (1/2) \\* m \\* v^2\n\nwhere KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the gas molecule, and v is the velocity of the gas molecule.\n\nThe mass of a gas molecule is directly proportional to its molecular weight. Therefore, the mass of a gas molecule is given by the formula:\n\nm = m_0 \\* R_H / M\n\nwhere m is the mass of the gas molecule, m_0 is the standard mass of a gas molecule, R_H is the gas constant, and M is the molecular weight of the gas.\n\nThe molecular weight of a gas is the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms that make up the gas. Therefore, the molecular weight of a gas is given by the formula:\n\nM = A_1 \\* A_2 \\* ... \\* A_n\n\nwhere M is the molecular weight of the gas, A_1, A_2, ..., A_n are the atomic weights of the atoms that make up the gas.\n\nThe average velocity of a gas molecule is given by the formula:\n\nv = sqrt(3 \\* R_H \\* T / (2 \\* M))\n\nwhere v is the velocity of the gas molecule, R_H is the gas constant, T is the temperature, and M is the molecular weight of the gas.\n\nNow, let's compare the average velocities of the three gases: hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.\n\nThe molecular weight of hydrogen is H_2, which is 2. The molecular weight of oxygen is O_2, which is 32. The molecular weight of nitrogen is N_2, which is 28.\n\nThe average velocity of hydrogen is:\n\nv_H = sqrt(3 \\* 8.314 \\* T / (2 \\* 2)) = sqrt(25.938 \\* T / 4)\n\nThe average velocity of oxygen is:\n\nv_O = sqrt(3 \\* 8.314 \\* T / (2 \\* 32)) = sqrt(25.938 \\* T / 64)\n\nThe average velocity of nitrogen is:\n\nv_N = sqrt(3 \\* 8.314 \\* T / (2 \\* 28)) = sqrt(25.938 \\* T / 56)\n\nSince the temperature is the same for all three gases, we can conclude that the average velocity of hydrogen is greater than the average velocity of oxygen and nitrogen. Therefore, the answer is A.",
