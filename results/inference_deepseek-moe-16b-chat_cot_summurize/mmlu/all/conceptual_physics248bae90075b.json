This is known as the second law of thermodynamics, which states that in any energy transformation, the total entropy (disorder) of the system and its surroundings will always increase over time. This means that the universe is constantly moving towards greater disorder and disorganization.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Higher order and lower order are relative terms and do not necessarily indicate direction.\nB. Disorganization and organization are not directional terms, but rather states of a system.\nC. Disorder and equilibrium are also relative terms and do not necessarily indicate direction.",
