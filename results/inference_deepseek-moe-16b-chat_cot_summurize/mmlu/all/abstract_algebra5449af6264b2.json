The polynomial x^2 + 1 can be rewritten as x^2 + 1 = (x + 1)(x + 1) in Z_2, since (x + 1)(x + 1) = x^2 + 2x + 1.\n\nNow, let's check each element in Z_2:\n\n1. x = 0: (0 + 1)(0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 \u2260 0, so x = 0 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n2. x = 1: (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 * 2 = 4 \u2260 0, so x = 1 is not a zero of the polynomial.\n\nSince there are no zeros of the polynomial x^2 + 1 in Z_2, the answer is:\n\nA. 0\nB. 1\nC. 0,1\nD. 2",
