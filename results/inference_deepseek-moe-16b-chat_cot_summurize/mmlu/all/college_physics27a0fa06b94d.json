            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative velocity. Since the spaceships are approaching Earth from opposite directions, their relative velocity is the sum of their speeds. Let's denote the speed of each spaceship as v.\n\nThe observer on Earth measures the length of the meterstick on one spaceship to be 60 cm. This is equivalent to a length contraction of 60 cm, which means that the spaceship is shorter by 60 cm when measured by the observer on Earth. This is due to the fact that the spaceship is moving relative to the observer, and its length contracts in the direction of motion.\n\nNow, let's use the Lorentz transformation to relate the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth to its length as measured by an occupant of the other spaceship. The Lorentz transformation is given by:\n\nx' = \u03b3(x - vt)\ny' = y\nz' = \u03b3(z - vt)\nt' = \u03b3(t - vx/c^2)\n\nwhere x, y, z, and t are the coordinates of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth, and x', y', z', and t' are the coordinates of the spaceship as measured by an occupant of the other spaceship. The Lorentz factor \u03b3 is given by:\n\n\u03b3 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)\n\nWe can use this transformation to relate the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth to its length as measured by an occupant of the other spaceship. Let's denote the length of the spaceship as measured by the observer on Earth as L1 and the length of the spaceship as measured by an occupant of the other spaceship as L2.\n\nL1 = 60 cm = 0.6 m\nL2 = \u03b3(L1 - vt)\n\nNow, we can use the Lorentz transformation to relate the speed of each spaceship to the observer on Earth. Let's denote the speed of each spaceship as v1 and v2.\n\nv1 = \u03b3(v1 - v)\nv2 = \u03b3(v2 - v)\n\nSince the spaceships are approaching Earth from opposite directions, their relative velocity is the sum of their speeds:\n\nv = v1 + v2\n\nSubstituting the expressions for v1 and v2 from the Lorentz transformation, we get:\n\nv = \u03b3(v1 - v) + \u03b3(v2 - v)\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = \u03b3(v1 - v) + \u03b3(v2 - v)\nv = \u03b3(v1 - v) + \u03b3(v2 - v)\nv = \u03b3(v1 - v) + \u03b3(v2 - v)\n\nDividing both sides by \u03b3, we get:\n\nv = (v1 - v) + (v2 - v)\nv = v1 - v + v2 - v\nv = v1 + v2 - 2v\n\nNow, we can solve for v:\n\nv = (v1 + v2) / 2\n\nSince the observer on Earth measures the speed of each spaceship to be equal, we can conclude that:\n\nv = 0.5c\n\nTherefore, the speed of each spaceship, as measured by the observer on Earth, is 0.5c.
