This includes addressing any underlying psychological factors that may be contributing to the pain, as well as ensuring that the person is taking the appropriate medications and dosages to manage their pain effectively.\n\nRegular reassessment is also crucial in order to monitor the effectiveness of the pain management plan and make any necessary adjustments. This may involve tracking the person's pain levels, assessing their response to medications, and monitoring for any side effects or complications.\n\nIt is not appropriate to prioritize limiting drug side effects over addressing the person's physical, psychological, and pharmacological needs, as this may lead to inadequate pain management and potential negative consequences for the person.",
