All of these.\n\nA sonic boom is created when an aircraft flies faster than the speed of sound, which is approximately 767 miles per hour (1,235 kilometers per hour) at sea level. When an aircraft breaks the sound barrier, it creates a shockwave that produces a loud noise, known as a sonic boom. This noise can be heard by people on the ground.\n\nWhen an aircraft is pulling out of a subsonic dive, it is not necessarily breaking the sound barrier. A subsonic dive is when an aircraft is flying at a speed slower than the speed of sound. The aircraft is not producing a sonic boom during this time.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. All of these.",
