            "content": " The correct answer is C. Interrupts can indicate the completion of an I/O operation.\n\nInterrupts are signals generated by the CPU to indicate that an event has occurred, such as the completion of an I/O operation. They are used to save the state of the CPU and to allow it to respond to the event without having to constantly check for it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because interrupts are not generated when memory cycles are \"stolen\". Instead, they are generated by hardware devices that need the CPU's attention.\n\nOption B is incorrect because interrupts are not used in place of data channels. Interrupts are used to signal the CPU to perform a specific task, while data channels are used to transfer data between devices.\n\nOption D is incorrect because interrupts can be generated by arithmetic operations. For example, when a division by zero occurs, an interrupt is generated to signal that an error has occurred.",
