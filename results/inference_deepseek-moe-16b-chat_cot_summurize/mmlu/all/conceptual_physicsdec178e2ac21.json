This is because the ball is in free fall and is not being affected by any other forces.\n\nHowever, if you throw the ball downward, you are imparting an initial velocity to it. The acceleration of the ball after it leaves your hand will depend on the speed at which you throw the ball. If you throw the ball with a speed greater than the acceleration due to gravity, the ball will continue to accelerate downward at a greater rate than 9.8 m/s^2.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. more than 9.8 m/s2.",
