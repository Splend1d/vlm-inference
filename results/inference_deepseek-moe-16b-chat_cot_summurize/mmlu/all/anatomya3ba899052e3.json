These neurons are located in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord and innervate target organs such as sweat glands, blood vessels, and the heart. When released, noradrenaline binds to adrenergic receptors on the surface of target cells, leading to a variety of physiological effects, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration.\n\nPost-ganglionic neurons, on the other hand, are located in the sympathetic ganglia, which are clusters of neurons located near the target organs. These neurons then release noradrenaline into the bloodstream, where it can be transported to the target organs and exert its effects.\n\nSo, noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter between sympathetic pre- and post-ganglionic neurons.",
