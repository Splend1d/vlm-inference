            "content": " The correct answer is B. A frameshift mutation is created when a codon's nucleotide sequence changes so that it calls for production of a different amino acid than the original one.\n\nA frameshift mutation occurs when there is a change in the number of nucleotide bases in a codon, which results in a shift in the reading frame of the DNA sequence. This can lead to the production of a different amino acid than intended, which can ultimately affect the structure and function of the protein that the gene encodes.\n\nA. telomeric sequences are removed from DNA: This is not a frameshift mutation, but rather a deletion mutation that removes a portion of the DNA sequence.\n\nC. a base pair is either inserted or deleted in a gene: This is also not a frameshift mutation, but rather a point mutation that changes a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence.\n\nD. a codon's nucleotide sequence is changed so that instead of coding for a given amino acid it acts to terminate translation: This is a nonsense mutation, which does not create a frameshift but instead results in the production of a truncated protein.",
