The intercostal nerve is a branch of the dorsal ramus of a spinal nerve and supplies sensation to the skin overlying the rib. It also supplies motor innervation to the intercostal muscles, which are responsible for respiration. The superior border of a rib is the border that is closest to the superior angle of the ribcage. Therefore, the intercostal nerve is superficial to this border.",
