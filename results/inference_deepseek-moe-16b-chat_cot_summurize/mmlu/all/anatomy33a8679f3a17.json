It is performed by injecting a local anaesthetic solution around the inferior alveolar nerve, which supplies sensation to the lower lip, mandibular teeth, and labial gingivae of the anterior mandibular teeth. The other options are incorrect because they either include areas that are not supplied by the inferior alveolar nerve or do not provide complete anaesthesia of the lower lip, mandibular teeth, and labial gingivae of the anterior mandibular teeth.",
