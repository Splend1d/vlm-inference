A maximal ideal M is an ideal such that R/M is a field. If M is maximal, then R/M is a field if and only if R/M is a division ring, which means that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. A maximal ideal M is prime if and only if R/M is an integral domain. Therefore, every maximal ideal is a prime ideal, but the converse is not true. So, this statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field.\nThis statement is also true. If I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field if and only if R/I is a division ring. As we established in the previous statement, every maximal ideal is a prime ideal, and a prime ideal is a maximal ideal. Therefore, if I is a maximal ideal of R, then R/I is a field.\n\nSo, both statements are true, and the correct answer is A. True, True.",
