Since then, scientists have been studying it and its moons. The current best observations show that Pluto has no satellites.\n\nPluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. Charon is the largest of Pluto's moons and is actually larger than some of the other planets' moons, such as Deimos and Phobos. The other four moons are much smaller, with diameters ranging from 10 to 30 miles.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. No satellites.",
