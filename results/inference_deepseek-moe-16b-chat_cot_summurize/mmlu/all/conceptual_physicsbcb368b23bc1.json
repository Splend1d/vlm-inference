Since the ball is tossed upward, the only force acting on it is gravity, which is given by the equation F = m*g, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAt the 10-m position, the net force on the ball is half of the maximum force acting on it, which is mg. Therefore, the net force on the ball at the 10-m position is mg/2.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. mg/2.",
