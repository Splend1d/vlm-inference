This is because as you approach the speed of light, the energy required to accelerate you further increases, and this energy is converted into mass. This is known as mass-energy equivalence, as described by Albert Einstein's famous equation, E=mc^2.\n\nThe decrease in pulse rate is also a common effect of traveling at high speeds, such as those close to the speed of light. This is because the body's biological processes, such as the heartbeat, can be affected by the intense acceleration and deceleration experienced during space travel. However, it is important to note that the pulse rate decrease is not as significant as the change in mass, and it is not a universal effect.",
