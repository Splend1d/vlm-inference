The order of a group is the product of the orders of its Sylow subgroups.\n2. The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group is congruent to 1 mod p and divides the order of the group.\n\nThe prime factorization of 72 is 2^3 * 3^2. Therefore, we need to find the number of Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups.\n\nFor Sylow 2-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. One Sylow 2-subgroup of order 8 (2^3).\n2. Three Sylow 2-subgroups of order 4 (2^2).\n\nFor Sylow 3-subgroups, we have the following possibilities:\n1. One Sylow 3-subgroup of order 9 (3^2).\n\nNow, we can use the following formula to find the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups:\n\nNumber of structurally distinct Abelian groups = (Number of Sylow 2-subgroups * Number of Sylow 3-subgroups) / GCD(Number of Sylow 2-subgroups, Number of Sylow 3-subgroups)\n\nNumber of Sylow 2-subgroups = 1 + 3 = 4\nNumber of Sylow 3-subgroups = 1\n\nGCD(4, 1) = 1\n\nTherefore, the number of structurally distinct Abelian groups is 4.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 4.",
