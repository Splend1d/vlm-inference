            "content": " The Doppler effect is a change in frequency perceived by an observer due to the relative motion between the observer and the source of the sound. The Doppler effect is named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who first described it in 1842.\n\nTo determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency, we need to know the speed of sound in the medium, the time of interaction between the sound source and the detector, the distance between the source and the detector, and the frequency of the emitted sound.\n\nA. I only: This option is not sufficient to determine the Doppler shift. The speed of sound in the medium is important for the calculation, but we also need to know the time of interaction and the distance between the source and the detector.\n\nB. I and III: This option is sufficient to determine the Doppler shift. The speed of sound in the medium and the time of interaction between the sound source and the detector are needed to calculate the Doppler shift.\n\nC. II and IV: This option is not sufficient to determine the Doppler shift. The frequency of the emitted sound and the distance between the source and the detector are not needed to calculate the Doppler shift.\n\nD. I and IV: This option is not sufficient to determine the Doppler shift. The speed of sound in the medium and the frequency of the emitted sound are not needed to calculate the Doppler shift.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. I and III.",
