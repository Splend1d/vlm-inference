The threshold potential is the minimum stimulus intensity required to initiate an action potential in a sensory neuron. As the stimulus intensity increases, the threshold potential decreases, allowing the brain to detect smaller changes in stimulus intensity. The other options, such as the amplitude of the action potential, the number of action potentials per second, and the number of synapses crossed, do not directly relate to the ability to detect differences in stimulus intensity.",
