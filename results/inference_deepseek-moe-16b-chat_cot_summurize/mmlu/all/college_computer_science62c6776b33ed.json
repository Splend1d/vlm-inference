Merge sort\n\nMerge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the input array into two halves, sorting each half independently, and then merging the two sorted halves back together. The running time of merge sort is O(n log n) in all cases, regardless of the initial ordering of the input.\n\nIn contrast, the running time of insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort depends on the initial ordering of the input. For example, if the input is already sorted, insertion sort has a running time of O(n^2), which is worse than the O(n log n) running time of merge sort. Similarly, if the input is already sorted in reverse order, selection sort and bubble sort have a running time of O(n^2), which is worse than the O(n log n) running time of merge sort.",
