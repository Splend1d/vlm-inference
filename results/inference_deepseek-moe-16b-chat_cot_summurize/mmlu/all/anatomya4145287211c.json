This process is closely associated with the somatic growth pattern, as it occurs during the growth spurt that occurs during puberty.\n\nThe facial bones and skull base bones are formed by the condensation and ossification of mesenchymal cells, which are derived from the mesoderm. These cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which are the cells responsible for the formation of cartilage. The chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and eventually undergo apoptosis, leaving behind a calcified matrix. This matrix is then replaced by bone tissue, which is laid down by osteoblasts.\n\nThe bones of the viscerocranium develop initially by endochondral ossification and follow the somatic growth pattern.",
