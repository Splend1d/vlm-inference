In this case, the size of the problem is N, so we have N terms in the recurrence relation.\n\nNext, let's find the growth rate of the solution. The growth rate is given by the maximum of the growth rates of the two sub-problems. In this case, the growth rate of the sub-problem f(2N) is log N, and the growth rate of the sub-problem f(2N + 1) is log N. Therefore, the maximum growth rate is log N.\n\nFinally, let's compare the growth rate to the given bounds. The given bounds are O(log N), O(N log N), O(log N) + 0(1), and O((log N)^2). Since the growth rate of the solution is log N, which is greater than the lower bound of O(log N), the solution must be in the O(log N) + 0(1) category.\n\nTherefore, the best upper bound for the value of f(N) is O(log N) + 0(1).\n\nSo, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
