            "content": " Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha.\nThis statement is true. If H is a subgroup of G and a is an element of G, then the set aH = {ah : h in H} is also a subgroup of G. This is because the operation in aH is the same as in G, and the identity element of G is in aH.\n\nStatement 2: If H is normal of G and a belongs to G, then ah = ha for all h in H.\nThis statement is also true. If H is normal in G, then for any h in H and a in G, we have aH = Ha. Therefore, a(ha^-1) = a(h^-1a) = (ah)a^-1 = e*a^-1 = a^-1, where e is the identity element of G. Thus, ah = ha for all h in H.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the answer is A.",
