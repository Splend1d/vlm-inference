Crossing the street, the pedestrian notices that the young woman appears both much wealthier than he is and is of a different ethnicity. Seeing no one else present, the pedestrian renders aid. According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?\n\nA. The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one\nB. The presence of another group of people one block up the street\nC. The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one\nD. The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl\n",

            "content": " The bystander effect refers to the phenomenon where the presence of others discourages individuals from providing help to a person in need. This is often due to a phenomenon known as diffusion of responsibility, where individuals assume that someone else will step in and help, so they do not feel the need to act themselves.\n\nIn this scenario, the pedestrian is already crossing the street to help the young woman, so the bystander effect is not the issue. The woman's ethnicity, socioeconomic class, and the presence of others are not relevant to the bystander effect. The only factor that would change how the pedestrian reacts is if there were already one other person who is already approaching the girl. If this were the case, the pedestrian might assume that someone else is already providing aid and not feel the need to do so themselves.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl.",
