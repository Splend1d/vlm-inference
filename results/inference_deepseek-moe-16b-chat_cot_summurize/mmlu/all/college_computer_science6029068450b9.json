The virtual address space can be larger than the amount of physical memory.\nThis statement is true. In a virtual memory system, the virtual address space is the total amount of memory that a process can address. This can be larger than the amount of physical memory, as the operating system can use a technique called swapping to move pages of memory from the hard disk into memory as needed.\n\nII. Programs must be resident in main memory throughout their execution.\nThis statement is false. Programs do not need to be resident in main memory throughout their execution. In fact, it is often beneficial for the operating system to swap out less frequently used programs to free up memory for other processes.\n\nIII. Pages correspond to semantic characteristics of the program.\nThis statement is false. Pages do not correspond to semantic characteristics of the program. Instead, they are a fixed-size unit of memory that is used to map the virtual address space to the physical address space.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. I only.",
