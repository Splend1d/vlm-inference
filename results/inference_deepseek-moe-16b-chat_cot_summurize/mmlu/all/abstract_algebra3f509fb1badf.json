The order of an element in a finite field is the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power n equals the identity element of the field.\n\nIn Z_11, the identity element is 0. We need to find an element that generates the entire field when raised to the power of 11.\n\nLet's try the elements of Z_11:\n\n1^1 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^2 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^3 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^4 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^5 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^6 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^7 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^8 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^9 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^10 = 1 (not the identity element)\n1^11 = 1 (the identity element)\n\nWe found that 1 has order 10 in Z_11. Therefore, the generator for the finite field Z_11 is 1.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. 1.",
