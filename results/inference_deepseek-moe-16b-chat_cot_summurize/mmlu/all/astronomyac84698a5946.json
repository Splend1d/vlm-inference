It is a hypothetical form of energy that is thought to be responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This energy is thought to be present in the form of a \"dark energy fluid\" that permeates all of space and exerts a repulsive force on matter, causing the expansion to speed up. The other options are not related to the concept of dark energy.",
