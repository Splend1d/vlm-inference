A - 2I and B - 2I are similar matrices.\n\nFor two matrices to be similar, they must have the same characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial of A - 2I is (x - 2), and the characteristic polynomial of B - 2I is (x - 2). Since the characteristic polynomials are not the same, A - 2I and B - 2I are not similar matrices.\n\nII. A and B have the same trace.\n\nThe trace of a matrix is the sum of the elements on the main diagonal. Since A and B are invertible matrices, their traces are equal to the sum of the diagonal elements of A and B, respectively. Therefore, A and B have the same trace.\n\nIII. A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices.\n\nFor two matrices to be similar, they must have the same characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial of A^-1 is (x - 1), and the characteristic polynomial of B^-1 is (x - 1). Since the characteristic polynomials are the same, A^-1 and B^-1 are similar matrices.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I, II, and III.",
