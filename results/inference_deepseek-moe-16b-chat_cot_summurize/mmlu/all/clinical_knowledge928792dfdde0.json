This is because anaerobic metabolism produces energy without oxygen, and it is more efficient for short bursts of activity.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the pH of the muscle does not fall below 6.0 with an increasing number of sprints. In fact, the pH of the muscle is maintained within a narrow range, typically between 7.0 and 7.4.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the blood glucose concentration does not fall below 3 mmol/L with an increasing number of sprints. The body can maintain blood glucose levels within a range of 3.3 to 6.1 mmol/L, even during intense exercise.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism does not increase with an increasing number of sprints. In fact, the anaerobic contribution increases, as explained above. The aerobic contribution remains relatively constant, as the body relies on both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism for energy production during sprinting.",
