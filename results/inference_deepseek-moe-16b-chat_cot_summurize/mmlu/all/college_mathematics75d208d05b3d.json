If f is a homeomorphism, then it is both continuous and one-to-one, and its inverse is also continuous. This means that the preimage of any open set in T is open in S, and the image of any open set in S is open in T. Therefore, the compactness of S implies the compactness of T.\n\nIf f is continuous and one-to-one, then it is also continuous and one-to-one on the preimage of any open set in T. However, the preimage of an arbitrary open set in T may not be open in S, so we cannot guarantee that the compactness of S implies the compactness of T in this case.\n\nIf f is continuous, then it is continuous on the preimage of any open set in T. However, the preimage of an arbitrary open set in T may not be open in S, so we cannot guarantee that the compactness of S implies the compactness of T in this case.\n\nIf f is one-to-one, then it is also one-to-one on the preimage of any open set in T.
