            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the diffraction formula for sound waves:\n\nd * sin(\u03b8) = \u03bb\n\nwhere d is the width of the slit, \u03b8 is the angle of diffraction, and \u03bb is the wavelength of the sound wave.\n\nFirst, we need to find the wavelength of the sound wave. The speed of sound is 343 m/s, and the width of the slit is 0.14 m. Therefore, the distance the sound wave travels before diffracting is:\n\nd = v * t\nd = 343 m/s * 0.14 s\nd = 48 m\n\nNow, we can use the diffraction formula to find the wavelength:\n\n48 m * sin(45\u00b0) = \u03bb\n\u03bb = 48 m * 0.7071\n\u03bb \u2248 34.65 m\n\nThe speed of sound is 343 m/s, so the frequency of the sound wave is:\n\nf = v / \u03bb\nf = 343 m/s / 34.65 m\nf \u2248 9.86 Hz\n\nHowever, none of the given options match the answer.
