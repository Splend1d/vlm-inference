            "content": " The correct answer is B. Greenhouse gases transmit visible light allowing it to heat the surface but then absorb infrared light from Earth trapping the heat near the surface.\n\nThe greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun's rays. These gases, called greenhouse gases, include carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. When sunlight reaches the Earth's surface, it is absorbed and then re-emitted as heat. Some of this heat is transmitted back into space, but some is absorbed by greenhouse gases. These gases then re-radiate the heat in all directions, including back towards the Earth. This trapped heat warms the Earth's surface, which is why the Earth is able to maintain a relatively stable temperature. Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth would be too cold for life as we know it.",
