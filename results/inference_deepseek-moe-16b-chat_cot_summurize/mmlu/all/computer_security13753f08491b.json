This is because Generational Fuzzers use a population-based approach, where they generate a large number of inputs and then iteratively test them to find bugs. This approach is more likely to find bugs in complex programs with many lines of code, as it can generate a large number of inputs and test them all.\n\nBlackbox and Whitebox Fuzzers, on the other hand, are more limited in their approach. Blackbox Fuzzers only test inputs against the program's inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of the program's internal workings. Whitebox Fuzzers, on the other hand, have some knowledge of the program's internal workings, but still only test inputs against the program's inputs and outputs.\n\nMutation-based Fuzzers, while they can be effective in finding bugs, are not as likely to explore paths covering every line of code in a program. This is because Mutation-based Fuzzers only test inputs by changing them slightly and then testing the results. This approach is more likely to find bugs in simple programs with fewer lines of code, as it can only test a limited number of inputs.",
