This layer is composed of the Earth's tectonic plates, which are constantly moving and interacting with each other. The lithosphere is divided into several plates, which are separated by faults and move independently of each other. The movement of these plates is responsible for the formation of mountains, earthquakes, and volcanic activity.",
