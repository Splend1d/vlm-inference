Both of these\n\nWhen two circuits are connected in a way that allows electric current to flow through one circuit and induce a magnetic field in the other circuit, the mutual induction of electric and magnetic fields can produce both light and energy. The light is produced when the magnetic field changes, and the energy is produced when the magnetic field interacts with a conductor to produce an electric current.",
