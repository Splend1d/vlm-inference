            "content": " The addition of the integers 109 and -42 is within range for all three representations of numbers by 8-bit words.\n\nI. One's complement: The 8-bit one's complement representation of 109 is 10010001, and the 8-bit one's complement representation of -42 is 01111110. Adding these two numbers gives 10011111, which is within the range of an 8-bit one's complement number.\n\nII. Two's complement: The 8-bit two's complement representation of 109 is 10010001, and the 8-bit two's complement representation of -42 is 01111110. Adding these two numbers gives 10001111, which is within the range of an 8-bit two's complement number.\n\nIII. Sign and magnitude: The 8-bit sign and magnitude representation of 109 is -10010001, and the 8-bit sign and magnitude representation of -42 is -01111110. Adding these two numbers gives -11111111, which is outside the range of an 8-bit sign and magnitude number.\n\nTherefore, all three representations can perform the addition of 109 and -42 within range.\nThe answer is D.",
