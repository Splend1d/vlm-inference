            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of preorder and postorder traversals in a depth-first search tree.\n\nIn a depth-first search tree, a preorder traversal visits a node and then its children in the order they are encountered. A postorder traversal visits a node and then its children in the reverse order they are encountered.\n\nGiven that pre(u) < pre(v), this means that u is visited before v in the preorder traversal of T. Since T is a depth-first search tree, this implies that u is an ancestor of v in T.\n\nNow, let's consider statement II. Since u is an ancestor of v in T, it is possible that u is not an ancestor of v in the original graph G. Therefore, statement II is not necessarily true.\n\nFinally, let's consider statement III. Since T is a depth-first search tree, the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T is a vertex w that is an ancestor of both u and v. Since u is an ancestor of v in T, it must also be an ancestor of the lowest common ancestor w in T. Therefore, u is an ancestor of w in T. Since w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, it must also be the lowest common ancestor of u and v in G. Therefore, statement III is true.\n\nSo, the only statement that must be true is III. Therefore, the answer is D.",
