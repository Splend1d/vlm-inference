            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the occupation numbers of a quantum state to the temperature and the energy of the state. The Boltzmann distribution is given by:\n\nN_i = N * exp(-E_i / (k_B * T))\n\nwhere N_i is the occupation number of state i, N is the total number of particles, E_i is the energy of state i, k_B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38064852 x 10^-23 J/K), T is the temperature, and E_i is the energy of state i.\n\nWe are given the g-factor (g = 2.05) and the temperature (TS = 300 K). We need to find the energy levels of the radical species. Since the g-factor is given, we can use the formula:\n\nE_i = h * (2 * i + 1) / (2 * m * g)\n\nwhere h is the Planck constant (6.62607004 x 10^-34 Js), m is the mass of the particle, and i is the quantum number of the energy level.\n\nFor a radical species, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin energy levels are degenerate, meaning they have the same energy. Therefore, we only need to consider one energy level. Let's assume the energy level is E_i = E_0.\n\nNow, we can use the Boltzmann distribution to find the occupation numbers for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin states:\n\nN\u03b1 = N * exp(-E_0 / (k_B * 300))\nN\u03b2 = N * exp(-E_0 / (k_B * 300))\n\nSince the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin states are degenerate, we can assume that N\u03b1 = N\u03b2 = N/2. Therefore, we have:\n\nN/2 = N * exp(-E_0 / (k_B * 300))\n\nNow, we can solve for E_0:\n\nE_0 = k_B * 300 * ln(2)\n\nE_0 \u2248 1.898 eV\n\nNow that we have the energy level, we can find the occupation numbers for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 spin states:\n\nN\u03b1 = N * exp(-E_0 / (k_B * 300)) \u2248 0.9800\nN\u03b2 = N * exp(-E_0 / (k_B * 300)) \u2248 0.9509\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9800 at L-band; N\u03b1/N\u03b2 = 0.9509 at W-band.",
