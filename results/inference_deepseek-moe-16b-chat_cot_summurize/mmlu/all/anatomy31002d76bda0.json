This can result in a loss of somaesthetic sensation, which means the patient will lose the ability to feel touch or pressure on the anterior two-thirds of their tongue.\n\nLoss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (Option A) is not a symptom of a damaged glossopharyngeal nerve, as the glossopharyngeal nerve does not directly supply the taste buds.\n\nLoss of somaesthetic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (Option C) is also not a symptom of a damaged glossopharyngeal nerve, as the glossopharyngeal nerve does not directly supply somaesthetic sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.\n\nParalysis of the muscles of the tongue (Option D) is a symptom of a damaged glossopharyngeal nerve, but it is not a symptom of a malignant tumour. Instead, it is a symptom of a stroke or other neurological disorder.",
