DNA and mRNA: DNA is a double-stranded molecule found in the nucleus, while mRNA is a single-stranded molecule that carries genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes for protein synthesis. They can be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\n\nC. Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum: The Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum are both organelles found in the cell membrane, but they have different functions. The Golgi apparatus is responsible for modifying and packaging proteins and lipids, while the endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein synthesis and lipid synthesis. They can be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\n\nD. Lysosomes and endosomes: Lysosomes and endosomes are both membrane-bound organelles that play a role in cellular digestion and recycling. Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down waste and foreign substances, while endosomes are involved in the sorting and transportation of materials within the cell. They can be separated by low-speed centrifugation.\n\nThe other pairs cannot be separated by low-speed centrifugation, as they are not distinct organelles or molecules that can be separated by centrifugation.",
