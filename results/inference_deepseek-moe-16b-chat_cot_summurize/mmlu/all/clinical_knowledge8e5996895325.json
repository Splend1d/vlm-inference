They may have difficulty reading the screen. This is a valid concern, but it doesn't directly address the importance of providing internet-based information sources.\n\nB. Less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet. This is a significant factor to consider. If a large portion of the elderly population does not have access to the internet, it would be important to provide them with information sources that are accessible to them.\n\nC. The internet is aimed at younger people. This is not necessarily true. While it's true that younger people are more likely to use the internet, there are still many internet resources and services that are designed for older users.\n\nD. They may not be able to type. This is a valid concern, but it doesn't directly address the importance of providing internet-based information sources.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the most relevant to the question. If a large portion of the elderly population does not have access to the internet, it would be important to provide them with information sources that are accessible to them.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{B}$.",
