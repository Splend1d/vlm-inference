            "content": " The impulse\u2013momentum relationship is a direct result of Newton's second law. The second law states that the force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration (F = ma). This means that an object's momentum (p) is equal to its mass (m) times its velocity (v). The impulse (J) is the product of the force (F) and the time (t) over which the force is applied. Therefore, the impulse\u2013momentum relationship can be written as J = \u0394p, where \u0394p is the change in momentum. This relationship shows that the impulse is equal to the change in momentum, and it is a direct result of Newton's second law.",
