The program executes on a time-sharing system.\n\nBusy-waiting on an asynchronous event is generally not a good idea because it can cause the program to consume a significant amount of CPU resources, which can lead to poor system performance and even system crashes. This is especially true on a time-sharing system, where multiple processes are competing for CPU resources.\n\nA. The wait is expected to be short: This is a reasonable justification for busy-waiting, as it is possible that the wait will be short. However, it is not a guarantee, and busy-waiting can still consume a significant amount of CPU resources, even if the wait is short.\n\nB. A busy-wait loop is easier to code than an interrupt handler: This is not a reasonable justification for busy-waiting. While it is true that writing an interrupt handler can be more complex than writing a busy-wait loop, the benefits of using an interrupt handler (such as allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the event) often outweigh the additional complexity.\n\nC. There is no other work for the processor to do: This is not a reasonable justification for busy-waiting. Even if there is no other work for the processor to do, busy-waiting can still consume a significant amount of CPU resources, which can lead to poor system performance and even system crashes.",
