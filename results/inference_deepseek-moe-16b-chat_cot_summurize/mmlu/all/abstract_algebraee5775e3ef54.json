A one-to-one function, also known as an injective function, is a function where every element in the range set has a unique corresponding element in the domain set.\n\nWhile it's true that every permutation is a one-to-one function, it's not necessarily the case that every one-to-one function is a permutation. For example, consider the function f(x) = x^2. This function is one-to-one, but it's not a permutation because it doesn't rearrange the elements in the domain.\n\nTherefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\nStatement 2: Every function is a permutation if and only if it is one to one.\nThis statement is also false. As we discussed earlier, not every one-to-one function is a permutation.\n\nSo, both statements are false, and the correct answer is D.",
