The oculomotor nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for moving the eye laterally. When the oculomotor nerve is damaged, the lateral rectus muscle may become weak or paralyzed, causing the eye to deviate medially and develop a squint.\n\nDamage to the trochlear nerve (B), ophthalmic trigeminal nerve (C), and abducens nerve (D) can also cause strabismus, but these nerves are responsible for controlling different muscles and are less likely to cause a medially directed squint.",
