Fracture of the radius and ulna at the wrist.\n\nA colles fracture is a specific type of wrist fracture that occurs at the distal radius and ulna, typically at the wrist joint. It is also known as a \"reverse\" or \"low\" wrist fracture because the break line is angled in a downward and outward direction, away from the palm. This type of fracture is often the result of a fall onto an outstretched hand, where the wrist is bent backwards and the force of the fall is transmitted to the wrist joint.\n\nSymptoms of a Colles fracture may include:\n\n* Pain and swelling in the wrist\n* Bruising around the wrist\n* Deformity of the wrist, with the wrist appearing crooked or rotated\n* Difficulty moving the wrist or using the hand\n* Numbness or tingling in the fingers\n\nTreatment for a Colles fracture typically involves immobilizing the wrist in a splint or cast for several weeks to allow the bone to heal. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to realign the bone and ensure proper healing. Physical therapy may also be recommended to help regain strength and mobility in the wrist and hand after the fracture has healed.",
