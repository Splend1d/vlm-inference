It is highly processed.\n\nA meteorite is a celestial body that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the Earth's atmosphere, landing on the ground as a solid mass. The other characteristics mentioned in the question are common features of meteorites:\n\nA. A fusion crust, also known as a fusion crust, is a black, glassy layer that forms on the outside of a meteorite as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. This crust forms when the meteorite's exterior heats up to temperatures of around 1,500 to 2,500 degrees Celsius.\n\nB. Solidified spherical droplets are also common in meteorites. These droplets are formed when the meteorite's exterior melts due to the extreme heat generated during its passage through the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nD. A different elemental composition than Earth is a characteristic of meteorites. This is because meteorites are made up of materials that are not found on Earth, such as iron, nickel, and stony-iron.\n\nHowever, the characteristic C. It is highly processed, is not necessarily true for all meteorites. While some meteorites may have undergone some degree of processing due to their passage through the Earth's atmosphere, not all meteorites have been significantly altered. The degree of processing depends on factors such as the meteorite's size, speed, and angle of entry into the Earth's atmosphere.",
