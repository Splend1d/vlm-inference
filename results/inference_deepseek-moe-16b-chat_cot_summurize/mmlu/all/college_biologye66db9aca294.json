Photosynthesis: Fungi, like plants, can perform photosynthesis to produce glucose from carbon dioxide and water.\n\nB. Fermentation: Fungi can also participate in fermentation, which is the process of breaking down organic compounds through the production of alcohol or acids.\n\nC. Ringworm: Fungi can cause ringworm, a skin infection that appears as a red, itchy rash.\n\nD. Mycorrhizal associations: Fungi can form associations with the roots of plants, called mycorrhizae, which help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil.\n\nThe option that fungi do not participate in is B. Fermentation. While fungi can participate in fermentation, it is not a necessary function of fungi, as other organisms, such as bacteria, can also perform fermentation. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
