Restart STP and retry the query, up to a limited number of retries.\n\nWhen the STP solver times out on a constraint query for a particular path, the EXE should restart the STP solver and retry the query up to a limited number of retries. This allows the EXE to continue executing the path and potentially find a solution that satisfies the query.\n\nOption A is incorrect because assuming that the query is satisfiable and continuing to execute the path may lead to an incorrect solution. Option B is incorrect because assuming that the query is not satisfiable and stopping the path execution may lead to an incorrect solution. Option D is incorrect because removing a subset of the constraints and retrying the query may not always result in a valid solution.",
