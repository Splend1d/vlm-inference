            "content": " The correct answer is C. Nephrolithiasis.\n\nNephrolithiasis, also known as kidney stones, is a condition characterized by the presence of kidney stones. These stones are formed from the crystallization of urine components, such as calcium, oxalate, and phosphate. They can vary in size, from small sand-like particles to large, painful masses.\n\nA. Glomerulonephritis is an inflammation of the glomeruli, a part of the nephron, which is the functional unit of the kidney. It is caused by infections, immune system disorders, or other factors and can lead to kidney damage.\n\nB. Interstitial nephritis is an inflammation of the interstitium, a part of the kidney that surrounds the nephrons. It can be caused by infections, drugs, or other factors and can lead to kidney damage.\n\nD. Polycystic kidney is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. It can lead to kidney failure if left untreated.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. Nephrolithiasis, which is characterized by the presence of kidney stones.",
