            "content": " Let's analyze each statement:\n\nA. Valid DV certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party than valid EV certificates.\nThis statement is false. Extended Validation (EV) certificates provide more confidence to a user that she is connecting to the intended party because they are more thoroughly vetted by the Certificate Authority (CA). They display the company name in the browser, which helps the user identify the site.\n\nB. OCSP stapling allows a server to prove to a browser that its certificate hasn\u2019t been revoked.\nThis statement is true. OCSP stapling is a technique that allows a server to send its Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) response directly to the client, instead of the client having to make a separate request to the OCSP server. This can help the client determine if the certificate has been revoked more quickly.\n\nC. DANE makes it difficult for an adversary to launch a SSL stripping attack.\nThis statement is true. DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) allows for the use of public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates for DNSSEC validation. This can help prevent SSL stripping attacks, as the client can verify the server's certificate using the DNSSEC validation.\n\nD. Server key-pinning makes it harder for an adversary to convince a CA to mint a certificate for a site and launch an MITM attack on that site.\nThis statement is true. Server key-pinning involves pinning a specific public key to a specific server, so that even if an attacker manages to convince a CA to issue a certificate for their server, the certificate will not be accepted by the client. This makes it harder for the attacker to launch a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\n\nSo, the false statements are A and D.",
