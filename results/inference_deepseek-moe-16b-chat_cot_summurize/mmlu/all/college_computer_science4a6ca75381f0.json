Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures.\n\nBitmap graphics, also known as raster graphics, are composed of pixels, which are small squares of color. They are limited in their ability to represent complex shapes and textures, as they can only display a limited number of colors and cannot accurately represent curved lines or shapes.\n\nIn contrast, vector graphics use mathematical equations to define shapes and lines, allowing them to be scaled up or down without losing quality. They can also represent complex shapes and textures, as well as realistic lighting and shading.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Polygons can be filled with solid colors and textures, which is not a property of bitmap graphics.",
