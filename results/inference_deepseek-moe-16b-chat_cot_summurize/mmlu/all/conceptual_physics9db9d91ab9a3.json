This is because the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. So, if the mass of one object (in this case, the Sun) is doubled, the gravitational force it exerts on the other object (in this case, Mars) will also be doubled.",
