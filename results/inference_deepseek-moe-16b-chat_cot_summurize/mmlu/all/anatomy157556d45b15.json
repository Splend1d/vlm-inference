Melanocytes.\n\nEctomesenchyme is a type of mesenchyme that gives rise to the neural crest cells, which give rise to various structures in the body, including motor neurons, melanocytes, and sweat glands.\n\nMotor neurons are derived from the neural tube, which is a part of the ectomesenchyme.\n\nSkeletal muscles are derived from the mesoderm, which is a different layer of the embryo.\n\nSweat glands are derived from the ectoderm, which is a different layer of the embryo.",
