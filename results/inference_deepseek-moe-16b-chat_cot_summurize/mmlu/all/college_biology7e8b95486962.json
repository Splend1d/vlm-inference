The passage mentions an experiment where a young male bird, which has been raised in isolation and only hears the song of a different species, develops an adult song repertoire that lacks certain characteristics typical of his own species. This suggests that the song of his species is not entirely instinctive, as he is not copying the song of his own species.\n\nThe passage also mentions that when a young male bird is raised in the presence of its own species, it will develop an adult song repertoire that includes certain characteristics typical of its own species. This suggests that the song of his species is both instinctive and learned.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. both instinctive and learned.",
