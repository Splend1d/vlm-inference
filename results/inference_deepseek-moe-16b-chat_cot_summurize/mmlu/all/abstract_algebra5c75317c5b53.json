            "content": " To find all cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z, we need to find all the elements in 2Z that can be written as a multiple of 4Z.\n\nSince 4Z is a subgroup of 2Z, we know that 4Z contains the multiples of 4, i.e., {0, 4, 8, 12, ...}. Now, we need to find all the elements in 2Z that can be written as a multiple of 4Z.\n\nLet's consider the element 2 in 2Z. We can write 2 as a multiple of 4Z in two ways: 2 = 0 (mod 4) and 2 = 4 (mod 4). So, 2 is in both cosets {0 + 4Z} and {4 + 4Z}.\n\nNow, let's consider the element 4 in 2Z. We can write 4 as a multiple of 4Z in two ways: 4 = 0 (mod 4) and 4 = 4 (mod 4). So, 4 is in both cosets {0 + 4Z} and {4 + 4Z}.\n\nSimilarly, we can check that 6, 8, 10, 12, ... are also in both cosets {0 + 4Z} and {4 + 4Z}.\n\nHowever, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... are not in both cosets. For example, 1 = 0 (mod 4) but 1 is not in {4 + 4Z}.\n\nSo, the cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z are {0 + 4Z} and {4 + 4Z}.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.",
