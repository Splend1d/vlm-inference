            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to find the values of x at which the two curves intersect and then find the area between the curves from x = 0 to x = a.\n\nFirst, let's find the values of x at which the two curves intersect:\n\ny = (sin x + cos x)^4\ny = (sin x - cos x)^4\n\nWe can expand these expressions using the binomial theorem:\n\ny = (sin^2 x + 2sin x cos x + cos^2 x)^2\ny = (1 - 2cos^2 x)^2\ny = (1 - 2cos^2 x)^2\n\nNow, let's set the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n(sin^2 x + 2sin x cos x + cos^2 x)^2 = (1 - 2cos^2 x)^2\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nsin^2 x + 2sin x cos x + cos^2 x = 1 - 4cos^2 x\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n\nsin^2 x + cos^2 x = 3cos^2 x + 1\n\nDividing both sides by cos^2 x, we get:\n\ntan^2 x + 1 = 3 + 1/cos^2 x\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean identity to solve for x:\n\ntan^2 x = 2 - 2/cos^2 x\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\ntan^4 x = 4 - 4/cos^4 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^4 x = 1 - cos^4 x\n\nNow, we can square both sides again:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2cos^4 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2(1 - cos^2 x) + cos^8 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2(1 - cos^2 x) + cos^8 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2(1 - cos^2 x) + cos^8 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2(1 - cos^2 x) + cos^8 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 + 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 + 2(1 - cos^2 x) + cos^8 x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 + 2 - 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x\n\nNow, we can use the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x to rewrite the equation:\n\nsin^8 x = 1 + 2 - 2 + 2cos^2 x + cos^8 x",
