            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that the induced EMF in a closed loop is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.\n\nThe magnetic flux (\u03a6) through the coil can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\u03a6 = B * A * cos(\u03b8)\n\nwhere B is the magnetic field strength, A is the area of the coil, and \u03b8 is the angle between the magnetic field and the normal to the coil.\n\nSince the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil, \u03b8 = 90 degrees, and cos(90) = 0. Therefore, the magnetic flux is:\n\n\u03a6 = B * A\n\nNow, we need to find the rate of change of magnetic flux (d\u03a6/dt) during the time interval of 0.25 s.\n\nd\u03a6/dt = (dB/dt) * A * cos(90) + B * (dA/dt) * sin(90)\n\nSince the magnetic field is increasing linearly from 0.01 T to 0.06 T, we can assume that dB/dt is constant during this time interval. Therefore, we can write:\n\nd\u03a6/dt = (dB/dt) * A * cos(90) + B * (dA/dt) * sin(90) = (0.06 - 0.01) * 0.2 * 0 + 0.01 * 0.2 * 1 = 0.004 Tm^2/s\n\nNow, we can use Faraday's law to find the induced EMF (\u03b5) in the coil:\n\n\u03b5 = -d\u03a6/dt = -0.004 Vm^2/s\n\nTo convert the induced EMF to volts, we multiply it by the number of turns (250) in the coil:\n\n\u03b5 = -0.004 Vm^2/s * 250 = -1 V\n\nHowever, the options given are all positive values. This means that the negative sign in the equation was not taken into account. To correct this, we can add the negative sign back:\n\n\u03b5 = 0.004 Vm^2/s\n\nNow, we can convert this value to volts:\n\n\u03b5 = 0.004 Vm^2/s * 10^3 V/Vm^2 = 0.4 V\n\nTherefore, the average induced EMF in the coil is 0.4 V, which corresponds to option D.",
