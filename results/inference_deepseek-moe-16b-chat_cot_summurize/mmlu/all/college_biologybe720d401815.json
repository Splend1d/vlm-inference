Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria.\n\nMitochondria and chloroplasts are both organelles found in plant and animal cells, but they have different functions. Mitochondria are responsible for generating energy in the form of ATP through a process called cellular respiration. They are also involved in other cellular processes, such as the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain.\n\nChloroplasts, on the other hand, are responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which plants and some algae convert sunlight into energy in the form of glucose. In chloroplasts, photosynthetic pigments, such as chlorophyll, absorb sunlight and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nPlants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria, as they are not involved in the process of photosynthesis. Animals, on the other hand, have only mitochondria, as they do not have chloroplasts and rely on the energy generated by mitochondria for their survival. Fungi, which are a type of decomposer, also have only mitochondria, as they do not have chloroplasts and are not involved in photosynthesis.",
