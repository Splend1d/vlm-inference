            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine if it is true or false.\n\nI. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T then U = M(V).\n\nThis statement is false. The set U consists of all matrices that commute with T, which means that TX = XT for all X in M(V). However, not all matrices that commute with T are in M(V). For example, consider the matrix A = [0 1; 1 0] in V = R^2. A does not commute with T, but it commutes with T^2, T^3, etc. Therefore, A is in U, but A is not in M(V).\n\nII. dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2\n\nThis statement is true. The dimension of a subspace is the number of vectors in a basis for that subspace. Since U and W are both subspaces of M(V), their dimensions must be less than or equal to n. Therefore, dim (U) + dim (W) \u2264 n^2.\n\nIII. dim (U) < n\n\nThis statement is true. Since U is a subspace of M(V), its dimension must be less than or equal to n. However, U consists of all matrices that commute with T, which means that U is a proper subspace of M(V). Therefore, dim (U) < n.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. I and II only.",
