Without a strong magnetic field, the solar wind stripped away most of the atmosphere significantly reducing the greenhouse effect and cooling Mars down.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. The ozone layer is not destroyed by the solar wind, but rather by the ultraviolet radiation from the sun.\nB. The greenhouse effect is not the cause of the climate change on Mars. The loss of its magnetic field is.\nD. The solar wind does not affect the heating of Mars. The planet's temperature is mainly controlled by the amount of sunlight it receives and the composition of its atmosphere.",
