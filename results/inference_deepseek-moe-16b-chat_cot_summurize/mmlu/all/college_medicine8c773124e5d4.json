            "content": " The correct answer is C. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites.\n\nExplanation:\n\nA. Hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire. This is true. Hyperpolarization is a process that occurs after an action potential, where the neuron's membrane potential becomes more negative, effectively blocking any further action potentials.\n\nB. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential. This is also true. In the first phase of an action potential, the neuron's membrane potential becomes more positive due to the influx of sodium ions through voltage-gated sodium channels.\n\nD. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential. This is also true. The threshold potential is the minimum membrane potential required for an action potential to occur. When the membrane potential reaches or surpasses the threshold potential, an action potential is initiated.\n\nC. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites. This is not true. Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal, not the dendrites. The dendrites are responsible for receiving neurotransmitters from other neurons and transmitting the signal to the cell body or other dendrites.",
