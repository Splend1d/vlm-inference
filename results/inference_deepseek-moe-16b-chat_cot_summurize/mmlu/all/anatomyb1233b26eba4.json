The aorta then divides into smaller arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the body's tissues. The oxygen-rich blood then returns to the heart through veins, which eventually lead back to the right atrium of the heart. The blood then passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps it into the pulmonary trunk, which leads to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen, and then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, which lead back to the left atrium. The oxygen-rich blood is then pumped into the left ventricle and the cycle continues.",
