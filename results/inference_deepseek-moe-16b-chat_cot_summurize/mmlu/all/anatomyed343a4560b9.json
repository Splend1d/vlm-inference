During gastrulation, the three primary germ layers - ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm - are formed. Ectomesenchyme formation and occurrence after neurulation is incorrect because it is a part of the process of gastrulation, not the entire process. Gastrulation does not occur after neurulation, but rather before it. Therefore, the correct answer is C. mesoderm formation and occurs before neurulation.",
