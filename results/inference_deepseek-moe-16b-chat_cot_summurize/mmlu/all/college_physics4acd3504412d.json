The gravitational force acting on the planets would still be the same, as the mass of the black hole and the Sun is the same. Therefore, the planets would continue to orbit in their elliptical or circular orbits as they do now.\n\nThe Schwarzschild radius of a black hole is a measure of its gravitational pull, not its effect on the orbits of objects near it. The orbit of a planet is determined by the sum of the gravitational forces acting on it from the Sun and other objects in the solar system, not by the presence or absence of a black hole.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D. The orbits would remain unchanged.",
