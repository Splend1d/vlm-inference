The corona is made up mostly of charged particles which aren't luminous.\n\nThe Sun's corona is the outermost layer of the Sun's atmosphere, and it can only be seen during a total solar eclipse. This is because the Moon is blocking the direct light from the Sun, allowing us to see the Sun's outer atmosphere. The corona is much cooler than the Sun's surface, which is why it isn't luminous and we can't see it during other times. The other options are not the reason why we can't see the Sun's corona except during total solar eclipses.",
