This collection of blood is called a haematoma, and it can cause pressure on the brain, leading to a coma and other serious complications.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. Skull bones and dura mater: This option refers to the space between the skull bones and the dura mater, which is the outermost protective layer of the brain. However, extradural haemorrhage occurs between the dura mater and the arachnoid, not the skull bones.\n\nC. Arachnoid and pia mater: This option refers to the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater, which is the innermost protective layer of the meninges. Extradural haemorrhage does not occur between the arachnoid and the pia mater.\n\nD. Pia mater and brain surface: This option refers to the space between the pia mater and the brain surface, which is the innermost protective layer of the brain. Extradural haemorrhage does not occur between the pia mater and the brain surface.",
