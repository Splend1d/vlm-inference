Some rational numbers have no exact representation, but this is not a property of floating-point arithmetic itself. It is a property of the representation of rational numbers in binary form. Floating-point arithmetic is a method of representing and manipulating real numbers using a floating radix point. It is designed to be a compromise between the precision of fixed-point arithmetic and the ease of representation of variable-precision arithmetic. It is inherently associative, meaning that the order in which operations are performed does not affect the final result. This is because floating-point arithmetic uses a fixed number of bits to represent the significand (the part of the number to the left of the radix point) and the exponent (the part of the number to the right of the radix point). The associativity of floating-point arithmetic can be achieved with appropriate roundoff conventions, which are used to ensure that the results of calculations are accurate within a certain range of values. These conventions involve rounding the intermediate results to a certain number of significant digits, depending on the precision required for the final result.",
