To find the number of distinct nonisomorphic trees, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Start with a tree with 1 vertex (a single edge).\n2. Add a new vertex to the tree, connecting it to the existing vertex. There are 2 possible ways to do this (forming a cycle or not forming a cycle).\n3. Add a new vertex to the tree, connecting it to the existing vertex. There are 2 possible ways to do this (forming a cycle or not forming a cycle).\n4. Continue this process until all vertices are connected.\n\nBy counting the number of distinct trees that can be formed in this way, we find that there are 3 nonisomorphic trees with 5 vertices:\n\n1. A tree with a single edge (a cycle of length 1).\n2. A tree with two edges (a cycle of length 2).\n3. A tree with three edges (a cycle of length 3).\n\nTherefore, the answer is C.",
