A semi-group with identity implies that there is a single identity element, but in this case, there are multiple nth roots of unity, and none of them is the identity element.\n\nB. A commutative semigroups with identity implies that the operation is commutative and the set has an identity element, but in this case, the operation is multiplication, which is already commutative, and there is no identity element.\n\nC.
