Since H is a subgroup of G, it is also a group. If H were Abelian, it would mean that the group operation in H is commutative, which contradicts the fact that G is a non-Abelian group. Therefore, H is a non-Abelian group. Since H is a factor group of G, it inherits the non-Abelian property of G.\n\nStatement 2: If K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nProof: Let K be a normal subgroup of H and H be a normal subgroup of G. Since H is a normal subgroup of G, the left cosets of H in G are exactly the right cosets of H in G. Similarly, the right cosets of H in G are exactly the left cosets of H in G. This implies that the left and right cosets of H in G coincide, which means that H is a normal subgroup of G. Since K is a normal subgroup of H, it is also a normal subgroup of G.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A. True, True.",
