            "content": " The emission spectrum of a hydrogen atom in its ground state (n = 1) is given by the Balmer series, which consists of the following wavelengths:\n\n1/2^(-1) - 1/4^(-1) - 1/3^(-1) - 1/6^(-1)\n\nThe emission of a photon with a wavelength of 1/2^(-1) corresponds to the transition from the n = 2 level to the n = 1 level. The emission of a photon with a wavelength of 1/4^(-1) corresponds to the transition from the n = 3 level to the n = 2 level. The emission of a photon with a wavelength of 1/3^(-1) corresponds to the transition from the n = 4 level to the n = 3 level. And the emission of a photon with a wavelength of 1/6^(-1) corresponds to the transition from the n = 5 level to the n = 4 level.\n\nSince the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ has two electrons, it is in the n = 2 level. Therefore, the emission spectrum of the doubly ionized lithium atom Li++ is identical to that of a hydrogen atom in which all the wavelengths are decreased by a factor of 9.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A.",
