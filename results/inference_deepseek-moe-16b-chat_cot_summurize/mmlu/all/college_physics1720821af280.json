            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the frequency of a pipe resonance:\n\nf = (1/2L) * sqrt(K)\n\nwhere f is the frequency, L is the length of the pipe, and K is the compressibility of the air inside the pipe.\n\nWe are given that the pipe resonates at a frequency of 440 Hz at 20\u00b0C. We need to find the frequency at a temperature of 20\u00b0C - 3% = 19.4\u00b0C.\n\nFirst, we need to find the speed of sound at 19.4\u00b0C. We can use the formula:\n\nv = sqrt(K/\u03bc)\n\nwhere v is the speed of sound, K is the compressibility of the air, and \u03bc is the mass density of the air.\n\nWe can assume that the compressibility of the air is constant at different temperatures. Therefore, we can use the compressibility at 20\u00b0C (K = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
