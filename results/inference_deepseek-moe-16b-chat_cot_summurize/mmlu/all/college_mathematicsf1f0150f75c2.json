The theorem states that if a continuous function changes sign at two points, then it must have at least one real root between those two points.\n\nLet's analyze the given polynomial: 2x^5 + 8x - 7.\n\nThe polynomial changes sign at x = 0, since 2(0)^5 + 8(0) - 7 = -7.\n\nNow, let's consider the endpoints of the interval [-1, 1].\n\nFor x = -1, the polynomial is 2(-1)^5 + 8(-1) - 7 = -2 - 8 - 7 = -17.\n\nFor x = 1, the polynomial is 2(1)^5 + 8(1) - 7 = 2 + 8 - 7 = 3.\n\nSince the polynomial changes sign at x = 0 and the function is continuous, there must be at least one real root between -1 and 1.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7 has at least one real root, which means the answer is:\n\nA.
