There actually is a strong greenhouse effect and Mars would be 35oC colder than it is now without it.\n\nMars has a thin atmosphere that is mostly made up of carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas. This greenhouse effect traps heat from the sun and keeps the planet warm. However, the atmosphere is not thick enough to trap a significant amount of heat, so the greenhouse effect is not as strong as it is on Earth. This is why Mars is much colder than Earth, even though it has a similar amount of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere.",
