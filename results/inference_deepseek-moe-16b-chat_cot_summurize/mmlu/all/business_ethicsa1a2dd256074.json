Financial accounting is a systematic process of recording, summarizing and reporting the financial activities of a business to provide information to shareholders, creditors, and other interested parties. It is a legal requirement and is based on financial transactions. On the other hand, Social accounting is a broader concept that includes financial accounting but also encompasses non-financial information such as environmental, social, and ethical issues.
