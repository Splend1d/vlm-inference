This process occurs in cells and tissues that are unable to obtain oxygen, such as during intense physical activity or in certain types of cells like muscle cells. In anaerobic metabolism, ATP is generated through processes like fermentation, which involves the conversion of glucose into lactic acid, or anaerobic glycolysis, which occurs in muscle cells during intense physical activity.",
