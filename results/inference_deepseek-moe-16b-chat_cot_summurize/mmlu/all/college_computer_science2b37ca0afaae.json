The divisors of x are -6, -2, -1, 1, 2, and 6.\n\nNow let's consider the second integer, y. The divisors of y are -6, -2, -1, 1, 2, and 6.\n\nSince the set of common divisors of x and y is the intersection of the sets of divisors of x and y, we can see that the set of all common divisors of two integers is the set {-6, -2, -1, 1, 2, 6}.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. {-6, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 6}.",
