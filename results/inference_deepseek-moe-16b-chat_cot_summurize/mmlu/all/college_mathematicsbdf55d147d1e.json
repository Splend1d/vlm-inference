A function is said to be analytic if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. Now, let's consider the function f(z) that maps the entire finite complex plane into the real axis. This means that f(z) is a real-valued function that is differentiable at every point in the complex plane.\n\nSince f(z) is analytic, it is also continuous everywhere in the complex plane. This means that f(z) can be extended to a continuous function on the entire complex plane. Now, let's consider the imaginary axis. The imaginary axis is a vertical line in the complex plane, and it is a closed set (i.e., it includes its endpoints).\n\nSince f(z) is continuous on the entire complex plane, it must also be continuous on the imaginary axis. This means that f(z) can be extended to a continuous function on the imaginary axis. However, this extension must be a real-valued function, since f(z) is a real-valued function.\n\nTherefore, the imaginary axis must be mapped onto the entire real axis by the function f(z). This is because the imaginary axis is a closed set, and the function f(z) is continuous on the entire complex plane.",
