In this case, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions, so it is consistent.\n\nB. The system has infinitely many solutions.\nThis statement is also true. Since the system is consistent, it has infinitely many solutions.\n\nC. The sum of any two solutions is a solution.\nThis statement is true. If two solutions are (w1, x1, y1, z1) and (w2, x2, y2, z2), then the sum of their solutions is (w1 + w2, x1 + x2, y1 + y2, z1 + z2). This is also a solution to the system of linear equations.\n\nD. Every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\nThis statement is FALSE. While it is true that any solution to the system of linear equations can be written as a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0), it is not true that every solution is a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0). For example, the solution (1, 2, 3, 4) is not a scalar multiple of (-5, 1, 1, 0).\n\nTherefore, the FALSE statement is D.",
