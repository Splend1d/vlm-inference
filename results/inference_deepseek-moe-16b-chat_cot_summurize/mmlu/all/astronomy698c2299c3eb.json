This is because the Moon's orbit is nearly circular, and its orbital velocity is slightly slower than its rotational velocity. As a result, the Moon takes slightly longer to rotate on its axis than it does to orbit the Earth, so we always see the same side of the Moon. The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nB. The Moon does rotate, but not at a rate that would cause us to see a different face each time we observe it.\n\nC. The Moon's other face does not point toward us only at new moon. The Moon's orbit is tilted about 1.5 degrees with respect to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so we can see the Moon's far side during a full moon.\n\nD. The Moon's rotational and orbital periods are not equal. The Moon's sidereal rotation period (the time it takes to complete a full rotation on its axis) is about 27.3 days, while its synodic rotation period (the time it takes to complete a full orbit around the Earth) is about 29.5 days.",
