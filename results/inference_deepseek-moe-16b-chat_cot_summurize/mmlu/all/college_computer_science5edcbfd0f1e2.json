            "content": "A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is\n\nA. 0.8 microseconds\nB. 1.2 microseconds\nC. 1.6 microseconds\nD. 2.4 microseconds\n",

This means that the time for one digitization should not exceed the time for one average calculation and output.\n\nLet's assume the maximum average instruction execution time is x microseconds.\n\nAccording to the given information, the maximum average instruction execution time should be less than or equal to the time for one digitization plus the time for one average calculation and output:\n\nx \u2264 12 + 120\n\nx \u2264 132\n\nTherefore, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is 132 microseconds.\n\nHowever, none of the given options match this answer.
