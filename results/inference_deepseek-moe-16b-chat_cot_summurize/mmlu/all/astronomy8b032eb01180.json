The total energy released in the impact is the sum of the initial kinetic energy and the final gravitational potential energy.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the comet is given by m*v^2/2, where v is the minimum impact speed. The final gravitational potential energy of the comet is given by m*GM/R, where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the earth.\n\nTherefore, the total energy released in the impact is 0.5*m*v^2/2 + m*GM/R.\n\nHowever, the expression for the total energy released in the impact is not given in the options. Therefore, we cannot determine which option is correct.",
