This means that statement I must be true for a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law.\n\nStatement II is not necessarily true. Raoult's law only describes the partial pressures of the components, not their volumes. Therefore, the volume of the mixture is not necessarily equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing.\n\nStatement III is also not necessarily true. Intermolecular interactions can vary between different components and mixtures, so the interactions in the mixture may not be identical to the interactions in the pure components.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.
