It is a recognized cause of hypertension.\n\nAddison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is a disorder of the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys. The adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone, which help the body respond to stress and regulate various bodily functions.\n\nAddison's disease is caused by a deficiency of these hormones, which can be due to damage to the adrenal glands or a lack of communication between the brain and the adrenal glands. This deficiency can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, darkening of the skin, and high blood pressure.\n\nWhile it is true that diabetes can be a complication of Addison's disease, it is not a cause of the disease itself. Additionally, the other options listed are not true about Addison's disease.",
