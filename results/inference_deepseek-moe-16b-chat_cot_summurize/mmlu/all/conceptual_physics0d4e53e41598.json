During a lunar eclipse, the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon. This can only happen at night, when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon.\n\nA solar eclipse, on the other hand, occurs when the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, casting its shadow on the Earth. This can happen during the day, when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun.\n\nSo, the correct answer is C. solar eclipse if it\u2019s daytime and lunar eclipse if it\u2019s nighttime.",
