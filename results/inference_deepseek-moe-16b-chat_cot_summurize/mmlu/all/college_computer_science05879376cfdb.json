However, definitions of such a structure often contain declarations of components of the structure (e.g., the header file for a C++ class may contain declarations of its private components). For such a language, an object's name could be bound at run time to stack storage for its component values (direct representation) or to a stack pointer referencing heap storage for its component values (indirect representation). Which of the following statements about comparisons between direct and indirect representations is (are) true?\nI. Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nII. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\nIII. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\n\nA. I only\nB.

Indirect representation noticeably increases compilation time.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The compilation time depends on the specific compiler and the code being compiled, not on the representation of the object's components.\n\nII. Direct representation decreases the time needed to access components of a variable.\nThis statement is true. In direct representation, the components of an object are stored directly in memory, which allows for faster access compared to indirect representation.\n\nIII. When the storage size of some private component of a variable changes, indirect representation minimizes the number of recompilations of source modules that must be performed.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. The need for recompilation depends on the specific language and its rules for handling changes to object representations. In some languages, recompilation may still be necessary even with indirect representation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. II and III only.",
