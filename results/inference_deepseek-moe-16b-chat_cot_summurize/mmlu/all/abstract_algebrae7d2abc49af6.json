Therefore, it must be irreducible over Z_7 as well.\n\nWe can use the fact that if a polynomial is irreducible over Z, then it is irreducible over any finite field. So, we can check if the polynomial is irreducible over Z_7 by trying to find its roots.\n\nBy trying out the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Z_7, we find that the polynomial has no roots in Z_7. Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Z_7, and its factorization in Z_7[x] is:\n\n(x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 2)",
