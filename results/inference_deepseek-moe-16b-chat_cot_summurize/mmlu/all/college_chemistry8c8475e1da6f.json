Sulfuric acid.\n\nSulfuric acid is a primary standard for use in standardizing bases because it is a strong acid and can completely neutralize a weak base. When sulfuric acid is added to a weak base, the base reacts with the acid to form a salt and water. The amount of acid used can be measured accurately, and the resulting solution can be standardized by adding more base until the reaction is complete.\n\nA. Ammonium hydroxide is not a primary standard because it is a weak acid and cannot completely neutralize a strong base.\nC. Acetic acid is not a primary standard because it is a weak acid and cannot completely neutralize a strong base.\nD. Potassium hydrogen phthalate is not a primary standard because it is not an acid or a base.",
