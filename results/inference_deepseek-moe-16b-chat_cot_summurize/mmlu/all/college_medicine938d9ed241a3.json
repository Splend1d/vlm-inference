Engineers assigned to the project have determined that, in order to jump the buses, the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h. If the distance of the track is 50m, at what rate must the car accelerate to reach this velocity?\n\nA. 13 m/s^2\nB. 26 m/s^2\nC. 7 m/s^2\nD. 17 m/s^2\n",

We can rearrange the equation to solve for a:\n\na = (32.22 - 0) / t\n\na = 32.22 / t\n\nWe know that the distance (d) is equal to the initial velocity (u) multiplied by the time (t):\n\nd = u * t\n\nSince the car is initially at rest, the initial velocity (u) is 0. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nd = 0 * t\n\nd = 0\n\nSince the distance is 0, the car will never reach the buses, and the problem is not possible. Therefore, there is no acceleration (a) that can be applied to the car to reach the desired velocity of 130 km/h.",
