This results in a split or cleft in the roof of the mouth (palate) and can also affect the nose and other facial structures. The exact cause of complete bilateral cleft palate is not fully understood, but it is thought to be a multifactorial trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Treatment for this condition typically involves a combination of surgical and orthodontic interventions to repair the cleft and restore normal function to the mouth and nose.",
