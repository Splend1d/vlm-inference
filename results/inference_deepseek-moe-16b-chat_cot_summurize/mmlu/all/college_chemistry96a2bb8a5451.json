The pulse duration is given as 1 \u03bcs, and the magnetic field strength is not provided in the options.\n\nHowever, we can use the formula for the strength of a 90\u00b0 pulse:\n\nB = (1 / 2\u03c0f) * (1 / 2)\n\nwhere B is the strength of the pulse, f is the frequency of the pulse, and 1/2\u03c0f represents the time it takes for the magnetic field to change from its maximum value to its minimum value.\n\nSince the pulse duration is 1 \u03bcs, we can calculate the frequency as follows:\n\nf = 1 / (2\u03c0 * 1 * 10^-6)\nf = 15.625 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the strength of the pulse:\n\nB = (1 / 2\u03c0 * 15.625 * 10^-6) * (1 / 2)\nB = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
