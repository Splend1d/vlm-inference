Copper wire is made up of many individual copper atoms, and each copper atom has one or more electrons. These electrons are part of the structure of the copper atom and are responsible for its ability to conduct electricity.\n\nWhen you buy copper wire, the electrons are already present in the wire and are ready to be used to carry electrical current. However, it is important to note that the electrons are not free to move around on their own. They are bound to the copper atoms by a strong force called the electron cloud.\n\nWhen you connect a wire to a power source, such as a battery, the electrons in the wire are excited by the power source and begin to move. This movement of electrons is what allows electricity to flow through the wire and power whatever device it is connected to.\n\nSo, when you buy copper wire, the electrons are included in the wire and are ready to be used to carry electrical current. However, it is important to note that the electrons are not free to move around on their own and require a power source to excite them and make them move.",
