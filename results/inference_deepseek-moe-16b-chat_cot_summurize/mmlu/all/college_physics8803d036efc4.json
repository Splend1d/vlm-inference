            "content": " The photoelectric effect is a phenomenon where electrons are emitted from a material's surface when it is illuminated by light. According to Einstein's theory of the photoelectric effect, the work function of the metal (the minimum amount of energy needed to remove an electron from the metal's surface) is directly proportional to the frequency of the light shining on the metal. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",
