If aH is a subgroup of G, then it must satisfy the three properties of a subgroup: closure, identity, and inverse.\n\n2. If a is in H, then aH is a subset of H. Since H is a subgroup of G, aH is also a subset of G.\n\n3. If aH is a subset of G, then it must satisfy the three properties of a subgroup: closure, identity, and inverse.\n\n4. Therefore, if aH is a subgroup of G, then a must be in H.\n\n5. Conversely, if a is in H, then aH is a subset of H. Since H is a subgroup of G, aH is also a subset of G.\n\n6. Therefore, if a is in H, then aH is a subgroup of G.\n\nSo, Statement 1 is true.\n\nStatement 2: If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G then aH = bH if and only if ab is in H.\n\nProof:\n\n1. If aH = bH, then aH and bH have the same elements.\n\n2. If ab is in H, then ab is in aH and bH.\n\n3. Therefore, if aH = bH, then ab is in H.\n\n4. Conversely, if ab is in H, then ab is in aH and bH.\n\n5. Therefore, if ab is in H, then aH = bH.\n\nSo, Statement 2 is also true.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true, so the correct answer is A.
