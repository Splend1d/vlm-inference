Hepatomegaly is the medical term for an enlarged liver.\n\nB. The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium: This statement is not entirely accurate. The liver is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, not the left hypochondrium. The liver may enlarge downwards and to the right, but this is not a definitive characteristic of hepatomegaly.\n\nC. The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause: This statement is not entirely accurate. While alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and enlargement, it is not the only cause of hepatomegaly. Other causes include viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.\n\nD. The liver is usually resonant to percussion: This statement is not entirely accurate. The liver is not usually resonant to percussion, as it is a soft, spongy organ. However, if the liver is enlarged, it may be less sensitive to percussion.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. Emphysema is a cause. Emphysema is a chronic lung disease that can cause respiratory failure and can lead to liver enlargement due to decreased oxygenation of the blood.",
