A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst.\n\nThe other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA. A pulsatile mass is not always due to an aortic aneurysm. A pulsatile mass can be caused by a variety of conditions, including an aortic aneurysm, but it can also be caused by other conditions such as a varicocele or an aortic dissection.\n\nB. An enlarged kidney is not always dull to percussion. A normal kidney is not palpable on palpation, and an enlarged kidney may be palpable but not necessarily dull to percussion.\n\nD. An indentible mass is not caused by faecal loading of the colon. An indentible mass is usually caused by a tumor, and faecal loading of the colon would not cause an indentible mass.",
