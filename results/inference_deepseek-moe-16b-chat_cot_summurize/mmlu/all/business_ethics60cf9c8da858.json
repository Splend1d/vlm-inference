He argued that the only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, as long as it stays within the boundaries of the law. He believed that businesses should focus on their core business functions and not engage in social or political activities that could divert their attention from their primary goal of maximizing profits. This view has been widely criticized by many scholars and business leaders who believe that businesses have a responsibility to consider the interests of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the community.",
