This is because the prism is made of glass or crystal that selectively absorbs and reflects certain wavelengths of light. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than green light, so it is more strongly refracted (bent) by the prism. The other options are not correct because they refer to colors that are closer to green in the visible spectrum.",
