            "content": " The conditions necessary for a terrestrial planet to have a strong magnetic field are both a molten metallic core and reasonably fast rotation.\n\nA terrestrial planet is a planet that is composed mainly of rock and metal, as opposed to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, which are composed mainly of gas. The presence of a strong magnetic field is crucial for the survival of life on a planet, as it protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and helps to create a stable environment for liquid water to exist.\n\nA strong magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect, which occurs when a planet's core is in motion. The motion of the core can be caused by either a fast rotation or a molten metallic core, but not by just one of these conditions alone.\n\nA fast rotation can generate a magnetic field, but it is not enough to sustain it. The magnetic field generated by a fast rotation will decay over time, as the planet's core cools and solidifies.\n\nA molten metallic core is also necessary for a strong magnetic field. The molten metal in the core can conduct electricity, which is necessary for the dynamo effect to occur. The dynamo effect generates a magnetic field by moving the molten metal in the core back and forth.\n\nTherefore, a terrestrial planet needs both a fast rotation and a molten metallic core to have a strong magnetic field. Option D is the correct answer.",
