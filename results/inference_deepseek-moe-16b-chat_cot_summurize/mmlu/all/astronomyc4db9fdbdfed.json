This is because radioactive dating is a method of determining the age of an object by measuring the amount of a given radioactive material it contains. By comparing the amount of a radioactive material in a sample to the amount of its decay product, scientists can determine the age of the sample.\n\nOption A is not a good evidence because the composition of rocks does not necessarily indicate their age.\nOption B is also not a good evidence because the composition of rocks does not necessarily indicate their age.\nOption C is not a good evidence because the erosion of a surface does not necessarily indicate the age of the rocks on that surface.\nOption D is not a good evidence because the number of impact craters on a surface does not necessarily indicate the age of the rocks on that surface.",
