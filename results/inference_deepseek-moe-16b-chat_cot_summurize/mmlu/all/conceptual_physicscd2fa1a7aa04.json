            "content": " When an increase in speed doubles the kinetic energy of a moving body, its momentum increases by a factor of 2. This is because the kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to its speed squared, and inversely proportional to its mass. When the speed doubles, the kinetic energy increases by a factor of 2, and since momentum is the product of an object's mass and its velocity, the momentum also increases by a factor of 2. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
