Once a process has been granted a resource, the process has exclusive use of that resource until it is released. If a process requests a resource that is already in use, the process enters a queue for that resource, waiting until the resource is available. Which of the following will NOT deal effectively with the problem of deadlock?\n\nA. Giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority\nB. Having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all\nC. Numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number\nD. Having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting\n",

            "content": " The problem of deadlock occurs when two or more processes are each waiting for a resource that the other processes have locked. This can result in a situation where no process can make progress, as each process is waiting for a resource that the other processes have locked.\n\nOption A, giving priorities to processes and ordering the wait queues by priority, can help to prevent deadlock by ensuring that high-priority processes are granted resources before low-priority processes. This can prevent low-priority processes from blocking high-priority processes.\n\nOption B, having a process request all its required resources when it first begins, and restarting if it cannot obtain them all, can also help to prevent deadlock. This is because the process will have all the resources it needs from the start, and will not need to request any additional resources.\n\nOption D, having processes time out and restart after a random interval of waiting, can also help to prevent deadlock. This is because the process will time out and restart after a random interval of waiting, which can prevent the process from waiting indefinitely for a resource.\n\nOption C, numbering the resources and requiring that processes request resources in order of increasing number, can also help to prevent deadlock. This is because the process will request resources in order of increasing number, which can prevent the process from requesting a resource that is already locked by another process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
