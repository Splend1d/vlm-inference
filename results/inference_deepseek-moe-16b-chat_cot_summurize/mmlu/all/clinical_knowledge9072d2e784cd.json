This is because clubbing is characterized by a convex curvature of the nail-bed, which can only be accurately assessed from this angle. Inspecting the nail-bed angle from above or below may not provide a clear picture of the degree of curvature. Assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed is not a reliable method, as it is not specific to clubbing. Schamroth's sign is a clinical sign of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not specific to clubbing.",
