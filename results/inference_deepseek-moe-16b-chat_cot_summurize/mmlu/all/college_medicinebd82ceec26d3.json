            "content": " To answer this question, let's analyze each statement in relation to the given information about a young adult who has suffered from substance abuse throughout adolescence.\n\nI. Pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex.\nThe prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functioning, which includes decision-making, planning, and problem-solving. If the patient has suffered from substance abuse throughout adolescence, it is likely that they have experienced some damage to the prefrontal cortex, leading to diminished executive functioning.\n\nII. Increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations.\nAuditory hallucinations are a symptom of various mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia. While substance abuse can contribute to the development of these symptoms, it is not necessarily true that all individuals who have suffered from substance abuse will experience increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations.\n\nIII. Reduced behavioral impulse control.\nImpulse control refers to the ability to resist immediate gratification in favor of long-term goals. Substance abuse can impair impulse control, as the individual may act on immediate desires rather than considering the consequences. This is likely true for the patient.\n\nBased on the analysis, statements I and III are likely true of the patient. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. I and III only",
