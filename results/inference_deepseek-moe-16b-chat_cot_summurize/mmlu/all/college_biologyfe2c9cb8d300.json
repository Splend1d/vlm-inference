Capacity for long-distance dispersal\n\nThe capacity for long-distance dispersal is the most important biological attribute that allows a species to become cosmopolitan in distribution. This means that the species can spread over a large area and can survive in a wide range of environments.\n\nOption A, extreme habitat specialization, is not necessarily a trait that would allow a species to become cosmopolitan. In fact, it is often the opposite, as species that are highly specialized to a specific habitat are more likely to be restricted to that habitat.\n\nOption B, K-selected reproductive rate, refers to a reproductive strategy where a species has a low reproductive rate and invests more time and energy into each offspring. This strategy is more likely to result in a stable population, rather than a cosmopolitan one.\n\nOption C, limited dispersal abilities, is the opposite of what is needed for a species to become cosmopolitan. A species with limited dispersal abilities would be restricted to a small area and would not be able to spread over a large area.",
