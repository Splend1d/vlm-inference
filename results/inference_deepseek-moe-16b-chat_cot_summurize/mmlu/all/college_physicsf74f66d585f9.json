            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the total energy radiated per second per unit area by a blackbody is directly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\nE = \u03c3T^4\n\nwhere E is the energy radiated per second per unit area, \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 x 10^-8 W/m^2 K^4), T is the absolute temperature, and the subscript \"total\" indicates that this is the total energy radiated by the blackbody, not just the energy per unit area.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the absolute temperature of the blackbody is increased by a factor of 3. The new temperature will be 3T. We can now use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the new energy radiated per second per unit area:\n\nE' = \u03c3(3T)^4 = 5.67 x 10^-8 x (9T^4) = 4.902 x 10^-8 x T^4\n\nSince the energy radiated per second per unit area is directly proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature, we can see that the new energy radiated per second per unit area is 9 times smaller than the original energy. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. Decreases by a factor of 9.",
