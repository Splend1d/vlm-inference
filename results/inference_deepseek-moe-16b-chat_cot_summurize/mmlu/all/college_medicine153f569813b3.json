It is calculated by dividing the amount of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) by the amount of Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and Inorganic Phosphate (Pi) that is bound to it. The higher the energy charge, the more energy is available for the cell to use.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because:\n\nA. The energy charge is not simply the difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell. It is a measure of the energy available for the cell to use, not the difference between the charges.\n\nB. The sodium-potassium ATPase is responsible for generating ATP, but it does not generate the energy charge of the cell.\n\nD. The total adenine nucleotide pool is not directly related to the energy charge of the cell. The energy charge is calculated by dividing the amount of ATP by the amount of ADP and Pi bound to it, not the total adenine nucleotide pool.",
