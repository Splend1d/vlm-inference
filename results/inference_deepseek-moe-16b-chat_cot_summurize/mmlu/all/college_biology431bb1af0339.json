It secretes a fluid called liquor amnii, which helps to cushion and protect the developing embryo from injury and dehydration. The amnion is another protective membrane that surrounds the embryo and secretes the liquor amnii, while the allantois is a structure that helps to regulate the balance of fluids in the body and the yolk sac provides nutrients to the developing embryo.",
