            "content": " The magnetic moment of an electron is given by the formula:\n\n\u03bc = g * (g - 1) * (\u0127 / 2)\n\nwhere g is the Land\u00e9 g-factor, \u0127 is the reduced Planck constant, and \u03bc is the magnetic moment.\n\nFor a 205Tl nucleus, the g-factor is approximately 1.91. The nuclear magneton is given by:\n\n\u03bc_N = (e * hbar) / (2 * m_e)\n\nwhere e is the elementary charge, hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and m_e is the mass of the electron. For a 205Tl nucleus, the nuclear magneton is approximately 5.05 x 10^-27 J T^-1.\n\nThe magnetic moment of a nucleus is given by the formula:\n\n\u03bc_N = \u03bc_p + \u03bc_n\n\nwhere \u03bc_p is the magnetic moment of the protons and \u03bc_n is the magnetic moment of the neutrons. For a 205Tl nucleus, the number of protons and neutrons is approximately 80 and 127, respectively.\n\nThe magnetic moment of the protons is approximately 0.845 x 10^-26 J T^-1, and the magnetic moment of the neutrons is approximately 1.91 x 10^-26 J T^-1.\n\nTherefore, the magnetic moment of 205Tl is:\n\n\u03bc = \u03bc_N + \u03bc_p + \u03bc_n\n\u03bc = (5.05 x 10^-27 J T^-1) + (0.845 x 10^-26 J T^-1) + (1.91 x 10^-26 J T^-1)\n\u03bc = 2.601 x 10^-26 J T^-1\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. 0.717 x 10^-26 J T-1",
