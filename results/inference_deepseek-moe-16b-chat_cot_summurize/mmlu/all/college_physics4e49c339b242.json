            "content": " To solve this problem, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\na = F / m\n\nwhere a is the acceleration, F is the net force, and m is the mass of the object.\n\nGiven that the acceleration of object B is twice that of object A, we can write:\n\na_B = 2a_A\n\nNow, we know that the mass of object B is twice that of object A. Let's denote the mass of object A as m_A and the mass of object B as m_B. Then, we can write:\n\nm_B = 2m_A\n\nNow, we can use the formula for acceleration to find the net force acting on object B:\n\na_B = F_B / m_B\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\n2a_A = F_B / (2m_A)\n\nNow, we can solve for F_B:\n\nF_B = 2 * 2a_A * m_A\nF_B = 4a_A * m_A\n\nNow, let's compare this expression for F_B with the options given:\n\nA. F_B = 1/4 F_A\nB. F_B = 1/2 F_A\nC. F_B = 2F_A\nD. F_B = 4F_A\n\nNone of these options match the expression we found for F_B. However, if we assume that the net force acting on object A is F_A, then we can rewrite the expression for F_B as:\n\nF_B = 4F_A\n\nThis is option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. F_B = 2F_A",
