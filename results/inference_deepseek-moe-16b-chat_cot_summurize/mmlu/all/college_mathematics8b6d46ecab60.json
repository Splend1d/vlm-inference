A compact set can have non-bounded continuous functions. For example, consider the interval [0, 1] with the usual topology. It is compact, but there are continuous functions on it that are not bounded, such as the function f(x) = 1/x for x \u2260 0 and f(0) = 0.\n\nII. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact.\nThis statement is true. A compact set is a set with the property that every open cover has a finite subcover. If every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then it is bounded on every open cover of K, and thus K can be covered by finitely many bounded sets, which implies that K is compact.\n\nIII. If K is compact, then K is connected.\nThis statement is not necessarily true. A compact set can be the union of two non-empty, disjoint, open sets, which implies that it is not connected. For example, consider the interval [0, 1] with the usual topology. It is compact, but it can be written as the union of two disjoint open sets, namely (0, 1/2) and (1/2, 1), which shows that it is not connected.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. II only.",
