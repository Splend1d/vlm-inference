If a and b are in the set, then their sum (a + b) and their product (ab) must also be in the set.\n3. If a is in the set, then its inverse (a^{-1}) must also be in the set.\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nI. {u + v : u \\in U and v \\in V}\nThis set is not an ideal because it does not satisfy condition 3. For example, if u = 1 and v = -1, then u + v = 0, but there is no inverse of 0 in R.\n\nII. {uv : u \\in U and v \\in V}\nThis set is not an ideal because it does not satisfy condition 2. For example, if u = 1 and v = -1, then uv = -1, but there is no element in U and V that can be multiplied to get -1.\n\nIII. {x : x \\in U and x \\in V}\nThis set is not an ideal because it does not satisfy condition 1. For example, if x = 1, then x \\in U and x \\in V, but there is no element in U and V that can be added to get 1.\n\nTherefore, none of the given sets are ideals of R.\nThe answer is D.",
