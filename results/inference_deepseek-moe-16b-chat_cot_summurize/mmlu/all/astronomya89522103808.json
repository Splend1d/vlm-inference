This is the crater believed to be responsible for the mass extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago. The impact from the asteroid or comet is thought to have caused a massive explosion, leading to the release of a huge amount of energy, which in turn led to the extinction of many species, including the dinosaurs.",
