If A and C are connected, then B is connected.\n\nConnectedness is a topological property, and it is not affected by the inclusion of other sets. Therefore, if A and C are connected, it does not necessarily mean that B is connected. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nII. If A and C are compact, then B is compact.\n\nCompactness is also a topological property, and it is not affected by the inclusion of other sets. Therefore, if A and C are compact, it does not necessarily mean that B is compact. So, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nIII. If A and C are Hausdorff, then B is Hausdorff.\n\nHausdorffness is a topological property, and it is not affected by the inclusion of other sets. Therefore, if A and C are Hausdorff, it means that B is Hausdorff. So, this statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.",
