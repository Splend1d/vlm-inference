This process is known as triboelectric charging. As a result, the charge of your hair becomes a combination of positive and negative charges. The positive charges are attracted to the negative charges on the charged object, while the negative charges are attracted to the positive charges on the charged object. This creates an imbalance in the charge of your hair, making it a charged object itself.",
