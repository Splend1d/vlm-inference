Look for chest movements, listen for breath sounds, and feel for exhaled air on your cheek.\n\nAssessing a patient's breathing is an important part of a healthcare professional's assessment. When assessing a patient's breathing, it is important to look for chest movements, listen for breath sounds, and feel for exhaled air on your cheek. This will give you a good idea of the patient's respiratory status.\n\nA. always remove dentures. This is not necessary, as dentures do not affect a patient's breathing.\n\nB. look for chest movements and use a mirror to check for exhaled air. This is not necessary, as looking for chest movements and using a mirror to check for exhaled air can be time-consuming and may not provide accurate information.\n\nD. assess for 30 seconds. This is not necessary, as assessing a patient's breathing should be done continuously throughout the assessment.",
