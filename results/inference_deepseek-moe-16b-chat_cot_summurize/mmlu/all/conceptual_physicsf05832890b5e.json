This is because the wave is able to travel further in the deeper water before it encounters the next disturbance, so the wavelength increases. Additionally, the wave is able to travel faster in deeper water, so the speed increases. The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the changes that occur when a wave moves from shallow to deep water.",
