Signal averaging: This involves taking multiple measurements of the same quantity and averaging them together. This can help to reduce random errors because it reduces the standard deviation of the mean.\n\nII. Use of internal standards: This involves using a known, stable, and accurately measured quantity as a reference for comparison. This can help to reduce random errors because it provides a known and stable value to compare against.\n\nIII. Averaging the results from multiple samples: This involves taking multiple measurements of the same quantity and averaging them together. This can help to reduce random errors because it reduces the standard deviation of the mean.\n\nSo, all three procedures can help to minimize the influence of random errors on measured results. Therefore, the answer is D. I and III only.",
