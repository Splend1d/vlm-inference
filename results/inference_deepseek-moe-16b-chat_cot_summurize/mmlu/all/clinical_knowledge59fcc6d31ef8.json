When taken as a supplement, creatine is converted into creatine phosphate, which is used to produce energy for muscle contractions. This process can lead to an increase in muscle mass and strength, as well as improved athletic performance. However, it is important to note that creatine supplementation is not a magic bullet and should be used in conjunction with a proper training and nutrition program. Additionally, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen.",
