            "content": " The EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical (CH3)3C\u2022 is a set of lines that correspond to the transitions between the different energy levels of the unpaired electron in the molecule. The intensity of each line is proportional to the square of the number of molecules in the transition.\n\nThe t-Bu radical has a total of 10 unpaired electrons, so the number of possible transitions is 10 choose 2 = 45. However, not all of these transitions will be observed in the EPR spectrum, as some will be forbidden by the selection rules.\n\nThe selection rules for the t-Bu radical are \u0394m_s = \u00b11, where \u0394m_s is the change in the projection of the electron spin along an axis perpendicular to the magnetic field. This means that the transitions between the energy levels with \u0394m_s = \u00b11 will be observed, while transitions with \u0394m_s = 0 will not be observed.\n\nThe number of transitions with \u0394m_s = \u00b11 is 10, so the total number of observed lines in the EPR spectrum is 10 choose 2 = 45. However, we need to divide by 2 to account for the fact that the transitions are symmetric with respect to the magnetic field, so the intensity of each line is divided by 2.\n\nTherefore, the intensity of each line in the EPR spectrum of the t-Bu radical is 1/20 = 1/45. The ratio of the intensities of the lines in the EPR spectrum is therefore 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 1:9:36:84:126:126:84:36:9:1.",
