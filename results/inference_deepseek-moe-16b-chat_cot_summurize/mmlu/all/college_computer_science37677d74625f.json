A Turing machine can be designed to count the number of steps taken during its computation. If the number of steps exceeds n, the computation is considered to last for at least n steps.\n\nProblem II: The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step.\n\nThis problem is undecidable. The reason is that the halting problem is undecidable, which means that there is no general method to determine whether a given Turing machine will halt or not. In this case, we are asked to determine whether a Turing machine with an infinite tape will print a 1 after at least n steps. This is equivalent to the halting problem, which is undecidable.\n\nProblem III: M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C.\n\nThis problem is decidable. A Turing machine can be designed to count the number of distinct tape squares scanned during its computation. If the number of distinct tape squares scanned is at least n, the computation is considered to scan at least n distinct tape squares.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D. I and III only.",
