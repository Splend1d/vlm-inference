            "content": " The correct answer is C. red, oxidative, fast contracting. Type I muscle fibres are also known as slow-twitch, red, or oxidative muscle fibres. They are responsible for activities that require sustained effort over a long period of time, such as long-distance running or swimming. These muscle fibres have a high number of mitochondria, which allows them to produce energy through aerobic respiration. This process is slower than anaerobic respiration, but it is more efficient and can sustain activity for a longer period of time.\n\nType II muscle fibres, on the other hand, are white, glycolytic, and fast contracting. These muscle fibres are responsible for activities that require short bursts of intense effort, such as sprinting or weightlifting. They have a lower number of mitochondria and rely on anaerobic respiration to produce energy quickly.",
