            "content": " The correct answer is A. Sensory loss is demonstrated in a stocking distribution.\n\nPeripheral neuropathy is a condition characterized by damage to the peripheral nerves, which can result in a variety of symptoms, including sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction. One of the key features of peripheral neuropathy is a loss of sensation in the affected limbs, which is often described as a \"stocking and glove\" distribution. This means that the loss of sensation typically begins in the toes and progresses upward, affecting the feet and lower legs before eventually involving the hands and upper arms.\n\nOption B, \"the tone is increased bilaterally in the legs,\" is not a specific feature of peripheral neuropathy and is not a reliable indicator of the condition.\n\nOption C, \"reflexes are very brisk with reinforcement,\" is also not a specific feature of peripheral neuropathy and is not a reliable indicator of the condition.\n\nOption D, \"weakness is more marked proximally than distally,\" is not a specific feature of peripheral neuropathy and is not a reliable indicator of the condition.",
